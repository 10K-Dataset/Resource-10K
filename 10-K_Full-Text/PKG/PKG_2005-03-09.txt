BUSINESS

General

Packaging Corporation of
America, or PCA, is the sixth largest producer of containerboard and corrugated
products in the United States, based on production capacity as reported in the
Pulp & Paper 2003-2004 Global Fact and Price
Book. With 2004 net sales of $1.9 billion, PCA produced about
2.3 million tons of containerboard, of which about 80% of the tons
produced was consumed in our corrugated products manufacturing plants, 13% was
sold to domestic customers and 7% was sold to the export market. Our corrugated
products manufacturing plants sold about 29.9 billion square feet (BSF) of
corrugated products.

Containerboard
Production and Corrugated Shipments

The 2.3 million tons of containerboard that we produced
in 2004 included 1.4 million tons of kraft linerboard produced at our
mills located in Counce, Tennessee and Valdosta, Georgia and 0.9 million
tons of semi-chemical corrugating medium produced at our mills located in
Tomahawk, Wisconsin and Filer City, Michigan. We currently lease the cutting
rights to approximately 115,000 acres of timberland located near our Counce and
Valdosta mills. We also have supply agreements on about 600,000 of the 800,000
acres of timberland we sold during 1999 and 2000.

Our converting operations
produce a wide variety of corrugated packaging products, including conventional
shipping containers used to protect and transport manufactured goods,
multi-color boxes and displays with strong visual appeal that help to
merchandise the packaged product in retail locations. In addition, we are a
large producer of meat boxes and wax-coated boxes for the agricultural
industry.

Corporate Developments

On April 12, 1999, Pactiv Corporation, formerly
known as Tenneco Packaging Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of
Tenneco Inc., sold its containerboard and corrugated products business to
PCA, an entity formed by Madison Dearborn Partners, LLC, a private equity
investment firm, in January 1999. The business was sold for
$2.2 billion, consisting of $246.5 million in cash and the assumption
of $1,760.0 million of debt incurred by Pactiv immediately prior to the
contribution. Pactiv retained a 45% common equity interest, or 193,500 shares,
in PCA valued at $193.5 million. PCA Holdings LLC, an entity organized and
controlled by Madison Dearborn, acquired the remaining 55% common equity
interest, or 236,500 shares, in PCA for $236.5 million in cash, which was
used to finance in part the transactions.

The share amounts
discussed above are prior to a 220-for-1 stock split which occurred in October 1999.
Including the effect of the 220-for-1 split, Pactiv received 42,570,000 shares
and PCA Holdings, LLC received 52,030,000 shares.


The financing of the
transactions consisted of (1) borrowings under a new $1,469.0 million
senior credit facility for which J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and BT Alex.
Brown Incorporated (the predecessor to Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown) were co-lead
arrangers, (2) the offering of $550.0 million of



¤


% senior subordinated notes due
2009, and $100.0 million of 12


¤


%
senior exchangeable preferred stock due 2010, (3) a cash equity investment
of $236.5 million by PCA Holdings LLC and (4) an equity investment by
Pactiv valued at $193.5 million. As required by their terms, the
$550.0 million of senior subordinated notes and $100.0 million of
senior exchangeable preferred stock issued in the April 12, 1999
transactions were exchanged for publicly registered securities in the same
amounts in a registered exchange offer completed in October 1999.

The senior credit facility was entered into to finance
in part the transactions and to pay related fees and expenses and to provide
future borrowings to PCA for general corporate purposes, including working
capital. The senior credit facility initially consisted of three term loan
facilities in an original aggregate principal amount of $1,219.0 million
and a revolving credit facility with up to $250.0 million in availability.
Effective December 14, 1999, PCA elected to reduce its availability under
the revolving credit facility from $250.0 million to $150.0 million.

On January 28, 2000, PCA became a publicly traded
company with the initial public offering of its common stock. In the offering,
Pactiv sold 35,000,000 shares and PCA sold 11,250,000 new shares of common
stock, both at an offering price of $12.00 per share. PCA used its net proceeds
to redeem all of the outstanding senior exchangeable preferred stock on March 3,
2000.

PCA completed the refinancing of its
$735.0 million senior secured debt and $150.0 million senior secured
revolving credit facility on June 29, 2000. Completion of the refinancing
eliminated a $226.5 million term loan, and reduced PCA’s average effective
interest rate on its senior secured term debt by approximately 100 basis points.

On November 29, 2000, PCA established an
on-balance sheet securitization program for its trade accounts receivable. To
effectuate this program, PCA formed a wholly-owned limited purpose subsidiary,
Packaging Credit Company, LLC, or PCC, which in turn formed a wholly-owned,
bankruptcy-remote, special-purpose subsidiary, Packaging Receivables Company,
LLC, or PRC, for the purpose of acquiring receivables from PCC. Both of these
entities are included in the consolidated financial statements of PCA. Under this
program, PCC purchases on an ongoing basis all of the receivables of PCA and
sells such receivables to PRC. PRC and lenders established a
$150.0 million receivables-backed revolving credit facility through which
PRC obtains funds to purchase receivables from PCC. The receivables purchased
by PRC are and will be solely the property of PRC. In the event of a
liquidation of PRC, the creditors of PRC would be entitled to satisfy their
claims from PRC’s assets prior to any distribution to PCC or PCA. Credit available
under the receivables credit facility is on a borrowing-base formula. As a
result, the full amount of the facility may not be available at all times. On October 13,
2003, PCA renewed the receivables credit facility for an additional three-year
term, expiring on October 10,
2006. As of December 31, 2004, $109.0 million was outstanding and
$41.0 million was available for additional borrowing under the receivables
credit facility. The highest outstanding principal balance under the
receivables credit facility during fiscal 2004 was $109.0 million.

During 2001, Pactiv sold approximately 6,160,240
shares of PCA common stock, which represented its remaining ownership interest.

On July 7, 2003, PCA repaid all borrowings under
its then-existing senior credit facility. This facility was replaced with a senior unsecured credit
facility that provides for a
$100.0 million revolving credit facility, including a $35.0 million subfacility
for letters of credit, and a $50.0
million term loan. The
senior credit facility closed on July 21, 2003, and it expires in 2008.
PCA’s total borrowings under the senior credit facility as of December 31,
2004 consisted of $39.0 million of term loans.


On July 21, 2003, PCA closed its offering and
private placement of $150.0 million of 4


¤


% five-year
notes and $400.0 million of 5


¤


%
ten-year notes. On July 22, 2003, PCA used the net proceeds from the
offering, together with the borrowings under the
senior credit facility and cash on hand, to purchase $546.4 million, or 99.3%,
of its then outstanding


¤


%
senior subordinated notes. As a result of these transactions, PCA recorded a
one-time charge of approximately $76.6 million ($46.7 million after-tax) in the
third quarter of 2003. The $76.6 million charge includes the tender offer
premium of $55.9 million and a $17.4 million non-cash charge for the write-off
of deferred financing fees due to the early extinguishment of debt, which are
included in interest expense, and fees and expenses of $3.3 million, which are
included in corporate overhead. As required by their terms, the
$150.0 million of 4


¤


%
five-year notes and $400.0 million of 5


¤


% ten-year
notes were exchanged for publicly registered securities in the same amounts in
a registered exchange offer completed in December 2003. The remaining
senior subordinated notes were repurchased on
April 1, 2004.

On October 13, 2003, PCA announced its intentions
to begin paying a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share, or $0.60 per
share annually, on its common stock. The first quarterly dividend of $0.15 per
share was paid on January 15, 2004 to shareholders of record as of December 15,
2003.

On February 10, 2004 Packaging Corporation of
Illinois, a wholly owned subsidiary of Packaging Corporation of America,
acquired the assets of Acorn Corrugated Box Company (Acorn) for approximately
$38 million. Acorn, a producer of high quality graphics packaging is located in
Bedford Park, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago, Illinois.

On January 19,
2005 PCA announced an increase on its quarterly dividend to $0.25 per share, or
$1.00 per share annually, on its common stock. The first quarterly cash
dividend of $0.25 per share will be payable to shareholders of record as of March 15,
2005 with a payment date of April 15, 2005.

Corrugated products plants tend to be located in close
proximity to customers to minimize freight costs. The U.S. corrugated products industry
consists of approximately 650 companies and 1,400
plants.

Containerboard, which includes both linerboard and
corrugating medium, is the principal raw material used to manufacture
corrugated products. Linerboard is used as the inner and outer facings, or
liners, of corrugated products. Corrugating medium is fluted and laminated to
linerboard in corrugator plants to produce corrugated sheets. The sheets are
subsequently printed, cut, folded and glued in corrugator plants or sheet
plants to produce corrugated products.

Containerboard may be manufactured from both softwood and
hardwood fibers, as well as from recycled fibers from used corrugated and waste
from converting operations. Kraft linerboard is made predominantly from
softwoods like pine. Semi-chemical corrugating medium is made from hardwoods


such as oak. The finished
paper product is wound into large rolls, which are slit to size as required by
converters and shipped to them.

Linerboard is made in a
range of grades or basis weights. The most commonly used basis weight of
linerboard is 35 lb., although linerboard is produced in weights that vary from
under 26 lb. to over 90 lb. Basis weight represents the weight in pounds per
thousand square feet of linerboard. Producers also market linerboard by
performance characteristics, appearance and color.

PCA Operations and
Products

Our two linerboard mills can manufacture a broad range
of linerboard grades ranging from 26 lb. to 96 lb. Our two semi-chemical
corrugating medium mills can manufacture grades ranging in weight from
21 lb. to 47 lb. All four of our mills have completed an extensive
independent review process to become ISO 9002 certified. ISO 9002 is an
international quality certification that verifies a facility maintains and
follows stringent procedures for manufacturing, sales and customer service.

Counce.

Our Counce, Tennessee mill is
one of the largest linerboard mills in the United States. Its production
capacity is approximately 1,002,000 tons per year. In 2004, we produced 999,000
tons of kraft linerboard on two paper machines at Counce. We produced a broad
range of basis weights from 26 lb. to 90 lb. The mill also produces a
variety of performance and specialty grades of linerboard.

Valdosta.

Our Valdosta, Georgia mill is
a kraft linerboard mill that has a production capacity of approximately 463,000
tons per year. In 2004, our single paper machine at Valdosta produced 457,000
tons of kraft linerboard. Valdosta produces linerboard ranging from 33 lb. to
90 lb.

Tomahawk.

Our Tomahawk, Wisconsin mill
is the second largest corrugating medium mill in the United States with
production capacity of 573,000 tons per year. In 2004, we produced 572,000 tons
of semi-chemical corrugating medium on three paper machines, one of which is
among the largest corrugating medium machines in the world. On  January 20, 2005, we announced that we
will shut down our  number three
paper machine at Tomahawk after resuming
reliable  production on our number one
paper machine at Filer City due to lower incremental fiber and transportation
costs at Filer City. This plan is based on
current market conditions and productivity and could change if market
conditions or productivity levels change going forward. Tomahawk’s production capacity
on the two paper machines remaining in operation is 507,000 tons. Our Tomahawk
mill produces a broad range of basis weights from 23 lb. to 40 lb. and a
variety of performance and specialty grades of corrugating medium.

Filer City.

Our Filer City, Michigan mill
is a semi-chemical corrugating medium mill with a production capacity of
363,000 tons. In 2004, we ran two of the three paper machines at Filer City and
produced 290,000 tons of corrugating medium. On January 25, 2005 we resumed
operation of our number one paper machine at Filer City
and now operate all three paper machines at the mill. Filer City produces
corrugating medium grades ranging in basis weight from 23 lb. to 40 lb.

We operate 66 corrugated
manufacturing operations, a technical and development center, five regional
graphic design centers, a rotogravure printing operation and a complement of
packaging supplies and distribution centers. Of the 66 manufacturing
facilities, 40 operate as combining operations, commonly called corrugated
plants, that manufacture corrugated sheets and finished corrugated containers.
The remaining 26 manufacturing facilities, commonly called sheet plants,
purchase combined sheets primarily produced at PCA’s combining operations and
manufacture finished corrugated containers. The five graphic design centers are
located in Cincinnati, Ohio; Dallas, Texas; Cranbury, New Jersey; Salisbury,
North Carolina and South Gate, California.

Our corrugated
manufacturing operations are spread throughout the United States. Each
corrugator plant serves a market radius that typically averages 150 miles. Our
sheet plants are generally located in


close
proximity to our larger corrugator plants, which enables us to offer additional
services and converting capabilities such as small volume and quick turnaround
items.

We produce a wide variety
of products ranging from basic corrugated shipping containers to specialized
packaging such as wax-coated boxes for the agriculture industry. We also have
multi-color printing capabilities to make high-impact graphics boxes and
displays that offer customers more attractive packaging.

Timberland

We currently lease the
cutting rights to approximately 115,000 acres of timberland located near our
Counce and Valdosta mills. Virtually all of the acres under cutting rights
agreements are located within 100 miles of our mills, which results in lower
wood transportation costs and provides a secure source of wood fiber. Most of
these leased cutting rights agreements have terms with over 15 years
remaining.

During 1999 and 2000, PCA
sold about 800,000 acres of timberland. As part of the timberland sale
agreements, we entered into supply arrangements covering about 600,000 acres of
the total acres sold. We also hold a 31


¤


% equity
ownership interest in approximately 150,000 acres owned by Southern Timber Venture,
LLC.

In addition to the
timberland we manage ourselves, our Forest Management Assistance Program
provides professional forestry assistance to private timberland owners to
improve harvest yields and to optimize their harvest schedule. We have managed
the regeneration of approximately 125,000 acres by supplying pine seedlings. In
exchange for our expertise, we are given the right of first refusal over timber
sales from those lands. These private lands include over 215,000 acres of
timberland. We expect to harvest approximately 75,000 cords of wood from these
forests annually.

PCA also participates in
the Sustainable Forestry Initiative, which is organized by the American Forest
and Paper Association. This initiative is aimed at ensuring the long-term
health and conservation of America’s forestry resources. Activities include
limiting tree harvest sizes, replanting harvest acreage, participating in flora
and fauna research and protecting water streams.

Solid Wood Facilities

On February 2, 2004
we sold our Selmer, Tennessee sawmill. This facility produced and sold 10
million board feet of lumber in 2003 with net sales of $4.5 million.

The two remaining sawmills
that we owned and operated in 2004 are located in Ackerman and Fulton,
Mississippi. During 2004, these two sawmills sold
136 million board feet of lumber used to make furniture and building
products. We also have an air-dry yard operation in Burnsville, Mississippi
that holds newly cut lumber while it dries.

Sales and Marketing

Our corrugated products are sold through a direct
sales and marketing organization. Sales representatives and a sales manager at
each converting operations facility serve local and regional accounts.
Corporate account managers serve large national accounts at multiple customer
locations. Additionally, our graphic design centers maintain an on-site
dedicated graphics sales force. General marketing support is located at our
corporate headquarters.

Our containerboard sales group is responsible for the
sale of linerboard and corrugating medium to our corrugator plants, to other
domestic customers and to the export market. This group handles order
processing for all shipments of containerboard from our mills to our corrugator
plants. These personnel also coordinate and execute all containerboard trade
agreements with other containerboard manufacturers.


In addition to direct
sales and marketing personnel, we utilize support personnel that are new
product development engineers and product graphics and design specialists.
These individuals are located at both the corrugator plants as well as the
graphic design centers.

Distribution

Our corrugated products are usually delivered by truck
due to our large number of customers and their demand for timely service.
Shipping costs represent a relatively high percentage of our total costs due to
the high bulk of corrugated products. As a result, our converting operations
typically service customers within a 150 miles radius.

Containerboard produced in
our mills is shipped by rail or truck. Our individual mills do not own or
maintain outside warehousing facilities. We do use some third-party warehouses
for short-term storage.

Customers

PCA’s corrugated products
group sells to over 8,200 customers in over 15,000 locations. About 65% to 70%
of our corrugated products customers are regional and local accounts, which are
broadly diversified across industries and geographic locations. The remaining
30% to 35% of our customer base consists primarily of national accounts, or
those customers with a national presence. These customers typically purchase
corrugated products from several of our box plants throughout the United
States.

Major Raw Materials
Used

Fiber supply.

Fiber is the single largest
cost in the manufacture of containerboard. PCA consumes both wood fiber and
recycled fiber in our containerboard mills. We have no 100% recycled mills, or
those mills whose fiber consumption consists solely of recycled fiber. To
reduce our fiber costs, we have invested in processes and equipment to ensure a
high degree of fiber flexibility. Our mills have the capability to shift a
portion of their fiber consumption between softwood, hardwood and recycled
sources. With the exception of our Valdosta mill, our other mills can utilize
some recycled fiber in their containerboard production. Our ability to use
various types of virgin and recycled fiber helps mitigate the impact of changes
in the prices of various fibers. Our corrugated products plants generate
recycled fiber as a by-product from the manufacturing process, which is sold to
our mills directly or through trade agreements. During 2004, our containerboard
mills consumed approximately 602,000 tons of recycled fiber and our corrugated
converting operations generated approximately 205,000 tons of recycled fiber.
As a result, PCA was a net recycled fiber buyer of 397,000 tons, or 17% of our
total fiber requirements.

Energy supply.

Energy at the mills is
obtained through purchased electricity or through various fuels, which are
converted to steam or electricity on-site. Fuel sources include coal, natural
gas, oil, internally produced and purchased bark and by-products of the containerboard
manufacturing and pulping process. These fuels are burned in boilers to produce
steam. Steam turbine generators are used to produce electricity. To reduce our
mill energy cost, we have invested in processes and equipment to ensure a high
level of purchased fuel flexibility. Historically, natural gas and fuel oil
have shown more price volatility than coal and purchased bark. During 2004,
11.7 million M


BTU’s (million BTU’s), or approximately 70% of our
mills’ purchased fuel needs, were from purchased bark and coal, historically
our two lowest cost purchased fuels. For the same period, our mills consumed
about 1.4 million M


BTU’s of natural gas (9% of the mills’ total
purchased fuels) and 3.1 million M


BTU’s of fuel oil (19% of the
mills’ total purchased fuels).

Our two, kraft linerboard mills at Counce and Valdosta
generate approximately 70% of their fuel requirements from their own
by-products. Approximately 45% of the electricity consumed by our four mills is
generated on-site.


PCA’s corrugated plants
each have a boiler that produces steam which is used by the corrugator. The
majority of these boilers burn natural gas, although some also have the ability
to burn fuel oil. During 2004, PCA’s corrugated products plants consumed
approximately 1.8 million M


BTU’s of natural gas.

Competition

Corrugated products are produced by about 650 U.S.
companies operating approximately 1,400 plants. Most corrugated products are
custom manufactured to the customer’s specifications. Corrugated producers
generally sell within a 150-mile radius of their plants and compete with
other corrugated producers in their local market. In fact, the Fibre Box
Association tracks industry data by 47 distinct market regions.

The larger, multi-plant integrated companies may also
solicit larger, multi-plant customers who purchase for all of their facilities
on a consolidated basis. These customers are often referred to as national or
corporate accounts.

Corrugated products businesses seek to differentiate
themselves through pricing, quality, service, design and product innovation. We
compete for both local and national account business and we compete against
producers of other types of packaging products. On a national level, our
competitors include Georgia-Pacific Corporation, International Paper Company,
Smurfit-Stone Container Corporation, Temple-Inland Inc. and Weyerhaeuser
Company. However, with our strategic focus on local and regional accounts, we
believe we compete as much with the smaller, independent converters as with the
larger, integrated producers.

Our principal competitors
with respect to sales of our containerboard produced but not consumed at our
own corrugated products plants are a number of large, diversified paper
companies, including Georgia-Pacific Corporation, International Paper Company,
Smurfit-Stone Container Corporation, Temple-Inland Inc. and Weyerhaeuser
Company, as well as other regional manufacturers. Containerboard is generally
considered a commodity-type product and can be purchased from numerous suppliers.

Employees

As of December 31, 2004, we had approximately
8,100 employees. Approximately 2,200 of these employees were salaried and
approximately 5,900 were hourly. Approximately 75% of our hourly employees are
represented by unions. Our unionized employees are represented primarily by the
Paper, Allied Industrial, Chemical, Energy Workers International Union (PACE),
the International Association of Machinists (IAM), the Graphic Communications
International Union (GCIU), and the United Steel Workers of America (USWA).

Contracts for unionized mill employees at our
containerboard mills expire between May 2006 and October 2009.
Contracts for unionized corrugated plant employees expire between October 2004
and January 2011. We are currently in negotiations to renew or extend any
union contracts that have recently expired or are expiring in the near future.

During 2004 we experienced
no work stoppages. In 2001, we experienced a one-month strike at our Filer City
mill with the USWA. The strike was settled, and the mill’s current agreement
expires in May 2006. Prior to this incident we had experienced no
instances of significant work stoppages in the previous 15 years. We
believe we have satisfactory relations with our employees.

Environmental
Matters

Compliance with
environmental requirements is a significant factor in our business operations.
We commit substantial resources to maintaining environmental compliance and
managing environmental risk. We are subject to, and must comply with, a variety
of federal, state and local environmental laws,


particularly
those relating to air and water quality, waste disposal and the cleanup of
contaminated soil and groundwater. The most significant of these laws affecting
us are:

1.     Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)

2.     Clean
Water Act (CWA)

3.     Clean Air
Act (CAA)

4.     The
Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know-Act (EPCRA)

5.     Toxic
Substance Control Act (TSCA)

6.     Safe
Drinking Water Act (SDWA)

We believe that we are currently in material
compliance with these and all applicable environmental rules and
regulations. Because environmental regulations are constantly evolving, we have
incurred, and will continue to incur, costs to maintain compliance with these
and other environmental laws. For the year ended December 31, 2004 we
spent approximately $15.1 million to comply with the requirements of these and
other environmental laws. For the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002
the costs of environmental compliance were approximately $12.4 million and
$11.5 million, respectively. We work diligently to anticipate and budget for
the impact of applicable environmental regulations and do not currently expect
that future environmental compliance obligations will materially affect our
business or financial condition.

In April 1998, the United States Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) finalized a new Clean Air and Water Act commonly
referred to as the Cluster Rules, which govern all pulp and paper mill
operations, including those at our mills. Over the next several years, the
Cluster Rules will affect our allowable discharges of air and water
pollutants. As a result, PCA and its competitors are required to incur costs to
ensure compliance with these new rules. From 1997 through 2004, we spent
approximately $34.5 million on Cluster Rule compliance to meet Clean
Air Act requirements. Total capital costs for environmental matters, including
Cluster Rule compliance, were $9.3 million for 2004. We currently
estimate 2005 environmental capital expenditures will be $14.1 million

,

of which $3.0 million of the expenditures are to meet
Cluster Rule requirements. Our current spending projections to complete
all Cluster Rule compliance requirements at our four mills is about
$4.8 million, which will be spent between 2005 and 2007.

As is the case with any industrial operation, we have
in the past incurred costs associated with the remediation of soil or
groundwater contamination. From 1994 through 2004, remediation costs at our
mills and converting plants totaled about $3.1 million. We do not believe
that any on-going remedial projects are material in nature. As of December 31,
2004, we maintained an environmental reserve of $5.7 million, which
includes funds relating to onsite landfill and surface impoundments as well as
on-going and anticipated remedial projects. Of the $5.7 million reserve, $3.8
million is reserved for our landfill obligations, which are accounted for in
accordance with SFAS No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations”.
We believe these reserves are adequate.

We could also incur environmental liabilities as a
result of claims by third parties for civil damages, including liability for
personal injury or property damage, arising from releases of hazardous
substances or contamination. We are not aware of any material claims of this
type currently pending against us.

As a part of the April 12, 1999 transactions,
Pactiv agreed to retain all liability for all former facilities and all sites
associated with pre-closing offsite waste disposal. Pactiv also retained
environmental liability for a closed landfill located near the Filer City mill.


As of this filing, we
believe that it is not reasonably possible that future environmental
expenditures above the $5.7 million accrued as of December 31, 2004 will
have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.

Forward-looking
Statements

Some of the
statements in this report and in our 2004 Annual Report to Shareholders, and in
particular, statements found in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations, that are not historical in
nature may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are often
identified by the words “will,” “should,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “expect,” “intend,”
“estimate,” “hope,” or similar expressions. These statements reflect management’s
current views with respect to future events and are subject to risks and uncertainties.
There are important factors that could cause actual results to differ
materially from those in forward-looking statements, many of which are beyond
our control. These factors, risks and uncertainties include the following:

·

the
impact of general economic conditions;

·

containerboard and corrugated products general
industry conditions, including competition, product demand and product pricing;

·

fluctuations in wood fiber and recycled fiber
costs;

·

fluctuations in purchased energy costs; and

·

legislative or regulatory requirements,
particularly concerning environmental matters.

Our actual results,
performance or achievement could differ materially from those expressed in, or
implied by, these forward-looking statements, and accordingly, we can give no
assurances that any of the events anticipated by the forward-looking statements
will transpire or occur, or if any of them do so, what impact they will have on

*       On
January 20, 2005 we announced that we would start up our number one paper
machine at our Filer City mill and, after this machine was performing reliably,
we would then shut down our number three paper machine at our Tomahawk mill.
Shutting down the number three machine at Tomahawk will reduce our total
productive capacity by 66,000 tons to 507,000 tons and to 2,335,000 tons for
our total containerboard mill system. This plan is based on current market
conditions and productivity and could change if market conditions or productivity
levels change going forward.

We currently own all four containerboard mills and 44
of our corrugated manufacturing operations. We also own two sawmills, an air-drying
yard, one warehouse and miscellaneous other property, which includes sales
offices and woodlands forest management offices. These sales offices and
woodlands forest management offices generally have one to four employees and
serve as administrative offices. PCA leases the space for three corrugated
plants, 19 sheet plants, five regional design centers, and numerous other
distribution centers, warehouses and facilities. The equipment in these leased
facilities is, in virtually all cases, owned by PCA except for forklifts and
other rolling stock which is generally leased.

We lease the cutting rights to approximately 115,000
acres of timberland located near our Counce and Valdosta mills. Most of these
cutting rights agreements have terms with over 15 years remaining.

We currently lease space
for our executive and administrative offices in Lake Forest, Illinois. The
lease for the Lake Forest, Illinois facility is a short term, facility use
agreement lease with automatic renewal rights. Specifically, this lease is a
continuous month-to-month lease with unlimited automatic renewals entitling
either party the right to terminate the lease with at least 8 months notice. We
currently believe that our owned and leased space for facilities and properties
are sufficient to meet our operating requirements for the foreseeable future.

.   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

On May 14, 1999, PCA was named as a defendant in
two Consolidated Class Action Complaints which alleged a civil violation
of Section 1 of the Sherman Act. The suits, then captioned

Winoff Industries, Inc. v. Stone Container Corporation

,
MDL No. 1261 (E.D. Pa.) and

General Refractories Co.
v. Gaylord Container Corporation

, MDL No. 1261 (E.D. Pa.), name
PCA as a defendant based solely on the allegation that PCA is successor to the
interests of Tenneco Packaging Inc. and Tenneco Inc., both of which were also
named as defendants in the suits, along with nine other linerboard and
corrugated sheet manufacturers. The complaints allege that the defendants,
during the period October 1, 1993 through November 30, 1995,
conspired to limit the supply of linerboard, and that the purpose and effect of
the alleged conspiracy was to artificially increase prices of corrugated
containers and corrugated sheets, respectively. On November 3, 2003,
Pactiv (formerly known as Tenneco Packaging), Tenneco and PCA entered into an
agreement to settle the class action lawsuits. The settlement agreement
provides for a full release of all claims against PCA as a result of the class
action lawsuits and was approved by the Court in an opinion issued on April 21,
2004. Approximately 160 plaintiffs opted out of the class and together filed
about ten direct


action complaints in
various federal courts across the country. All of the opt-out complaints make
allegations against the defendants, including PCA, substantially similar to
those made in the class actions. The settlement agreement does not cover these
direct action cases. These actions have all been consolidated as

In re Linerboard

, MDL 1261 (E.D. Pa.) for pretrial purposes.
Fact discovery is proceeding and is currently set to close June 30, 2005. As of
the date of this filing, we believe it is not reasonably possible that the
outcome of this litigation will have a material adverse effect on our financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.

PCA is also party to
various legal actions arising in the ordinary course of our business. These
legal actions cover a broad variety of claims spanning our entire business. As
of the date of this filing, we believe it is not reasonably possible that the
resolution of these legal actions will, individually or in the aggregate, have
a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or
cash flows.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION
AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion
of historical results of operations and financial condition should be read in
conjunction with the audited financial statements and the notes thereto which
appear elsewhere in this report.

Overview

On April 12, 1999, PCA acquired the
containerboard and corrugated products business of Pactiv Corporation (the “Group”),
formerly known as Tenneco Packaging Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of
Tenneco, Inc. The Group operated prior to April 12, 1999 as a
division of Pactiv, and not as a separate, stand-alone entity. From its
formation in January 1999 and through the closing of the acquisition on April 12,
1999, PCA did not have any significant operations.

The April 12, 1999
acquisition was accounted for using historical values for the contributed
assets. Purchase accounting was not applied because, under the applicable
accounting guidance, a change of control was deemed not to have occurred as a
result of the participating veto rights held by Pactiv after the closing of the
transactions under the terms of the stockholders agreement entered into in
connection with the transactions.

Results of
Operations

Year Ended December 31,
2004 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003

The
historical results of operations of PCA for the years ended December, 31 2004
and 2003 are set forth the below:


Net Sales

Net sales increased by
$154.6 million, or 8.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2004 from
the year ended December 31, 2003. Net sales increased due to improved
sales volumes and prices of corrugated products and containerboard compared to
2003.

Total corrugated products
volume sold increased 6.6% to 29.9 billion square feet in 2004 compared to
28.1 billion square feet in 2003. On a comparable shipment-per-workday
basis, corrugated products sales volume increased 7.0% in 2004 from 2003.
Shipments-per-workday is calculated by dividing in shipments-per-workday our
total corrugated products volume during the year by the number of workdays
within the year. The larger percentage increase was due to the fact that 2004
had one less workday (251 days), those days not falling on a weekend or
holiday, than 2003 (252 days). Containerboard sales volume to external domestic
and export customers increased 6.8% to 475,000 tons for the year ended December 31,
2004 from 445,000 tons in 2003.

Income Before
Interest and Taxes

Income before interest and
taxes increased by $43.6 million, or 45.1%, for the year ended December 31,
2004 compared to 2003. Included in income before interest and taxes for the
twelve months ended December 31, 2004 is income of $27.8 million, net of
expenses, attributable to a dividend paid to PCA by Southern Timber Venture,
LLC (STV), the timberlands joint venture in which PCA owns a 31


¤


% ownership interest. Included
in income before interest and taxes for the twelve months ended December 31,
2003 is a $3.3 million charge for fees and expenses related to the Company’s
debt refinancing which was completed in July 2003, and a fourth quarter
charge of $16.0 million to settle certain benefits related matters with Pactiv
Corporation dating back to April 12, 1999 when PCA became a stand-alone
company, as described below.

During the fourth quarter
of 2003, Pactiv notified PCA that we owed Pactiv additional amounts for hourly
pension benefits and workers’ compensation liabilities dating back to April 12,
1999. A settlement of $16.0 million was negotiated between Pactiv and PCA in
December 2003. The full amount of the settlement was accrued in the fourth
quarter of 2003.

Excluding these special
items, operating income decreased $3.4 million in 2004 compared to 2003. The $3.4
million decrease in income before interest and taxes was primarily attributable
to increased energy costs, including transportation ($19.2 million), higher
recycled and wood fiber costs ($16.7 million), increased salary expenses
related to annual increases and new hires ($5.7 million), and increased
contractual hourly labor costs ($5.6 million), which was partially offset by
increased sales volume and sales prices of ($44.3 million).

Gross profit decreased
$0.2 million, or 0.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2004 from the
year ended December 31, 2003. Gross profit as a percentage of sales
declined from 17.2% of sales in 2003 to 15.8% of sales in the current year
primarily due to the cost increases described above.

Corporate overhead for the
year ended December 31, 2004, decreased by $1.6 million, or 3.5%,
from the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease was primarily
attributable to the fees and expenses related to the debt refinancing ($3.3
million) incurred in 2003, partially offset by increased salaries ($.8 million)
and higher professional fees primarily related to audits of internal controls
($0.7 million).

Selling and administrative
expenses increased $8.6 million, or 6.7%, for the year ended December 31,
2004 from the comparable period in 2003. The increase was primarily the result
of increased salary and incentive compensation expense ($4.2 million) and
related fringe benefits ($1.0 million), higher warehousing costs due to customer
requirements ($1.1 million), increased travel, entertainment and promotional expenses
($0.9 million), increased broker commissions ($0.6 million) and higher
recruiting, relocation and training costs ($0.6 million).


Other expense, net, decreased
$6.2 million, or 50.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to
the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease was primarily due to a
reduction in charges on disposal and transfer costs of fixed assets and facility
closure costs of $3.3 million, reduced legal charges of $1.5 million, and a
reduction in expenses of $1.4 million consisting of individually insignificant
items.

Interest Expense
and Income Taxes

Interest expense decreased
in 2004 by $92.2 million, or 75.7%, from 2003. This decrease included
$73.3 million of expenses related to the Company’s debt refinancing, which was
completed in July 2003. The $73.3 million of expenses consisted of $55.9
million paid in premiums for the tender of the 9


¤


% senior
subordinated notes, and a $17.4 million non-cash charge for the write-off of
deferred financing fees related to the 9


¤


% notes and
PCA’s original revolving credit facility. Excluding the $73.3 million charge,
interest expense was $18.9 million lower than in 2003 as a result of lower
interest rates attributable to the Company’s July 2003 refinancing and
lower debt levels.

PCA’s effective tax rate
was 38.0% for the year ended December 31, 2004 and 42.3% for the year
ended December 31, 2003. The higher tax rate in 2003 is due to stable
permanent items over lower book income (loss). For both years 2004 and 2003 tax
rates are higher than the federal statutory rate of 35.0% due to state income
taxes.

Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to Year
Ended December 31, 2002

The
historical results of operations of PCA for the years ended December 31, 2003
and 2002 are set forth below:

Net Sales

Net sales decreased by $0.4 million, or 0.0%, for
the year ended December 31, 2003 from the year ended December 31,
2002. Net sales increased due to improved sales volumes compared to 2002,
however, this increase was entirely offset by lower sales prices.

Total corrugated products
volume sold increased 2.1% to 28.1 billion square feet in 2003 compared to
27.5 billion square feet in 2002. On a comparable shipment-per-workday
basis, corrugated products sales volume increased 1.7% in 2003 from 2002.
Shipments-per-workday is calculated by dividing our total corrugated products
volume during the year by the number of workdays within the year. The lower
percentage increase was due to the fact that 2003 had one more workday (252
days), those days not falling on a weekend or holiday, than 2002 (251 days).
Containerboard sales volume to external domestic and export customers decreased
6.7% to 445,000 tons for the year ended December 31, 2003 from 477,000
tons in the comparable period of 2002.

Income Before
Interest and Taxes

Income before interest and
taxes decreased by $48.4 million, or 33.3%, for the year ended December 31,
2003 compared to 2002. Included in income before interest and taxes for the
twelve months


ended December 31,
2003 is a $3.3 million charge for fees and expenses related to the Company’s
debt refinancing which was completed in July 2003, and a fourth quarter
charge of $16.0 million to settle certain benefits related matters with Pactiv
Corporation dating back to April 12, 1999 when PCA became a stand-alone
company. The remaining $29.1 million decrease in income before interest
and taxes was primarily attributable to decreased sales prices ($13.4 million),
and increased costs of energy ($7.9 million) and wood costs ($4.8 million).

Gross profit decreased
$26.8 million, or 8.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2003 from the
year ended December 31, 2002. Gross profit as a percentage of sales
declined from 18.7% of sales in 2002 to 17.2% of sales in the current year
primarily due to the sales price decreases and energy and wood cost increases
described above.

Corporate overhead for the
year ended December 31, 2003, increased by $5.5 million, or 13.5%,
from the year ended December 31, 2002. The increase was primarily
attributable to the fees and expenses related to the debt refinancing ($3.3
million), increased depreciation and amortization expense ($ 0.8 million) and
an increase in pension costs ($0.7 million).

Selling and administrative
expenses decreased $2.9 million, or 2.2%, for the year ended December 31,
2003 from the comparable period in 2002. The decrease was primarily the result
of decreased travel and meeting costs ($1.3 million), lower recruiting and
relocation expenses ($0.7 million), reduced salary costs ($0.5 million) and a
reduction in training costs ($0.5 million).

Other expense, net,
increased $1.9 million, or 18.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2003
compared to the year ended December 31, 2002, primarily due to a $1.6 million
increase in the Company’s legal reserve.

Interest Expense
and Income Taxes

Interest expense increased
in 2003 by $54.1 million, or 79.9%, from the comparable period in 2002.
This increase included $73.3 million of expenses related to the Company’s debt
refinancing, which was completed in July 2003. The $73.3 million of
expenses consisted of $55.9 million paid in premiums for the tender of the 9


¤


%
senior subordinated notes, and a $17.4 million non-cash charge for the
write-off of deferred financing fees related to the 9


¤


% notes and
PCA’s original revolving credit facility dated as of April 12, 1999 and
amended and restated as of June 29, 2000. Excluding the $73.3 million
charge, interest expense was $19.2 million lower than in 2002 as a result of
lower interest rates attributable to the Company’s July 2003 refinancing
and lower debt levels.

PCA’s effective tax rate
was 42.3% for the year ended December 31, 2003 and 37.9% for the year
ended December 31, 2002. The 2003 increase in the tax rate is due to
stable permanent items over lower book income (loss). The tax rates are higher
than the federal statutory rate of 35.0% due to state income taxes.

Liquidity and Capital Resources


Operating
Activities

Cash flow provided by
operating activities decreased $29.5 million, or 12.1%, to $215.3 million, for
the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the year ended December 31,
2003. The decrease was the result of higher working capital requirements of $65.4
million, partially offset by higher net income and increased deferred income
taxes as a result of the higher income levels in 2004. The higher working
capital requirements were driven by a $13.0 million payment to Pactiv in January 2004
for a fourth quarter 2003 negotiated settlement of pension benefits and workers’
compensation liabilities dating back to April 12, 1999, the date Tenneco
Packaging (now known as Pactiv) sold us to PCA Holdings LLC. This payment
was accrued in the fourth quarter of 2003. Additionally, PCA paid Pactiv $10.0
million (of which $7.5 million was accrued at December 31, 2003) in April 2004
as final payment for PCA’s participation in Pactiv’s salaried pension plan. The
higher working capital levels were also driven by unfavorable changes in
accounts payable ($13.1 million), accrued liabilities ($5.0 million) and
prepaid expenses and other current assets ($12.1 million) primarily due to
a federal income tax refund received in 2003, as well as higher balances of
accounts receivable ($11.1 million) in 2004 primarily due to improved sales
volumes and pricing previously described and higher balances of inventory
($3.6 million) in 2004.

Cash flow provided by
operating activities increased $4.8 million, or 2.0%, to $244.8 million,
for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to the year ended December 31,
2002. The increase was the result of lower working capital requirements of $34.0
million, partially offset by lower net income as previously described and
decreased deferred income taxes as a result of recording a deferred tax asset
related to the 2003 tax net operating loss. The lower working capital
requirements were primarily driven by higher accounts payable and accrued
liability balances ($37.7 million), lower prepaid expenses and other current
assets balance ($20.9 million) primarily due to a federal income tax refund
received during 2003, partially offset by higher balances of accounts
receivable ($9.5 million) related to strong fourth quarter 2003 sales volumes
and higher inventory balances ($15.1 million) in 2003.

Investing
Activities

Net cash used for
investing activities decreased by $1.1 million, or 0.9%, to $116.8 million for
the year ended December 31, 2004. The decrease in cash used for investing
activities was primarily the result of lower expenditures for property, plant
and equipment of $4.6 million, a joint venture dividend of $29.3 million
received from Southern Timber Venture, LLC (STV), and $2.0 million in proceeds
received from the sale of a small portion of PCA’s investment in STV in 2004,
partially offset by higher acquisitions in 2004 of $34.6 million. See Note 13
to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for
additional information regarding acquisitions.

Net cash used for
investing activities increased by $8.3 million, or 7.6%, to $117.9
million, for the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to the year ended December 31,
2002. The increase in cash used for investing activities was primarily the
result of increased expenditures for property, plant and equipment of $5.8
million, the acquisition of the assets of one corrugated products plant for
$3.1 million and $0.7 million in expenditures to establish two small sheet
plants. See Note 13 to our audited consolidated financial statements included
elsewhere in this report for additional information regarding this acquisition.

As of December 31,
2004, PCA had commitments for capital expenditures of $55.2 million. PCA
believes operating cash flow from continuing operations will be sufficient to
fund these commitments.

Financing
Activities

Net cash used for financing activities totaled $57.2
million for the year ended December 31, 2004, a decrease of $29.0 million, or
33.6%, from the comparable period in 2003. The decrease was primarily
attributable to $4.0 million in debt prepayments in 2004 compared to $94.1
million in debt prepayments made during the comparable period in 2003 and stock
repurchases of $17.5 million made in 2003. This was partially offset by dividend
payments on PCA’s common stock of $63.7 million in 2004 and the $14.0 million
in proceeds that PCA netted from the debt refinancing in 2003 described below.


Net cash used for
financing activities increased by $4.6 million, or $5.6, to $86.2 million, for
the year ended December 31, 2003 compared to the year ended December 31,
2002. The increase was primarily attributable to $94.1 million in debt
prepayments in 2003 compared to $53.1 million in debt prepayments made during
the comparable period in 2002. This was partially offset by lower stock
repurchases of $15.5 million that PCA made in 2003 compared to 2002 and higher
proceeds received from stock option exercises of $7.2 million in 2003 compared
to the same period in 2002. In addition, PCA also netted $14.0 million in
proceeds from the debt refinancing described below.

In connection with the
debt refinancing in July 2003, PCA received proceeds, net of discount, of
$595.8 million from its notes offering and new senior credit facility and $27.0
million from settlement of the Treasury lock, which it used to complete the
tender offer of its 9

equity ownership interest in Southern Timber Venture, LLC. In 2004, 2003 and
2002, PCA received dividends from Southern Timber Venture, LLC of $29.3 million
($16.9 million net of taxes and expenses), $1.2 million ($0.7 million
after-tax) and $2.3 million ($1.4 million after-tax), respectively.

On November 29, 2000,
PCA established an on-balance sheet securitization program for its trade
accounts receivable. To effectuate this program, PCA formed a wholly-owned
limited purpose subsidiary, Packaging Credit Company, LLC, or PCC, which in
turn formed a wholly-owned, bankruptcy-remote, special-purpose subsidiary,
Packaging Receivables Company, LLC, or PRC, for the purpose of acquiring
receivables from PCC. Both of these entities are included in the consolidated
financial statements of PCA. Under this program, PCC purchases on an ongoing basis
substantially all of the receivables of PCA and sells such receivables to PRC.
PRC and lenders established a $150.0 million receivables-backed revolving
credit facility through which PRC obtains funds to purchase receivables from
PCC. The receivables purchased by PRC are and will be solely the property of
PRC. In the event of a liquidation of PRC, the creditors of PRC would be
entitled to satisfy their claims from PRC’s assets prior to any distribution to
PCC or PCA. Credit available under the receivables credit facility is on a
borrowing-base formula. As a result, the full amount of the facility may not be
available at all times. On October 31, 2003, PCA renewed the receivables
credit facility for an additional three-year term, expiring on October 10,
2006. As of December 31, 2004, $109.0 million was outstanding and
$41.0 million was available for additional borrowing under the receivables
credit facility. The highest outstanding principal balance under the
receivables credit facility during fiscal 2004 was $109.0 million.

On July 7, 2003, PCA
repaid all borrowings under its then-existing senior credit facility. This
facility was replaced with a senior unsecured credit facility that provides for
a $100.0 million revolving credit facility, including a $35.0 million subfacility
for letters of credit, and a $50.0 million term loan. The senior credit
facility closed on July 21, 2003, and it expires in 2008. PCA’s total
borrowings under the senior credit facility as of December 31, 2004
consisted of $39.0 million of term loans.

charge of approximately $76.6 million ($46.7 million after-tax) in the third
quarter of 2003. The $76.6 million charge includes the tender offer premium of
$55.9 million and a $17.4 million non-cash charge for the write-off of deferred
financing fees due to the early extinguishment of debt, which are included in
interest expense, and fees and expenses of $3.3 million, which are included in
corporate overhead. As required by their terms, the $150.0 million of 4

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

The Company does not have
any off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2004 that would
require disclosure under SEC FR-67, “Disclosure in Management’s
Discussion and Analysis About Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate
Contractual Obligations.”

Contractual Obligations

The
following table summarizes PCA’s contractual obligations at December 31,
2004:

The above table excludes unamortized debt discount of
$3.4 million at December 31, 2004,
interest payments on debt outstanding, and PCA’s pension contributions of $20.4 million to be made in 2005.
PCA currently does not have any projections for future pension contributions
beyond 2005.

The lease commitments, purchase commitments and
letters of credit are not reflected on PCA’s consolidated balance sheet as of December 31,
2004. See Notes 7 and 10 to the audited consolidated financial statements for
additional information.

PCA’s primary sources of liquidity are net cash
provided by operating activities, borrowings under PCA’s revolving credit facility,
and additional borrowings under PCA’s receivables credit facility. As of December 31,
2004, PCA had $141.0 million in unused borrowing capacity under its existing
credit agreements. PCA’s primary uses of cash are for capital expenditures,
debt service and common stock dividends, which it expects to be able to fund
from these sources.

The
following table provides the outstanding balances and the weighted average
interest rates as of December 31, 2004 for each of PCA’s outstanding term
loans, the revolving credit facility and the receivables credit facility:


The above table excludes unamortized debt discount of
$3.4 million at December 31, 2004. It also excludes from the projected
annual cash interest payments, the
non-cash income from the annual amortization of the $27.0
million received in July 2003 from the settlement of the Treasury locks
related to the five- and ten- year notes. The amortization is being recognized
over the terms of the five- and ten-year notes.

The borrowings under the senior credit facility are
available to fund PCA’s working capital requirements, capital expenditures and
other general corporate purposes. The term loan must be repaid in quarterly
installments from July 2006 through 2008. The senior credit facility will
terminate in July 2008. The receivables credit facility will terminate in October 2006.

The instruments
governing PCA’s indebtedness contain financial and other covenants that limit,
among other things, the ability of PCA and its subsidiaries to:

·

enter
into sale and leaseback transactions,

·

incur
liens,

·

enter
into certain transactions with affiliates, or

·

merge
or consolidate with any other person or sell or otherwise dispose of all or
substantially all of the assets of PCA.

These limitations could limit corporate and operating
activities.

In addition, we must maintain minimum net worth,
maximum leverage and minimum EBITDA to interest ratios under the senior credit
facility. A failure to comply with the restrictions contained in the senior
credit facility could lead to an event of default, which could result in an
acceleration of such indebtedness. Such an acceleration would also constitute
an event of default under the notes indenture and the receivables credit
facility.

PCA currently expects to incur capital expenditures of
$110.0 million

to $115.0 million

in
2005. These capital expenditures
will be used primarily for maintenance capital, cost reduction, business
growth, and environmental compliance.

PCA believes that net cash
generated from operating activities and available cash-on-hand will be adequate
to meet its anticipated debt service requirements, capital expenditures, common
stock dividend payments and working capital needs for the next 12 months,
and that net cash generated from operating activities and amounts available
under the revolving credit facility and additional borrowings under its
receivables credit facility will be adequate to meet its anticipated debt
service requirements, capital expenditures, common stock dividend payments and
working capital needs for the foreseeable future. PCA’s future operating
performance and its ability to service or refinance the notes and to service,
extend or refinance the credit facilities will be subject to future economic
conditions and to financial, business and other factors, many of which are
beyond PCA’s control.

Environmental
Matters

We are subject to,
and must comply with, a variety of federal, state and local environmental laws,
particularly those relating to air and water quality, waste disposal and the
cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater. The most significant of these
laws affecting us are:

·

Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)

·

Clean
Water Act (CWA)

·

Clean
Air Act (CAA)


·

The
Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know-Act (EPCRA)

·

Toxic
Substance Control Act (TSCA)

·

Safe
Drinking Water Act (SDWA)

We believe that we are currently in material
compliance with these and all applicable environmental rules and
regulations. Because environmental regulations are constantly evolving, we have
incurred, and will continue to incur, costs to maintain compliance with these
and other environmental laws. For the year ended December 31, 2004 we
spent approximately $ 15.1 million to comply with the requirements of these and
other environmental laws. For the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002
the costs of environmental compliance were approximately $12.4 million and
$11.5 million, respectively.

In addition, the EPA finalized the Cluster Rules which
govern pulp and paper mill operations, including those at the Counce, Filer
City, Valdosta and Tomahawk mills. The
Cluster Rules affect
our allowable discharges of air and water pollutants, and require us to spend
money to ensure compliance with those new rules.

As is the case with any industrial operation, we have,
in the past, incurred costs associated with the remediation of soil or
groundwater contamination, as required by the federal Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as the
federal “Superfund” law, and analogous state laws. Cleanup requirements arise
with respect to properties we currently own or operate, former facilities and
off-site facilities where we have disposed of hazardous substances. Under the
terms of the contribution agreement, Pactiv has agreed to retain all liability
for all former facilities and all sites associated with pre-closing off-site
waste disposal. Pactiv has also retained environmentally impaired real property
in Filer City, Michigan unrelated to current mill operations.

Because liability for
remediation costs under environmental laws is strict, meaning that liability is
imposed without fault, joint and several, meaning that liability is imposed on
each party without regard to contribution, and retroactive, we could receive
notifications of cleanup liability in the future and this liability could be
material. From January 1994 through December 2004, remediation costs
at our mills and corrugated plants totaled about
$3.1 million. As of December 31, 2004, we maintained an environmental
reserve of $5.7 million, which includes funds relating to onsite landfills
and surface impoundments as well as on-going and anticipated remedial projects.
Total capital costs for environmental matters, including Cluster Rule compliance,
were $9.3 million for 2004 and we currently estimate 2005 environmental
capital expenditures will be $14.1 million, of which $3.0 million of
the expenditures are to meet Cluster Rule requirements. As of this filing,
we believe that it is not reasonably possible that future environmental
expenditures above the $5.7 million accrued as of December 31, 2004 will
have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Impact of Inflation

PCA does not believe that
inflation has had a material impact on its financial position or results of
operations during the past three years.

Critical Accounting
Policies

Management’s discussion and analysis of our financial
condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial
statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these
financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect
the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we
evaluate our estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories,
intangible assets, pensions and other post-retirement benefits, income taxes,
and contingencies and litigation. We


base our estimates on
historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be
reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for
making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are
not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these
estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

We believe the following
critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and
estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. For
a further discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies,
see Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements included
elsewhere in this report.

Accounts Receivable—Allowance for Doubtful Accounts and Customer Deductions

We evaluate the collectibility of our accounts
receivable based upon a combination of factors. In circumstances where we are
aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations to
us (e.g., bankruptcy filings, substantial downgrading of credit sources), we
record a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recorded receivable to the amount
we reasonably believe will be collected. For all other customers, we recognize
reserves for bad debts consisting of 0.3% for amounts less than 90 days past
due and 30% for amounts more than 90 days past due based on our historical
collection experience. If our collection experience deteriorates (i.e., higher
than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major
customer’s ability to meet its financial obligations to us), our estimates of
the recoverability of amounts due us could be reduced by a material amount.

The customer deductions reserve represents the
estimated amount required for customer returns, allowances and earned
discounts. Based on our experience, customer returns, allowances and earned
discounts have averaged 1.0% of our gross selling price. Accordingly, we
reserve 1.0% of our open customer accounts receivable balance for these items.

As of December 31,
2004, the balance in the allowance for doubtful accounts and customer
deductions reserve was $4.6 million, compared to
$5.3 million at December 31, 2003. Bad debt expense in 2004 was $0.4
million, compared to $1.8 million in 2003. The $1.4 million decrease

was primarily attributable to a reduction of $1.2 million
in the amount of accounts receivable balance that was deemed uncollectable in
2004 compared to 2003

.

For the year
ended December 31, 2003, bad debt
expense was $1.8 million compared to $3.0 million in 2002. The
decrease of $1.2 million was primarily attributable to one customer that filed
for bankruptcy during 2002, resulting in bad debt expense of $1.3 million

.

Inventories

We record our inventories
at the lower of cost or market. The estimated market value is based on
assumptions for future demand and related pricing. If actual market conditions
are less favorable than those projected by management, reductions in the value
of inventory may be required. Raw materials, work in process and finished goods valued using the lower of
last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) cost or market method comprised 66% and 67% of
inventories at current cost at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Supplies and materials
inventories are valued using a moving average cost.

Pension and Postretirement Benefits

The
Company accounts for defined benefit pension plans in accordance with SFAS No. 87, “Employers’ Accounting for
Pensions.” We account for our postretirement benefits in accordance with
SFAS No. 106, “Employers’
Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions.”

One of the principal assumptions used to calculate net
periodic pension cost is the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. The
expected long-term rate of return on plan assets may result in recognized
returns that are greater or less than the actual returns on those plan assets
in any given year. Over time,


however, the expected
long-term rate of return on plan assets is designed to approximate the actual
long term returns.

The discount rate assumptions used to account for
pension and postretirement benefit plans reflect the rates available on
high-quality, fixed-income debt instruments on December 31 of each year. The
rate of compensation increase is another significant assumption used for
pension accounting and is determined by the Company based upon annual reviews.

For postretirement health
care plan accounting, our Company reviews external data and our own historical
trends for health care costs to determine the health care cost trend rate
assumptions.

Environmental Liabilities

PCA accounts for its retirement obligations related to
its landfills under SFAS No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations,” which requires
legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets to be
recognized at their fair value at the time that the obligations are incurred.
Upon initial recognition of a liability, that cost is capitalized as part of the
related long-lived asset and amortized to expense over the
useful life of the asset. The adoption of SFAS No. 143 on January 1,
2003 did not have a material impact on PCA’s financial statements.

The potential costs for various environmental matters
are uncertain due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible cleanup
costs, the complexity and evolving nature of governmental laws and regulations
and their interpretations, and the timing, varying costs and effectiveness of
alternative cleanup technologies. Liabilities recorded for environmental
contingencies are estimates of the probable costs based upon available
information and assumptions. Because of these uncertainties, however, our
estimates may change. We believe that any additional costs identified as
further information becomes available would not have a material effect on our
financial statements.

In connection with the
sale to PCA of the containerboard and corrugated products business of Pactiv
Corporation in April 1999, Pactiv agreed to retain all liability for all
former facilities and all sites associated with offsite waste disposal prior to
April 12, 1999. Pactiv also retained the environmental liability for a
closed landfill located near the Filer City mill.

Revenue Recognition

PCA recognizes revenue as
title to the products is transferred to customers. Shipping and handling costs
are included in cost of sales. Shipping and handling billings to a customer are
included in revenue. In addition, PCA offers volume rebates to some of its
customers. The total cost of these programs is estimated and accrued as a
reduction to revenue at the time of the respective sale.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived assets to be
held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully
recoverable. In the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of any long-lived assets may be impaired, an evaluation of
recoverability would be performed. If an evaluation were required, the
estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset would be
compared to the asset’s carrying amount to determine if a write-down to fair
value is required.

Item
7A.   QUANTITIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

PCA is exposed to the
impact of interest rate changes and changes in the market value of its
financial instruments. PCA periodically enters into derivatives in order to
minimize these risks, but not for trading purposes. As of December 31,
2004, PCA was not party to any derivatives.


As the
interest rates on approximately 79% of PCA’s debt are fixed, a one percent
increase in interest rates would result in an increase in interest expense and
a corresponding decrease in income before taxes of $1.5 million annually for
the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003.  As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, the weighted average LIBOR was
2.56% and 1.19%, respectively, and the weighted average commercial paper rate
was 2.33% and 1.11%, respectively. In the event of a change in interest rates, management could take actions to mitigate its exposure to the
change. However, due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be
taken and their possible effects, the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes
in PCA’s financial structure.

9.   CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND
FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES

There were no changes in

Item 9A.   CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Controls
and Procedures

PCA’s management, under
the supervision and with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and
operation of PCA’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended)  as of
December 31, 2004. The evaluation of PCA’s disclosure controls
and procedures included a review of the controls’ objectives and design, PCA’s
implementation of the controls and the effect of the controls on the
information generated for use in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

During the quarter ended December 31,
2004, there were no changes in internal controls over financial reporting that
have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, PCA’s
internal control over financial reporting.

Based upon their
evaluation as of December 31, 2004, PCA’s Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer have concluded that PCA’s disclosure controls and
procedures are effective to ensure that material information relating to PCA is
made known to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, particularly during the periods when PCA’s periodic reports are being
prepared.

Management’s
Report  on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting

PCA’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in
Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f).  Internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles.  Internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company’s assets;
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being
made only with proper authorizations; and (3) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.


Because
of its inherent limitations, PCA’s internal control over
financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. A control system, no matter how well conceived
and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that
objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations
in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute
assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been
detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls become inadequate because of
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and
procedures may deteriorate.

PCA’s
management, under the supervision of and with the participation of the Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, assessed the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31,  2004,  based on
criteria for effective control over financial reporting described in “Internal
Control—Integrated Framework” issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  Based on this assessment, PCA’s management
concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as
of December 31, 2004, based on the specified criteria.

Management’s
assessment of the effectiveness  of internal control over financial reporting has
been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an
independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which
is included herein.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Packaging Corporation of
America

Board of Directors and Shareholders

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets of Packaging Corporation of America (the “Company”) as of December 31,
2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in
shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2004. Our audits also included the financial statement
schedule listed in the index at Item 15(a). These financial statements and
schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial
position of Packaging Corporation of America at December 31, 2004 and
2003, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004, in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial
statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial
statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the
information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
effectiveness of Packaging Corporation of America’s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in
Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated
February 11, 2005 expressed
an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF

REGISTERED

PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

On
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Packaging Corporation of America

Board
of Directors and Shareholders

We have audited management’s assessment, included
in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting, that Packaging Corporation of America maintained effective internal
control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal
Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Packaging
Corporation of America’s management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
management’s assessment and an
opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based
on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
management’s assessment, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial
reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable  assurance
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and
that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance
with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or
disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Packaging
Corporation of America maintained effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2004, is fairly stated, in all material
respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, Packaging Corporation of America maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2004, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
consolidated balance sheets of Packaging
Corporation of America as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related
consolidated statements of operations,  changes in shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004, and our
report dated February 11, 2005,
expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

BASIS
OF PRESENTATION AND NATURE OF BUSINESS

Packaging Corporation of America (“PCA” or the “Company”)
was incorporated on January 25, 1999. On April 12, 1999, PCA acquired the
containerboard and corrugated packaging products business of Pactiv
Corporation, formerly known as Tenneco Packaging Inc., a wholly owned
subsidiary of Tenneco Inc. PCA had no operations from the date of
incorporation on January 25, 1999 to April 11, 1999.

The Company is comprised of mills and corrugated
products operations. The mill operations (the “Mills”) consist of two kraft
linerboard mills located in Counce, Tennessee, and Valdosta, Georgia, and two
medium mills located in Filer City, Michigan, and Tomahawk, Wisconsin. The
Company leases the cutting rights to approximately 115,000 acres of timberland
as of December 31, 2004. The Mills transfer the majority of their output
to PCA’s corrugated products operations plants.

PCA’s corrugated manufacturing operations consist of
66 corrugated products plants, with 40 operating as combining operations, or
corrugated plants, and 26 as sheet plants; a technical and development center;
five graphic design centers; a rotogravure printing operation and a complement
of packaging supplies and distribution centers. All plants are located in the
continental United States. Corrugated plants combine linerboard and medium into
sheets that are converted into corrugated shipping containers, point-of-sale
graphics packaging, point-of-purchase displays and other specialized packaging.
Sheet plants purchase sheets primarily from PCA corrugated products plants to
use in the finished corrugated products converting process. The corrugated
products manufacturing plants sell to diverse customers primarily in North
America.

As of December 31, 2004, we had approximately
8,100 employees. Approximately 2,200 of these employees were salaried and
approximately 5,900 were hourly. Approximately 75% of our hourly employees are
represented by unions. Our unionized employees are represented primarily by the
Paper, Allied Industrial, Chemical, Energy Workers International Union, the
International Association of Machinists, the Graphic Communications
International Union and the United Steel Workers of America.

Contracts for unionized
mill employees at our containerboard mills expire between May 2006 and October 2009.
Contracts for unionized corrugated plant employees expire between October 2004
and January 2011. We are currently in negotiations to renew or extend any union
contracts that have recently expired or are expiring in the near future.

SUMMARY
OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Consolidation

The accompanying
consolidated financial statements of PCA include all majority-owned
subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated. The Company
has one joint venture that is carried under the equity method.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.

SUMMARY OF
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents
include all cash balances and highly liquid investments with a maturity of
three months or less. Cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates
market.

Accounts Receivable

The collectibility of our accounts receivable is based
upon a combination of factors. In circumstances where a specific customer is
unable to meet its financial obligations to us (e.g., bankruptcy filings,
substantial downgrading of credit sources), a specific reserve for bad debts is
recorded against amounts due to reduce the net recorded receivable to the
amount we reasonably believe will be collected. For all other customers,
reserves for bad debts are recognized consisting of 0.3% for amounts less than
90 days past due and 30% for amounts more than 90 days past due based
on historical collection experience. If collection experience deteriorates
(i.e., higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change
in a major customer’s ability to meet its financial obligations to us), the
estimate of the recoverability of amounts due could be reduced by a material
amount.

The customer deductions reserve represents the
estimated amount required for customer returns, allowances and earned
discounts. Based on our experience, customer returns, allowances and earned
discounts have averaged 1.0% of our gross selling price. Accordingly, we
reserve 1.0% of our open customer accounts receivable balance for these items.

At December 31, 2004 and
2003, the allowance for doubtful accounts was $2.4 million and $3.4 million,
respectively. Also included in the accounts receivable balance at December 31,
2004 and 2003 were reserves for customer deductions of $2.2 million and $1.9
million, respectively.

Inventories

Raw materials, work in process and finished goods are
valued using the lower of last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) cost or market method.
Supplies and materials inventories are valued using a moving average cost. All
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Inventories valued using
the LIFO method comprised 66% and 67% of inventories at current cost at December 31,
2004 and 2003, respectively. The LIFO method was not elected for valuing
inventories at Acorn Corrugated Box Co., which was acquired by PCA in February
2004.

SUMMARY OF
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

Depreciation is computed
on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related
assets. The following lives are used for the various categories of assets:

Buildings and land
  improvements

5 to 40 years

Machinery and equipment

3 to 25 years

Trucks and automobiles

3 to 10 years

Furniture and fixtures

3 to 20 years

Computers and hardware

3 to 7 years

Leasehold improvements

Period of the lease or useful life, if shorter

The amount of depreciation expense was
$151.3 million, $146.2 million and $139.8 million for the years ended
December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Assets under capital leases are depreciated on the
straight-line method over the term of the lease.

Expenditures for repairs
and maintenance are expensed as incurred.

Intangible Assets

The Company has
capitalized certain intangible assets, primarily customer lists and relationships,
covenants not to compete, and goodwill, based on their estimated fair value at
the date of acquisition. Amortization is provided for customer lists and
relationships on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from 10 to 40
years. Covenants not to compete are amortized on a straight-line basis over the
terms of the respective agreements. Goodwill, which amounted to $3.7 million
and $2.3 million as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, is not
being amortized but is subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 142, “Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets.”

Other Long-Term Assets

PCA has capitalized certain costs related to obtaining
its financing. These costs are amortized to interest expense using the
effective interest rate method over the terms of the senior credit facility and
senior notes, which range from five to ten years. Unamortized deferred
financing costs were $4.0 million and $4.6 million as of December 31,
2004 and 2003, respectively.

PCA leases the cutting rights to approximately 115,000
acres of timberland and capitalizes the annual lease payments and reforestation
costs associated with these leases. These costs are recorded as depletion when
timber is harvested and used in PCA’s business operations or sold to customers.
Capitalized long-term lease costs were $19.5 million and
$18.9 million as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The
amount of depletion expense was $2.3 million, $5.1 million and $4.9 million for
the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

PCA capitalizes certain
costs related to the purchase and development of software which is used in its
business operations. The costs attributable to these software systems are
amortized over their estimated useful lives based on various factors such as
the effects of obsolescence, technology and other economic factors. Net capitalized
software costs were $3.6 million and $7.3 million as of December 31,
2004 and 2003, respectively. Software amortization expense was $4.0 million, $4.6 million
and $4.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002,
respectively.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived assets to be
held and used are reviewed for impairment in accordance with provisions of SFAS
No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.”
In the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of
any long-lived assets may be impaired, an evaluation of recoverability would be
performed. If an evaluation is required, the estimated future undiscounted cash
flows associated with the asset would be compared to the asset’s carrying
amount to determine if a write-down to fair value is required.

Pension and Postretirement Benefits

The Company accounts for defined benefit pension plans
in accordance with SFAS No. 87, “Employers’ Accounting for Pensions.” We
account for our postretirement benefits in accordance with SFAS No. 106, “Employers’
Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions.”

One of the principal assumptions used to calculate net
periodic pension cost is the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. The
expected long-term rate of return on plan assets may result in recognized
returns that are greater or less than the actual returns on those plan assets
in any given year. Over time, however, the expected long-term rate of return on
plan assets is designed to approximate the actual long term returns.

The discount rate assumptions used to account for
pension and postretirement benefit plans reflect the rates available on high-quality,
fixed-income debt instruments on December 31st of each year. The rate of
compensation increase is another significant assumption used for pension
accounting and is determined by the Company based upon annual reviews.

For postretirement health
care plan accounting, the Company reviews external data and our own historical
trends for health care costs to determine the health care cost trend rate
assumptions.

Environmental Liabilities

The Company accounts for
its retirement obligations related to its landfills under SFAS No. 143, “Accounting
for Asset Retirement Obligations,” which requires legal obligations associated
with the retirement of long-lived assets to be recognized at their fair value
at the time that the obligations are incurred. Upon initial recognition of a
liability, that cost is capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and
amortized to expense over the useful life of the asset. The adoption of SFAS No. 143
on January 1, 2003 did not have a material impact on the Company’s
financial statements.

Packaging Corporation of America

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES (Continued)

Income Taxes

PCA utilizes the liability
method of accounting for income taxes whereby it recognizes deferred tax assets
and liabilities for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between
the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the
financial statements. Deferred tax assets will be reduced by a valuation
allowance if, based upon management’s estimates, it is more likely than not, that a portion of the deferred
tax assets will not be realized in a future period. The estimates utilized in
the recognition of deferred tax assets are subject to revision in future
periods based on new facts or circumstances.

Revenue Recognition

The Company recognizes
revenue as title to the products is transferred to customers. Shipping and
handling costs are included in cost of sales. Shipping and handling billings to
a customer
are included in revenue. In addition, the Company offers volume rebates to some
of its customers. The total cost of these programs is estimated and accrued as
a reduction to revenue at the time of the respective sale.

Research and Development

Research and development
costs are expensed as incurred. The amount charged to expense was $6.1 million,
$6.1 million, and $6.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2004,
2003 and 2002, respectively.

Industry Agreements

PCA regularly trades
containerboard with other manufacturers primarily to reduce shipping costs.
Containerboard trade agreements are a long standing industry practice. These
agreements are entered into on an annual basis, in which both parties agree to
ship an identical number of tons to each other within the agreement period.
These agreements minimize transportation cost by allowing each party’s
containerboard mills to ship containerboard to the other party’s closest
corrugated products plant. We track each shipment to ensure that the other
party’s shipments are equal during the agreement period. Such transfers are possible
because containerboard is a commodity product with no distinguishing product
characteristics. These transactions are accounted
for at carrying value, and sales are not recorded as the transactions are not
the culmination of an earnings process.
The transactions are recorded into inventory accounts, and no income is
recorded until such inventory is converted to a finished product and sold to an
end-use customer.

Segment Information

PCA is primarily engaged
in one line of business: the integrated
manufacture and sale of packaging materials, boxes and
containers for industrial and consumer markets. No single customer accounts for
more than 10% of total revenues.

Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities

The Company records its derivatives in accordance with SFAS No. 133,
“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.” The Statement requires the Company to
recognize derivative

F-

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

SUMMARY OF

instruments as either
assets or liabilities in the balance sheet at fair value. It further provides
criteria for derivative instruments to be designated as fair value, cash flow
or foreign currency hedges and establishes respective accounting standards for
reporting changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments. The gains or
losses resulting from adjusting the derivative instruments to fair value are
recorded in net income or accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (OCI),
as appropriate.

The Company has historically used
derivative instruments to manage interest costs and the risk associated with
changing interest rates. The Company’s objectives for holding derivatives are
to minimize the risks using the most effective methods to eliminate or reduce
the impacts of these exposures. Derivative
losses included in OCI as of December 31, 2002, were reclassified into
earnings over the lives of the collar agreements, through June 30, 2003.
As of December 31, 2004 and 2003,
the Company was not party to any derivatives.

On June 12, 2003, PCA
entered into two interest rate protection agreements with a counterparty to
lock in then current interest rates on 5-year and 10-year U.S.
Treasury notes. PCA entered into these agreements to protect it against
increases in the five-year U.S. Treasury note rate, which served as a
reference in determining the interest rate applicable to the five-year
notes due 2008, and the ten-year U.S. Treasury note rate, which served as
a reference in determining the interest rate applicable to the ten-year
notes due 2013. As a result of increases in the interest rates on the five-year
U.S. Treasury notes and ten-year U.S. Treasury notes, PCA received a
payment of approximately $27.0 million from the counterparty upon settlement of
the agreements, which occurred on July 21, 2003. PCA recorded the
settlement in OCI
and is amortizing
this amount against interest expense over the respective lives of the notes.

Stock-Based Compensation

PCA entered into management equity agreements in June 1999
with 125 of its management-level employees. These agreements provide for the
grant of options to purchase up to an aggregate of 6,576,460 shares of PCA’s
common stock at $4.55 per share, the same price per share at which PCA acquired the business from Pactiv Corporation. The agreement
called for these options to vest ratably over a five-year period, or, upon
completion of an initial public offering, vest fully with contractual
restrictions on transfer for a period of up to 18 months following
completion of the offering. The options vested with the initial public offering
in January 2000, and the restriction period ended August 2001.

In October 1999, the Company adopted a long-term
equity incentive plan, which provides for grants of stock options, stock
appreciation rights (SARs), restricted stock and performance awards to
directors, officers and employees of PCA, as well as others who engage in
services for PCA. Option awards granted to officers and employees vest ratably
over a four-year period, whereas option awards granted to directors vest immediately.
The plan, which will terminate on October 19, 2009, provides for the
issuance of up to 4,400,000 shares of common stock, of which 4,299,458  options have been granted through December 31,
2004.

During 2003, the Company
began granting
shares of restricted stock to certain of its officers,  employees
and directors. Restricted share awards granted to officers and
employees vest at the end of a

three to four year period, whereas
restricted share awards granted to directors vest at the end of a six-month

SUMMARY OF
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

As permitted by SFAS No. 123,
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” and amended by SFAS No. 148, “Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation—Transition and Disclosure,” the Company has
elected to account for its stock option plan under Accounting Principles Board
(“APB”) Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and
adopt the disclosure only provisions of SFAS No. 123 and SFAS No. 148.
Under APB No. 25, no compensation costs are recognized because the number
of options is fixed and the option exercise price is equal to the fair market
price of the common stock on the date of the grant. Under SFAS No. 123,
stock options are valued at the grant date using the Black-Scholes valuation model
and compensation costs are recognized ratably over the vesting period. Had
stock options been accounted for using the fair value method as recommended in
SFAS No. 123, compensation expense would have had the following pro forma
effect on our net income (loss) and
earnings (loss) per
share for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002.

Black-Scholes
option-pricing model assumptions and fair value for these options are shown in
the following table:

The Black-Scholes option valuation model
was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options which have
no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option
valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including
the expected stock price volatility. Because the Company’s employee stock
options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded
options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially
affect the fair value estimate, in

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

management’s opinion, the
existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the
fair value of its employee stock options.

New Accounting Pronouncements

In May 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)  issued FASB
Staff Position (“FSP”) No. 106-2, “Accounting Disclosure Requirements Related
to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003,”
which supersedes FSP No. 106-1 of the same title issued in January 2004. The
Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the
“Medicare Act”) introduces a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care
benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to
Medicare Part D. As the Company sponsors a number of postretirment benefit
plans, the Company performed an analysis and has determined that the adoption
of FSP No. 106-2 would not have a material impact on net periodic
postretirement benefit costs in future periods and would not have a material
impact on its financial
position, results of operations or cash
flows.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R),
“Share-Based Payment.” SFAS No. 123(R) requires that compensation cost related
to share-based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements based on fair value. Share-based payment transactions within the scope
of SFAS No. 123(R) include stock options, restricted stock awards,
performance-based awards, stock appreciation rights, and employee share
purchase plans. The provisions of SFAS No. 123(R) are  effective
as of the first interim period that begins after June 15, 2005. Accordingly,
the Company will implement the revised standard in the third quarter of fiscal
year 2005. Currently, the Company accounts for its share-based payment
transactions under the provisions of APB Opinion No. 25, which generally does
not require the recognition of compensation cost for employee stock options in
the financial statements. Management believes that the current required
disclosures in Note 2 under Stock-Based Compensation, materially reflect the
impact this standard would have on reported net earnings if adopted in the
periods presented.

Reclassifications

Prior year’s financial
statements have been reclassified where appropriate to conform with current
year presentation.

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS AND OTHER
POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

In connection with the acquisition from Pactiv, PCA
and Pactiv entered into a human resources agreement which, among other items,
granted PCA employees continued participation in the Pactiv pension plan for a
period of up to five years following the closing of the acquisition for an
agreed upon fee. For salaried employees, PCA paid Pactiv $4.0 million in
the first and second years, $6.0 million in the third year, $8.0 million
in the fourth year, and $10.0 million in the fifth year following the
closing date of the acquisition. For hourly employees, PCA paid Pactiv
$1.2 million per year through December 31, 2000 and

then $4.5 million per
year for two additional years, ending on December 31, 2002. The amounts
paid to Pactiv for continued participation in the Pactiv pension plans were
stipulated in the original human resources agreement or the extension
negotiated for hourly employee participation after December 31, 2000. The
fees paid to Pactiv were expensed ratably throughout the year.

Effective January 1, 2003, PCA adopted a
mirror-image pension plan for eligible hourly employees to succeed the Pactiv
pension plan in which PCA had participated though December 31, 2002. The PCA
pension plan for hourly employees recognizes service earned under both the PCA
plan and the prior Pactiv plan. Benefits earned under the PCA plan are reduced
by retirement benefits earned under the Pactiv plan through December 31,
2002. All assets and liabilities associated with benefits earned through December 31,
2002 for hourly employees and retirees of PCA were retained by the Pactiv plan.

Effective May 1, 2004, PCA adopted a
grandfathered pension plan for certain salaried employees who had previously
participated in the Pactiv pension plan pursuant to the above mentioned human
resource agreement. The benefit formula for the new PCA pension plan for
salaried employees is comparable to that of the Pactiv plan except that the PCA
plan uses career average base pay in the benefit formula in lieu of final
average base pay. The PCA pension plan for salaried employees recognizes
service earned under both the PCA plan and the prior Pactiv plan. Benefits
earned under the PCA plan are reduced by retirement benefits earned under the
Pactiv plan through April 30, 2004. All assets and liabilities associated
with benefits earned through April 30, 2004 for salaried employees and
retirees of PCA were retained by the Pactiv plan.

PCA has a supplemental executive retirement plan for
its CEO which will provide a supplemental pension benefit calculated on the
basis of the following formula: (annual salary + bonus) x (years of service) x
(0.167), where “years of service” equals years of service with PCA + five
years. The benefit is payable in a lump sum.

PCA also maintains a supplemental executive retirement
plan (SERP), which augments pension benefits for eligible executives (excluding
the CEO) earned under the PCA pension plan for salaried employees. Benefits are
determined using the same formula as the PCA pension plan but in addition to
counting career average base pay, the SERP also recognizes bonuses and any pay
earned in excess of IRS qualified plan compensation limits. Benefits earned
under the SERP are reduced by benefits paid from the PCA pension plan and any
prior qualified pension and SERP benefits earned under the Pactiv plan.

PCA also provides certain medical benefits for retired
salaried employees and certain medical and life insurance benefits for certain
hourly employees. For salaried employees, the plan covers employees retiring
from PCA on or after attaining age 58 who have had at least 10 years of
full-time service with PCA after attaining age 48. For hourly employees, the
postretirement medical coverage, where applicable, is available according to
the eligibility provisions in effect at the employee’s work location. Per the
human resources agreement referred to above, Pactiv retained the liability
relating to retiree medical and life benefits for PCA employees who had retired
on or before April 12, 1999 or who were eligible to retire within two
years of that date. On January 1, 2003, the Company adopted a new plan
design for salaried employees incorporating annual dollar caps in determining
the maximum amount of employer contributions made towards the total cost of
postretirement medical coverage.

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT
PLANS AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS (Continued)

No pay-related benefits are provided under the hourly
pension plan. PCA uses a September 30 measurement date for all of its
benefit plans.

PCA will contribute $20.4 million
to the pension plans in 2005.

Our funding policy is to
contribute to the plans amounts necessary to satisfy the funding requirements
of applicable laws and regulations. Pension plan assets, which totaled $7.9
million at September 30, 2004, were invested in the following classes of
securities:

Percentage

of Fair Value

Equity securities


%

Debt securities


%

Other


%

Our investment policy is to invest more heavily in
equity securities than debt securities. Approximately 60% of principal
contributions to the trust are invested in equity securities and 40% in debt
securities, with a liquidity requirement sufficient to cover at least three
months of benefit payment obligations.

In determining net pension and other postretirement
benefit costs, we have elected to amortize prior service cost on a
straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of employees
expected to receive benefits under the plans. A 10% corridor is used to
determine the amount of the unrecognized net gain or loss to be amortized. The
excess, if any, of the unrecognized net gain or loss over 10% of the greater of
the projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets is
amortized over the average remaining service period until retirement for active
participants and included in the net periodic benefit cost.

As of September 30, 2004, the Company assumed health
care cost trend rates for its postretirement benefit plans were 10.00% in 2005,
9.00% in 2006, 8.00% in 2007, 7.00% in 2008, 6.00% in 2009 and 5.00% for 2010 thereafter.
As of September 30, 2003, the Company assumed health care cost trend rates
for its postretirement benefit plans were 10.50% for 2004, 9.50% for 2005,
8.00% for 2006, 7.00% for 2007, 6.00% for 2008 and 5.00% for 2009 thereafter. As
of September 30, 2002, the Company assumed health care cost trend rates were
11.00% for 2003, 10.50% for 2004, 9.50% for 2005, 8.00% for 2006, 7.00% for
2007, 6.00% for 2008, and 5.00% for 2009 and thereafter.

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT
PLANS AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS (Continued)

Increasing the assumed health care cost trend rate by
one percentage point would increase the 2004 postretirement benefit obligation
by approximately $1.1 million and would increase the net postretirement
benefit cost by approximately $0.2 million. Decreasing the assumed health
care cost trend rate by one percentage point would decrease the 2004 postretirement
benefit obligation by approximately $1.0 million and would decrease the net
postretirement benefit cost by approximately $0.2 million.

The following benefit
payments are expected to be paid to current plan participants:

On February 1, 2000,
the Company adopted two defined contribution benefit plans that cover all
full-time salaried employees and certain hourly employees at several of the
Company’s facilities. Employees can make voluntary contributions in accordance
with the provisions of their respective plan. The Company expensed
$7.4 million, $7.0 million and $6.9 million for employer
contributions during the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.

DEBT
(Continued)

On July 7, 2003, PCA repaid all borrowings under
its then-existing senior secured credit facility. This facility was replaced
with a
senior unsecured credit facility that provides for a $100.0 million revolving
credit facility, including a $35.0 million subfacility for letters of credit,
and a $50.0
million term loan. The
senior credit facility closed on July 21, 2003, and it expires in 2008.

On July 21, 2003, PCA closed its offering and
private placement of $150.0 million of 4

senior notes and $400.0 million of 5

% ten-year
senior notes. On July 22, 2003, PCA used the net proceeds from the
offering, together with the borrowings under the
senior credit facility and cash on hand, to repurchase $546.4 million, or
99.3%, of its then outstanding


¤


%
senior subordinated notes. As a result of these transactions, PCA recorded a
one-time charge of approximately $76.6 million ($46.7 million after-tax) in the
third quarter of 2003.
The $76.6 million charge includes the tender offer premium of $55.9 million and
a $17.4 million non-cash charge for the write-off of deferred financing fees
due to the early extinguishment of debt, both included in interest expense, and
fees and expenses of $3.3 million, included in corporate overhead. The
remaining senior subordinated notes were repurchased
on April 1, 2004 at a premium of $0.2
million.

The
instruments governing PCA’s indebtedness contain covenants that limit the
ability of PCA and its subsidiaries to enter into sale and leaseback
transactions, incur liens, enter into certain transactions with affiliates, merge or consolidate with any
other person or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the
assets of the Company. They also require PCA to comply with certain financial
covenants, including the ratio of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization (EBITDA) to interest expense, the ratio of debt to total
capitalization, and minimum net worth levels. A failure to comply with these restrictions
could lead to an event of default, which could result in an acceleration of
such indebtedness. At December 31, 2004,
the Company was in compliance with these covenants.

Additional
information regarding PCA’s variable rate debt is shown below:

As of December 31, 2004, annual principal maturities for debt during the
next five years are: $109.2 million (2005), $9.0 million (2006),
$10.0 million (2007), $170.1 million (2008), $0.0 million
(2009), and $400.0 million (2010 and thereafter).

Interest payments in connection with the Company’s
debt obligations for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002
amounted to $34.2 million, $104.5 million, and $66.0 million,
respectively. Included in the $104.5 million in interest paid for 2003 is
the tender offer premium of $55.9 million paid in connection with the July 2003
tender offer.

DEBT (Continued)

On November 29, 2000, the Company established an
on-balance sheet securitization program for its trade accounts receivable. To
effectuate this program, the Company formed a wholly owned limited purpose
subsidiary, Packaging Credit Company, LLC (“PCC”), which in turn formed a
wholly owned, bankruptcy-remote, special-purpose subsidiary, Packaging
Receivables Company, LLC (“PRC”), for the purpose of acquiring receivables from
PCC. Both of these entities are included in the consolidated financial
statements of the Company. Under this program, PCC purchases on an ongoing
basis substantially all of the receivables of the Company and sells such
receivables to PRC. PRC and lenders established a $150.0 million
receivables-backed revolving credit facility (“Receivables Credit Facility”)
through which PRC obtains funds to purchase receivables from PCC. The
receivables purchased by PRC are and will be solely the property of PRC. In the
event of liquidation of PRC, the creditors of PRC would be entitled to satisfy
their claims from PRC’s assets prior to any distribution to PCC or the Company.
Credit available under the receivables credit facility is on a borrowing-base
formula. As a result, the full amount of the facility may not be available at
all times. At December 31, 2004, $109.0 million was outstanding and
$41.0 million was available for additional borrowing under the receivables
credit facility. The highest outstanding principal balance under the
receivables credit facility during fiscal 2004 was $109.0 million. On October 10,
2003, PCA renewed the receivables credit facility for an additional three-year
term, expiring
on October 10, 2006.

SHAREHOLDERS’
EQUITY

In June 1999, PCA entered into management equity
agreements with 125 of its management-level employees. Under these agreements,
PCA Holdings, LLC and Pactiv Corporation sold 3,132,800 shares of common stock
to 113 of these employees at $4.55 per share. The management equity agreements
also provide for the grant of options (see Note 2).

On May 16, 2001, the Company announced a
$100.0 million common stock repurchase program. PCA may continue to
repurchase shares from time to time. Through December 31, 2003, the
Company repurchased 5,195,600 shares of common stock for $88.8 million.
All repurchased shares were retired prior to December 31, 2003

.

No shares of common stock were
repurchased in 2004.

On October 13, 2003,
PCA announced that it would begin paying a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per
share, or $0.60 per share annually, on its common stock. The first quarterly
dividend of $0.15 per share was paid on January 15, 2004 to shareholders
of record as of December 15, 2003.

On
January 19, 2005, PCA announced an increase in its quarterly cash dividend
to $0.25 per share, or $1.00 per share annually, on its common stock. The first
quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share will be payable to shareholders of record
as of March 15, 2005 with a payment date of April 15, 2005.

Litigation

On May 14, 1999, PCA was named as a defendant in
two Consolidated Class Action Complaints which alleged a civil violation
of Section 1 of the Sherman Act. The suits, then captioned

Winoff Industries, Inc. v. Stone Container Corporation

,
MDL No. 1261 (E.D. Pa.) and

General Refractories Co.
v. Gaylord Container Corporation

, MDL No. 1261 (E.D. Pa.), name
PCA as a defendant based solely on the allegation that PCA is successor to the
interests of Tenneco Packaging Inc. and Tenneco Inc., both of which were also
named as defendants in the suits, along with nine other linerboard and
corrugated sheet manufacturers. The complaints allege that the defendants,
during the period October 1, 1993 through November 30, 1995,
conspired to limit the supply of linerboard, and that the purpose and effect of
the alleged conspiracy was to artificially increase prices of corrugated
containers and corrugated sheets, respectively. On November 3, 2003,
Pactiv (formerly known as Tenneco Packaging), Tenneco and PCA entered into an
agreement to settle the class action lawsuits. The settlement agreement
provides for a full release of all claims against PCA as a result of the class
action lawsuits and was approved by the Court in an opinion issued on April 21,
2004. Approximately 160 plaintiffs opted out of the class and together filed
about ten direct action complaints in various federal courts across the
country. All of the opt-out complaints make allegations against the defendants,
including PCA, substantially similar to those made in the class actions. The
settlement agreement does not cover these direct action cases. These actions
have all been consolidated as

MDL 1261 (E.D. Pa.) for pretrial purposes. Fact discovery is proceeding and is
currently set to close June 30, 2005. As of the date of this filing, we believe
it is not reasonably possible that the outcome of this litigation will have a
material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash
flows.

PCA is also party to
various legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. These legal
actions cover a broad variety of claims spanning our entire business. As of the
date of this filing, we believe it is not reasonably possible that the
resolution of these legal actions will, individually or in the aggregate, have
a material adverse effect on our financial position, or results of operations
or cash flows.

Environmental Liabilities

In April 1998, the United States Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) finalized a new Clean Air and Water Act commonly
referred to as the Cluster Rules, which govern all pulp and paper mill
operations, including those at our mills. The Cluster Rules affect our
allowable discharges of air and water pollutants. PCA and its competitors are required
to incur costs to ensure compliance with these new rules. From 1997 through
2004, we spent approximately $34.5 million on Cluster Rule compliance
to meet Clean Air Act requirements. Total capital costs for environmental
matters, including Cluster Rule compliance, were $9.3 million for
2004. We currently estimate 2005 environmental capital expenditures will be
$14.1 million

,

of which $3.0 million of
the expenditures are to meet Cluster Rule requirements. Our current
spending projections to complete all Cluster Rule compliance requirements
at our four mills is about $4.8 million, which will be spent between 2005
and 2007.

The potential costs for various environmental matters
are uncertain due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible cleanup
costs, the complexity and evolving nature of governmental laws and regulations
and their interpretations, and the timing, varying costs and effectiveness of
alternative

cleanup technologies. From
January 1994 through December 2004, remediation costs at our mills
and corrugated plants totaled about $3.1 million. As of December 31,
2004, we maintained an environmental reserve of $5.7 million, which
includes funds relating to onsite landfills and surface impoundments as well as
on-going and anticipated remedial projects. Liabilities recorded for
environmental contingencies are estimates of the probable costs based upon
available information and assumptions. Because of these uncertainties, however,
PCA’s estimates may change. As of this filing, we believe that it is not
reasonably possible that future environmental expenditures above the $5.7
million accrued as of December 31, 2004 will have a material impact on our
financial condition and results of operations.

In connection with the
sale to PCA of the containerboard and corrugated products business of Pactiv
Corporation, Pactiv agreed to retain all liability for all former facilities
and all sites associated with pre-closing offsite waste disposal and all
environmental liability for a closed landfill located near the Filer City mill.

RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

PCA owns a 31


¤


% interest in Southern Timber
Venture, LLC (“STV”). At December 31, 2004, PCA had not guaranteed the
debt of STV and has no future funding requirements. The Company’s investment
recorded on its balance sheet at December 31, 2004 is zero. In March 2002,
PCA received a $2.3 million dividend, in October 2003, PCA received a $1.2
million dividend and
in December 2004, PCA received a $29.3 dividend ($27.8 million net of
direct  expenses)
from STV.

PCA purchases pulpwood from STV in accordance with the
terms of a fiber supply agreement between the two companies which expires December 31,
2017. The price of pulpwood in this agreement is based upon the fair market
value of pulpwood and is adjusted annually for any
changes in market value.
PCA purchased $22.6 million, $19.3 million and $19.8 million of
pulpwood for its Counce, Tennessee and Valdosta, Georgia mills from STV during

QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA (UNAUDITED)

Note: The sum of the quarters
may not equal the total of the respective year’s earnings per share on either a
basic or diluted basis due to changes in the weighted average shares
outstanding throughout the year.

Adjusted amounts in 2004 are the result of an error which resulted in an
understatement of the intercompany profit reserve for products held in
inventory that was discovered after the Form 10-Q for the third
quarter of 2004 was filed.

For the three months ended December 31, 2004, net
income included a $16.9 million (or $0.16
per share) dividend payment net of taxes and expenses from
Southern Timber Venture, a timberlands joint venture in which PCA owns a 31


¤


% interest. The dividend resulted from STV’s
sale of a portion of their timberland holdings.

For the three
months ended December 31, 2003, net income was reduced by $9.8 million or
$0.09 per share due to the settlement with Pactiv Corporation of several
benefit cost related matters dating back to April 12, 1999 when PCA became
a stand-alone company.

For the three months ended September 30, 2003,
net income was reduced by $46.7 million after tax, or $0.44 per basic and
diluted share, due to PCA’s debt refinancing.
