BUSINESS

General

Packaging Corporation of America (we, us, our, “PCA”
    or the “Company”) is the fifth largest producer of
    containerboard and corrugated products in the United States in
    terms of production capacity. During 2008, we produced
    approximately 2.35 million tons of containerboard at our
    mills, of which about 80% was consumed in PCA’s corrugated
    products manufacturing plants, 11% was sold to domestic
    customers and 9% was sold in the export market. Our corrugated
    products manufacturing plants sold about 30.3 billion
    square feet (BSF) of corrugated products. Our net sales to third
    parties totaled $2.4 billion in 2008.

In 2008, we produced 1.44 million tons of kraft linerboard
    at our mills in Counce, Tennessee and Valdosta, Georgia, and
    0.91 million tons of semi-chemical corrugating medium at
    our mills in Tomahawk, Wisconsin and Filer City, Michigan. We
    currently lease the cutting rights to approximately
    91,000 acres of timberland located near our Counce and
    Valdosta mills. We also have supply agreements with third
    parties on approximately 359,000 acres of timberland.

Our corrugated products manufacturing plants produce a wide
    variety of corrugated packaging products, including conventional
    shipping containers used to protect and transport manufactured
    goods, multi-color boxes and displays with strong visual appeal
    that help to merchandise the packaged product in retail
    locations. In addition, we are a large producer of meat boxes
    and wax-coated boxes for the agricultural industry.

Industry
    Overview

According to the Fibre Box Association, the value of industry
    shipments of corrugated products was $26 billion in 2008.

Corrugated products plants tend to be located in close proximity
    to customers to minimize freight costs. The U.S. corrugated
    products industry consists of approximately 630 companies
    and 1,350 plants.

Containerboard, which includes both linerboard and corrugating
    medium, is the principal raw material used to manufacture
    corrugated products. Linerboard is used as the inner and outer
    facings, or liners, of corrugated products. Corrugating medium
    is fluted and laminated to linerboard in corrugator plants to
    produce



corrugated sheets. The sheets are subsequently printed, cut,
    folded and glued in corrugator plants or sheet plants to produce
    corrugated products.

Containerboard may be manufactured from both softwood and
    hardwood fibers, as well as from recycled fibers from used
    corrugated and waste from converting operations. Kraft
    linerboard is made predominantly from softwoods like pine.
    Semi-chemical corrugating medium is made from hardwoods such as
    oak. The finished paper product is wound into large rolls, which
    are slit to size as required and shipped to converters.

PCA
    Operations and Products

Our two linerboard mills can manufacture a broad range of
    linerboard grades ranging from 26 lb. to 96 lb. Our two
    semi-chemical corrugating medium mills can manufacture grades
    ranging in weight from 20 lb. to 47 lb. Mill capacities
    described below are estimated based on expected mix of paper
    basis weights. All four of our mills have completed an extensive
    independent review process to become ISO 9002 certified. ISO
    9002 is an international quality certification that verifies a
    facility maintains and follows stringent procedures for
    manufacturing, sales and customer service.

The following four paragraphs describe our containerboard
    mills’ annual practical maximum capacity, 2008 actual
    production and production capabilities.

Counce.

Our Counce, Tennessee mill is one of
    the largest kraft linerboard mills in the United States. Its
    estimated production capacity, as reported to the American
    Forest and Paper Association (“AF&PA”), is
    approximately 1,007,000 tons per year. In 2008, we produced
    970,000 tons of kraft linerboard on two paper machines at
    Counce. The mill produces a broad range of basis weights from 26
    lb. to 90 lb. The mill also produces a variety of performance
    and specialty grades of linerboard.

Valdosta.

Our Valdosta, Georgia mill is a
    kraft linerboard mill that has an estimated production capacity
    of approximately 474,000 tons per year, as reported to the
    AF&PA. In 2008, our single paper machine at Valdosta
    produced 474,000 tons of kraft linerboard. Valdosta produces
    linerboard ranging from 35 lb. to 96 lb.

Tomahawk.

Our Tomahawk, Wisconsin mill is one
    of the largest semi-chemical corrugating medium mills in the
    United States with an estimated production capacity of 581,000
    tons per year on three paper machines, as reported to the
    AF&PA. In April 2005, we completed the indefinite closure
    of our number three paper machine at Tomahawk and currently
    operate the remaining two paper machines which have a combined
    production capacity of 516,000 tons. In 2008, we produced
    502,000 tons of semi-chemical corrugating medium on two paper
    machines at Tomahawk. One of the two paper machines we operate
    is among the largest corrugating medium machines in the world.
    The Tomahawk mill produces a broad range of basis weights from
    23 lb. to 47 lb. and a variety of performance and specialty
    grades of corrugating medium.

Filer City.

Our Filer City, Michigan mill is a
    semi-chemical corrugating medium mill with an estimated
    production capacity of 413,000 tons on three paper machines, as
    reported to the AF&PA. In 2008, we produced 407,000 tons of
    corrugating medium at Filer City. Filer City produces
    corrugating medium grades ranging in basis weight from 20 lb. to
    47 lb.

We operate 67 corrugated manufacturing operations, a technical
    and development center, five regional graphic design centers, a
    rotogravure printing operation and a complement of packaging
    supplies and distribution centers. Of the 67 manufacturing
    facilities, 40 operate as combining operations, commonly called
    corrugated plants, that manufacture corrugated sheets and
    finished corrugated containers. The remaining 27 manufacturing
    facilities, commonly called sheet plants, purchase combined
    sheets primarily produced at PCA’s combining operations and
    manufacture finished corrugated containers.

We have corrugated manufacturing operations in 26 states in
    the U.S., with no manufacturing facilities outside of the
    continental U.S. Each corrugated plant, for the most part,
    serves a market radius that typically averages 150 miles.
    Our sheet plants are generally located in close proximity to our
    larger corrugated plants, which enables us to offer additional
    services and converting capabilities such as small volume and
    quick turnaround items.



We produce a wide variety of products ranging from basic
    corrugated shipping containers to specialized packaging such as
    wax-coated boxes for the agriculture industry. We also have
    multi-color printing capabilities to make high-impact graphics
    boxes and displays that offer customers more attractive
    packaging.

Timberland

We currently lease the cutting rights to approximately
    91,000 acres of timberland located near our Counce and
    Valdosta mills. Virtually all of the acres under cutting rights
    agreements are located within 100 miles of these two mills,
    which results in lower wood transportation costs and provides a
    secure source of wood fiber. These leased cutting rights
    agreements have terms with over 15 years remaining, on
    average.

During 1999 and 2000, PCA sold approximately 800,000 acres
    of timberland. We currently have in place supply agreements
    covering approximately 359,000 of the 800,000 acres sold.
    The majority of the acreage under supply agreement is located in
    close proximity to our Counce mill. We currently hold an
    approximate 29% equity ownership interest in approximately
    51,000 acres owned by Southern Timber Venture, LLC (STV).
    This acreage is located primarily in southern Georgia and
    northern Florida, near our Valdosta, Georgia mill, and includes
    both timberlands and higher beneficial use properties.

In addition to the timberland we manage ourselves, our Forest
    Management Assistance Program provides professional forestry
    assistance to private timberland owners to improve harvest
    yields and to optimize their harvest schedule. We have managed
    the regeneration of approximately 125,000 acres by
    supplying pine seedlings. In exchange for our expertise, we are
    given the right of first refusal over timber sales from those
    lands. These private lands include over 145,000 acres of
    timberland. We expect to harvest approximately 80,000 cords of
    wood from these forests annually.

PCA also participates in the Sustainable Forestry Initiative.
    This initiative is aimed at ensuring the long-term health and
    conservation of America’s forestry resources. Activities
    include limiting tree harvest sizes, replanting harvest acreage,
    participating in flora and fauna research and protecting water
    streams.

Solid
    Wood Facilities

We own and operate one sawmill located in Ackerman, Mississippi.
    During 2008, the Ackerman sawmill sold 51 million board
    feet of lumber used in the building products and furniture
    industries. We also have an air-dry yard operation in
    Burnsville, Mississippi that holds newly cut lumber while it
    dries.

Sales and
    Marketing

Our corrugated products are sold through a direct sales and
    marketing organization. We have sales representatives and a
    sales manager at each corrugated manufacturing operation who
    serve local and regional accounts. We also have corporate
    account managers who serve large national accounts at multiple
    customer locations. Additionally, our graphic design centers
    maintain an

on-site

dedicated graphics sales force. In addition to direct sales and
    marketing personnel, we utilize new product development
    engineers and product graphics and design specialists. These
    individuals are located at both the corrugated plants and the
    graphic design centers. General marketing support is located at
    our corporate headquarters.

Our containerboard sales group is responsible for the sale of
    linerboard and corrugating medium to our corrugated plants, to
    other domestic customers and to the export market. This group
    handles order processing for all shipments of containerboard
    from our mills to our corrugated plants. These personnel also
    coordinate and execute all containerboard trade agreements with
    other containerboard manufacturers.

Distribution

Our corrugated products are usually delivered by truck due to
    our large number of customers and their demand for timely
    service. Shipping costs represent a relatively high percentage
    of our total costs due to the high bulk of corrugated products.
    As a result, our converting operations typically service
    customers within a 150 miles radius.



Containerboard produced in our mills is shipped by rail or
    truck. Rail shipments represent about 55% to 60% of the tons
    shipped and the remaining 40% to 45% is comprised of truck
    shipments. Our individual mills do not own or maintain outside
    warehousing facilities. We use third-party warehouses for
    short-term storage.

Customers

PCA’s corrugated products group sells to over 9,600
    customers in over 17,500 locations. About two-thirds of our
    corrugated products customers are regional and local accounts,
    which are broadly diversified across industries and geographic
    locations. The remaining one-third of our customer base consists
    primarily of national accounts, or those customers with a
    national presence. These customers typically purchase corrugated
    products from several of our box plants throughout the United
    States.

Major Raw
    Materials Used

Fiber supply.

Fiber is the single largest cost
    in the manufacture of containerboard. PCA consumes both wood
    fiber and recycled fiber in its containerboard mills. We have no
    100% recycled mills, or those mills whose fiber consumption
    consists solely of recycled fiber. To reduce our fiber costs, we
    have invested in processes and equipment to ensure a high degree
    of fiber flexibility. Our mills have the capability to shift a
    portion of their fiber consumption between softwood, hardwood
    and recycled sources. All of our mills, other than our Valdosta
    mill, can utilize some recycled fiber in their containerboard
    production. Our ability to use various types of virgin and
    recycled fiber helps mitigate the impact of changes in the
    prices of various fibers. Our corrugated manufacturing
    operations generate recycled fiber as a by-product from the
    manufacturing process, which is sold to our mills directly or
    through trade agreements. During 2008, our containerboard mills
    consumed approximately 590,000 tons of recycled fiber, and our
    corrugated converting operations generated approximately 195,000
    tons of recycled fiber. As a result, PCA was a net recycled
    fiber buyer of 395,000 tons, or 17% of PCA’s total fiber
    requirements.

Energy supply.

Energy at the mills is obtained
    through purchased electricity or through various fuels, which
    are converted to steam or electricity

on-site.

Fuel sources include coal, natural gas, oil, internally produced
    and purchased bark and by-products of the containerboard
    manufacturing and pulping process. These fuels are burned in
    boilers to produce steam. Steam turbine generators are used to
    produce electricity. To reduce our mill energy cost, we have
    invested in processes and equipment to ensure a high level of
    purchased fuel flexibility. In recent history, natural gas and
    fuel oil have exhibited higher costs per thermal unit and more
    price volatility than coal and bark. During 2008,
    11.7 million MMBTU’s (million BTU’s), or
    approximately 75% of our mills’ purchased fuel needs, were
    from purchased bark and coal, historically our two lowest cost
    purchased fuels. For the same period, our mills consumed about
    2.5 million MMBTU’s of natural gas (16% of the
    mills’ total purchased fuels) and 1.0 million
    MMBTU’s of oil (7% of the mills’ total purchased
    fuels). Our two kraft linerboard mills at Counce and Valdosta
    generate more than two-thirds of their fuel requirements from
    their own by-products.

PCA’s corrugated plants each have a boiler that produces
    steam which is used by the corrugator. The majority of these
    boilers burn natural gas, although some also have the ability to
    burn fuel oil. During 2008, PCA’s corrugated products
    plants consumed approximately 2.0 million MMBTU’s of
    natural gas.

Approximately 40% of the electricity consumed by our four mills
    is generated

on-site.

Our
    mills purchase approximately 9,445,000 CkWh (hundred kilowatt
    hours) annually, or the equivalent of 3.2 million
    MMBTU’s. PCA’s corrugated products plants purchase
    about 2,290,000 CkWh annually, or the equivalent of
    0.8 million MMBTU’s.

Competition

According to industry sources, corrugated products are produced
    by about 630 U.S. companies operating approximately 1,350
    plants. Most corrugated products are manufactured to the
    customer’s specifications. Corrugated producers generally
    sell within a

150-mile

radius of their plants and compete with other corrugated
    producers in their local market. In fact, the Fibre Box
    Association tracks industry data by 47 distinct market regions.

The larger, multi-plant integrated companies may also solicit
    larger, multi-plant customers who purchase for all of their
    facilities on a consolidated basis. These customers are often
    referred to as national or corporate accounts.

Corrugated products businesses seek to differentiate themselves
    through pricing, quality, service, design and product
    innovation. We compete for both local and national account
    business and we compete against producers of other types of
    packaging products. On a national level, our competitors include
    International Paper Company, Koch Industries, Inc.,
    Smurfit-Stone Container Corporation and Temple-Inland Inc.
    However, with our strategic focus on local and regional
    accounts, we also compete with the smaller, independent
    converters.

Our principal competitors with respect to sales of our
    containerboard produced but not consumed at our own corrugated
    products plants are a number of large, diversified paper
    companies, including International Paper Company, Koch
    Industries, Inc., Smurfit-Stone Container Corporation and
    Temple-Inland Inc., as well as other regional manufacturers.
    Containerboard is generally considered a commodity-type product
    and can be purchased from numerous suppliers.

Employees

As of December 31, 2008, we had approximately
    8,100 employees. Approximately 2,400 of these employees
    were salaried and approximately 5,700 were hourly. Approximately
    75% of our hourly employees are represented by unions. The
    majority of our unionized employees are represented by the
    United Steel



Workers (USW), the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT)
    and the International Association of Machinists (IAM).

Based on an agreement reached with the USW in August 2008, the
    existing labor agreements at our containerboard mills covering
    USW-represented employees (91% of mill hourly workforce) were
    extended five years. With this extension, the USW contracts at
    our mills are currently set to expire between September 2013 and
    June 2015. Agreements with other union mill employees (9% of
    mill hourly workforce) expire between October 2009 and June
    2012. Contracts for unionized corrugated products plant
    employees expire between February 2009 and November 2014. We are
    currently in negotiations to renew or extend any union contracts
    that have recently expired or are expiring in the near future.

During 2008, we experienced no work stoppages and have
    experienced no instances of significant work stoppages in the
    five years prior to 2008. We believe we have satisfactory
    relations with our employees.

Environmental
    Matters

Compliance with environmental requirements is a significant
    factor in our business operations. We commit substantial
    resources to maintaining environmental compliance and managing
    environmental risk. We are subject to, and must comply with, a
    variety of federal, state and local environmental laws,
    particularly those relating to air and water quality, waste
    disposal and the cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater.
    The most significant of these laws affecting us are:

1. Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)

2. Clean Water Act (CWA)

3. Clean Air Act (CAA)

4. The Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know-Act
    (EPCRA)

5. Toxic Substance Control Act (TSCA)

6. Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA)

We believe that we are currently in material compliance with
    these and all applicable environmental rules and regulations.
    Because environmental regulations are constantly evolving, we
    have incurred, and will continue to incur, costs to maintain
    compliance with these and other environmental laws. For the year
    ended December 31, 2008, we spent approximately
    $23.5 million to comply with the requirements of these and
    other environmental laws. For the years ended December 31,
    2007 and 2006, the costs of environmental compliance were
    approximately $19.4 million and $17.5 million,
    respectively. We work diligently to anticipate and budget for
    the impact of applicable environmental regulations, and do not
    currently expect that future environmental compliance
    obligations will materially affect our business or financial
    condition.

In 1998, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
    finalized a Clean Air and Water Act commonly referred to as the
    Cluster Rule. The Cluster Rules govern allowable discharges of
    air and water pollutants at all pulp and paper mill operations.
    As a result, PCA and its competitors were required to incur
    costs to ensure compliance with these rules. We completed all of
    our projects related to Cluster Rule requirements in 2006 and,
    as a result, do not anticipate any further capital expenditures
    related to ensuring compliance with the Cluster Rules. From 1997
    through 2006, we spent approximately $39.2 million to
    ensure compliance with the Cluster Rule requirements. Total
    capital costs for environmental matters were $3.5 million
    for 2008. We currently estimate 2009 environmental capital
    expenditures will be $1.5 million.

As is the case with any industrial operation, we have in the
    past incurred costs associated with the remediation of soil or
    groundwater contamination. From 1994 through 2008, remediation
    costs at our mills and converting plants totaled approximately
    $3.2 million. We do not believe that any ongoing remedial
    projects are material in nature. As of December 31, 2008,
    we maintained an environmental reserve of $8.3 million,
    which includes funds relating to

on-site

landfill and surface impoundments as well as ongoing and
    anticipated remedial projects. Of the $8.3 million reserve,
    $4.2 million is reserved for our landfill



obligations, which are accounted for in accordance with
    SFAS No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement
    Obligations.” We believe these reserves are adequate.

We could also incur environmental liabilities as a result of
    claims by third parties for civil damages, including liability
    for personal injury or property damage, arising from releases of
    hazardous substances or contamination. We are not aware of any
    material claims of this type currently pending against us.

On April 12, 1999, Pactiv Corporation, formerly known as
    Tenneco Packaging Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Tenneco
    Inc., sold its containerboard and corrugated products business
    to PCA, an entity formed by Madison Dearborn Partners, LLC, a
    private equity investment firm. As a part of the April 12,
    1999 transaction, Pactiv agreed to retain all liability for all
    former facilities and all sites associated with pre-closing
    offsite waste disposal. Pactiv also retained environmental
    liability for a closed landfill located near the Filer City mill.

As of this filing, we believe that it is not reasonably possible
    that future environmental expenditures above the
    $8.3 million accrued as of December 31, 2008 will have
    a material impact on our financial condition and results of
    operations.

Item 1A.

RISK
    FACTORS

Some of the statements in this report and, in particular,
    statements found in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations, that are not
    historical in nature are forward-looking statements within the
    meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
    These statements are often identified by the words
    “will,” “should,” “anticipate,”
    “believe,” “expect,” “intend,”
    “estimate,” “hope,” or similar expressions.
    These statements reflect management’s current views with
    respect to future events and are subject to risks and
    uncertainties. There are important factors that could cause
    actual results to differ materially from those in
    forward-looking statements, many of which are beyond our
    control. These factors, risks and uncertainties include, but are
    not limited to, the factors described below.

Our actual results, performance or achievement could differ
    materially from those expressed in, or implied by, these
    forward-looking statements, and accordingly, we can give no
    assurances that any of the events anticipated by the
    forward-looking statements will transpire or occur, or if any of
    them do so, what impact they will have on our results of
    operations or financial condition. In view of these
    uncertainties, investors are cautioned not to place undue
    reliance on these forward-looking statements. We expressly
    disclaim any obligation to publicly revise any forward-looking
    statements that have been made to reflect the occurrence of
    events after the date hereof.



Industry
    Risks

Industry
    Earnings Cyclicality — Imbalances of supply and demand
    for containerboard could affect the price at which we can sell
    containerboard and corrugated products, and as a result, could
    result in lower selling prices and earnings.

The price of containerboard could fall if the supply of
    containerboard available for sale in the market exceeds the
    demand. The demand for containerboard is driven by market needs
    for containerboard in the United States and abroad to
    manufacture corrugated shipping containers. Market needs or
    demand are driven by both global and U.S. business
    conditions, which severely weakened during the fourth quarter of
    2008. If supply exceeds demand, prices for containerboard and
    corrugated products could decline, resulting in decreased
    earnings and cash generated from operations.

Competition —
    The intensity of competition in the containerboard and
    corrugated packaging industry could result in downward pressure
    on pricing and volume, which could lower earnings and cash
    generated from operations.

The containerboard and corrugated products industry is highly
    competitive, with no single containerboard or corrugated
    packaging producer having a dominant position. Containerboard
    cannot generally be differentiated by producer, which tends to
    intensify price competition. The corrugated packaging industry
    is also sensitive to changes in economic conditions, as well as
    other factors including innovation, design, quality and service.
    To the extent that one or more competitors are more successful
    with respect to any key competitive factor, our business could
    be adversely affected. Our products also compete, to some
    extent, with various other packaging materials, including
    products made of paper, plastics, wood and various types of
    metal. The intensity of competition could lead to a reduction in
    our market share as well as lower sales prices for our products,
    both of which could reduce our earnings and cash flow.

Company
    Risks

Cost
    of Fiber — An increase in the cost of fiber could
    increase our manufacturing costs and lower our
    earnings.

PCA has supply agreements at market prices for wood fiber to be
    consumed at three of our four mills on approximately
    359,000 acres of timberland. In addition to these supply
    agreements, PCA also secures wood fiber from various other
    sources at market prices.

PCA purchases recycled fiber for use at three of its four
    containerboard mills. PCA currently purchases, net of recycled
    fiber generated at its box plants, approximately 395,000 tons of
    recycled fiber per year.

The market price of wood fiber varies based upon availability
    and source. In addition, the increase in demand of products
    manufactured, in whole or in part, from recycled fiber, on a
    global basis, has caused an occasional tightening in the supply
    of recycled fiber. These periods of supply and demand imbalance
    have tended to create significant price volatility. Periods of
    above average fiber costs and unusual price volatility have
    occurred in the past and may occur again in the future, which
    could result in lower or volatile earnings.

Cost
    of Purchased Energy and Chemicals — An increase in the
    cost of purchased energy and chemicals could lead to higher
    manufacturing costs, resulting in reduced
    earnings.

PCA has the capability to use various types of purchased fuels
    in its manufacturing operations, including coal, bark, natural
    gas and oil. Energy prices, in particular prices for oil and
    natural gas, have fluctuated dramatically in the past and have
    risen substantially in recent years. In addition, costs for key
    chemicals used in our manufacturing have risen. These
    fluctuations impact our manufacturing costs and result in
    earnings volatility. If energy and chemical prices rise, our
    production costs will increase, which will lead to higher
    manufacturing costs and reduced earnings.



Material
    Disruption of Manufacturing — A material disruption at
    one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from
    meeting customer demand, reduce our sales and/or negatively
    impact our results of operation and financial
    condition.

Our business depends on continuous operation of our facilities,
    particularly at our mills. Any of our manufacturing facilities,
    or any of our machines within such facilities, could cease
    operations unexpectedly for a long period of time due to a
    number of events, including unscheduled maintenance outages;
    prolonged power failures; an equipment failure; explosion of a
    boiler; labor difficulties; natural catastrophes; terrorism;
    governmental regulations; and other operational problems. These
    events could lead to higher costs and reduced earnings.

Environmental
    Matters — PCA may incur significant environmental
    liabilities with respect to both past and future
    operations.

We are subject to, and must comply with, a variety of federal,
    state and local environmental laws, particularly those relating
    to air and water quality, waste disposal and the cleanup of
    contaminated soil and groundwater. Because environmental
    regulations are constantly evolving, we have incurred, and will
    continue to incur, costs to maintain compliance with those laws.
    See Item 1. “Business — Environmental
    Matters” for certain estimates of expenditures we expect to
    make for environmental compliance in the next few years.
    Although we have established reserves to provide for future
    environmental liability, these reserves may not be adequate. In
    addition, enactment of new environmental laws or regulations or
    changes in existing laws or regulations might require
    significant expenditures.

Investment
    Risks

Market
    Price of our Common Stock — The market price of our
    common stock may be volatile, which could cause the value of
    your investment to decline.

Securities markets worldwide have recently experienced
    significant price declines and volume fluctuations. This market
    volatility, as well as general economic, market or political
    conditions, could reduce the market price of our common stock in
    spite of our operating performance. In addition, our operating
    results could be below the expectations of public market
    analysts and investors, and in response, the market price of our
    common stock could decrease significantly.

General
    Risks

Economic
    Conditions —  Our earnings and cash generated from
    operations could be significantly lower as a result of the
    severe and possibly prolonged downturn in the U.S.
    economy.

Our operations and financial performance are directly impacted
    by changes in the U.S. economy, and to a lesser extent, by
    global economic conditions. The significant downturn in the
    U.S. economy during the fourth quarter of 2008
    significantly lowered the demand for our products. As a result,
    to balance the production of containerboard at our mills with
    demand, we reduced our fourth quarter mill production by 90,000
    tons and operated our mills at about 85% of capacity. This lower
    demand and production reduced our revenues, increased our unit
    production costs, and lowered our earnings and our cash
    generated from operations. It is uncertain if economic
    conditions will deteriorate further, or when economic conditions
    will improve. Until economic conditions improve, our operating
    and financial performance will continue to be adversely
    impacted. Lower earnings and reduced cash flow could impact our
    ability to fund operations, capital requirements, and common
    stock dividend payments, and a prolonged and severe downturn
    could possibly impact our ability to comply with our debt
    convenants.

*

*

In April, 2005, we shut down the number three paper machine at
    our Tomahawk mill after resuming operations on the number one
    paper machine at our Filer City mill. Shutting down the number
    three machine (out of 3 total paper machines) at Tomahawk
    reduces our total productive capacity by 65,000 tons at Tomahawk
    from 581,000 tons to 516,000 tons and reduces our total
    containerboard mill system capacity from 2,475,000 tons to
    2,410,000 tons. This action was based on market conditions and
    productivity and could change if market conditions or
    productivity levels change going forward.

We currently own our four containerboard mills and 44 of our
    corrugated manufacturing operations (37 corrugated plants and
    seven sheet plants). We also own one sawmill, an air-drying
    yard, one warehouse and miscellaneous other property, which
    includes sales offices and woodlands forest management offices.
    These sales offices and woodlands forest management offices
    generally have one to four employees and serve as administrative
    offices. PCA leases the space for three corrugated plants, 20
    sheet plants, five regional design centers, and numerous other
    distribution centers, warehouses and facilities. The equipment
    in these leased facilities is, in virtually all cases, owned by
    PCA, except for forklifts and other rolling stock which are
    generally leased.

We lease the cutting rights to approximately 91,000 acres
    of timberland located near our Valdosta mill (80,000 acres)
    and our Counce mill (11,000 acres). On average, these
    cutting rights agreements have terms with over 15 years
    remaining.

We currently lease space for our corporate headquarters in Lake
    Forest, Illinois. The lease for the Lake Forest, Illinois
    facility is a short term, facility use agreement lease with
    automatic renewal rights. Specifically, this lease is a
    continuous month-to-month lease with unlimited automatic
    renewals entitling either party the right to terminate the lease
    with at least 8 months notice.

We currently believe that our owned and leased space for
    facilities and properties are sufficient to meet our operating
    requirements for the foreseeable future.

Item 3.

LEGAL
    PROCEEDINGS

PCA is a party to various legal actions arising in the ordinary
    course of our business. These legal actions cover a broad
    variety of claims spanning our entire business. As of the date
    of this filing, we believe it is not reasonably possible that
    the resolution of these legal actions will, individually or in
    the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our financial
    condition, results of operations or cash flows.

MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
    OPERATIONS

The following discussion of historical results of operations and
    financial condition should be read in conjunction with the
    audited financial statements and the notes thereto which appear
    elsewhere in this report.

Overview

PCA is the fifth largest producer of containerboard and
    corrugated products in the United States, based on production
    capacity. We operate four containerboard mills and 67 corrugated
    products manufacturing plants throughout the United States.
    Approximately 80% of the containerboard tons produced at our
    mills are consumed in our corrugated products manufacturing
    plants. The remaining 20% is sold to domestic customers or the
    export market. We produce a wide variety of corrugated products
    ranging from basic corrugated shipping containers to specialized
    packaging such as wax-coated boxes for the agriculture industry.
    We also



have multi-color printing capabilities to make high-impact
    graphics boxes and displays that offer our customers more
    attractive packaging.

In analyzing our operating performance, we focus on the
    following factors that affect our business and are important to
    consider when reviewing our financial and operating results:

•

corrugated products demand;

•

corrugated products and containerboard pricing;

•

containerboard inventories; and

•

cost trends and volatility for our major costs, including wood
    and recycled fiber, purchased fuels, electricity, labor and
    fringe benefits and transportation costs.

The market for containerboard and corrugated products is
    generally subject to changes in the U.S. economy.
    Historically, supply and demand, as well as industry-wide
    inventory levels, have influenced prices of containerboard and
    corrugated products. In addition to U.S. shipments,
    approximately 10% of domestically produced containerboard has
    been exported for use in other countries.

The U.S. economy experienced a severe downturn in the
    fourth quarter of 2008 and, as a result, reported industry
    shipments of corrugated products decreased 10% for this period
    compared to 2007. During this same period, reported industry
    containerboard production levels decreased 14% from fourth
    quarter of 2007 levels. The total industry reported
    containerboard mill production for December was the lowest
    monthly production in over 15 years. As reported by
    industry publications, linerboard prices decreased $10 per ton
    and corrugating medium prices decreased $20 per ton in December
    2008, and additional price decreases of $10 per ton for both
    linerboard and corrugating medium were reported by industry
    publications in both January and February 2009. Average prices
    for linerboard and corrugating medium ended 2008 at $45 per ton
    and $35 per ton, respectively, higher than December 2007 levels,
    reflecting the July 2008 $55 per ton increase, partially offset
    by the December pricing decline.

The cost to manufacture containerboard is dependent, in large
    part, on the costs of wood fiber, recycled fiber, purchased
    fuels, electricity, labor and fringe benefits. While energy and
    other costs are significant in the manufacture of corrugated
    products, labor and fringe benefits make up the largest
    component of corrugated products’ manufactured costs
    besides the cost of containerboard.

Our costs for purchased fuels averaged approximately 30% higher
    for the full year 2008 compared to 2007, while transportation
    and electricity costs rose more modestly from prior year levels.
    Recycled fiber costs in 2008 were lower than in 2007 and at the
    end of 2008 were about 75% below year-end 2007 levels. Wood
    fiber costs in 2008 were higher than they were in 2007 and, at
    the end of 2008, about 5% higher than they were in December
    2007. Chemical costs were also higher during 2008 compared to
    2007; this was particularly significant in the second half of
    2008 and is expected to continue into at least the first part of
    2009.

For the year ended December 31, 2008, PCA’s earnings
    were negatively impacted by increased costs during the first
    three quarters and by the severe economic downturn in the fourth
    quarter. For the full year, 2008 earnings were approximately 20%
    below the record earnings level set in 2007, but still
    represented our second highest earnings for a fiscal year,
    excluding special items, since becoming a standalone company in
    April 1999. The reduction in earnings was primarily driven by
    decreased sales volume for both containerboard and corrugated
    products. Fourth quarter corrugated products sales volume was
    down 9.9% compared to the fourth quarter of 2007 and market
    related downtime and machine slowbacks reduced mill production
    by 90,000 tons. This downtime was the most downtime our mills
    have taken in a quarter since becoming a standalone company.
    Sales prices rose compared to 2007 with the implementation of
    the containerboard price increase in July 2008 and the
    corresponding corrugated products price increases. Partially
    offsetting the beneficial impact of the price increases were
    cost increases mentioned previously in energy, chemicals and
    wood fiber in addition to higher labor and fringe benefits
    costs, including medical costs.

In the first quarter 2009, our Valdosta mill will be down for
    its annual maintenance outage and in addition, market related
    downtime is likely. Energy usage will be higher with colder
    weather, and we also



expect higher chemical costs. Considering these items and with
    the current economic conditions and uncertainty, we expect our
    first quarter 2009 earnings to be lower than our earnings in the
    fourth quarter of 2008.

Net
    Sales

Net sales increased by $44.5 million, or 1.9%, for the year
    ended December 31, 2008 from the year ended
    December 31, 2007. Net sales increased primarily due to
    increased sales prices of corrugated products and containerboard
    ($111.0 million), partially offset by the impact of lower
    sales volume ($66.5 million).

Total corrugated products volume sold decreased 2.9% to
    30.3 billion square feet in 2008 compared to
    31.2 billion square feet in 2007. On a comparable

shipment-per-workday

basis, corrugated products sales volume decreased 3.3% in 2008
    from 2007.

Shipments-per-workday

is calculated by dividing our total corrugated products volume
    during the year by the number of workdays within the year. The
    larger percentage decrease on a

shipment-per-workday

basis was due to the fact that 2008 had one more workday
    (252 days), those days not falling on a weekend or holiday,
    than 2007 (251 days). Containerboard sales volume to
    external domestic and export customers decreased 11.7% to
    478,000 tons for the year ended December 31, 2008 from
    541,000 tons in 2007.

Income
    from Operations

Income from operations decreased by $51.7 million, or
    17.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to
    2007. The decrease in income from operations was primarily
    attributable to increased energy and energy related costs
    including transportation ($56.2 million), lower sales
    volume ($44.4 million), increased costs for wood fiber
    ($25.1 million), labor ($17.6 million), medical
    ($8.9 million), bad debts ($4.1 million), legal
    matters ($3.4 million),

start-up

costs of two major mill projects ($3.2 million) and fixed
    asset disposals ($3.1 million). The impact of higher costs
    and lower volume was partially offset by increased sales prices
    ($111.0 million) and lower recycled fiber costs
    ($3.6 million).

Gross profit decreased $33.3 million, or 6.3%, for the year
    ended December 31, 2008 from the year ended
    December 31, 2007. Gross profit as a percentage of net
    sales decreased from 22.7% of net sales in the year ended
    December 31, 2007 to 20.8% of net sales in the year ended
    December 31, 2008 primarily due to the cost increases and
    reduced sales volume described previously.

Selling and administrative expenses increased $3.8 million,
    or 2.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2008 from the year
    ended December 31, 2007. The increase was primarily the
    result of higher expenses related



to labor and fringe benefit costs ($1.5 million),
    warehousing costs due to customer requirements
    ($1.5 million) and travel, meeting and entertainment
    expenses ($0.5 million).

Corporate overhead for the year ended December 31, 2008
    increased $4.8 million, or 8.6%, from the year ended
    December 31, 2007. The increase was primarily attributable
    to increased salary and fringe benefit expenses
    ($4.5 million).

Other expense, net, increased $8.8 million, or 134.5% for
    the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended
    December 31, 2007. The increase was primarily due to higher
    legal related costs ($3.4 million), fixed asset disposal
    costs ($3.1 million), storm damage to our facilities
    ($1.0 million) and a gain on sale of land occurring in 2007
    ($0.8 million).

Interest
    Expense, Net and Income Taxes

Interest expense, net of interest income, increased by
    $6.1 million, or 23.8%, for the year ended
    December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended
    December 31, 2007, primarily as a result of lower interest
    income ($6.2 million) earned on PCA’s cash
    equivalents, partially offset by lower interest expense
    ($0.1 million) related to PCA’s outstanding debt
    balances. The $6.2 million decrease in interest income was
    due both to lower interest income rates and lower cash balances
    during 2008 compared to 2007. The $0.1 million decrease in
    interest expense was due to a $2.4 million decrease in
    interest expense related to the Company’s receivables
    credit facility due to lower interest rates and a
    $1.4 million decrease in term loan interest expense as a
    result of the repayment of the term loan in March 2008. This was
    almost completely offset by a $3.7 million increase in
    interest expense related to the issuance in March 2008 of
    PCA’s

PCA’s effective tax rate was 35.5% for the year ended
    December 31, 2008 and 36.5% for the year ended
    December 31, 2007. The effective tax rate varies from the
    U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35.0% principally due to
    the impact of state and local income taxes offset by the
    domestic manufacturers’ deduction. PCA had no material
    changes impacting FIN No. 48 in 2008.

    Sales

Net sales increased by $129.0 million, or 5.9%, for the
    year ended December 31, 2007 from the year ended
    December 31, 2006. Approximately $123.1 million of the
    increase resulted from higher sales prices and approximately
    $5.9 million of the increase resulted from higher sales
    volumes.

The increased sales prices resulted from the August 2007
    increase in containerboard prices and the realization of those
    price increases in our sales of corrugated products.



Total corrugated products volume sold decreased 0.3% to
    31.2 billion square feet in 2007 compared to
    31.3 billion square feet in 2006. On a comparable

shipment-per-workday

basis, corrugated products sales volume decreased 1.1% in 2007
    from 2006.

Shipments-per-workday

is calculated by dividing our total corrugated products volume
    during the year by the number of workdays within the year. The
    larger percentage decrease on a

shipment-per-workday

basis was due to the fact that 2007 had two more workdays
    (251 days), those days not falling on a weekend or holiday,
    than 2006 (249 days). Containerboard sales volume to
    external domestic and export customers increased 12.3% to
    541,000 tons for the year ended December 31, 2007 from
    482,000 tons in 2006.

Income
    from Operations

Income from operations increased by $67.6 million, or
    29.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the
    year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in income from
    operations was primarily attributable to higher sales prices and
    volume ($120.1 million), partially offset by increased
    costs for recycled fiber ($16.8 million), wage increases
    for hourly and salaried personnel ($16.8 million), medical,
    pension, benefit and incentive costs ($6.3 million),
    transportation costs ($5.4 million), wood fiber costs
    ($3.1 million) and the impact of a fourth quarter 2007
    unplanned outage at the Counce, Tennessee linerboard mill
    ($5.0 million, net of insurance recovery).

Gross profit increased $81.1 million, or 18.3%, for the
    year ended December 31, 2007 from the year ended
    December 31, 2006. Gross profit as a percentage of net
    sales increased from 20.3% of net sales in 2006 to 22.7% of net
    sales in the current year primarily due to the increased sales
    prices described previously.

Selling and administrative expenses increased
    $10.6 million, or 6.7%, for the year ended
    December 31, 2007 from the year ended December 31,
    2006. The increase was primarily the result of increased salary
    and incentive compensation expense ($6.3 million) and
    related fringe benefit costs ($1.7 million), increased
    travel and entertainment expenses ($1.1 million) and higher
    warehousing costs due to customer requirements
    ($0.8 million).

Corporate overhead for the year ended December 31, 2007,
    increased $4.4 million, or 8.7%, from the year ended
    December 31, 2006. The increase was primarily attributable
    to higher salary, incentive and related benefit expenses
    ($2.8 million) and increased information technology
    infrastructure costs ($1.2 million).

Other expense, net, decreased $0.5 million, or 5.5% for the
    year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended
    December 31, 2006. The decrease was primarily due to a
    $0.8 million gain on the sale of land in the third quarter
    and other individually insignificant items.

Interest
    Expense, Net and Income Taxes

Interest expense, net of interest income, decreased by
    $5.6 million, or 18.0%, for the year ended
    December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended
    December 31, 2006, primarily as a result of increased
    income earned on PCA’s cash equivalents due to higher cash
    balances.

PCA’s effective tax rate was 36.5% for the year ended
    December 31, 2007 and 35.8% for the year ended
    December 31, 2006. For both 2007 and 2006, tax rates were
    higher than the federal statutory rate of 35.0% due principally
    to state income taxes.

Operating
    Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities decreased
    $30.8 million, or 10.3% to $269.3 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended
    December 31, 2007. The decrease in net cash provided by
    operating activities was primarily the result of lower net
    income in 2008 of $34.5 million as previously described,
    partially offset by lower requirements for operating assets and
    liabilities of $1.5 million. During 2008, PCA’s cash
    taxes paid for both federal and state income taxes were
    $89.4 million, or 42.5% of book income before taxes of
    $210.1 million, compared to PCA’s effective tax rate
    of 35.5% in 2008.

The lower requirements for operating assets and liabilities were
    driven by favorable year over year changes in accounts
    receivable ($33.7 million) and inventories
    ($5.9 million) and lower 2008 pension contributions
    ($12.1 million), partially offset by unfavorable year over
    year changes in accounts payable ($43.9 million) and
    accrued liabilities ($10.5 million). The higher pension
    contributions in 2007 were driven in part by expected additional
    funding requirements beginning in 2008. Changes in balances of
    operating assets and liabilities reflected the ordinary course
    operation of PCA’s business during 2008. Requirements for
    operating assets and liabilities are subject to PCA’s
    operating needs, the timing of collection of receivables and the
    payments of payables and expenses, and to seasonal fluctuations
    in PCA’s operations. Working capital requirements were
    affected by the weak business conditions and significantly lower
    than expected demand for containerboard and corrugated products
    during the fourth quarter of 2008, resulting in a net increase
    in the requirements for accounts payable, accrued liabilities
    and accounts receivable of $32.6 million for the three
    months ended December 31, 2008 compared to the same period
    in 2007.

Net cash provided by operating activities increased
    $53.5 million, or 21.7%, to $300.1 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended
    December 31, 2006. The increase in net cash provided by
    operating activities was primarily the result of higher net
    income in 2007 as previously described and lower requirements
    for operating assets and liabilities of $3.5 million for
    the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the same
    period in 2006. During 2007, PCA’s cash taxes paid for both
    federal and state income taxes were $105.5 million, or
    39.4% of book income before taxes of $267.9 million,
    compared to PCA’s effective tax rate of 36.5% in 2007.

Requirements for operating assets and liabilities were lower by
    $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2007
    compared to the same period in 2006, primarily driven by
    favorable year-over-year changes in accounts receivable
    ($35.3 million) and accounts payable ($20.6 million),
    partially offset by unfavorable year-over-year changes in
    accrued liabilities ($32.6 million), inventories
    ($5.0 million) and higher 2007 pension contributions
    ($12.1 million).

Investing
    Activities

Net cash used for investing activities increased by
    $21.3 million, or 18.8%, to $134.5 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended
    December 31, 2007. The increase was primarily related to
    higher additions to property, plant and equipment of
    $19.5 million and higher additions to other long term
    assets of $1.4 million in the year ended December 31,
    2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007.



Net cash used for investing activities increased by
    $19.2 million, or 20.5%, to $113.2 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended
    December 31, 2006. The increase was primarily related to
    higher additions to property, plant and equipment of
    $25.2 million in 2007 compared to 2006, partially offset by
    the cost of acquisitions in 2006 of $4.3 million and lower
    additions to other long term assets of $2.4 million.

As of December 31, 2008, PCA had commitments for general
    purpose capital expenditures of $43.0 million for 2009. PCA
    believes cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund
    these commitments.

Financing
    Activities

Net cash used for financing activities totaled
    $213.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008,
    an increase of $92.9 million, or 77.0%, from the year ended
    December 31, 2007. The increase was primarily attributable
    to higher debt payments of $160.2 million, higher
    repurchases of PCA common stock of $35.1 million,
    $20.0 million in additional dividends paid on PCA’s
    common stock and lower proceeds from the issuance of common
    stock upon exercise of stock options of $21.9 million
    during 2008 compared to 2007, partially offset by
    $145.2 million in net proceeds received from PCA’s
    notes offering described below.

In connection with the senior notes offering in March of 2008,
    PCA received proceeds, net of discount, of $149.9 million
    and paid $4.4 million for settlement of a treasury lock
    that it entered into to protect against increases in the
    ten-year U.S. Treasury rate, which served as a reference in
    determining the interest rate applicable to the notes. PCA also
    incurred financing costs in the amount of $0.3 million in
    connection with the senior notes offering. PCA used the proceeds
    of this offering, together with cash on hand, to repay all of
    the $150.0 million of outstanding


/


% senior
    notes that were due on August 1, 2008.

Net cash used for financing activities totaled
    $120.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2007,
    an increase of $17.1 million, or 16.6%, from the year ended
    December 31, 2006. The increase was primarily attributable
    to $30.5 million in repurchases of PCA common stock in
    2007, partially offset by additional proceeds from the issuance
    of common stock upon exercise of stock options of
    $14.4 million during 2007 compared to 2006.

PCA holds an approximate 29% equity ownership interest in STV.
    PCA did not receive any dividends from STV in 2008, 2007 or 2006.

On November 29, 2000, PCA established an on-balance sheet
    securitization program for its trade accounts receivable. To
    effectuate this program, PCA formed a wholly-owned limited
    purpose subsidiary, Packaging Credit Company, LLC, or PCC, which
    in turn formed a wholly-owned, bankruptcy-remote,
    special-purpose subsidiary, Packaging Receivables Company, LLC,
    or PRC, for the purpose of acquiring receivables from PCC. Both
    of these entities are included in the consolidated financial
    statements of PCA. Under this program, PCC purchases on an
    ongoing basis substantially all of the receivables of PCA and
    sells such receivables to PRC. PRC and lenders established a
    $150.0 million receivables-backed revolving credit facility
    through which PRC obtains funds to purchase receivables from
    PCC. The receivables purchased by PRC are and will be solely the
    property of PRC. In the event of a liquidation of PRC, the
    creditors of PRC would be entitled to satisfy their claims from
    PRC’s assets prior to any distribution to PCC or PCA.
    Credit available under the receivables credit facility is on a
    borrowing-base formula. As a result, the full amount of the
    facility may not be available at all times. On
    September 19, 2008, PCA extended its receivables credit
    facility through September 18, 2009. As of
    December 31, 2008, $109.0 million was outstanding and
    $41.0 million was available for additional borrowing under
    the receivables credit facility. The highest outstanding
    principal balance under the receivables credit facility during

On March 31, 2008, PCA repaid all borrowings under its old
    senior credit facility. This facility was replaced with a senior
    credit facility that provides a new $150.0 million
    revolving credit facility, including a $35.0 million
    subfacility for letters of credit. The new senior credit
    facility closed on April 15, 2008. The new revolving credit
    facility is available to fund PCA’s working capital
    requirements, capital expenditures and other general corporate
    purposes. The new revolving credit facility will terminate in
    April 2013. As of December 31, 2008, PCA had
    $130.6 million in unused borrowing capacity under the
    senior credit facility, net of the impact on this borrowing
    capacity of $19.4 million of outstanding letters of credit.

    of December 31, 2008 that would require disclosure under
    SEC FR-67, “Disclosure in Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis About Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate
    Contractual Obligations.”

The above table excludes unamortized debt discount of
    $1.6 million at December 31, 2008 and interest
    payments on debt outstanding. Based on interest rates in effect
    and long-term debt balances outstanding as of December 31,
    2008, projected contractual interest payments would be
    approximately $36.0 million in 2009 and for each future
    year. For the purpose of this disclosure, PCA’s variable
    and fixed rate long-term debt would be replaced at maturity with
    similar long-term debt and similar interest rates. This
    disclosure does not attempt to predict changes in interest
    rates. See Item 7A. “Quantitative and Qualitative
    Disclosures About Market Risk” for the impact of changes in
    interest rates on PCA’s future cash flows.

The operating lease commitments, capital commitments, purchase
    commitments and letters of credit are not reflected on
    PCA’s consolidated balance sheet as of December 31,
    2008. See Notes 8 and 12 to the audited consolidated
    financial statements for additional information. PCA currently
    does not have any projections for future pension contributions
    beyond 2009.

As of December 31, 2008, the Company’s expected
    payment for significant contractual obligations excludes
    $10.4 million of obligations for unrecognized tax benefits
    because the Company cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate
    of the period of cash settlement for such liability. See
    Note 14 to the audited consolidated financial statements
    for additional information.

PCA’s primary sources of liquidity are net cash provided by
    operating activities, borrowings under PCA’s revolving
    credit facility and additional borrowings under PCA’s
    receivables credit facility. As of December 31, 2008, PCA
    had $171.6 million in unused borrowing capacity under its
    existing credit facilities, net of the



impact on this borrowing capacity of $19.4 million of
    outstanding letters of credit. Currently, PCA’s primary
    uses of cash are for capital expenditures, debt service and
    declared common stock dividends, which it expects to be able to
    fund from these sources.

The instruments governing PCA’s indebtedness contain
    financial and other covenants that limit, among other things,
    the ability of PCA and its subsidiaries to:

•

enter into sale and leaseback transactions,

•

incur liens,

•

incur indebtedness at the subsidiary level,

•

enter into certain transactions with affiliates, or

•

merge or consolidate with any other person or sell or otherwise
    dispose of all or substantially all of the assets of PCA.

These limitations could limit corporate and operating activities.

In addition, we must maintain minimum net worth and maximum debt
    to total capitalization and minimum interest coverage ratios
    under the revolving credit facility. A failure to comply with
    the restrictions contained in our revolving credit facility
    could lead to an event of default, which could result in an
    acceleration of any outstanding indebtedness

and/or

prohibit us from drawing on the revolving credit facility. Such
    a default may also constitute an event of default under the
    senior notes indentures and the receivables credit facility. At
    December 31, 2008, PCA was in compliance with these
    covenants.

PCA currently expects to incur capital expenditures of
    $90.0 million in 2009. These expenditures will be used
    primarily for maintenance capital, cost reduction, business
    growth and environmental compliance.

PCA believes that net cash generated from operating activities,
    available cash reserves and available borrowings under its
    committed credit facilities and available capital through access
    to capital markets will be adequate to meet its liquidity and
    capital requirements, including payments of any declared common
    stock dividends, for the foreseeable future. As its debt or
    credit facilities become due, PCA will need to repay, extend or
    replace such facilities, which will be subject to future
    economic conditions and financial, business and other factors,
    many of which are beyond PCA’s control.



Environmental
    Matters

We are subject to, and must comply with, a variety of federal,
    state and local environmental laws, particularly those relating
    to air and water quality, waste disposal and the cleanup of
    contaminated soil and groundwater. The most significant of these
    laws affecting us are:

•

Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA);

•

Clean Water Act (CWA);

•

Clean Air Act (CAA);

•

The Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know-Act (EPCRA);

•

Toxic Substance Control Act (TSCA); and

•

Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA).

We believe that we are currently in material compliance with
    these and all applicable environmental rules and regulations.
    Because environmental regulations are constantly evolving, we
    have incurred, and will continue to incur, costs to maintain
    compliance with these and other environmental laws. We work
    diligently to anticipate and budget for the impact of applicable
    environmental regulations, and do not currently expect that
    future environmental compliance obligations will materially
    affect our business or financial condition. For the year ended
    December 31, 2008, we spent approximately $23.5 million to
    comply with the requirements of these and other environmental
    laws. For the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, the
    costs of environmental compliance were approximately
    $19.4 million and $17.5 million, respectively.

In addition, the Cluster Rules govern allowable discharges of
    air and water pollutants at all pulp and paper mill operations,
    including those at the Counce, Filer City, Valdosta and Tomahawk
    mills. We have completed all of our projects to ensure
    compliance with the Cluster Rules and as of this filing, we
    believe that it is not reasonably possible that future
    expenditures related to Cluster Rule compliance will have a
    material impact on our financial condition and results of
    operations.

As is the case with any industrial operation, we have, in the
    past, incurred costs associated with the remediation of soil or
    groundwater contamination, as required by the federal
    Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability
    Act, commonly known as the federal “Superfund” law,
    and analogous state laws. Cleanup requirements arise with
    respect to properties we currently own or operate, former
    facilities and off-site facilities where we have disposed of
    hazardous substances. Under the terms of the contribution
    agreement, Pactiv has agreed to retain all liability for all
    former facilities and all sites associated with pre-closing
    off-site waste disposal. Pactiv has also retained
    environmentally impaired real property in Filer City, Michigan
    unrelated to current mill operations.

Because liability for remediation costs under environmental laws
    is strict, meaning that liability is imposed without fault,
    joint and several, meaning that liability is imposed on each
    party without regard to contribution, and retroactive, we could
    receive notifications of cleanup liability in the future and
    this liability could be material. From 1994 through 2008,
    remediation costs at our mills and corrugated plants totaled
    approximately $3.2 million. As of December 31, 2008,
    we maintained an environmental reserve of $8.3 million
    relating to

on-site

landfills and surface impoundments as well as ongoing and
    anticipated remedial projects. Total capital costs for
    environmental matters were $3.5 million for 2008 and we
    currently estimate 2009 environmental capital expenditures will
    be $1.5 million. As of this filing, we believe that it is
    not reasonably possible that future environmental expenditures
    above the $8.3 million accrued as of December 31, 2008
    will have a material impact on our financial condition, results
    of operations and cash flows.

Critical
    Accounting Policies

Management’s discussion and analysis of our financial
    condition and results of operations are based upon our
    consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in
    accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America. The preparation of these financial
    statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that
    affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and
    expenses,



and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On
    an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those
    related to bad debts, inventories, goodwill and intangible
    assets, pensions and other postretirement benefits, income
    taxes, environmental liabilities, stock based compensation, and
    contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on
    historical experience and on various other assumptions that are
    believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results
    of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying
    values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
    from other sources. Actual results may differ from these
    estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our
    more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation
    of our consolidated financial statements. For a further
    discussion on the application of these and other accounting
    policies, see Note 2 to our consolidated financial
    statements included elsewhere in this report.

Accounts
    Receivable — Allowance for Doubtful Accounts and
    Customer Deductions

We evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based
    upon a combination of factors. In circumstances where we are
    aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its
    financial obligations to us (e.g., bankruptcy filings,
    substantial downgrading of credit sources), we record a specific
    reserve for bad debts against amounts due to us to reduce the
    net recorded receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will
    be collected. For all other customers, we recognize reserves for
    bad debts consisting of 0.3% for amounts less than 90 days
    past due their contractual terms and 30% for amounts more than
    90 days past due their contractual terms based on our
    historical collection experience. If our collection experience
    deteriorates (i.e., higher than expected defaults or an
    unexpected material adverse change in a major customer’s
    ability to meet its financial obligations to us), our estimates
    of the recoverability of amounts due us could be reduced by a
    material amount.

The customer deductions reserve represents the estimated amount
    required for customer returns, allowances and earned discounts.
    Based on our experience, customer returns, allowances and earned
    discounts have averaged 1.0% of our gross selling price.
    Accordingly, we reserve 1.0% of our open customer accounts
    receivable balance for these items.

As of December 31, 2008, the balance in the allowance for
    doubtful accounts reserve was $4.4 million, compared to
    $2.9 million at December 31, 2007. Bad debt expense in
    2008 was $4.2 million, compared to $0.1 million in
    2007. The increase in bad debt expense of $4.1 million was
    primarily attributable to a $2.7 million increase in
    expense related to customers who had filed for bankruptcy and an
    increase of $1.1 million reserved for specific customers at
    the 90% level of their accounts receivable balance as of
    December 31, 2008. For the year ended December 31,
    2007, bad debt expense was $0.1 million compared to
    $3.2 million in 2006. The decrease of $3.1 million was
    primarily attributable to a $1.8 million decrease in
    expense related to customers who had filed for bankruptcy and a
    decrease of $0.9 million in connection with specific
    customers that were reserved for at the 90% level of their
    accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2007.

Inventories

We record our inventories at the lower of cost or market and
    include all costs directly associated with manufacturing
    products: materials, labor and manufacturing overhead. The
    estimated market value is based on assumptions for future demand
    and related pricing. If actual market conditions are less
    favorable than those projected by management, reductions in the
    carrying value of inventories may be required. Raw materials,
    work in process and finished goods valued using the

last-in,

first-out (“LIFO”) cost method comprised 64% of
    inventories at current cost at both December 31, 2008 and
    2007, respectively. Supplies and materials inventories are
    valued using a moving average cost.

Pension
    and Postretirement Benefits

The Company accounts for defined benefit pension plans and
    postretirement plans in accordance with SFAS No. 87,
    “Employers’ Accounting for Pensions,”
    SFAS No. 106, “Employers’ Accounting for



Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions” and
    SFAS No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for
    Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
    Plans — An Amendment of FASB Statements No. 87,
    88, 106 and 132(R).”

One of the principal assumptions used to calculate net periodic
    pension cost is the expected long-term rate of return on plan
    assets. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets may
    result in recognized returns that are greater or less than the
    actual returns on those plan assets in any given year. Over
    time, however, the expected long-term rate of return on plan
    assets is designed to approximate the actual long term returns.

The discount rate assumptions used to calculate net periodic
    pension and postretirement costs reflect the rates available on
    high-quality, fixed-income debt instruments on December 31.
    The rate of compensation increase is another significant
    assumption used to calculate net periodic pension cost and is
    determined by us based upon annual reviews.

For postretirement health care plan accounting, we review
    external data and our own historical trends for health care
    costs to determine the health care cost trend rate assumption.

Environmental
    Liabilities

PCA accounts for its retirement obligations related to its
    landfills under SFAS No. 143, “Accounting for
    Asset Retirement Obligations,” which requires legal
    obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets
    to be recognized at their fair value at the time that the
    obligations are incurred. Upon initial recognition of a
    liability, that cost is capitalized as part of the related
    long-lived asset and amortized to expense over the useful life
    of the asset.

The potential costs for various environmental matters are
    uncertain due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of
    possible cleanup costs, the complexity and evolving nature of
    governmental laws and regulations and their interpretations, and
    the timing, varying costs and effectiveness of alternative
    cleanup technologies. Liabilities recorded for environmental
    contingencies are estimates of the probable costs based upon
    available information and assumptions. Because of these
    uncertainties, however, our estimates may change. We believe
    that any additional costs identified as further information
    becomes available would not have a material effect on our
    financial statements.

In connection with the sale to PCA of the containerboard and
    corrugated products business of Pactiv Corporation in April
    1999, Pactiv agreed to retain all liability for all former
    facilities and all sites associated with off-site waste disposal
    prior to April 12, 1999. Pactiv also retained the
    environmental liability for a closed landfill located near the
    Filer City mill.

Revenue
    Recognition

PCA recognizes revenue as title to the products is transferred
    to customers. Shipping and handling costs are included in cost
    of sales. Shipping and handling billings to a customer are
    included in net sales. In addition, PCA offers volume rebates to
    certain of its customers. The total cost of these programs is
    estimated and accrued as a reduction to net sales at the time of
    the respective sale.

Impairment
    of Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets

Goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter
    or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that
    the carrying amount may exceed fair value. Recoverability of
    goodwill is determined by comparing the fair value of the
    reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill. If
    the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair
    value, the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s
    goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of its goodwill to
    determine if a write-down to fair value is necessary.

Long-lived assets other than goodwill are reviewed for
    impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
    that the carrying amount of any long-lived asset may not be
    fully recoverable. In the event that facts and circumstances
    indicate that the carrying amount of any long-lived assets may
    be impaired,



an evaluation of recoverability would be performed. If an
    evaluation were required, the estimated future undiscounted cash
    flows associated with the asset (or group of assets) would be
    compared to the asset’s (or group of assets’) carrying
    amount to determine if a write-down to fair value is required.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

PCA measures and records stock-based compensation cost in
    accordance with SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based
    Payment.” Stock compensation cost includes:
    (a) compensation cost for all share-based payments granted
    prior to, but not vested as of January 1, 2006, the
    effective date of SFAS No. 123(R), based on the grant
    date fair value estimated in accordance with the original
    provisions of SFAS No. 123, and (b) compensation
    cost for all share-based payments granted subsequent to
    January 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value
    estimated in accordance with the provisions of
    SFAS No. 123(R).

PCA recognizes compensation expense associated with option
    awards ratably over their vesting periods. The Company uses the
    Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model to estimate the fair
    value of each option grant as of the date of grant. Expected
    volatilities are based on historical volatility of the
    Company’s common stock. The expected life of the option is
    estimated using historical data pertaining to option exercises
    and employee terminations. Separate groups of employees that
    have similar historical exercise behavior are considered
    separately for estimating the expected life. The risk-free
    interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury yields in effect at
    the time of grant.

The fair value of restricted stock awards is determined based on
    the closing price of PCA’s common stock on the grant date.
    The Company generally recognizes compensation expense associated
    with restricted stock awards ratably over their vesting periods.
    As PCA’s Board of Directors has the ability to accelerate
    the vesting of restricted stock upon an employee’s
    retirement, the Company accelerates the recognition of
    compensation expense for certain employees approaching normal
    retirement age.

Income
    Taxes

PCA’s annual tax rate is determined based on income,
    statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated
    differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting
    purposes. Tax law requires some items to be included in the tax
    return at different times than the items reflected in the
    financial statements. As a result, the annual tax rate in the
    financial statements is different than the rate reported on
    PCA’s tax return. Some of these differences are permanent,
    such as expenses that are not deductible in the tax return, and
    some differences are temporary, reversing over time, such as
    depreciation expense. These temporary differences create
    deferred tax assets and liabilities.

Inherent in determining the annual tax rate are judgments
    regarding business plans, planning opportunities and
    expectations about future outcomes. Significant management
    judgments are required for the following items:

•

Management reviews PCA’s deferred tax assets for
    realizability. Valuation allowances are established when
    management believes that it is more likely than not that some
    portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Changes
    in valuation allowances from period to period are included in
    the tax provision.

•

PCA establishes accruals for uncertain tax contingencies when,
    despite the belief that PCA’s tax return positions are
    fully supported, PCA believes that an uncertain tax position
    does not meet the recognition threshold of FASB Interpretation
    (“FIN”) No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty
    in Income Taxes.” The tax contingency accruals are adjusted
    in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the
    progress of tax audits, the expiration of the statute of
    limitations for the relevant taxing authority to examine a tax
    return, case law and emerging legislation. While it is difficult
    to predict the final outcome or timing of resolution for any
    particular tax matter, PCA believes that the accruals for
    uncertain tax contingencies at December 31, 2008 reflect
    the likely outcome of known tax contingencies as of such date in
    accordance with FIN No. 48.



Item 7A.

QUANTITATIVE
    AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

PCA is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and
    changes in the market value of its financial instruments. PCA
    periodically enters into derivatives in order to minimize these
    risks, but not for trading purposes. On January 17, 2008,
    in connection with a contemplated issuance of ten-year debt
    securities in March 2008, PCA entered into an interest rate
    protection agreement with a counterparty to lock in the then
    current interest rate on ten-year U.S. Treasury notes to
    protect against increases in the ten-year U.S. Treasury
    note rate. This rate served as a reference in determining the
    interest rate applicable to the ten-year notes due 2018 issued
    in March 2008. As a result of a decrease in the interest rate on
    the ten-year U.S. Treasury notes between the date of the
    agreement and the time PCA priced its offering of those notes,
    PCA paid $4.4 million to the counterparty on March 25,
    2008, the date of settlement. As of December 31, 2008, PCA
    was not a party to any derivative instruments.

The interest rates on approximately 84% of PCA’s debt are
    fixed. A one percent increase in interest rates related to
    variable rate debt would have resulted in an increase in
    interest expense and a corresponding decrease in income before
    taxes of $1.1 million annually. In the event of a change in
    interest rates, management could take actions to mitigate its
    exposure to the change. However, due to the uncertainty of the
    specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects,
    the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in PCA’s
    financial structure.

    and Procedures

PCA maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in

of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that are designed
    to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be
    disclosed in PCA’s filings under the Securities Exchange
    Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
    periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that
    such information is accumulated and communicated to PCA’s
    management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions
    regarding required disclosure.

Prior to filing this report, PCA completed an evaluation under
    the supervision and with the participation of PCA’s
    management, including PCA’s Chief Executive Officer and
    Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and
    operation of PCA’s disclosure controls and procedures as of
    December 31, 2008. The evaluation of PCA’s disclosure
    controls and procedures included a review of the controls’
    objectives and design, PCA’s implementation of the controls
    and the effect of the controls on the information generated for
    use in this report. Based on this evaluation, PCA’s Chief
    Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that
    PCA’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at
    the reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2008.

During the quarter ended December 31, 2008, there were no
    changes in internal controls over financial reporting that have
    materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
    affect, PCA’s internal control over financial reporting.



Management’s
    Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

PCA’s management is responsible for establishing and
    maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting,
    as such term is defined in Exchange Act

Rule 13a-15(f).

Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed
    to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
    financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
    for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting
    includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to
    the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
    accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
    of the Company’s assets; (2) provide reasonable
    assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
    preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
    accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
    expenditures are being made only with proper authorizations; and
    (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
    timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
    disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a
    material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, PCA’s internal control
    over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
    misstatements. A control system, no matter how well conceived
    and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,
    assurance that objectives of the control system are met. Because
    of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no
    evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all
    control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been
    detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness
    to future periods are subject to the risk that controls become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.

PCA’s management, under the supervision of and with the
    participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer, assessed the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on
    criteria for effective control over financial reporting
    described in “Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this
    assessment, PCA’s management concluded that its internal
    control over financial reporting was effective as of
    December 31, 2008, based on the specified criteria.

Ernst & Young LLP, the independent registered public
    accounting firm that audited PCA’s financial statements
    included in this

Form 10-K,

has also audited the effectiveness of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting. Their attestation
    report precedes PCA’s audited financial statements included
    elsewhere in this report.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Packaging Corporation of America

Board of Directors and Stockholders

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Packaging Corporation of America (the “Company”) as of
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the related consolidated
    statements of income, changes in stockholders’ equity, and
    cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2008. Our audits also included the financial
    statement schedule listed in the index at Item 15(a). These
    financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the
    Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our
    audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of Packaging Corporation of America at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the consolidated results of
    its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in
    the period ended December 31, 2008, in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our
    opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
    considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken
    as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the
    information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 6 to the financial statements, the
    Company changed its method of accounting for pension and
    postretirement benefits effective December 31, 2008, and as
    discussed in Note 14 to the financial statements, the
    Company changed its method of accounting for uncertainty in
    income taxes effective January 1, 2007.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
    Packaging Corporation of America’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
    the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 16,
    2009 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Packaging Corporation of America

Board of Directors and Stockholders

We have audited Packaging Corporation of America’s internal
    control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008,
    based on criteria established in Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria).
    Packaging Corporation of America’s management is
    responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
    financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness
    of internal control over financial reporting included in
    Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
    company’s internal control over financial reporting based
    on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
    management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
    such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
    circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
    basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Packaging Corporation of America maintained, in
    all material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on the COSO
    criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of Packaging Corporation of America
    as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the related
    consolidated statements of income, changes in stockholders’
    equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
    ended December 31, 2008, and our report dated
    February 16, 2009, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Packaging
    Corporation of America

Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 31,

1.  BASIS
    OF PRESENTATION AND NATURE OF BUSINESS

Packaging Corporation of America (“PCA” or the
    “Company”) was incorporated on January 25, 1999.
    On April 12, 1999, PCA acquired the containerboard and
    corrugated packaging products business of Pactiv Corporation
    (“Pactiv”), formerly known as Tenneco Packaging Inc.,
    a wholly owned subsidiary of Tenneco Inc. PCA had no operations
    from the date of incorporation on January 25, 1999 to
    April 11, 1999.

The Company is comprised of mills and corrugated manufacturing
    operations. The mill operations (the “Mills”) consist
    of two kraft linerboard mills located in Counce, Tennessee, and
    Valdosta, Georgia, and two medium mills located in Filer City,
    Michigan, and Tomahawk, Wisconsin. The Company leased the
    cutting rights to approximately 91,000 acres of timberland
    as of December 31, 2008. The Mills transfer the majority of
    their containerboard produced to PCA’s corrugated products
    plants.

PCA’s corrugated manufacturing operations consist of 67
    plants, with 40 operating as combining operations, or corrugated
    plants, and 27 as sheet plants; a technical and development
    center; five graphic design centers; a rotogravure printing
    operation and a complement of packaging supplies and
    distribution centers. All plants are located in the continental
    United States. Corrugated plants combine linerboard and medium
    into sheets that are converted into corrugated shipping
    containers, point-of-sale graphics packaging, point-of-purchase
    displays and other specialized packaging. Sheet plants purchase
    sheets primarily from PCA corrugated products plants to use in
    the finished corrugated products converting process. The
    corrugated manufacturing operations sell to diverse customers
    primarily in North America.

As of December 31, 2008, PCA had approximately
    8,100 employees. Approximately 2,400 of these employees
    were salaried and approximately 5,700 were hourly. Approximately
    75% of its hourly employees are represented by unions. The
    majority of its unionized employees are represented primarily by
    the United Steel Workers (USW), the International Brotherhood of
    Teamsters (IBT), and the International Association of Machinists
    (IAM).

Based on an agreement reached with the USW in August 2008, the
    existing labor agreements at PCA’s containerboard mills
    covering USW represented employees (91% of mill hourly
    workforce) were extended five years. With this extension,
    the USW contracts at PCA’s mills are currently set to
    expire between September 2013 and June 2015. Agreements with
    other unions representing the remaining mill unionized employees
    (9% of mill hourly workforce) expire between October 2009 and
    June 2012. Contracts for unionized corrugated products plant
    employees expire between February 2009 and November 2014. The
    Company is currently in negotiations to renew or extend any
    union contracts that have recently expired or are expiring in
    the near future.

2.  SUMMARY
    OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis
    of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements of PCA
    include all majority-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany
    transactions have been eliminated. The Company has one joint
    venture that is accounted for under the equity method.

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires
    management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
    amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes.
    Actual results could differ from those estimates.

F-8


Packaging
    Corporation of America

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

December 31, 2008

Cash
    and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include all cash balances and highly
    liquid investments with a maturity, when acquired, of three
    months or less. Cash equivalents are stated at cost, which
    approximates market.

Accounts
    Receivable

The collectibility of PCA’s accounts receivable is based
    upon a combination of factors. In circumstances where a specific
    customer is unable to meet its financial obligations to PCA
    (e.g., bankruptcy filings, substantial downgrading of credit
    sources), a specific reserve for bad debts is recorded against
    amounts due to the Company to reduce the net recorded receivable
    to the amount the Company reasonably believes will be collected.
    For all other customers, reserves for bad debts are recognized
    consisting of 0.3% for amounts less than 90 days past due
    their contractual terms and 30% for amounts more than
    90 days past due their contractual terms based on
    historical collection experience. If collection experience
    deteriorates (i.e., higher than expected defaults or an
    unexpected material adverse change in a major customer’s
    ability to meet its financial obligations to us), the estimate
    of the recoverability of amounts due could be reduced by a
    material amount.

The customer deductions reserve represents the estimated amount
    required for customer returns, allowances and earned discounts.
    Based on the Company’s experience, customer returns,
    allowances and earned discounts have averaged 1.0% of gross
    selling price. Accordingly, PCA reserves 1.0% of its open
    customer accounts receivable balance for these items.

At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the allowance for doubtful
    accounts was $4.4 million and $2.9 million,
    respectively. Also offsetting the accounts receivable balance at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, were reserves for customer
    deductions of $2.5 million and $2.7 million,
    respectively.

Inventories

With the exception of inventories at PCA’s Chicago
    corrugated products plant, which was acquired in 2004, raw
    materials, work in process and finished goods are valued using
    the

last-in,

first-out (“LIFO”) cost method. Inventories at the
    Chicago plant are valued at the

first-in,

first-out (“FIFO”) cost method. Supplies and materials
    are valued using a moving average cost. All inventories are
    stated at the lower of cost or market and include all costs
    directly associated with manufacturing products: materials,
    labor and manufacturing overhead. Inventories valued using the
    LIFO method totaled $173.5 million and $162.6 million,
    respectively, as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, compared to
    total inventory values (before the LIFO inventory reserve) of
    $272.8 million and $255.1 million for the same
    respective periods.

The amount of interest capitalized related to construction in

Depreciation is computed on the straight-line basis over the
    estimated useful lives of the related assets. Assets under
    capital leases are depreciated on the straight-line method over
    the term of the lease or the useful life, if shorter. The
    following lives are used for the various categories of assets:

Buildings and land improvements

5 to 40 years

Machinery and equipment

3 to 25 years

Trucks and automobiles

3 to 10 years

Furniture and fixtures

3 to 20 years

Computers and hardware

3 to 7 years

Leasehold improvements

Period of the lease or

useful life, if shorter

The amount of depreciation expense was $143.3 million,
    $144.6 million and $150.0 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
    Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as
    incurred.

Goodwill
    and Intangible Assets

The Company has capitalized certain intangible assets, primarily
    customer lists and relationships, covenants not to compete and
    goodwill, based on their estimated fair value at the date of
    acquisition. Amortization is provided for customer lists and
    relationships on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from
    six to 40 years. Covenants not to compete are amortized on
    a straight-line basis over the terms of the respective
    agreements. Goodwill, which amounted to $37.2 million as of
    both December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, is not being
    amortized but is subject to annual impairment tests in
    accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    (“SFAS”) No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
    Intangible Assets.” The Company performs the impairment
    tests in the fourth quarter or sooner if events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed fair
    value. Recoverability of goodwill is determined by comparing the
    fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value,
    including goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit
    exceeds the fair value, the implied fair value of the reporting
    unit’s goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of its
    goodwill to determine if a write-down to fair value is
    necessary. The Company

    Corporation of America

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

December 31, 2008

concluded that no impairment of goodwill existed at the time of
    the annual impairment tests in 2008, 2007 and 2006.

Other
    Long-Term Assets

PCA has capitalized certain costs related to obtaining its
    financing. These costs are amortized to interest expense using
    the effective interest rate method over the terms of the senior
    credit facilities and senior notes, which range from five to ten
    years. Unamortized deferred financing costs were
    $2.4 million and $1.9 million as of December 31,
    2008 and 2007, respectively.

PCA leases the cutting rights to approximately 91,000 acres
    of timberland and capitalizes the annual lease payments and
    reforestation costs associated with these leases. These costs
    are recorded as depletion when timber is harvested and used in
    PCA’s business operations or sold to customers. Capitalized
    long-term lease costs were $22.1 million and
    $21.5 million as of December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. The amount of depletion expense was
    $1.4 million, $1.5 million and $2.2 million for
    the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively.

PCA capitalizes certain costs related to the purchase and
    development of software which is used in its business
    operations. The costs attributable to these software systems are
    amortized over their estimated useful lives based on various
    factors such as the effects of obsolescence, technology and
    other economic factors. Net capitalized software costs were
    $1.8 million and $0.9 million as of December 31,
    2008 and 2007, respectively. Software amortization expense was
    $0.3 million, $0.4 million and $1.1 million for
    the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively.

Impairment
    of Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived assets other than goodwill are reviewed for
    impairment in accordance with provisions of
    SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or
    Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” In the event that facts and
    circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any
    long-lived assets may be impaired, an evaluation of
    recoverability would be performed. If an evaluation is required,
    the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the
    asset (or group of assets) would be compared to the asset’s
    (or group of assets’) carrying amount to determine if a
    write-down to fair value is required. The Company concluded that
    no impairment of long-lived assets existed in 2008, 2007 and
    2006.

Pension
    and Postretirement Benefits

One of the principal assumptions used to calculate net periodic
    pension cost is the expected long-term rate of return on plan
    assets. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets may
    result in recognized returns that are greater or less than the
    actual returns on those plan assets in any given year. Over
    time, however, the expected long-term rate of return on plan
    assets is designed to approximate the actual long term returns.

The discount rate assumptions used to calculate net periodic
    pension and postretirement cost reflect the rates available on
    high-quality, fixed-income debt instruments on
    December 31

st

of

    each year. The rate of compensation increase is another
    significant assumption used to calculate net periodic pension
    cost and is determined by the Company based upon annual reviews.

For postretirement health care plan accounting, the Company
    reviews external data and its own historical trends for health
    care costs to determine the health care cost trend rate
    assumption.

Environmental
    Matters

Environmental expenditures related to existing conditions
    resulting from past or current operations from which no current
    or future benefit is discernible are expensed as incurred.
    Environmental expenditures that extend the life of the related
    property or mitigate or prevent future environmental
    contamination are capitalized. Liabilities are recorded for
    environmental contingencies when such costs are probable and
    reasonably estimable. These liabilities are adjusted as further
    information develops or circumstances change.

Asset
    Retirement Obligations

The Company accounts for its retirement obligations related to
    its landfills under SFAS No. 143, “Accounting for
    Asset Retirement Obligations,” which requires legal
    obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets
    to be recognized at their fair value at the time that the
    obligations are incurred. Upon initial recognition of a
    liability, that cost is capitalized as part of the related
    long-lived asset and amortized to expense over the useful life
    of the asset.

Income
    Taxes

PCA utilizes the liability method of accounting for income taxes
    whereby it recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for
    the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the
    tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts
    in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets will be reduced
    by a valuation allowance if, based upon management’s
    estimates, it is more likely than not, that a portion of the
    deferred tax assets will not be realized in a future period. The
    estimates utilized in the recognition of deferred tax assets are
    subject to revision in future periods based on new facts or
    circumstances.

PCA’s practice is to recognize interest and penalties
    related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense.

Planned
    Major Maintenance Activities

The Company accounts for its planned major maintenance
    activities in accordance with FSP No. AUG AIR-1,
    “Accounting for Planned Major Maintenance Activities,”
    using the deferral method. All maintenance costs incurred during
    the year are expensed in the fiscal year in which the
    maintenance activity occurs.

Revenue
    Recognition

The Company recognizes revenue as title to the products is
    transferred to customers. Shipping and handling billings to a
    customer are included in net sales. Shipping and handling costs
    are included in cost of sales. In addition, the Company offers
    volume rebates to certain of its customers. The total cost of
    these programs is estimated and accrued as a reduction to net
    sales at the time of the respective sale.

Research
    and Development

Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. The
    amount charged to expense was $6.9 million,
    $7.6 million and $6.9 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Interest
    Expense, Net

Interest expense, net, includes interest income of
    $5.2 million, $9.5 million and $4.8 million for
    the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively, and amortization of the net gain on treasury lock
    settlements in July 2003 and March 2008 of $2.4 million in
    2008 and $3.1 million in both 2007 and 2006.

Industry
    Agreements

PCA regularly trades containerboard with other manufacturers
    primarily to reduce shipping costs. Containerboard trade
    agreements are a long-standing industry practice. These
    agreements are entered into on an annual basis, in which both
    parties agree to ship an identical number of tons to each other
    within the agreement period. These agreements minimize
    transportation cost by allowing each party’s containerboard
    mills to ship containerboard to the other party’s closest
    corrugated products plant. PCA tracks each shipment to ensure
    that the other party’s shipments to the Company match its
    shipments to them during the agreement period. Such transfers
    are possible because containerboard is a commodity product with
    no distinguishing product characteristics. These transactions
    are accounted for at carrying value, and sales are not recorded
    as the transactions do not represent the culmination of an
    earnings process. The transactions are recorded into inventory
    accounts, and no income is recorded until such inventory is
    converted to a finished product and sold to an end-use customer.

Segment
    Information

PCA is engaged in one line of business: the integrated
    manufacture and sale of packaging materials, boxes and
    containers for industrial and consumer markets. No single
    customer accounts for more than 10% of total net sales.

Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities

The Company records its derivatives in accordance with
    SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities.” The Statement requires
    the Company to recognize derivative instruments as either assets
    or liabilities in the balance sheet at fair value. It further
    provides criteria for derivative instruments to be designated as
    fair value, cash flow or foreign currency hedges and establishes
    respective accounting standards for reporting changes in the
    fair value of the derivative instruments. The gains or losses
    resulting from adjusting the derivative instruments to fair
    value are recorded in net income or accumulated other
    comprehensive income (loss) (“OCI”), as appropriate.

The Company has historically used derivative instruments to
    manage interest costs and the risk associated with changing
    interest rates. The Company’s objectives for holding
    derivatives are to minimize the risks using the most effective
    methods to eliminate or reduce the impacts of these exposures.
    On June 12, 2003, in connection with a contemplated
    issuance of ten-year debt securities, PCA entered into an
    interest rate protection agreement with a counterparty to
    protect against increases in the ten-year U.S. Treasury
    Note rate. On January 17, 2008, in connection with a
    contemplated issuance of ten-year debt securities, PCA entered
    into an interest rate protection agreement with a counterparty
    to protect against increases in the ten-year U.S. Treasury
    Note rate. These treasury rates served as references in
    determining the interest rates applicable to the debt securities
    the Company issued in July 2003 and March 2008, respectively. As
    a result of changes in the interest rates on those treasury
    securities between the time PCA entered into the agreements and
    the time PCA priced and issued the debt securities, the Company:
    (1) received a payment of $22.8 million from the
    counterparty upon settlement of the 2003 interest rate
    protection agreement on July 21, 2003; and (2) made a
    payment of $4.4 million to the counterparty upon settlement
    of the 2008 interest rate protection agreement on March 25,
    2008. The Company recorded the settlements in accumulated other
    comprehensive income (loss) and is amortizing the
    $22.8 million gain and the $4.4 million loss to
    interest expense over the lives of the respective notes. As of
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company was not a
    party to any derivative instruments.

Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements

In October 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued Staff Position

No. 157-3,

“Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the
    Market for That Asset Is Not Active.” FSP

No. 157-3

clarifies the application of SFAS No. 157 in a market
    that is not active and addresses application issues such as the
    use of internal assumptions when relevant observable data does
    not exist, the use of observable market information when the
    market is not active, and the use of market quotes when
    assessing the relevance of observable and unobservable data. FSP

No. 157-3

is effective for all periods presented in accordance with
    SFAS No. 157. The Company considered the additional
    guidance with respect to the valuation of its financial assets
    and liabilities and their corresponding designation within the
    fair value hierarchy. For additional information, see
    Note 10.

In June 2008, the FASB issued FSP

No. EITF 03-6-1,

“Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based
    Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities.” FSP

No. EITF 03-6-1

was issued to clarify that unvested share-based payment awards
    with a right to receive nonforfeitable dividends are
    participating securities. This FSP also provides guidance on how
    to allocate earnings to participating securities and compute
    basic EPS using the two-class method. FSP

No. EITF 03-6-1

is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
    2008. The Company does not expect the adoption of this FSP to
    have a material impact on its earnings per share calculations.

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161,
    “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities.” SFAS No. 161 changes the disclosure
    requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities.
    Entities will be required to provide enhanced disclosures about
    how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, how
    derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted
    for under SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for
    Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” and its
    related interpretations, and how derivative instruments and
    related items affect an entity’s financial position,
    operations and cash flows. SFAS No. 161 is effective
    as of the beginning of an entity’s fiscal year that begins
    after November 15, 2008. Early adoption is permitted. To
    the extent that PCA is a party to any derivative instruments
    after December 31, 2008, SFAS No. 161 will impact
    PCA’s disclosures related to derivative instruments and
    hedging activities.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R),
    “Business Combinations.” SFAS No. 141(R)
    significantly changes the accounting for and reporting of
    business combination transactions in consolidated financial
    statements. These significant changes include
    (1) recognition of 100% of the fair value of assets
    acquired, liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests of
    acquired businesses, even if 100% of the acquisition has not
    been acquired; (2) recognition of contingent consideration
    arrangements and preacquisition gain and loss contingencies at
    their acquisition-date fair values; (3) capitalization of
    research and development assets acquired at acquisition-date
    fair value; (4) recognition of acquisition-related
    transaction costs as expense when incurred; and
    (5) recognition of acquisition-related restructuring cost
    accruals only if the criteria in SFAS No. 146,
    “Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal
    Activities,” are met as of the acquisition date.
    SFAS No. 141(R) is effective for fiscal years
    beginning after December 15, 2008. Early adoption is not
    permitted. To the extent the Company makes an acquisition after
    December 31, 2008, SFAS No. 141(R) will impact
    the Company’s accounting for such acquisition.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,
    “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities — Including an Amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 115.” SFAS No. 159 permits entities to
    choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other
    items at fair value. Most of the provisions of
    SFAS No. 159 apply only to entities that elect the
    fair value option. However, the amendments to
    SFAS No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments
    In Debt and Equity Securities,” apply to all entities with
    available-for-sale and trading securities.
    SFAS No. 159 was effective as of the beginning of an
    entity’s first

fiscal year that began after November 15, 2007. On
    January 1, 2008, the Company decided not to adopt the fair
    value option for any of its financial instruments.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158,
    “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
    Other Postretirement Plans — an amendment of FASB
    Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R).”
    SFAS No. 158 requires plan sponsors of defined benefit
    pension and other postretirement benefit plans (collectively,
    “postretirement benefit plans”) to recognize the
    funded status of their postretirement benefit plans in the
    statement of financial position, measure the fair value of plan
    assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the fiscal year
    end statement of financial position, and provide additional
    disclosures. These requirements were effective for fiscal years
    ending after December 15, 2006, with the exception of the
    requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of
    the plan sponsor’s fiscal year-end. This requirement was
    effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008.
    On December 31, 2006, the Company adopted the recognition
    and disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 158. On
    December 31, 2008, the Company adopted the measurement
    provision of SFAS No. 158. The effect of adopting this
    provision on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet at
    December 31, 2008 has been included in the accompanying
    consolidated financial statements. See Note 6 for further
    discussion of the effect of adopting the measurement provision
    of SFAS No. 158 on the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,
    “Fair Value Measurements.” SFAS No. 157
    clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the
    assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset
    or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that
    prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions.
    Under the standard, fair value measurements would be separately
    disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy. This
    Statement was effective for fiscal years beginning after
    November 15, 2007. The Company adopted
    SFAS No. 157 on January 1, 2008. For additional
    information regarding SFAS No. 157, see Note 10.

4.  STOCK-BASED
    COMPENSATION

In October 1999, the Company adopted a long-term equity
    incentive plan, which provides for grants of stock options,
    stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and performance
    awards to directors, officers and employees of PCA, as well as
    others who engage in services for PCA. Option awards granted to
    directors, officers and employees have contractual lives of
    seven or ten years. Options granted to officers and employees
    vest ratably over a three- or four-year period, whereas options
    granted to directors vest immediately. The plan, which will
    terminate on October 19, 2009, provides for the issuance of
    up to 6,550,000 shares of common stock. As of
    December 31, 2008, options or restricted stock for
    6,172,508 shares have been granted, net of forfeitures.
    Forfeitures are added back to the pool of shares of common stock
    available to be granted at a future date.

The Company measures and records stock-based compensation cost
    in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based
    Payment.” Stock compensation cost includes:
    (a) compensation cost for all share-based payments granted
    prior to, but not vested as of January 1, 2006, the
    effective date of SFAS No. 123(R), based on the grant
    date fair value estimated in accordance with the original
    provisions of SFAS No. 123, and (b) compensation
    cost for all share-based payments granted subsequent to
    January 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value
    estimated in accordance with the provisions of
    SFAS No. 123(R).

Compensation expense for both stock options and restricted stock
    recognized in the consolidated statements of income for the year
    ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 was as follows:

The Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model
    to estimate the fair value of each option grant as of the date
    of grant. Expected volatilities are based on historical
    volatility of the Company’s common stock. The expected life
    of the option is estimated using historical data pertaining to
    option exercises and employee terminations. Separate groups of
    employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are
    considered separately for estimating the expected life. The
    risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury yields in
    effect at the time of grant. There were no option grants in
    2008. The estimated weighted-average fair values of and related
    assumptions for the 2007 and 2006 option grants were as follows:

The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years
    ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $1,397,000 and
    $14,189,000, respectively. As of December 31, 2008, there
    was $712,000 of total unrecognized compensation costs related to
    non-vested stock option awards granted under the Company’s
    equity incentive plan. That cost is expected to be recognized
    over a weighted-average period of 1.2 years.

Restricted stock awards granted to employees vest at the end of
    a three- or four-year period, whereas restricted stock awards
    granted to directors vest at the end of a six-month period. The
    fair value of restricted stock is determined based on the
    closing price of the Company’s common stock on the grant
    date. The Company generally recognizes compensation expense
    associated with restricted stock awards ratably over their
    vesting periods. As PCA’s Board of Directors has the
    ability to accelerate vesting of restricted stock upon an
    employee’s retirement, the Company accelerates the
    recognition of compensation expense for certain employees
    approaching normal retirement age.

6.  EMPLOYEE
    BENEFIT PLANS AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

In connection with the acquisition from Pactiv, PCA and Pactiv
    entered into a human resources agreement which, among other
    items, granted PCA employees continued participation in the
    Pactiv pension plan for a period of up to five years following
    the closing of the acquisition for an agreed upon fee.

Effective January 1, 2003, PCA adopted a mirror-image
    pension plan for eligible hourly employees to succeed the Pactiv
    pension plan in which PCA hourly employees had participated
    though December 31, 2002. The PCA pension plan for hourly
    employees recognizes service earned under both the PCA plan and
    the prior Pactiv plan. Benefits earned under the PCA plan are
    reduced by retirement benefits earned under the Pactiv plan
    through December 31, 2002. All assets and liabilities
    associated with benefits earned through December 31, 2002
    for hourly employees and retirees of PCA were retained by the
    Pactiv plan.

Effective May 1, 2004, PCA adopted a grandfathered pension
    plan for eligible salaried employees who had previously
    participated in the Pactiv pension plan. The benefit formula for
    the new PCA pension plan for salaried employees is comparable to
    that of the Pactiv plan except that the PCA plan uses career
    average base pay in the benefit formula in lieu of final average
    base pay. The PCA pension plan for salaried employees recognizes
    service earned under both the PCA plan and the prior Pactiv
    plan. Benefits earned under the PCA plan are reduced by
    retirement benefits earned under the Pactiv plan through
    April 30, 2004. All assets and liabilities associated with
    benefits earned through April 30, 2004 for salaried
    employees and retirees of PCA were retained by the Pactiv plan.

PCA maintains a supplemental executive retirement plan
    (“SERP”), which augments pension benefits for eligible
    executives (excluding the CEO) earned under the PCA pension plan
    for salaried employees. Benefits are determined using the same
    formula as the PCA pension plan but in addition to counting
    career average base pay, the SERP also recognizes bonuses and
    any pay earned in excess of IRS qualified plan compensation
    limits. Benefits earned under the SERP are reduced by benefits
    paid from the PCA salaried pension plan and any prior qualified
    pension and SERP benefits earned under the Pactiv plan.

December 31, 2008

PCA also maintains a separate supplemental executive retirement
    benefit for its CEO which will provide a supplemental pension
    benefit calculated on the basis of the following formula:
    (annual salary + bonus) x (years of service) x (0.0167), where
    “years of service” equals years of service with PCA +
    five years. The supplemental pension benefit is payable in a
    lump sum.

PCA provides certain medical benefits for retired salaried
    employees and certain medical and life insurance benefits for
    certain hourly employees. For salaried employees, the plan
    covers employees retiring from PCA on or after attaining
    age 58 who have had at least 10 years of full-time
    service with PCA after attaining age 48. For hourly
    employees, the postretirement medical coverage, where
    applicable, is available according to the eligibility provisions
    in effect at the employee’s work location. Per the human
    resources agreement referred to above, Pactiv retained the
    liability relating to retiree medical and life benefits for PCA
    employees who had retired on or before April 12, 1999 or
    who were eligible to retire within two years of that date. On
    January 1, 2003, the Company adopted a new plan design for
    salaried employees incorporating annual dollar caps in
    determining the maximum amount of employer contributions made
    towards the total cost of postretirement medical coverage.

Adoption
    of SFAS No. 158

On December 31, 2008, the Company adopted the measurement
    provision of SFAS No. 158, which required the Company
    to measure the fair value of plan assets and benefit obligations
    as of the date of the Company’s year end. The Company had
    previously measured these as of September 30th of each
    year. The Company adopted the measurement provision using the
    transition method based on the data as of the September 30,
    2007 measurement date. As a result, the following adjustments
    were made to PCA’s balance sheet as of December 31,
    2008:

The Company makes pension plan contributions that are sufficient
    to fund its actuarially determined costs, generally equal to the
    minimum amounts required by the Employee Retirement Income
    Security Act (ERISA). However, from time to time the Company may
    make discretionary contributions in excess of the required
    minimum amounts. Pension plans’ assets were invested in the
    following classes of securities at December 31, 2008 and
    September 30, 2007:

PCA has retained the services of a professional advisor to
    oversee our pension investments and provide recommendations
    regarding investment strategy. PCA’s overall strategy and
    related apportionments between equity and debt securities may
    change from time to time based on market conditions, external
    economic factors, and the funding status of the plans.

The expected return on pension plan assets reflects the expected
    long-term rates of return for the categories of investments
    currently held in the plan as well as anticipated returns for
    additional contributions made in the future. The expected
    long-term rate of return is adjusted when there are fundamental
    changes in expected returns on the plan investments.

The discount rate assumptions used to calculate the present
    value of pension and postretirement benefit obligations reflect
    the rates available on high-quality, fixed-income debt
    instruments on December 31st beginning in 2008. Prior
    to 2008, the discount rate assumptions were based on rates as of
    September 30th of each year. The rate of compensation
    increase is another significant assumption used for pension
    accounting and is determined by the Company based upon annual
    reviews.

In determining net pension and postretirement benefit costs, the
    Company elected to amortize prior service cost on a
    straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of
    employees expected to receive benefits under the plans. A 10%
    corridor is used to determine the amount of the unrecognized net
    gain or loss to be amortized. The excess, if any, of the
    unrecognized net gain or loss over 10% of the greater of the
    projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan
    assets is amortized over the average remaining service period
    until retirement for active participants and included in the net
    periodic benefit cost.

As of December 31, 2008, the Company assumed health care
    cost trend rates for its postretirement benefit plans were 7.50%
    in 2009, 7.00% in 2010, 6.50% in 2011, 6.00% in 2012, 5.50% in
    2013, and 5.00% in 2014 and thereafter. As of September 30,
    2007, the Company assumed health care cost trend rates for its
    postretirement benefit plans were 7.50% for 2008, 7.00% for
    2009, 6.50% for 2010, 6.00% for 2011, 5.50% for 2012 and 5.00%
    for 2013 and thereafter. As of September 30, 2006, the
    Company assumed health care cost trend rates were 9.00% for
    2007, 8.00% for 2008, 7.00% for 2009, 6.00% for 2010 and 5.00%
    for 2011 and thereafter.

Increasing the assumed health care cost trend rate by one
    percentage point would increase the 2008 postretirement benefit
    obligation by approximately $0.6 million and would increase
    the 2008 net postretirement benefit cost by approximately
    $0.1 million. Decreasing the assumed health care cost trend
    rate by one percentage point would decrease the 2008
    postretirement benefit obligation by approximately
    $0.5 million and would decrease the 2008 net
    postretirement benefit cost by approximately $0.1 million.

The Company has two defined contribution 401(k) benefit plans
    that cover all full-time salaried employees and certain hourly
    employees at several of the Company’s facilities. Employees
    can make voluntary contributions in accordance with the
    provisions of their respective plan. The Company made
    employer-matching contributions of $9.4 million,
    $9.0 million and $8.5 million during the years ended
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Salaried employees who are not participants in the grandfathered
    pension plan (generally those hired on or after April 12,
    1999) receive a service-related Company retirement
    contribution to their 401(k) account in addition to any employer
    matching contribution. This contribution increases with years of
    service and ranges from 3% to 5% of base pay. The Company
    expensed $2.5 million, $2.2 million and
    $1.8 million for this retirement contribution during the
    years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

On March 25, 2008, PCA issued $150.0 million of
    6.50% senior notes due March 15, 2018 through a
    registered public offering. PCA used the proceeds of this
    offering, together with cash on hand, to repay all of the
    $150.0 million of outstanding


/

    notes on August 1, 2008.

On April 15, 2008, PCA replaced its existing senior credit
    facility that was scheduled to expire later in 2008, with a new
    five-year $150.0 million senior revolving credit facility.
    The Company had $19.4 million of outstanding letters of
    credit under this facility, resulting in $130.6 million in
    unused borrowing capacity as of December 31, 2008.

On September 19, 2008, the Company extended its receivable
    credit facility through September 18, 2009. The Company had
    $41.0 million in additional borrowing capacity available
    under this facility as of December 31, 2008.

The instruments governing PCA’s indebtedness contain
    covenants that limit the ability of PCA and its subsidiaries to
    enter into sale and leaseback transactions, incur liens, incur
    indebtedness at the subsidiary level, enter into certain
    transactions with affiliates, merge or consolidate with any
    other person or sell or otherwise dispose of all or
    substantially all of its assets. The senior credit facility also
    requires PCA to comply with certain financial covenants,
    including maintaining a minimum interest coverage ratio, a
    maximum ratio of debt to total capitalization, and a minimum net
    worth level. A failure to comply with these restrictions could
    lead to an event of default, which could result in an
    acceleration of any outstanding indebtedness

and/or

prohibit the Company from drawing on the revolving credit
    facility. Such a default may also constitute an event of default
    under the senior notes indenture and the receivables credit
    facility. At December 31, 2008, the Company was in
    compliance with these financial covenants.

As of December 31, 2008, annual principal maturities for
    debt, excluding unamortized debt discount, are:
    $109.0 million (2009), $400.0 million (2013) and
    $150.0 (2018).

Interest payments in connection with the Company’s debt
    obligations for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and
    2006, amounted to $38.9 million, $38.0 million, and
    $38.2 million, respectively.

On November 29, 2000, the Company established an on-balance
    sheet securitization program for its trade accounts receivable.
    To effectuate this program, the Company formed a wholly owned
    limited purpose subsidiary, Packaging Credit Company, LLC
    (“PCC”), which in turn formed a wholly owned,
    bankruptcy-remote, special-purpose subsidiary, Packaging
    Receivables Company, LLC (“PRC”), for the purpose of
    acquiring receivables from PCC. Both of these entities are
    included in the consolidated financial statements of the
    Company. Under this program, PCC purchases on an ongoing basis
    substantially all of the receivables of the Company and sells
    such receivables to PRC. PRC and lenders established a
    $150.0 million receivables-backed revolving credit facility
    (“Receivables Credit Facility”) through which PRC
    obtains funds to purchase receivables from PCC. The receivables
    purchased by PRC are solely the property of PRC. In the event of
    liquidation of PRC, the creditors of PRC would be entitled to
    satisfy their claims from PRC’s assets prior to any
    distribution to PCC or the Company. Credit available under the
    receivables credit facility is on a borrowing-base formula. As a
    result, the full amount of the facility may not be available at
    all times. At December 31, 2008, $109.0 million was
    outstanding and $41.0 million was available for additional
    borrowing under the receivables credit facility. The highest
    outstanding principal balance under the receivables credit
    facility during 2008 was $109.0 million.

    facilities, including the impact of $19.4 million of

The fair value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts
    receivable, net and accounts and dividends payable approximate
    their carrying amounts due to the short-term nature of these
    financial instruments.

The fair value of the term loan and the receivables credit
    facility approximates their carrying amount due to the variable
    interest-rate feature of the instruments. The fair values of the
    senior notes are based on quoted market prices. The fair value
    of the capital lease obligations was estimated to not be
    materially different from the carrying amount.

FAIR
    VALUE MEASUREMENTS

PCA adopted SFAS No. 157 on January 1, 2008.
    SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a
    consistent framework for measuring fair value and expands
    disclosure for each major asset and liability category measured
    at fair value on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis.
    SFAS No. 157 clarifies that fair value is an exit
    price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an
    asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
    between market participants. As such, fair value is a
    market-based measurement that should be determined based on
    assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an
    asset or liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions,
    SFAS No. 157 establishes a three-tier fair value
    hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair
    value as follows:

Level 1 — observable inputs such as quoted prices
    in active markets

Level 2 — inputs, other than quoted prices in
    active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly

Level 3 — unobservable inputs in which there is
    little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to
    develop its own assumptions

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are based on one
    or more of three valuation techniques noted in
    SFAS No. 157. The valuation techniques are as follows:

(a) Market approach — prices and other relevant
    information generated by market transactions involving identical
    or comparable assets or liabilities

F-26


Packaging
    Corporation of America

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

December 31, 2008

(b) Cost approach — amount that would be required
    to replace the service capacity of an asset (replacement cost)

(c) Income approach — techniques to convert
    future amounts to a single present amount based on market
    expectations (including present value techniques, option-pricing
    and excess earnings models)

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring
    basis are as follows:

There were no changes in the Company’s valuation techniques
    used to measure fair values on a recurring basis as a result of
    adopting SFAS No. 157. PCA had no assets or
    liabilities that were measured on a nonrecurring basis.

11.  STOCKHOLDERS’
    EQUITY

On May 16, 2001, PCA announced that its Board of Directors
    had authorized a $100.0 million common stock repurchase
    program, which it completed in the fourth quarter of 2007.
    Through December 31, 2007, the Company repurchased
    5,607,671 shares of common stock for $100.0 million.
    All repurchased shares were retired prior to December 31,
    2007.

On October 17, 2007, PCA announced that its Board of
    Directors authorized a $150.0 million common stock
    repurchase program. There is no expiration date for the common
    stock repurchase program. Through December 31, 2008, the
    Company repurchased 3,818,729 shares of common stock, with
    3,142,600 shares repurchased during 2008 and
    676,129 shares repurchased during 2007. All repurchased
    shares were retired prior to December 31, 2008. As of
    December 31, 2008, $65.0 million of the
    $150.0 million authorization remained available for
    repurchase of the Company’s common stock.

12.  COMMITMENTS
    AND CONTINGENCIES

Capital
    Commitments

The Company had authorized capital expenditures of approximately
    $43.0 million and $58.3 million as of

    with the expansion and replacement of existing facilities and
    equipment.

Lease
    Obligations

PCA leases space for certain of its facilities and cutting
    rights to approximately 91,000 acres of timberland under
    long-term leases. The Company also leases equipment, primarily
    vehicles and rolling stock, and other assets under long-term
    leases with a duration generally of three years. The minimum
    lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases with lease
    terms in excess of one year are as follows:

Total lease expense, including base rent on all leases and

    the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 was
    $41.6 million, $39.8 million and $38.5 million,
    respectively. These costs are included in cost of goods sold and
    selling and administrative expenses.

PCA was obligated under capital leases covering buildings and
    machinery and equipment in the amount of $23.7 million and
    $0.2 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company
    entered into a capital lease relating to buildings and
    machinery, totaling $23.9 million, payable over
    20 years. This capital lease amount is a non-cash
    transaction and, accordingly, has been excluded from the
    consolidated statements of cash flows. Assets held under capital
    lease obligations are included in property, plant and equipment

    agreements.

Litigation

PCA is a party to various legal actions arising in the ordinary
    course of business. These legal actions cover a broad variety of
    claims spanning our entire business. As of the date of this
    filing, the Company believes it is not reasonably possible that
    the resolution of these legal actions will, individually or in
    the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on its financial
    position, results of operations, or cash flows.

Environmental
    Liabilities

In 1998, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
    finalized a Clean Air and Water Act commonly referred to as the
    Cluster Rules. The Cluster Rules govern allowable discharges of
    air and water

F-29


Packaging
    Corporation of America

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

December 31, 2008

pollutants at all pulp and paper mill operations. As a result,
    PCA and its competitors were required to incur costs to ensure
    compliance with these rules. The Company completed all of the
    projects related to Cluster Rule requirements in 2006 and, as a
    result, does not anticipate any further capital expenditures
    related to compliance with Cluster Rules. From 1997 through
    2006, the Company spent approximately $39.2 million to
    ensure compliance with Cluster Rule requirements. Total capital
    costs for environmental matters were $3.5 for 2008 and
    $4.5 million for 2007. The Company currently estimates 2009
    environmental capital expenditures will be approximately
    $1.5 million.

The potential costs for various environmental matters are
    uncertain due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of
    possible cleanup costs, the complexity and evolving nature of
    governmental laws and regulations and their interpretations, and
    the timing, varying costs and effectiveness of alternative
    cleanup technologies. From 1994 through 2008, remediation costs
    at the Company’s mills and corrugated plants totaled
    approximately $3.2 million. As of December 31, 2008,
    the Company maintained an environmental reserve of
    $8.3 million relating to

on-site

landfills (see Note 13) and surface impoundments as
    well as ongoing and anticipated remedial projects. Liabilities
    recorded for environmental contingencies are estimates of the
    probable costs based upon available information and assumptions.
    Because of these uncertainties, PCA’s estimates may change.
    As of the date of this filing, the Company believes that it is
    not reasonably possible that future environmental expenditures
    and asset retirement obligations above the $8.3 million
    accrued as of December 31, 2008, will have a material
    impact on its financial condition, results of operations, or
    cash flows.

In connection with the sale to PCA of its containerboard and
    corrugated products business, Pactiv agreed to retain all
    liability for all former facilities and all sites associated
    with pre-closing off-site waste disposal and all environmental
    liabilities related to a closed landfill located near the
    Company’s Filer City mill.

13.  ASSET
    RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

Asset retirement obligations consist primarily of landfill
    capping and closure and post-closure costs. PCA is legally
    required to perform capping and closure and post-closure care on
    the landfills at each of the Company’s mills. In accordance
    with SFAS No. 143, “Accounting for Asset
    Retirement Obligations,” PCA recognizes the fair value of
    these liabilities as an asset retirement obligation for each
    landfill and capitalizes that cost as part of the cost basis of
    the related asset. The liability is accreted to its estimated
    value of the asset retirement obligation over time, and the
    related assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over
    their useful lives. Upon settlement of the liability, PCA will
    recognize a gain or loss for any difference between the
    settlement amount and the recorded liability.

    retirement obligation liability:

Cash payments for income taxes were $89.4 million,
    $105.5 million and $65.1 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

The Company adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48,
    “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes”
    (FIN No. 48) on January 1, 2007. As a result
    of the adoption of FIN No. 48, PCA recognized a
    $5.1 million decrease to reserves for uncertain tax
    positions and an increase to the beginning balance of retained
    earnings on January 1, 2007.

During the third quarter of 2007, the statute of limitations for
    the tax year 2001 expired and the Federal examination of the tax
    year 2004 was concluded. As a result of these events, the
    reserve for uncertain tax positions was decreased by
    $1.0 million gross or $0.8 million net of the federal
    benefit for state taxes during the third quarter of 2007. At
    December 31, 2008, PCA had $10.4 million unrecognized
    tax benefits excluding interest. Of the total, $7.5 million
    (net of the federal benefit for state taxes) would impact the
    effective tax rate if recognized.

During the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, PCA
    recorded $0.1 million gross ($0.06 million net) and
    $0.6 million gross ($0.4 million net), respectively,
    in its statement of income, increasing the accrual for interest
    to $1.7 million gross ($1.0 million net) and
    $1.6 million gross ($1.0 million, net) at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. No accrual for
    penalties was made.

PCA and its subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal income
    taxes, as well as income taxes of multiple state and city
    jurisdictions. A federal examination of the tax years 2002 and
    2004 have been concluded. The tax years 2003 and

investment in STV under the equity method. PCA did not receive
    any dividends from STV in 2008, 2007 or 2006. STV currently owns
    approximately 51,000 acres of land, including timberlands
    and higher beneficial use properties, located primarily in
    southern Georgia and northern Florida.

Currently, PCA purchases pulpwood directly from STV for its
    Valdosta mill in accordance with the terms of a fiber supply
    agreement between the two companies which expires
    December 31, 2017. The price of pulpwood in this agreement
    is based upon the market value of pulpwood and is adjusted
    annually for any changes in market value. PCA purchased
    $3.0 million, $3.2 million and $3.3 million of
    pulpwood for its Valdosta, Georgia mill from STV during the
    years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

In December 2007, PCA sold a portion of its interest in STV for
    $1.0 million and recognized a pre-tax gain of
    $1.0 million.

ACQUISITIONS

During the second quarter of 2006, PCA acquired a sheet plant in
    Miami, Florida for $4.3 million, which expanded the
    Company’s presence in southern Florida. The purchase method
    of accounting was used to account for the acquisition. Goodwill
    of $2.9 million (which is deductible for income tax
    purposes) was recorded in connection with the acquisition. Net
    sales and total assets of the plant acquired were not material.
    Operating results of the plant subsequent to the date of
    acquisition are included in the Company’s operating results.

BUSINESS
    INTERRUPTION INSURANCE RECOVERY

On October 24, 2007, PCA’s Counce, Tennessee
    linerboard mill incurred a major, unplanned outage due to a
    total mill power failure. The mill was down for


/


days and experienced operational difficulties through the end of
    the month. This outage resulted in about 11,000 tons of lost
    production as well as significant additional operating costs of
    $7.4 million ($4.7 million net of tax). In December
    2007, the Company received $2.4 million ($1.5 million
    net of tax) in business interruption insurance proceeds. The
    amount of the loss, net of the insurance recovery, is included
    in cost of sales in the statement of income for the year ended
    December 31, 2007. The insurance proceeds are included in
    net cash provided by operating activities in the statement of
    cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2007.

    due to a reduction in the Company’s state tax rate.

For the three months ended December 31, 2007, net income
    was reduced by $3.2 million or $0.03 per share due to the
    major, unplanned outage at the Company’s Counce, Tennessee
