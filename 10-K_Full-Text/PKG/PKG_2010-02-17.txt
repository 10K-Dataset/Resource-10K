Item 1.

BUSINESS

General

Packaging Corporation of America (we, us, our, “PCA”
    or the “Company”) is the fifth largest producer of
    containerboard and corrugated products in the United States in
    terms of production capacity. During 2009, we produced
    2,258,000 million tons of containerboard at our mills, of
    which about 80% was consumed in PCA’s corrugated products
    manufacturing plants, 11% was sold to domestic customers and 9%
    was sold in the export market. Our corrugated products
    manufacturing plants sold about 28.9 billion square feet
    (BSF) of corrugated products. Our net sales to third parties
    totaled $2.15 billion in 2009.

In 2009, we produced 1.4 million tons of kraft linerboard
    at our mills in Counce, Tennessee and Valdosta, Georgia, and
    0.9 million tons of semi-chemical corrugating medium at our
    mills in Tomahawk, Wisconsin and Filer City, Michigan. We
    currently lease the cutting rights to approximately
    91,000 acres of timberland located near our Counce and
    Valdosta mills. We also have supply agreements with third
    parties on approximately 352,000 acres of timberland.

Our corrugated products manufacturing plants produce a wide
    variety of corrugated packaging products, including conventional
    shipping containers used to protect and transport manufactured
    goods, multi-color boxes and displays with strong visual appeal
    that help to merchandise the packaged product in retail
    locations. In addition, we are a large producer of meat boxes
    and wax-coated boxes for the agricultural industry.

Industry
    Overview

According to the Fibre Box Association, the value of industry
    shipments of corrugated products was $24 billion in 2009.

Corrugated products plants tend to be located in close proximity
    to customers to minimize freight costs. The U.S. corrugated
    products industry consists of approximately 625 companies
    and 1,340 plants.

Containerboard, which includes both linerboard and corrugating
    medium, is the principal raw material used to manufacture
    corrugated products. Linerboard is used as the inner and outer
    facings, or liners, of corrugated products. Corrugating medium
    is fluted and laminated to linerboard in corrugator plants to
    produce



corrugated sheets. The sheets are subsequently printed, cut,
    folded and glued in corrugator plants or sheet plants to produce
    corrugated products.

Containerboard may be manufactured from both softwood and
    hardwood fibers, as well as from recycled fibers from used
    corrugated and waste from converting operations. Kraft
    linerboard is made predominantly from softwoods like pine.
    Semi-chemical corrugating medium is made from hardwoods such as
    oak. The finished paper product is wound into large rolls, which
    are slit to size as required and shipped to converters.

PCA
    Operations and Products

Our two linerboard mills can manufacture a broad range of
    linerboard grades ranging from 26 lb. to 96 lb. Our two
    semi-chemical corrugating medium mills can manufacture grades
    ranging in weight from 20 lb. to 47 lb. Mill capacities
    described below are estimated based on expected mix of paper
    basis weights, and production can exceed estimated capacity if a
    higher-than-estimated mix of heavier grade paper is produced.
    All four of our mills have completed an extensive independent
    review process to become ISO 9002 certified. ISO 9002 is an
    international quality certification that verifies a facility
    maintains and follows stringent procedures for manufacturing,
    sales and customer service.

The following four paragraphs describe our containerboard
    mills’ annual practical maximum capacity, 2009 actual
    production and production capabilities.

Counce.

Our Counce, Tennessee mill is one of
    the largest kraft linerboard mills in the United States. Its
    estimated production capacity, as reported to the American
    Forest and Paper Association (“AF&PA”), is
    approximately 1,007,000 tons per year. In 2009, we produced
    902,000 tons of kraft linerboard on two paper machines at
    Counce. The mill produces a broad range of basis weights from 26
    lb. to 90 lb. The mill also produces a variety of performance
    and specialty grades of linerboard.

Valdosta.

Our Valdosta, Georgia mill is a
    kraft linerboard mill that has an estimated production capacity
    of approximately 474,000 tons per year, as reported to the
    AF&PA. In 2009, our single paper machine at Valdosta
    produced 465,000 tons of kraft linerboard. Valdosta produces a
    range of basis weights from 35 lb. to 96 lb.

Tomahawk.

Our Tomahawk, Wisconsin mill is one
    of the largest semi-chemical corrugating medium mills in the
    United States with an estimated production capacity of 581,000
    tons per year on three paper machines, as reported to the
    AF&PA. In April 2005, we completed the indefinite closure
    of our number three paper machine at Tomahawk and currently
    operate the remaining two paper machines which have a combined
    production capacity of 516,000 tons. In 2009, we produced
    526,000 tons of semi-chemical corrugating medium on two paper
    machines at Tomahawk. The Tomahawk mill produces a broad range
    of basis weights from 23 lb. to 47 lb. and a variety of
    performance and specialty grades of corrugating medium.

Filer City.

Our Filer City, Michigan mill is a
    semi-chemical corrugating medium mill with an estimated
    production capacity of 413,000 tons on three paper machines, as
    reported to the AF&PA. In 2009, we produced 365,000 tons of
    corrugating medium at Filer City. Filer City produces
    corrugating medium grades ranging in basis weight from 20 lb. to
    47 lb.

We operate 68 corrugated manufacturing operations, a technical
    and development center, six regional graphic design centers, a
    rotogravure printing operation and a complement of packaging
    supplies and distribution centers. Of the 68 manufacturing
    facilities, 40 operate as combining operations, commonly called
    corrugated plants, that manufacture corrugated sheets and
    finished corrugated containers. The remaining 28 manufacturing
    facilities, commonly called sheet plants, purchase combined
    sheets primarily produced at PCA’s combining operations and
    manufacture finished corrugated containers.

We have corrugated manufacturing operations in 26 states in
    the U.S., with no manufacturing facilities outside of the
    continental U.S. Each corrugated plant, for the most part,
    serves a market radius that typically averages 150 miles.
    Our sheet plants are generally located in close proximity to our
    larger corrugated plants, which enables us to offer additional
    services and converting capabilities such as small volume and
    quick turnaround items.



We produce a wide variety of products ranging from basic
    corrugated shipping containers to specialized packaging such as
    wax-coated boxes for the agriculture industry. We also have
    multi-color printing capabilities to make high-impact graphics
    boxes and displays that offer customers more attractive
    packaging.

Timberland

We currently lease the cutting rights to approximately
    91,000 acres of timberland located near our Counce and
    Valdosta mills. Virtually all of the acres under cutting rights
    agreements are located within 100 miles of these two mills,
    which results in lower wood transportation costs and provides a
    secure source of wood fiber. These leased cutting rights
    agreements have terms with about 15 years remaining, on
    average.

During 1999 and 2000, PCA sold approximately 800,000 acres
    of timberland. We currently have in place supply agreements
    covering approximately 352,000 of the 800,000 acres sold.
    The majority of the acreage under supply agreement is located in
    close proximity to our Counce mill. We currently hold an
    approximate 29% equity ownership interest in approximately
    51,000 acres owned by Southern Timber Venture, LLC (STV).
    This acreage is located primarily in southern Georgia and
    northern Florida, near our Valdosta, Georgia mill, and includes
    both timberlands and higher beneficial use properties.

Our Forest Management Assistance Program provides professional
    forestry assistance to private timberland owners to improve
    harvest yields and to optimize their harvest schedule. We have
    managed the regeneration of approximately 125,000 acres by
    supplying pine seedlings. In exchange for our expertise, we are
    given the right of first refusal over timber sales from those
    lands. These private lands include about 115,000 acres of
    timberland.

PCA also participates in the Sustainable Forestry Initiative.
    This initiative is aimed at ensuring the long-term health and
    conservation of America’s forestry resources. Activities
    include limiting tree harvest sizes, replanting harvest acreage,
    participating in flora and fauna research and protecting water
    streams.

Sales and
    Marketing

Our corrugated products are sold through a direct sales and
    marketing organization. We have sales representatives and a
    sales manager at each corrugated manufacturing operation who
    serve local and regional accounts. We also have corporate
    account managers who serve large national accounts at multiple
    customer locations. Additionally, our graphic design centers
    maintain an

on-site

dedicated graphics sales force. In addition to direct sales and
    marketing personnel, we utilize new product development
    engineers and product graphics and design specialists. These
    individuals are located at both the corrugated plants and the
    graphic design centers. General marketing support is located at
    our corporate headquarters.

Our containerboard sales group is responsible for the sale of
    linerboard and corrugating medium to our corrugated plants, to
    other domestic customers and to the export market. This group
    handles order processing for all shipments of containerboard
    from our mills to our corrugated plants. These personnel also
    coordinate and execute all containerboard trade agreements with
    other containerboard manufacturers.

Distribution

Containerboard produced in our mills is shipped by rail or
    truck. Rail shipments represent about 50% of the tons shipped
    and the remaining 50% is comprised of truck shipments. Our
    individual mills do not own or maintain outside warehousing
    facilities.

Our corrugated products are delivered by truck due to our large
    number of customers and their demand for timely service. Our
    converting operations typically service customers within a
    150 miles radius. We use third-party warehouses for
    short-term storage of corrugated products.

Customers

PCA’s corrugated products group sells to over 9,600
    customers in over 17,500 locations. About two-thirds of our
    corrugated products customers are regional and local accounts,
    which are broadly diversified across



industries and geographic locations. The remaining one-third of
    our customer base consists primarily of national accounts, or
    those customers with a national presence. These customers
    typically purchase corrugated products from several of our box
    plants throughout the United States.

Major Raw
    Materials Used

Fiber supply.

Fiber is the single largest cost
    in the manufacture of containerboard. PCA consumes both wood
    fiber and recycled fiber in its containerboard mills. We have no
    100% recycled mills, or those mills whose fiber consumption
    consists solely of recycled fiber. To reduce our fiber costs, we
    have invested in processes and equipment to ensure a high degree
    of fiber flexibility. Our mills have the capability to shift a
    portion of their fiber consumption between softwood, hardwood
    and recycled sources. All of our mills, other than our Valdosta
    mill, can utilize some recycled fiber in their containerboard
    production. Our ability to use various types of virgin and
    recycled fiber helps mitigate the impact of changes in the
    prices of various fibers. Our corrugated manufacturing
    operations generate recycled fiber as a by-product from the
    manufacturing process, which is sold to our mills directly or
    through trade agreements. During 2009, with low recycled fiber
    prices, our containerboard mills consumed approximately 636,000
    tons of recycled fiber, and our corrugated converting operations
    generated approximately 189,000 tons of recycled fiber. As a
    result, PCA was a net recycled fiber buyer of 447,000 tons, or
    20% of PCA’s total fiber requirements, up from 17% in 2008.

Energy supply.

Energy at the mills is obtained
    through purchased electricity or through various fuels, which
    are converted to steam or electricity

on-site.

Fuel sources include coal, natural gas, oil, internally produced
    and purchased bark and by-products of the containerboard
    manufacturing and pulping process, including black liquor. These
    fuels are burned in boilers to produce steam. Steam turbine
    generators are used to produce electricity. To reduce our mill
    energy cost, we have invested in processes and equipment to
    ensure a high level of purchased fuel flexibility. In recent
    history, natural gas and fuel oil have exhibited higher costs
    per thermal unit and more price volatility than coal and bark.
    During 2009, 10.7 million MMBTU’s (million
    BTU’s), or approximately 75% of our mills’ purchased
    fuel needs, were from purchased bark and coal, historically our
    two lowest cost purchased fuels. For the same period, our mills
    consumed about 2.2 million MMBTU’s of natural gas (15%
    of the mills’ total purchased fuels) and 0.8 million
    MMBTU’s of oil (6% of the mills’ total purchased
    fuels). Our two kraft linerboard mills at Counce and Valdosta
    generate approximately two-thirds of their fuel requirements
    from their own by-products.

PCA’s corrugated plants each have a boiler that produces
    steam which is used by the corrugator. The majority of these
    boilers burn natural gas, although some also have the ability to
    burn fuel oil. During 2009, PCA’s corrugated products
    plants consumed approximately 2.0 million MMBTU’s of
    natural gas.

The following table shows PCA’s purchased fuel consumption
    by fuel type for 2009:

Approximately 40% of the electricity consumed by our four mills
    is generated

on-site.

Our
    mills purchase approximately 8,907,000 CkWh (hundred kilowatt
    hours) annually, or the equivalent of 3.0 million
    MMBTU’s. PCA’s corrugated products plants purchase
    about 2,196,000 CkWh annually, or the equivalent of
    0.7 million MMBTU’s.

In October 2009, PCA announced that it will undertake major
    energy optimization projects at the Counce and Valdosta
    linerboard mills, which are expected to significantly reduce
    fuel and electricity purchases at these mills and nearly
    eliminate fossil fuel consumption at these facilities. The
    projects include a new recovery boiler and turbine generator at
    the Valdosta mill and a rebuild and upgrade of two existing
    recovery boilers and a new turbine generator at the Counce mill.
    The total capital expenditures for these projects are expected
    to be about $295 million to be spent over two years, and
    the projects are expected to be completed in the fourth quarter
    of 2011.

Competition

According to industry sources, corrugated products are produced
    by about 625 U.S. companies operating approximately 1,340
    plants. Most corrugated products are manufactured to the
    customer’s specifications. Corrugated producers generally
    sell within a

150-mile

radius of their plants and compete with other corrugated
    producers in their local market. In fact, the Fibre Box
    Association tracks industry data by 47 distinct market regions.

The larger, multi-plant integrated companies may also solicit
    larger, multi-plant customers who purchase for all of their
    facilities on a consolidated basis. These customers are often
    referred to as national or corporate accounts.

Corrugated products businesses seek to differentiate themselves
    through pricing, quality, service, design and product
    innovation. We compete for both local and national account
    business, and we compete against producers of other types of
    packaging products. On a national level, our primary competitors
    include International Paper Company, Georgia-Pacific (owned by
    Koch Industries, Inc.), Smurfit-Stone Container Corporation and
    Temple-Inland Inc. However, with our strategic focus on local
    and regional accounts, we also compete with the smaller,
    independent converters.

Our principal competitors with respect to sales of our
    containerboard produced but not consumed at our own corrugated
    products plants are a number of large, diversified paper
    companies, including International Paper Company,
    Georgia-Pacific, Smurfit-Stone Container Corporation and
    Temple-Inland Inc., as well as other regional manufacturers.
    Containerboard is generally considered a commodity-type product
    and can be purchased from numerous suppliers.

Employees

As of December 31, 2009, we had approximately
    8,000 employees. Approximately 2,400 of these employees
    were salaried and approximately 5,600 were hourly. Approximately
    75% of our hourly employees are represented by unions. The
    majority of our unionized employees are represented by the
    United Steel Workers (USW), the International Brotherhood of
    Teamsters (IBT) and the International Association of Machinists
    (IAM).

Based on an agreement reached with the USW in August 2008, the
    existing labor agreements at our containerboard mills covering
    USW-represented employees (89% of mill hourly workforce) were
    extended five years. With this extension, the USW contracts at
    our mills are currently set to expire between September 2013 and
    June 2015. Agreements with other union mill employees (11% of
    mill hourly workforce) expire between June 2012 and October
    2014. Based on an agreement reached with the USW in April 2009,
    the labor agreement at 25 corrugated plants covering USW
    represented employees was extended up to five years. Contracts
    for unionized corrugated products plant employees expire between
    March 2010 and December 2014. We are currently in negotiations
    to renew or extend any union contracts that have recently
    expired or are expiring in the near future.

During 2009, we experienced no work stoppages and have
    experienced no instances of significant work stoppages in the
    five years prior to 2009. We believe we have satisfactory
    relations with our employees.



Environmental
    Matters

Compliance with environmental requirements is a significant
    factor in our business operations. We commit substantial
    resources to maintaining environmental compliance and managing
    environmental risk. We are subject to, and must comply with, a
    variety of federal, state and local environmental laws,
    particularly those relating to air and water quality, waste
    disposal and the cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater.
    The most significant of these laws affecting us are:

1. Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA)

2. Clean Water Act (CWA)

3. Clean Air Act (CAA)

4. The Emergency Planning and Community

Right-to-Know-Act

(EPCRA)

5. Toxic Substance Control Act (TSCA)

6. Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA)

We believe that we are currently in material compliance with
    these and all applicable environmental rules and regulations.
    Because environmental regulations are constantly evolving, we
    have incurred, and will continue to incur, costs to maintain
    compliance with these and other environmental laws. For the year
    ended December 31, 2009, we spent approximately
    $26.4 million to comply with the requirements of these and
    other environmental laws. For the years ended December 31,
    2008 and 2007, the costs of environmental compliance were
    approximately $23.5 million and $19.4 million,
    respectively. We work diligently to anticipate and budget for
    the impact of applicable environmental regulations, and do not
    currently expect that future environmental compliance
    obligations will materially affect our business or financial
    condition. Total capital costs for environmental matters were
    $0.4 million for 2009. We currently estimate 2010
    environmental capital expenditures will be $1.2 million.

As is the case with any industrial operation, we have in the
    past incurred costs associated with the remediation of soil or
    groundwater contamination. From 1994 through 2009, remediation
    costs at our mills and converting plants totaled approximately
    $3.2 million. We do not believe that any ongoing remedial
    projects are material in nature. As of December 31, 2009,
    we maintained an environmental reserve of $9.1 million,
    which includes funds relating to

on-site

landfill and surface impoundments as well as ongoing and
    anticipated remedial projects. Of the $9.1 million reserve,
    $4.5 million is reserved for our landfill obligations,
    which are accounted for in accordance with Accounting Standards
    Codification (“ASC”) 410, “Asset Retirement and
    Environmental Obligations.” We believe these reserves are
    adequate.

We could also incur environmental liabilities as a result of
    claims by third parties for civil damages, including liability
    for personal injury or property damage, arising from releases of
    hazardous substances or contamination. We are not aware of any
    material claims of this type currently pending against us.

On April 12, 1999, Pactiv Corporation, formerly known as
    Tenneco Packaging Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Tenneco
    Inc., sold its containerboard and corrugated products business
    to PCA, an entity formed by Madison Dearborn Partners, LLC, a
    private equity investment firm. As a part of the April 12,
    1999 transaction, Pactiv agreed to retain all liability for all
    former facilities and all sites associated with pre-closing
    offsite waste disposal. Pactiv also retained environmental
    liability for a closed landfill located near the Filer City mill.

As of this filing, we believe that it is not reasonably possible
    that future environmental expenditures above the
    $9.1 million accrued as of December 31, 2009 will have
    a material impact on our financial condition and results of
    operations.

While legislation regarding the regulation of greenhouse gas
    emissions has been proposed at the federal level, it is
    uncertain whether such legislation will be passed and, if so,
    what the breadth and scope of such legislation will be. The
    result of the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could be an
    increase in our future environmental compliance costs, through
    caps, taxes or additional capital expenditures to modify
    facilities, which may be material. However, climate change
    legislation and the resulting future energy policy could also



provide us with opportunities if the use of renewable energy is
    encouraged. We currently generate a significant portion of our
    power requirements for our mills using bark, black liquor and
    biomass as fuel, which are derived from renewable resources. Our
    energy optimization projects at the Counce and Valdosta
    linerboard mills are expected to nearly eliminate the use of
    fossil fuels at those facilities by the end of 2011, while
    providing more efficient power generation at those facilities.
    While we believe we are well-positioned to take advantage of any
    renewable energy incentives, it is uncertain what the ultimate
    costs and opportunities of any climate change legislation will
    be and how our business and industry will be affected.

Financial
    Information About Segments

We operate as one segment and our revenues are generated
    primarily in one geographic segment. See “Segment
    Information” of Note 2 — Summary of
    Significant Accounting Policies contained in the “Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements.”

Item 1A.

RISK
    FACTORS

Some of the statements in this report and, in particular,
    statements found in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations, that are not
    historical in nature are forward-looking statements within the
    meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
    These statements are often identified by the words
    “will,” “should,” “anticipate,”
    “believe,” “expect,” “intend,”
    “estimate,” “hope,” or similar expressions.
    These statements reflect management’s current views with
    respect to future events and are subject to risks and
    uncertainties. There are important factors that could cause
    actual results to differ materially from those in
    forward-looking statements, many of which are beyond our
    control. These factors, risks and uncertainties include, but are
    not limited to, the factors described below.

Our actual results, performance or achievement could differ
    materially from those expressed in, or implied by, these
    forward-looking statements, and accordingly, we can give no
    assurances that any of the events anticipated by the
    forward-looking statements will transpire or occur, or if any of
    them do so, what impact they will have on our results of
    operations or financial condition. In view of these
    uncertainties, investors are cautioned not to place undue
    reliance on these forward-looking statements. We expressly
    disclaim any obligation to publicly revise any forward-looking
    statements that have been made to reflect the occurrence of
    events after the date hereof.

Industry
    Risks

Industry
    Earnings Cyclicality — Imbalances of supply and demand
    for containerboard could affect the price at which we can sell
    containerboard and corrugated products, and as a result, could
    result in lower selling prices and earnings.

The price of containerboard could fall if the supply of
    containerboard available for sale in the market exceeds the
    demand. The demand for containerboard is driven by market needs
    for containerboard in the United States and abroad to
    manufacture corrugated shipping containers. Market needs or
    demand are driven by both global and U.S. business
    conditions. If supply exceeds demand, prices for containerboard
    and corrugated products could decline, resulting in decreased
    earnings and cash generated from operations.



Competition —
    The intensity of competition in the containerboard and
    corrugated packaging industry could result in downward pressure
    on pricing and volume, which could lower earnings and cash
    generated from operations.

The containerboard and corrugated products industry is highly
    competitive, with no single containerboard or corrugated
    packaging producer having a dominant position. Containerboard
    cannot generally be differentiated by producer, which tends to
    intensify price competition. The corrugated packaging industry
    is also sensitive to changes in economic conditions, as well as
    other factors including innovation, design, quality and service.
    To the extent that one or more competitors are more successful
    with respect to any key competitive factor, our business could
    be adversely affected. Our products also compete, to some
    extent, with various other packaging materials, including
    products made of paper, plastics, wood and various types of
    metal. The intensity of competition could lead to a reduction in
    our market share as well as lower sales prices for our products,
    both of which could reduce our earnings and cash flow.

Company
    Risks

Cost
    of Fiber — An increase in the cost of fiber could
    increase our manufacturing costs and lower our
    earnings.

PCA has supply agreements at market prices for wood fiber to be
    consumed at three of our four mills on approximately
    352,000 acres of timberland. In addition to these supply
    agreements, PCA also secures wood fiber from various other
    sources at market prices.

PCA purchases recycled fiber for use at three of its four
    containerboard mills. PCA currently purchases, net of recycled
    fiber generated at its box plants, approximately 400,000 to
    450,000 tons of recycled fiber per year. The amount of recycled
    fiber purchased each year depends on the prices of both recycled
    fiber and wood fiber as the company attempts to minimize total
    fiber costs.

The market price of wood fiber varies based upon availability
    and source. In addition, the increase in demand of products
    manufactured, in whole or in part, from recycled fiber, on a
    global basis, has caused an occasional tightening in the supply
    of recycled fiber. These periods of supply and demand imbalance
    have tended to create significant price volatility. Periods of
    above average fiber costs and unusual price volatility have
    occurred in the past and may occur again in the future, which
    could result in lower or volatile earnings.

Cost
    of Purchased Energy and Chemicals — An increase in the
    cost of purchased energy and chemicals could lead to higher
    manufacturing costs, resulting in reduced
    earnings.

PCA has the capability to use various types of purchased fuels
    in its manufacturing operations, including coal, bark, natural
    gas and oil. Energy prices, in particular prices for oil and
    natural gas, have fluctuated dramatically in the past and have
    risen substantially in recent years. In addition, costs for key
    chemicals used in our manufacturing have risen. These
    fluctuations impact our manufacturing costs and result in
    earnings volatility. If energy and chemical prices rise, our
    production costs will increase, which will lead to higher
    manufacturing costs and reduced earnings.

Material
    Disruption of Manufacturing — A material disruption at
    one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from
    meeting customer demand, reduce our sales and/or negatively
    impact our results of operation and financial
    condition.

Our business depends on continuous operation of our facilities,
    particularly at our mills. Any of our manufacturing facilities,
    or any of our machines within such facilities, could cease
    operations unexpectedly for a long period of time due to a
    number of events, including unscheduled maintenance outages;
    prolonged power failures; an equipment failure; explosion of a
    boiler; labor difficulties; natural catastrophes; terrorism;
    governmental regulations; and other operational problems. These
    events could lead to higher costs and reduced earnings.



Environmental
    Matters — PCA may incur significant environmental
    liabilities with respect to both past and future
    operations.

We are subject to, and must comply with, a variety of federal,
    state and local environmental laws, particularly those relating
    to air and water quality, waste disposal and the cleanup of
    contaminated soil and groundwater. Because environmental
    regulations are constantly evolving, we have incurred, and will
    continue to incur, costs to maintain compliance with those laws.
    See Item 1. “Business — Environmental
    Matters” for certain estimates of expenditures we expect to
    make for environmental compliance in the next few years.
    Although we have established reserves to provide for known
    environmental liabilities as of the date of this filing, these
    reserves may change over time due to the enactment of new
    environmental laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or
    regulations, which might require additional significant
    environmental expenditures.

Investment
    Risks

Market
    Price of our Common Stock — The market price of our
    common stock may be volatile, which could cause the value of
    your investment to decline.

Securities markets worldwide periodically experience significant
    price declines and volume fluctuations. This market volatility,
    as well as general economic, market or political conditions,
    could reduce the market price of our common stock in spite of
    our operating performance. In addition, our operating results
    could be below the expectations of public market analysts and
    investors, and in response, the market price of our common stock
    could decrease significantly.

General
    Risks

Economic
    Conditions — Our earnings and cash generated from
    operations could be significantly lower if a severe downturn in
    the U.S. economy occurs.

Our operations and financial performance are directly impacted
    by changes in the U.S. economy, and to a lesser extent, by
    global economic conditions. The significant downturn in the
    U.S. economy began to impact our industry and PCA in the
    fourth quarter of 2008 and continued in 2009, lowering the
    demand for our products and our mill production. This lower
    demand and production reduced our revenues, increased our unit
    production costs, and lowered our earnings and our cash
    generated from operations. Demand for our products and
    PCA’s mill production improved during the second half of
    2009, but it is uncertain if economic conditions will again
    deteriorate or continue to improve. In the event that economic
    conditions deteriorate, our operating and financial performance
    will be adversely impacted. Lower earnings and reduced cash flow
    could impact our ability to fund operations, capital
    requirements, and common stock dividend payments, and a
    prolonged and severe downturn could possibly impact our ability
    to comply with our debt covenants.

PROPERTIES

The table below provides a summary of our containerboard mills,

In April, 2005, we shut down the number three paper machine at
    our Tomahawk mill after resuming operations on the number one
    paper machine at our Filer City mill. Shutting down the number
    three machine (out of 3 total paper machines) at Tomahawk
    reduces our total productive capacity by 65,000 tons at Tomahawk
    from 581,000 tons to 516,000 tons and reduces our total
    containerboard mill system capacity from 2,475,000 tons to
    2,410,000 tons. This action was based on market conditions and
    productivity and could change if market conditions or
    productivity levels change going forward.

We currently own our four containerboard mills and 44 of our
    corrugated manufacturing operations (37 corrugated plants and
    seven sheet plants). We also own one sawmill, an air-drying
    yard, one warehouse and miscellaneous other property, which
    includes sales offices and woodlands forest management offices.
    These sales offices and woodlands forest management offices
    generally have one to four employees and serve as administrative
    offices. PCA leases the space for three corrugated plants, 21
    sheet plants, six regional design centers, and numerous other
    distribution centers, warehouses and facilities. The equipment
    in these leased facilities is, in virtually all cases, owned by
    PCA, except for forklifts and other rolling stock which are
    generally leased.

We lease the cutting rights to approximately 91,000 acres
    of timberland located near our Valdosta mill (80,000 acres)
    and our Counce mill (11,000 acres). On average, these
    cutting rights agreements have terms with approximately
    15 years remaining.

We currently lease space for our corporate headquarters in Lake
    Forest, Illinois. The lease for the Lake Forest, Illinois
    facility is a short term, facility use agreement lease with
    automatic renewal rights. Specifically, this lease is a
    continuous

month-to-month

lease with unlimited automatic renewals entitling either party
    the right to terminate the lease with at least 8 months
    notice.

We currently believe that our owned and leased space for
    facilities and properties are sufficient to meet our operating
    requirements for the foreseeable future.

Item 3.

LEGAL
    PROCEEDINGS

PCA is a party to various legal actions arising in the ordinary
    course of our business. These legal actions cover a broad
    variety of claims spanning our entire business. As of the date
    of this filing, we believe it is not reasonably possible that
    the resolution of these legal actions will, individually or in
    the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our financial
    condition, results of operations or cash flows.

MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
    OPERATIONS

The following discussion of historical results of operations and
    financial condition should be read in conjunction with the
    audited financial statements and the notes thereto which appear
    elsewhere in this report.

Overview

PCA is the fifth largest producer of containerboard and
    corrugated products in the United States, based on production
    capacity. We operate four containerboard mills and 68 corrugated
    products manufacturing plants



throughout the United States. Approximately 80% of the
    containerboard tons produced at our mills are consumed in our
    corrugated products manufacturing plants. The remaining 20% is
    sold to domestic customers or the export market. We produce a
    wide variety of corrugated products ranging from basic
    corrugated shipping containers to specialized packaging such as
    wax-coated boxes for the agriculture industry. We also have
    multi-color printing capabilities to make high-impact graphics
    boxes and displays that offer our customers more attractive
    packaging.

In analyzing our operating performance, we focus on the
    following factors that affect our business and are important to
    consider when reviewing our financial and operating results:

•

containerboard and corrugated products demand;

•

corrugated products and containerboard pricing and mix;

•

cost trends and volatility for our major costs, including wood
    and recycled fiber, purchased fuels, electricity, labor and
    fringe benefits and transportation costs; and

•

cash flow from operations and capital expenditures.

Historically, supply and demand, as well as industry-wide
    inventory levels, have influenced prices of containerboard and
    corrugated products. In addition to U.S. shipments,
    approximately 10% of domestically produced containerboard has
    been exported for use in other countries.

The market for containerboard and corrugated products is
    generally subject to changes in the U.S. economy. The
    severe downturn in the economy began to significantly impact
    demand in the fourth quarter of 2008 and continued in 2009, with
    industry-wide corrugated products shipments down 7.7% in 2009
    compared to 2008. The industry, as well as PCA, began to see
    some improvement in demand as the economy improved. For the
    year, our corrugated products shipments were down only 4.6%
    compared to 2008 and steadily improved beginning in the second
    quarter of 2009. PCA mills ran to demand during the year at 94%
    of capacity after taking over 150,000 tons of downtime, both
    market and maintenance related. Compared to 2008, our mill
    production was down almost 100,000 tons. Industry supply and
    demand for containerboard was in balance, and industry
    containerboard inventories at the end of December 2009 were
    2,139,000 tons, the lowest December inventory level since 1980.

Prices for containerboard and corrugated products were lower
    during 2009 compared to 2008, with industry published prices for
    containerboard dropping $70 per ton. From January 2009 through
    May 2009, prices dropped $60 per ton, and prices dropped an
    additional $10 per ton in September 2009. Containerboard prices
    subsequently increased in January 2010, with industry published
    prices up $50 per ton, except for West coast shipments which
    increased $70 per ton.

Lower pricing as well as lower demand resulting from the
    economic downturn negatively impacted PCA’s 2009 earnings
    but these factors were partially offset by lower energy,
    transportation and input costs. Our costs for purchased fuels
    averaged approximately 22% lower for the full year 2009 compared
    to 2008, while transportation costs decreased 12% from prior
    year levels. Electricity costs, which typically lag fuel cost
    changes, rose slightly on average in 2009 as producers tried to
    recoup 2008 fuel cost increases in the beginning of 2009. By the
    fourth quarter of 2009, electricity costs were below the prior
    year levels. Published recycled fiber costs decreased, on
    average, 44% compared to 2008. Since the end of the year,
    however, recycled fiber costs have rebounded sharply, and have
    more than doubled from the 2009 average. Wood fiber costs in
    2009 were lower than they were in 2008 on average; however, in
    the fourth quarter poor weather conditions in the Southern U.S.
    made it difficult to access wood fiber, driving wood costs to
    higher levels. Average chemical costs for full year 2009 were
    comparable to 2008 with costs being higher than the previous
    year in the first half of 2009 and lower in the second half of
    2009.

Our earnings for 2009 also benefitted from alternative fuel
    mixture tax credits, which are fully described in Note 15
    to the consolidated financial statements. The alternative fuel
    mixture tax credit expired on December 31, 2009.



In the first quarter of 2010, we expect higher containerboard
    and box prices from announced price increases, but most of the
    earnings benefit will not be realized until the second quarter
    when the price increase has been passed through to box
    customers. We expect mill downtime and higher operating costs
    from our annual maintenance outage at Counce and our Valdosta
    mill outage for work related to our energy optimization project.
    Much higher recycled fiber costs, higher energy costs associated
    with colder weather, a higher effective tax rate and higher
    timing-related benefit costs are also expected in the first
    quarter. Considering all these items, we estimate our first
    quarter earnings will be lower than our fourth quarter earnings
    of $16 million, which excludes net income of
    $44 million from alternative fuel mixture tax credits and a
    $1 million after tax charge from asset disposals related to
    the energy optimization projects.

Net
    Sales

Net sales decreased by $212.9 million, or 9.0%, for the
    year ended December 31, 2009 from the year ended
    December 31, 2008. Net sales decreased primarily due to the
    impact of lower sales volume ($145.5 million) and decreased
    sales prices of corrugated products and containerboard
    ($67.4 million).

Total corrugated products volume sold decreased 4.6% to
    28.9 billion square feet in 2009 compared to
    30.3 billion square feet in 2008. On a comparable

shipment-per-workday

basis, corrugated products sales volume decreased 3.8% in 2009
    from 2008.

Shipments-per-workday

is calculated by dividing our total corrugated products volume
    during the year by the number of workdays within the year. The
    larger percentage decrease, on a total shipments basis, was due
    to the fact that 2009 had two fewer workdays (250 days),
    those days not falling on a weekend or holiday, than 2008
    (252 days). Containerboard sales volume to external
    domestic and export customers decreased 9.9% to 431,000 tons for
    the year ended December 31, 2009 from 478,000 tons in 2008.
    Outside sales of both corrugated products and containerboard
    began 2009 with significantly lower volumes compared to 2008 and
    steadily improved throughout the year.

Income
    from Operations

Income from operations increased by $110.7 million, or
    45.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to
    2008 primarily attributable to the alternative fuel mixture tax
    credit of $168.4 million described in Note 15 to the
    consolidated financial statements. Excluding the alternative
    fuel mixture tax credit, income from operations decreased
    $57.8 million for full year 2009, which was primarily
    attributable to decreased sales prices of corrugated products
    and containerboard ($67.4 million), lower sales volume
    ($52.5 million) and increased labor and fringe benefit
    costs ($8.0 million), partially offset by decreased costs
    of energy ($24.5 million), transportation
    ($23.7 million), recycled fiber ($18.9 million) and
    wood fiber costs ($3.5 million).



Gross profit decreased $64.8 million, or 13.2%, for the
    year ended December 31, 2009 from the year ended
    December 31, 2008. Gross profit as a percentage of net
    sales decreased from 20.8% of net sales in the year ended
    December 31, 2008 to 19.9% of net sales in the year ended
    December 31, 2009 primarily due to the decreases of sales
    prices and volume described previously.

Selling and administrative expenses were essentially unchanged,
    up 0.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2009 from the year
    ended December 31, 2008.

Corporate overhead for the year ended December 31, 2009
    decreased $6.5 million, or 10.6%, from the year ended
    December 31, 2008. The decrease was primarily attributable
    to lower salary and fringe benefit expenses ($5.9 million)
    and other items which were individually insignificant.

Other expense, net, decreased $0.7 million, or 4.7% for the
    year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended
    December 31, 2008. The decrease was primarily due to lower
    legal related costs ($1.6 million), partially offset by
    increased fixed asset disposal costs ($0.8 million).

Interest
    Expense, Net and Income Taxes

Interest expense, net of interest income, increased by
    $3.8 million, or 12.0%, for the year ended
    December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended
    December 31, 2008, due to lower interest rates on our
    investments, which reduced interest income by $5.0 million
    in 2009 compared to 2008.

PCA’s total effective tax rate was 16.1% for the year ended
    December 31, 2009 and 35.5% for the year ended
    December 31, 2008. The effective tax rate in 2009 varies
    from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35.0%
    principally due to the impact of the alternative fuel mixture
    tax credit, state and local income taxes and the domestic
    manufacturers’ deduction. PCA had no material changes to
    its uncertain tax positions under ASC 740, “Income
    Taxes,” in 2009.

Net
    Sales

Net sales increased by $44.5 million, or 1.9%, for the year
    ended December 31, 2008 from the year ended
    December 31, 2007. Net sales increased primarily due to
    increased sales prices of corrugated products and containerboard
    ($111.0 million), partially offset by the impact of lower
    sales volume ($66.5 million).

Total corrugated products volume sold decreased 2.9% to
    30.3 billion square feet in 2008 compared to
    31.2 billion square feet in 2007. On a comparable

shipment-per-workday

basis, corrugated products sales volume decreased 3.3% in 2008
    from 2007.

Shipments-per-workday

is calculated by dividing our total corrugated products volume
    during the year by the number of workdays within the year. The
    larger percentage decrease on a

shipment-per-workday

basis was due to the fact that 2008 had one more workday
    (252 days), those days not falling on a weekend or holiday,
    than 2007 (251 days). Containerboard sales volume to
    external



domestic and export customers decreased 11.7% to 478,000 tons
    for the year ended December 31, 2008 from 541,000 tons in
    2007.

Income
    from Operations

Income from operations decreased by $51.7 million, or
    17.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to
    2007. The decrease in income from operations was primarily
    attributable to increased energy and energy related costs
    including transportation ($56.2 million), lower sales
    volume ($44.4 million), increased costs for wood fiber
    ($25.1 million), labor ($17.6 million), medical
    ($8.9 million), bad debts ($4.1 million), legal
    matters ($3.4 million),

start-up

costs of two major mill projects ($3.2 million) and fixed
    asset disposals ($3.1 million). The impact of higher costs
    and lower volume was partially offset by increased sales prices
    ($111.0 million) and lower recycled fiber costs
    ($3.6 million).

Gross profit decreased $33.3 million, or 6.3%, for the year
    ended December 31, 2008 from the year ended
    December 31, 2007. Gross profit as a percentage of net
    sales decreased from 22.7% of net sales in the year ended
    December 31, 2007 to 20.8% of net sales in the year ended
    December 31, 2008 primarily due to the cost increases and
    reduced sales volume described previously.

Selling and administrative expenses increased $3.8 million,
    or 2.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2008 from the year
    ended December 31, 2007. The increase was primarily the
    result of higher expenses related to labor and fringe benefit
    costs ($1.5 million), warehousing costs due to customer
    requirements ($1.5 million) and travel, meeting and
    entertainment expenses ($0.5 million).

Corporate overhead for the year ended December 31, 2008
    increased $4.8 million, or 8.6%, from the year ended
    December 31, 2007. The increase was primarily attributable
    to increased salary and fringe benefit expenses
    ($4.5 million).

Other expense, net, increased $8.8 million, or 134.5% for
    the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended
    December 31, 2007. The increase was primarily due to higher
    legal related costs ($3.4 million), fixed asset disposal
    costs ($3.1 million), storm damage to our facilities
    ($1.0 million) and a gain on sale of land occurring in 2007
    ($0.8 million).

Interest
    Expense, Net and Income Taxes

Interest expense, net of interest income, increased by
    $6.1 million, or 23.8%, for the year ended
    December 31, 2008 compared to the full year 2007, primarily
    as a result of lower interest income ($6.2 million) earned
    on PCA’s cash equivalents and partially offset by lower
    interest expense ($0.1 million) related to PCA’s
    outstanding debt balances. The $6.2 million decrease in
    interest income was due both to lower interest income rates and
    lower cash balances during 2008 compared to 2007. The
    $0.1 million decrease in interest expense was due to a
    $2.4 million decrease in interest expense related to the
    Company’s receivables credit facility due to lower interest
    rates and a $1.4 million decrease in term loan interest
    expense as a result of the repayment of the term loan in March
    2008. This was almost completely offset by a $3.7 million
    increase in interest expense related to PCA’s senior notes
    as a result of the issuance in March 2008 of the


/


% notes
    due 2018, the proceeds of which were used to repay the


/


% notes
    due August 2008.

PCA’s effective tax rate was 35.5% for the year ended
    December 31, 2008 and 36.5% for the year ended
    December 31, 2007. The effective tax rate varies from the
    U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35.0% principally due to
    the impact of state and local income taxes offset by the
    domestic manufacturers’ deduction. The Company had no
    material changes to its uncertain tax positions under ASC 740,
    “Income Taxes,” in 2008.

Operating
    Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities increased
    $36.8 million, or 13.7%, to $306.1 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended
    December 31, 2008. Net income, excluding income from
    alternative fuel mixture tax credits (described in Note 15
    to the financial statements included in this report), was
    $94.6 million for 2009 compared to $135.6 million for
    2008, a decrease of $41.0 million that reduced net cash
    provided by operating activities by the same amount. This
    decrease, however, was more than offset by reduced operating
    cash requirements, including a $48.4 million net reduction
    in federal tax payments after applying alternative fuel mixture
    tax credits. During 2009, PCA’s cash taxes paid for both
    federal and state income taxes were $22.3 million.
    Additionally, requirements for operating assets and liabilities
    were lower by $33.9 million in 2009 compared to 2008,
    driven for the most part by receivables and payables levels,
    both of which were impacted by the economic downturn. This was
    partially offset by higher pension contributions in 2009. Cash
    requirements for operating activities are subject to PCA’s
    operating needs, the timing of collection of receivables and
    payments of payables and expenses, and seasonal fluctuations in
    the Company’s operations.

Net cash provided by operating activities decreased
    $30.8 million, or 10.3% to $269.3 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended
    December 31, 2007. The decrease in net cash provided by
    operating activities was primarily the result of lower net
    income in 2008 of $34.5 million, partially offset by lower
    requirements for operating assets and liabilities of
    $1.5 million. Changes in balances of operating assets and
    liabilities reflected the ordinary course of operation of
    PCA’s business during 2008. Requirements for operating
    assets and liabilities are subject to PCA’s operating
    needs, the timing of collection of receivables and the payments
    of payables and expenses, and to seasonal fluctuations in
    PCA’s operations. Working capital requirements were
    affected by the weak business conditions and significantly lower
    than expected demand for containerboard and corrugated products
    during the fourth quarter of 2008, resulting in a net increase
    in the requirements for accounts payable, accrued liabilities
    and accounts receivable of $32.6 million for the three
    months ended December 31, 2008 compared to the same period
    in 2007. During 2008, PCA’s cash taxes paid for both
    federal and state income taxes were $89.4 million.

Investing
    Activities

Net cash used for investing activities decreased
    $15.2 million, or 11.3%, to $119.3 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended
    December 31, 2008. The decrease was due to lower additions
    to property, plant and equipment of $18.8 million in 2009
    compared to 2008, which was partially offset by a
    $3.1 million acquisition completed during the third quarter
    of 2009 as described in Note 17 to the financial statements.

Net cash used for investing activities increased by
    $21.3 million, or 18.8%, to $134.5 million for the
    year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended
    December 31, 2007. The increase was primarily related to
    higher additions to property, plant and equipment of
    $19.5 million and higher additions to other long term
    assets of $1.4 million in the year ended December 31,
    2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007.

As of December 31, 2009, PCA had commitments for general
    purpose capital expenditures of $198.1 million for 2010,
    including $156.3 million for the major energy projects at
    its Counce and Valdosta



mills. PCA believes that

cash-on-hand

combined with cash flow from operations and alternative fuel
    mixture credits receivable will be sufficient to fund these
    commitments.

Financing
    Activities

Net cash used for financing activities totaled
    $75.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, a
    decrease of $138.0 million, or 64.7%, compared to the same
    period in 2008. The difference was primarily attributable to
    lower debt payments of $169.7 million in 2009, partially
    offset by $145.2 million in net proceeds received from
    PCA’s notes offering in 2008 described below. Additionally,
    PCA made no common stock repurchases in 2009 compared to
    $65.7 million in repurchases of PCA common stock during
    2008, and lower common stock dividends of $76.9 million
    paid in 2009 compared to $125.1 million paid in 2008.

Net cash used for financing activities totaled
    $213.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2008,
    an increase of $92.9 million, or 77.0%, from the year ended
    December 31, 2007. The increase was primarily attributable
    to higher debt payments of $160.2 million, higher
    repurchases of PCA common stock of $35.1 million,
    $20.0 million in additional dividends paid on PCA’s
    common stock and lower proceeds from the issuance of common
    stock upon exercise of stock options of $21.9 million
    during 2008 compared to 2007, partially offset by
    $145.2 million in net proceeds received from PCA’s
    notes offering .

In connection with the senior notes offering in March of 2008,
    PCA received proceeds, net of discount, of $149.9 million
    and paid $4.4 million for settlement of a treasury lock
    that it entered into to protect against increases in the
    ten-year U.S. Treasury rate, which served as a reference in
    determining the interest rate applicable to the notes. PCA also
    incurred financing costs in the amount of $0.3 million in
    connection with the senior notes offering. PCA used the proceeds
    of this offering, together with cash on hand, to repay all of
    the $150.0 million of outstanding


/


% senior
    notes that were due on August 1, 2008.

PCA holds an approximate 29% equity ownership interest in STV.
    PCA did not receive any dividends from STV in 2009, 2008 or 2007.

On November 29, 2000, PCA established an on-balance sheet
    securitization program for its trade accounts receivable. To
    effectuate this program, PCA formed a wholly-owned limited
    purpose subsidiary, Packaging Credit Company, LLC, or PCC, which
    in turn formed a wholly-owned, bankruptcy-remote,
    special-purpose subsidiary, Packaging Receivables Company, LLC,
    or PRC, for the purpose of acquiring receivables from PCC. Both
    of these entities are included in the consolidated financial
    statements of PCA. Under this program, PCC purchases on an
    ongoing basis substantially all of the receivables of PCA and
    sells such receivables to PRC. PRC and lenders established a
    $150.0 million receivables-backed revolving credit facility
    through which PRC obtains funds to purchase receivables from
    PCC. The receivables purchased by PRC are and will be solely the
    property of PRC. In the event of a liquidation of PRC, the
    creditors of PRC would be entitled to satisfy their claims from
    PRC’s assets prior to any distribution to PCC or PCA.
    Credit available under the receivables credit facility is on a
    borrowing-base formula. As a result, the full amount of the
    facility may not be available at all times. On April 15,
    2009, PCA extended its receivables credit facility through
    April 14, 2010. As of December 31, 2009,
    $109.0 million was outstanding. The highest outstanding
    principal balance under the receivables credit facility during
    fiscal 2009 was $109.0 million.

On July 21, 2003, PCA closed its offering and private

On March 31, 2008, PCA repaid all borrowings under its old
    senior credit facility. This facility was replaced with a senior
    credit facility that provides a new $150.0 million
    revolving credit facility, including a $35.0 million
    subfacility for letters of credit. The new senior credit
    facility closed on April 15, 2008. The new revolving credit
    facility is available to fund PCA’s working capital
    requirements, capital expenditures and other general corporate
    purposes. The new revolving credit facility will terminate in
    April 2013.

The above table excludes unamortized debt discount of
    $1.3 million at December 31, 2009 and interest
    payments on debt outstanding. Based on interest rates in effect
    and long-term debt balances outstanding as of December 31,
    2009, projected contractual interest payments would be
    approximately $34.9 million in 2009 and for each future
    year. For the purpose of this disclosure, PCA’s variable
    and fixed rate long-term debt would be replaced at maturity with
    similar long-term debt and similar interest rates. This
    disclosure does not attempt to predict changes in interest
    rates. See Item 7A. “Quantitative and Qualitative
    Disclosures About Market Risk” for the impact of changes in
    interest rates on PCA’s future cash flows.

The operating lease commitments, capital commitments, purchase
    commitments and letters of credit are not reflected on
    PCA’s consolidated balance sheet as of December 31,
    2009. See Notes 8 and 12 to the audited consolidated
    financial statements for additional information. PCA currently
    does not have any projections for future pension contributions
    beyond 2010. See Note 6 to the audited consolidated
    financial statements for additional information.

As of December 31, 2009, the Company’s expected
    payment for significant contractual obligations excludes
    $9.0 million of obligations for unrecognized tax benefits
    because the Company cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate
    of the period of cash settlement for such liability. See
    Note 14 to the audited consolidated financial statements
    for additional information.

PCA’s primary sources of liquidity are net cash provided by
    operating activities, borrowings under PCA’s revolving
    credit facility and additional borrowings under PCA’s
    receivables credit facility. As of December 31, 2009, PCA
    had $172.2 million in unused borrowing capacity under its
    existing credit facilities, net of the impact on this borrowing
    capacity of $18.8 million of outstanding letters of credit.
    Currently, PCA’s primary uses of cash are for operations,
    capital expenditures, debt service and declared common stock
    dividends, which it expects to be able to fund from these
    sources.



The following table provides the outstanding balances and the

The instruments governing PCA’s indebtedness contain
    financial and other covenants that limit, among other things,
    the ability of PCA and its subsidiaries to:

•

enter into sale and leaseback transactions,

•

incur liens,

•

incur indebtedness at the subsidiary level,

•

enter into certain transactions with affiliates, or

•

merge or consolidate with any other person or sell or otherwise
    dispose of all or substantially all of the assets of PCA.

These limitations could limit corporate and operating activities.

In addition, PCA must maintain minimum net worth and maximum
    debt to total capitalization and minimum interest coverage
    ratios under the revolving credit facility. A failure to comply
    with the restrictions contained in the revolving credit facility
    could lead to an event of default, which could result in an
    acceleration of any outstanding indebtedness

and/or

prohibit PCA from drawing on the revolving credit facility. Such
    an acceleration may also constitute an event of default under
    the senior notes indentures and the receivables credit facility.
    At December 31, 2009, PCA was in compliance with these
    covenants.

PCA currently expects to incur capital expenditures of
    $300.0 million in 2010, including up to $200.0 million
    for major energy optimization projects at its Counce and
    Valdosta mills. The remaining $100.0 million in
    expenditures will be used primarily for maintenance capital,
    cost reduction, business growth and environmental compliance.

PCA believes that net cash generated from operating activities,
    available cash reserves and alternative fuel mixture tax credit
    receivable, and available borrowings under its committed credit
    facilities and available capital through access to capital
    markets will be adequate to meet its liquidity and capital
    requirements, including payments of any declared common stock
    dividends, for the foreseeable future. As its debt or credit
    facilities become due, PCA will need to repay, extend or replace
    such facilities, which will be subject to future economic
    conditions and financial, business and other factors, many of
    which are beyond PCA’s control.



Environmental
    Matters

PCA is subject to, and must comply with, a variety of federal,
    state and local environmental laws, particularly those relating
    to air and water quality, waste disposal and the cleanup of
    contaminated soil and groundwater. The most significant of these
    laws affecting the Company are:

•

Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA);

•

Clean Water Act (CWA);

•

Clean Air Act (CAA);

•

The Emergency Planning and Community

Right-to-Know-Act

(EPCRA);

•

Toxic Substance Control Act (TSCA); and

•

Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA).

PCA believes that it is currently in material compliance with
    these and all applicable environmental rules and regulations.
    Because environmental regulations are constantly evolving, the
    Company has incurred, and will continue to incur, costs to
    maintain compliance with these and other environmental laws. The
    Company works diligently to anticipate and budget for the impact
    of applicable environmental regulations, and does not currently
    expect that future environmental compliance obligations will
    materially affect its business or financial condition. For the
    year ended December 31, 2009, we spent approximately
    $26.4 million to comply with the requirements of these and
    other environmental laws. For the years ended December 31,
    2008 and 2007, the costs of environmental compliance were
    approximately $23.5 million and $19.4 million,
    respectively.

As is the case with any industrial operation, PCA has, in the
    past, incurred costs associated with the remediation of soil or
    groundwater contamination, as required by the federal
    Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability
    Act, commonly known as the federal “Superfund” law,
    and analogous state laws. Cleanup requirements arise with
    respect to properties the Company currently owns or operates,
    former facilities and off-site facilities where the Company has
    disposed of hazardous substances. As part of the April 12,
    1999 transaction, Pactiv has agreed to retain all liability for
    all former facilities and all sites associated with pre-closing
    off-site waste disposal. Pactiv has also retained
    environmentally impaired real property in Filer City, Michigan
    unrelated to current mill operations.

Because liability for remediation costs under environmental laws
    is strict, meaning that liability is imposed without fault,
    joint and several, meaning that liability is imposed on each
    party without regard to contribution, and retroactive, PCA could
    receive notifications of cleanup liability in the future and
    this liability could be material. From 1994 through 2009,
    remediation costs at PCA’s mills and corrugated plants
    totaled approximately $3.2 million. As of December 31,
    2009, PCA maintained an environmental reserve of
    $9.1 million relating to

on-site

landfills and surface impoundments as well as ongoing and
    anticipated remedial projects. Total capital costs for
    environmental matters were $0.4 million for 2009, and the
    Company currently estimates 2010 environmental capital
    expenditures will be $1.2 million. As of this filing, the
    Company believes that it is not reasonably possible that future
    environmental expenditures above the $9.1 million accrued
    as of December 31, 2009 will have a material impact on its
    financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

While legislation regarding the regulation of greenhouse gas
    emissions has been proposed at the federal level, it is
    uncertain whether such legislation will be passed and, if so,
    what the breadth and scope of such legislation will be. The
    result of the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could be an
    increase in our future environmental compliance costs, through
    caps, taxes or additional capital expenditures to modify
    facilities, which may be material. However, climate change
    legislation and the resulting future energy policy could also
    provide us with opportunities if the use of renewable energy is
    encouraged. We currently generate a significant portion of our
    power requirements for our mills using bark, black liquor and
    biomass as fuel, which are derived from renewable resources. Our
    energy optimization projects at the Counce and Valdosta
    linerboard mills are expected to nearly eliminate the use of
    fossil fuels at those facilities by the end of 2011, while



providing more efficient power generation at those facilities.
    While we believe we are well-positioned to take advantage of any
    renewable energy incentives, it is uncertain what the ultimate
    costs and opportunities of any climate change legislation will
    be and how our business and industry will be affected.

Critical
    Accounting Policies

Management’s discussion and analysis of PCA’s
    financial condition and results of operations are based upon the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements, which have
    been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of
    these financial statements requires the Company to make
    estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of
    assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related
    disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing
    basis, PCA evaluates its estimates, including those related to
    bad debts, inventories, goodwill and intangible assets, pensions
    and other postretirement benefits, income taxes, environmental
    liabilities, stock based compensation, and contingencies and
    litigation. PCA bases its estimates on historical experience and
    on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable
    under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for
    making judgments about the carrying values of assets and
    liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
    Actual results may differ from these estimates under different
    assumptions or conditions.

PCA believes the following critical accounting policies affect
    its more significant judgments and estimates used in the
    preparation of its consolidated financial statements. For a
    further discussion on the application of these and other
    accounting policies, see Note 2 to its consolidated
    financial statements included elsewhere in this report.

Accounts
    Receivable — Allowance for Doubtful Accounts and
    Customer Deductions

PCA evaluates the collectibility of its accounts receivable
    based upon a combination of factors. In circumstances where the
    Company is aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet
    its financial obligations (e.g., bankruptcy filings, substantial
    downgrading of credit sources), PCA records a specific reserve
    for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recorded
    receivable to the amount the Company reasonably believes will be
    collected. For all other customers, the Company recognizes
    reserves for bad debts based on its historical collection
    experience. If the Company’s collection experience
    deteriorates (i.e., higher than expected defaults or an
    unexpected material adverse change in a major customer’s
    ability to meet its financial obligations), PCA’s estimates
    of the recoverability of amounts due could be reduced by a
    material amount.

The customer deductions reserve represents the estimated amount
    required for customer returns, allowances and earned discounts.
    Based on PCA’s experience, customer returns, allowances and
    earned discounts have averaged 1.0% of its gross selling price.
    Accordingly, the Company reserves 1.0% of its open customer
    accounts receivable balance for these items.

As of December 31, 2009, the balance in the allowance for
    doubtful accounts reserve was $3.9 million, compared to
    $4.4 million at December 31, 2008. Bad debt expense in
    2009 was $1.5 million, compared to $4.2 million in
    2008. The decrease in bad debt expense of $2.7 million was
    primarily attributable to a $1.4 million decrease in
    expense related to customers who had filed for bankruptcy and a
    recovery of $1.4 million from one customer that had
    previously filed for bankruptcy. For the year ended
    December 31, 2008, bad debt expense was $4.2 million
    compared to $0.1 million in 2007. The increase in bad debt
    expense of $4.1 million was primarily attributable to a
    $2.7 million increase in expense related to customers who
    had filed for bankruptcy and an increase of $1.1 million
    reserved for specific customers at the 90% level of their
    accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2008.

Inventories

PCA records its inventories at the lower of cost or market and
    includes all costs directly associated with manufacturing
    products: materials, labor and manufacturing overhead. The
    estimated market value is based on assumptions for future demand
    and related pricing. If actual market conditions are less
    favorable than those projected by management, reductions in the
    carrying value of inventories may be required. Raw materials,



work in process and finished goods valued using the

last-in,

first-out (“LIFO”) cost method comprised 62% and 64%
    of inventories at current cost at December 31, 2009 and
    2008, respectively. Supplies and materials inventories are
    valued using a moving average cost.

Pension
    and Postretirement Benefits

The Company accounts for defined benefit pension plans and
    postretirement plans in accordance with Accounting Standards
    Codification (“ASC”) 715,
    “Compensation — Retirement Benefits.”

One of the principal assumptions used to calculate net periodic
    pension cost is the expected long-term rate of return on plan
    assets. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets may
    result in recognized returns that are greater or less than the
    actual returns on those plan assets in any given year. Over
    time, however, the expected long-term rate of return on plan
    assets is designed to approximate the actual long term returns.

The discount rate assumptions used to calculate net periodic
    pension and postretirement costs reflect the rates available on
    high-quality, fixed-income debt instruments on December 31.
    The rate of compensation increase is another significant
    assumption used to calculate net periodic pension cost and is
    determined by PCA based upon annual reviews.

For postretirement health care plan accounting, PCA reviews
    external data and its own historical trends for health care
    costs to determine the health care cost trend rate assumption.

Environmental
    Liabilities

PCA accounts for its retirement obligations related to its
    landfills under ASC 410, “Asset Retirement and
    Environmental Obligations,” which requires legal
    obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets
    to be recognized at their fair value at the time that the
    obligations are incurred. Upon initial recognition of a
    liability, that cost is capitalized as part of the related
    long-lived asset and amortized to expense over the useful life
    of the asset.

The potential costs for various environmental matters are
    uncertain due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of
    possible cleanup costs, the complexity and evolving nature of
    governmental laws and regulations and their interpretations, and
    the timing, varying costs and effectiveness of alternative
    cleanup technologies. Liabilities recorded for environmental
    contingencies are estimates of the probable costs based upon
    available information and assumptions. Because of these
    uncertainties, however, the Company’s estimates may change.
    PCA believes that any additional costs identified as further
    information becomes available would not have a material effect
    on its financial statements.

In connection with the sale to PCA of the containerboard and
    corrugated products business of Pactiv Corporation in April
    1999, Pactiv agreed to retain all liability for all former
    facilities and all sites associated with off-site waste disposal
    prior to April 12, 1999. Pactiv also retained the
    environmental liability for a closed landfill located near the
    Filer City mill.

Revenue
    Recognition

PCA recognizes revenue as title to the products is transferred
    to customers. Shipping and handling costs are included in cost
    of sales. Shipping and handling billings to a customer are
    included in net sales. In addition, PCA offers volume rebates to
    certain of its customers. The total cost of these programs is
    estimated and accrued as a reduction to net sales at the time of
    the respective sale.

Impairment
    of Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets

Goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter
    or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that
    the carrying amount may exceed fair value. Recoverability of
    goodwill is determined by comparing the fair value of the
    reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill. If
    the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair
    value, the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s



goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of its goodwill to
    determine if a write-down to fair value is necessary.

Long-lived assets other than goodwill are reviewed for
    impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
    that the carrying amount of any long-lived asset may not be
    fully recoverable. In the event that facts and circumstances
    indicate that the carrying amount of any long-lived assets may
    be impaired, an evaluation of recoverability would be performed.
    If an evaluation were required, the estimated future
    undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset (or group of
    assets) would be compared to the asset’s (or group of
    assets’) carrying amount to determine if a write-down to
    fair value is required.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

PCA measures and records stock-based compensation cost in
    accordance with ASC 718, “Compensation — Stock
    Compensation.” Stock compensation cost includes:
    (a) compensation cost for all share-based payments granted
    prior to, but not vested as of January 1, 2006, the
    effective date of ASC 718, and (b) compensation costs for
    all share-based payments granted subsequent to January 1,
    2006. The grant date fair value is estimated in accordance with
    the provisions of ASC 718.

PCA recognizes compensation expense associated with option
    awards ratably over their vesting periods. The Company uses the
    Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model to estimate the fair
    value of each option grant as of the date of grant. Expected
    volatilities are based on historical volatility of the
    Company’s common stock. The expected life of the option is
    estimated using historical data pertaining to option exercises
    and employee terminations. Separate groups of employees that
    have similar historical exercise behavior are considered
    separately for estimating the expected life. The risk-free
    interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury yields in effect at
    the time of grant.

The fair value of restricted stock awards is determined based on
    the closing price of PCA’s common stock on the grant date.
    The Company generally recognizes compensation expense associated
    with restricted stock awards ratably over their vesting periods.
    As PCA’s Board of Directors has the ability to accelerate
    the vesting of restricted stock upon an employee’s
    retirement, the Company accelerates the recognition of
    compensation expense for certain employees approaching normal
    retirement age.

Income
    Taxes

PCA’s annual tax rate is determined based on income,
    statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated
    differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting
    purposes. Tax law requires some items to be included in the tax
    return at different times than the items reflected in the
    financial statements. As a result, the annual tax rate in the
    financial statements is different than the rate reported on
    PCA’s tax return. Some of these differences are permanent,
    such as expenses that are not deductible in the tax return, and
    some differences are temporary, reversing over time, such as
    depreciation expense. These temporary differences create
    deferred tax assets and liabilities.

Inherent in determining the annual tax rate are judgments
    regarding business plans, planning opportunities and
    expectations about future outcomes. Significant management
    judgments are required for the following items:

•

Management reviews PCA’s deferred tax assets for
    realizability. Valuation allowances are established when
    management believes that it is more likely than not that some
    portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Changes
    in valuation allowances from period to period are included in
    the tax provision.

•

PCA establishes accruals for uncertain tax contingencies when,
    despite the belief that PCA’s tax return positions are
    fully supported, PCA believes that an uncertain tax position
    does not meet the recognition threshold of ASC 740, “Income
    Taxes.” The tax contingency accruals are adjusted in light
    of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of tax
    audits, the expiration of the statute of limitations for the
    relevant taxing authority to examine a tax return, case law and
    emerging legislation. While it is difficult to predict the final
    outcome or timing of resolution for any particular tax matter,
    PCA believes



that the accruals for uncertain tax contingencies at
    December 31, 2009 reflect the likely outcome of known tax
    contingencies as of such date in accordance with uncertain tax
    positions under ASC 740.

Item 7A.

QUANTITATIVE
    AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

PCA is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and
    changes in the market value of its financial instruments. PCA
    periodically enters into derivatives in order to minimize these
    risks, but not for trading purposes. For a discussion of
    derivatives and hedging activities, see Note 2 to
    PCA’s consolidated financial statement included elsewhere
    in the report.

The interest rates on approximately 84% of PCA’s debt are
    fixed. A one percent increase in interest rates related to
    variable rate debt would have resulted in an increase in
    interest expense and a corresponding decrease in income before
    taxes of $1.1 million annually. In the event of a change in
    interest rates, management could take actions to mitigate its
    exposure to the change. However, due to the uncertainty of the
    specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects,
    the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in PCA’s
    financial structure.

CONTROLS
    AND PROCEDURES

Controls
    and Procedures

PCA maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in

Rule 13a-15(e)

of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that are designed
    to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be
    disclosed in PCA’s filings under the Securities Exchange
    Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
    periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that
    such information is accumulated and communicated to PCA’s
    management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions
    regarding required disclosure.

Prior to filing this report, PCA completed an evaluation under
    the supervision and with the participation of PCA’s
    management, including PCA’s Chief Executive Officer and
    Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and
    operation of PCA’s disclosure controls and procedures as of
    December 31, 2009. The evaluation of PCA’s disclosure
    controls and procedures included a review of the controls’
    objectives and design, PCA’s implementation of the controls
    and the effect of the controls on the information generated for
    use in this report. Based on this evaluation, PCA’s Chief
    Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that
    PCA’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at
    the reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2009.

During the quarter ended December 31, 2009, there were no
    changes in internal controls over financial reporting that have
    materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
    affect, PCA’s internal control over financial reporting.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

PCA’s management is responsible for establishing and
    maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting,
    as such term is defined in Exchange Act

Rule 13a-15(f).

Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed
    to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
    financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
    for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting



principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes
    those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the
    maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
    and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the
    Company’s assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance
    that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
    preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
    accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
    expenditures are being made only with proper authorizations; and
    (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
    timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
    disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a
    material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, PCA’s internal control
    over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
    misstatements. A control system, no matter how well conceived
    and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,
    assurance that objectives of the control system are met. Because
    of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no
    evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all
    control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been
    detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness
    to future periods are subject to the risk that controls become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.

PCA’s management, under the supervision of and with the
    participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer, assessed the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on
    criteria for effective control over financial reporting
    described in “Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this
    assessment, PCA’s management concluded that its internal
    control over financial reporting was effective as of
    December 31, 2009, based on the specified criteria.

Ernst & Young LLP, the independent registered public
    accounting firm that audited PCA’s financial statements
    included in this

Form 10-K,

has also audited the effectiveness of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting. Their attestation
    report precedes PCA’s audited financial statements included
    elsewhere in this report.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Packaging Corporation of America

Board of Directors and Stockholders

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Packaging Corporation of America (the “Company”) as of
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the related consolidated
    statements of income, changes in stockholders’ equity, and
    cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2009. Our audits also included the financial
    statement schedule listed in the index at Item 15(a). These
    financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the
    Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our
    audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
    present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
    financial position of Packaging Corporation of America at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the consolidated results of
    its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in
    the period ended December 31, 2009, in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our
    opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when
    considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken
    as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the
    information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 6 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for
    pension and postretirement benefits effective December 31,
    2008, and as discussed in Note 14 to the consolidated
    financial statements, the Company changed its method of
    accounting for uncertainty in income taxes effective
    January 1, 2007.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
    Packaging Corporation of America’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
    the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 17,
    2010 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Packaging Corporation of America

Board of Directors and Stockholders

We have audited Packaging Corporation of America’s internal
    control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009,
    based on criteria established in Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria).
    Packaging Corporation of America’s management is
    responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
    financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness
    of internal control over financial reporting included in
    Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
    company’s internal control over financial reporting based
    on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
    management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
    such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
    circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
    basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Packaging Corporation of America maintained, in
    all material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on the COSO
    criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of Packaging Corporation of America
    as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the related
    consolidated statements of income, changes in stockholders’
    equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
    ended December 31, 2009, and our report dated
    February 17, 2010, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Notes

December 31,

1.

BASIS OF
    PRESENTATION AND NATURE OF BUSINESS

Packaging Corporation of America (“PCA” or the
    “Company”) was incorporated on January 25, 1999.
    On April 12, 1999, PCA acquired the containerboard and
    corrugated packaging products business of Pactiv Corporation
    (“Pactiv”), formerly known as Tenneco Packaging Inc.,
    a wholly owned subsidiary of Tenneco Inc. PCA had no operations
    from the date of incorporation on January 25, 1999 to
    April 11, 1999.

The Company is comprised of mills and corrugated manufacturing
    operations. The mill operations (the “Mills”) consist
    of two kraft linerboard mills located in Counce, Tennessee, and
    Valdosta, Georgia, and two medium mills located in Filer City,
    Michigan, and Tomahawk, Wisconsin. The Company leased the
    cutting rights to approximately 91,000 acres of timberland
    as of December 31, 2009. The Mills transfer the majority of
    their containerboard produced to PCA’s corrugated products
    plants.

PCA’s corrugated manufacturing operations consist of 68
    plants, with 40 operating as combining operations, or corrugated
    plants, and 28 as sheet plants; a technical and development
    center; six graphic design centers; a rotogravure printing
    operation and a complement of packaging supplies and
    distribution centers. All plants are located in the continental
    United States. Corrugated plants combine linerboard and medium
    into sheets that are converted into corrugated shipping
    containers,

point-of-sale

graphics packaging,

point-of-purchase

displays and other specialized packaging. Sheet plants purchase
    sheets primarily from PCA corrugated products plants to use in
    the finished corrugated products converting process. The
    corrugated manufacturing operations sell to diverse customers
    primarily in North America.

As of December 31, 2009, PCA had approximately
    8,000 employees. Approximately 2,400 of these employees
    were salaried and approximately 5,600 were hourly. Approximately
    75% of its hourly employees are represented by unions. The
    majority of its unionized employees are represented primarily by
    the United Steel Workers (USW), the International Brotherhood of
    Teamsters (IBT), and the International Association of Machinists
    (IAM).

Based on an agreement reached with the USW in August 2008, the
    existing labor agreements at PCA’s containerboard mills
    covering USW-represented employees (89% of mill hourly
    workforce) were extended five years. With this extension, the
    USW contracts at the Company’s mills are currently set to
    expire between September 2013 and June 2015. Agreements with
    other union mill employees (11% of mill hourly workforce) expire
    between June 2012 and October 2014. Based on an agreement
    reached with the USW in April 2009, the labor agreement at 25
    corrugated plants covering USW represented employees was
    extended up to five years. Contracts for unionized corrugated
    products plant employees expire between March 2010 and December
    2014. The Company is currently in negotiations to renew or
    extend any union contracts that have recently expired or are
    expiring in the near future.

SUMMARY
    OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis
    of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements of PCA
    include all majority-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany
    transactions have been eliminated. The Company has one joint
    venture that is accounted for under the equity method.

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires
    management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
    amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes.
    Actual results could differ from those estimates.

F-8


Packaging
    Corporation of America

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

December 31,

Cash
    and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include all cash balances and highly
    liquid investments with a maturity, when acquired, of three
    months or less. Cash equivalents are stated at cost, which
    approximates market.

Accounts
    Receivable

The collectibility of PCA’s accounts receivable is based
    upon a combination of factors. In circumstances where a specific
    customer is unable to meet its financial obligations to PCA
    (e.g., bankruptcy filings, substantial downgrading of credit
    sources), a specific reserve for bad debts is recorded against
    amounts due to the Company to reduce the net recorded receivable
    to the amount the Company reasonably believes will be collected.
    For all other customers, reserves for bad debts are recognized
    based on historical collection experience. If collection
    experience deteriorates (i.e., higher than expected defaults or
    an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer’s
    ability to meet its financial obligations to us), the estimate
    of the recoverability of amounts due could be reduced by a
    material amount.

The customer deductions reserve represents the estimated amount
    required for customer returns, allowances and earned discounts.
    Based on the Company’s experience, customer returns,
    allowances and earned discounts have averaged 1.0% of gross
    selling price. Accordingly, PCA reserves 1.0% of its open
    customer accounts receivable balance for these items.

At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the allowance for doubtful
    accounts was $3.9 million and $4.4 million,
    respectively. The reserve for customer deductions of
    $2.4 million and $2.5 million at December 31,
    2009 and 2008, respectively, are also included as a reduction of
    the accounts receivable balance.

Inventories

With the exception of inventories at PCA’s Chicago
    corrugated products plants, which were acquired in 2004 and
    2009, raw materials, work in process and finished goods are
    valued using the

last-in,

first-out (“LIFO”) cost method. Inventories at the
    Chicago plants are valued at the

first-in,

first-out (“FIFO”) cost method. Supplies and materials
    are valued using a moving average cost. All inventories are
    stated at the lower of cost or market and include all costs
    directly associated with manufacturing products: materials,
    labor and manufacturing overhead. Inventories valued using the
    LIFO method totaled $169.2 million and $173.5 million,
    respectively, as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, compared to
    total inventory values (before the LIFO inventory reserve) of
    $275.9 million and $272.8 million for the same
    respective periods.

Depreciation is computed on the straight-line basis over the
    estimated useful lives of the related assets. Assets under
    capital leases are depreciated on the straight-line method over
    the term of the lease or the useful life, if shorter. The
    following lives are used for the various categories of assets:

Buildings and land improvements

5 to 40 years

Machinery and equipment

3 to 25 years

Trucks and automobiles

3 to 10 years

Furniture and fixtures

3 to 20 years

Computers and hardware

3 to 7 years

Leasehold improvements

Period of the lease or

useful life, if shorter

The amount of depreciation expense was $148.2 million,
    $143.3 million and $144.6 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
    Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as
    incurred.

Pursuant to the terms of an industrial revenue bond, title to
    certain property, plant and equipment was transferred to a
    municipal development authority in order to receive a property
    tax abatement. The title of these assets will revert back to PCA
    upon retirement or cancellation of the bond. The assets are
    included in the consolidated balance sheet under the caption
    “Property, plant and equipment, net” as all risks and
    rewards remain with the Company.

Goodwill
    and Intangible Assets

The Company has capitalized certain intangible assets, primarily
    customer lists and relationships, covenants not to compete and
    goodwill, based on their estimated fair value at the date of
    acquisition. Amortization is provided for customer lists and
    relationships on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from
    six to 40 years. Covenants not to compete are amortized on
    a straight-line basis over the terms of the respective
    agreements. Goodwill, which amounted to $38.9 million and
    $37.2 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively, is not being amortized but is subject to annual
    impairment tests in accordance with Accounting Standards
    Codification (“ASC”) 350,
    “Intangibles — Goodwill and Other.” The
    Company

performs the impairment tests in the fourth quarter or sooner if
    events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
    amount may exceed fair value. Recoverability of goodwill is
    determined by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit
    with its carrying value, including goodwill. If the carrying
    amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value, the implied
    fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is compared to
    the carrying amount of its goodwill to determine if a write-down
    to fair value is necessary. The Company concluded that no
    impairment of goodwill existed at the time of the annual
    impairment tests in 2009, 2008 and 2007.

Other
    Long-Term Assets

PCA has capitalized certain costs related to obtaining its
    financing. These costs are amortized to interest expense using
    the effective interest rate method over the terms of the senior
    credit facilities and senior notes, which range from five to ten
    years. Unamortized deferred financing costs were
    $1.8 million and $2.4 million as of December 31,
    2009 and 2008, respectively.

PCA leases the cutting rights to approximately 91,000 acres
    of timberland and capitalizes the annual lease payments and
    reforestation costs associated with these leases. These costs
    are recorded as depletion when timber is harvested and used in
    PCA’s business operations or sold to customers. Capitalized
    long-term lease costs were $22.9 million and
    $22.1 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. The amount of depletion expense was
    $1.2 million, $1.4 million and $1.5 million for
    the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively.

PCA capitalizes certain costs related to the purchase and
    development of software which is used in its business
    operations. The costs attributable to these software systems are
    amortized over their estimated useful lives based on various
    factors such as the effects of obsolescence, technology and
    other economic factors. Net capitalized software costs were
    $1.5 million and $1.8 million as of December 31,
    2009 and 2008, respectively. Software amortization expense was
    $0.5 million, $0.3 million and $0.4 million for
    the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively.

Impairment
    of Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived assets other than goodwill are reviewed for
    impairment in accordance with provisions of ASC 360,
    “Property, Plant and Equipment.” In the event that
    facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any
    long-lived assets may be impaired, an evaluation of
    recoverability would be performed. If an evaluation is required,
    the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the
    asset (or group of assets) would be compared to the asset’s
    (or group of assets’) carrying amount to determine if a
    write-down to fair value is required. The Company concluded that
    no impairment of long-lived assets existed in 2009, 2008 and
    2007.

Pension
    and Postretirement Benefits

One of the principal assumptions used to calculate net periodic
    pension cost is the expected long-term rate of return on plan
    assets. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets may
    result in recognized returns that are greater or less than the
    actual returns on those plan assets in any given year. Over
    time, however, the expected long-term rate of return on plan
    assets is designed to approximate the actual long term returns.

The discount rate assumptions used to calculate net periodic
    pension and postretirement cost reflect the rates available on
    high-quality, fixed-income debt instruments on
    December 31st of each year. The rate of compensation
    increase is another significant assumption used to calculate net
    periodic pension cost and is determined by the Company based
    upon annual reviews.

December 31,

For postretirement health care plan accounting, the Company
    reviews external data and its own historical trends for health
    care costs to determine the health care cost trend rate
    assumption.

Environmental
    Matters

Environmental expenditures related to existing conditions
    resulting from past or current operations from which no current
    or future benefit is discernible are expensed as incurred.
    Environmental expenditures that extend the life of the related
    property or mitigate or prevent future environmental
    contamination are capitalized. Liabilities are recorded for
    environmental contingencies when such costs are probable and
    reasonably estimable. These liabilities are adjusted as further
    information develops or circumstances change.

Asset
    Retirement Obligations

The Company accounts for its retirement obligations related to
    its landfills under ASC 410, “Asset Retirement and
    Environmental Obligations,” which requires legal
    obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets
    to be recognized at their fair value at the time that the
    obligations are incurred. Upon initial recognition of a
    liability, that cost is capitalized as part of the related
    long-lived asset and amortized to expense over the useful life
    of the asset.

Income
    Taxes

PCA utilizes the liability method of accounting for income taxes
    whereby it recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for
    the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the
    tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts
    in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets will be reduced
    by a valuation allowance if, based upon management’s
    estimates, it is more likely than not, that a portion of the
    deferred tax assets will not be realized in a future period. The
    estimates utilized in the recognition of deferred tax assets are
    subject to revision in future periods based on new facts or
    circumstances.

PCA’s practice is to recognize interest and penalties
    related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense.

Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments

PCA measures the fair value of its financial instruments in
    accordance with ASC 820, “Fair Value Measurements and
    Disclosures.” The guidance defines fair value as the price
    that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a
    liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.
    It is determined based on assumptions that market participants
    would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for
    considering such assumptions, ASC 820 establishes the following
    hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies
    used to measure fair value:

Level 1 — Valuations based on quoted prices for
    identical assets and liabilities in active markets.

Level 2 — Valuations based on observable inputs
    other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as
    quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active
    markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and
    liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that
    are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.

Level 3 — Valuations based on unobservable inputs
    in which there is little or no market data, which require the
    reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.

The Company measures the fair value of money market funds based
    on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or
    liabilities. See Note 6 for information about PCA’s
    pension plans’ assets measured at fair value.

Planned
    Major Maintenance Activities

The Company accounts for its planned major maintenance
    activities in accordance with ASC 360, “Property, Plant,
    and Equipment,” using the deferral method. All maintenance
    costs incurred during the year are expensed in the fiscal year
    in which the maintenance activity occurs.

Revenue
    Recognition

The Company recognizes revenue as title to the products is
    transferred to customers. Shipping and handling billings to a
    customer are included in net sales. Shipping and handling costs
    are included in cost of sales. In addition, the Company offers
    volume rebates to certain of its customers. The total cost of
    these programs is estimated and accrued as a reduction to net
    sales at the time of the respective sale.

Research
    and Development

Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. The
    amount charged to expense was $9.4 million,
    $8.3 million and $7.6 million for the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Interest
    Expense, Net

Interest expense, net, includes interest income of
    $0.1 million, $5.2 million and $9.5 million for
    the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively, and amortization of the net gain on treasury lock
    settlements in July 2003 and March 2008 of $1.8 million,
    $2.4 million and $3.1 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively.

Industry
    Agreements

PCA regularly trades containerboard with other manufacturers
    primarily to reduce shipping costs. Containerboard trade
    agreements are a long-standing industry practice. These
    agreements are entered into on an annual basis, in which both
    parties agree to ship an identical number of tons to each other
    within the agreement period. These agreements minimize
    transportation cost by allowing each party’s containerboard
    mills to ship containerboard to the other party’s closest
    corrugated products plant. PCA tracks each shipment to ensure
    that the other party’s shipments to the Company match its
    shipments to them during the agreement period. Such transfers
    are possible because containerboard is a commodity product with
    no distinguishing product characteristics. These transactions
    are accounted for at carrying value, and revenue is not recorded
    as the transactions do not represent the culmination of an
    earnings process. The transactions are recorded into inventory
    accounts, and no income is recorded until such inventory is
    converted to a finished product and sold to an end-use customer.

Segment
    Information

PCA is engaged in one line of business: the integrated
    manufacture and sale of packaging materials, boxes and
    containers for industrial and consumer markets. No single
    customer accounts for more than 10% of total net sales.

Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities

The Company records its derivatives in accordance with ASC 815,
    “Derivatives and Hedging.” The guidance requires the
    Company to recognize derivative instruments as either assets or
    liabilities in the balance sheet at fair value. The accounting
    for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the
    intended use and designation of the derivative instrument. For a
    derivative designated as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss

F-13


Packaging
    Corporation of America

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

December 31,

on the derivative is recognized in earnings in the period of
    change in fair value together with the offsetting gain or loss
    on the hedged item. For a derivative instrument designated as a
    cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the derivative’s
    gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated
    other comprehensive income (loss) (“OCI”) and is
    subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure
    affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss is
    recognized in earnings.

Hedging
    Strategy

PCA is exposed to certain risks relating to its ongoing
    operations. When appropriate, the Company uses derivatives as a
    risk management tool to mitigate the potential impact of certain
    market risks. The primary risks managed by using derivative
    financial instruments are interest rate and foreign currency
    exchange rate risks. PCA does not enter into derivative
    financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

Interest
    Rate Risk

The Company has historically used derivative instruments to
    manage interest costs and the risk associated with changing
    interest rates. On June 12, 2003, in connection with a
    contemplated issuance of ten-year debt securities, PCA entered
    into an interest rate protection agreement with a counterparty
    to protect against increases in the ten-year U.S. Treasury
    Note rate. On January 17, 2008, in connection with a
    contemplated issuance of ten-year debt securities, PCA entered
    into an interest rate protection agreement with a counterparty
    to protect against increases in the ten-year U.S. Treasury
    Note rate. These treasury rates served as references in
    determining the interest rates applicable to the debt securities
    the Company issued in July 2003 and March 2008, respectively. As
    a result of changes in the interest rates on those treasury
    securities between the time PCA entered into the agreements and
    the time PCA priced and issued the debt securities, the Company:
    (1) received a payment of $22.8 million from the
    counterparty upon settlement of the 2003 interest rate
    protection agreement on July 21, 2003; and (2) made a
    payment of $4.4 million to the counterparty upon settlement
    of the 2008 interest rate protection agreement on March 25,
    2008. The Company recorded the settlements in accumulated other
    comprehensive income (loss) and is amortizing the
    $22.8 million gain and the $4.4 million loss to
    interest expense over the lives of the respective notes. As of
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company was not a
    party to any interest rate derivative instruments.

Foreign
    Currency Exchange Rate Risk

In connection with the energy optimization project at its
    Valdosta, Georgia mill, the Company entered into foreign
    currency forward contracts on December 18, 2009 to hedge
    its exposure to forecasted purchases of machinery and equipment
    with prices denominated in foreign currencies. The foreign
    currency forward contracts were properly documented and
    designated as cash flow hedges at inception. At
    December 31, 2009, the change in fair value of the foreign
    currency derivatives was immaterial to PCA’s financial
    position or results of operations.

Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements

In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update
    (“ASU”)

2010-06,

“Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (Topic
    820) — Improving Disclosures about Fair Value
    Measurements.” This ASU requires some new disclosures and
    clarifies some existing disclosure requirements about fair value
    measurement as set forth in Accounting Standards Codification
    (“ASC”) 820. ASU

2010-06

amends ASC 820 to now require: (1) a reporting entity
    should disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers
    in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value
    measurements and describe the reasons for the transfers; and
    (2) in the reconciliation for fair value measurements using
    significant unobservable inputs, a reporting entity should
    present separately information about purchases, sales,
    issuances,

and settlements. In addition, ASU

2010-06

clarifies the requirements of existing disclosures. ASU

2010-06

is
    effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning
    after December 15, 2009, except for the disclosures about
    purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements in the roll forward
    of activity in Level 3 fair value measurements. Those
    disclosures are effective for fiscal years beginning after
    December 15, 2010, and for interim periods within those
    fiscal years. Early application is permitted. The Company will
    comply with the additional disclosures required by this guidance
    upon its adoption in January 2010.

In December 2009, the FASB issued ASU

2009-16,

“Transfers and Servicing (Topic 860) — Accounting
    for Transfers of Financial Assets,” which formally codifies
    FASB Statement No. 166, “Accounting for Transfers of
    Financial Assets,” into the FASB Accounting Standards
    Codification. ASU

2009-16

revises the provisions of former FASB Statement No. 140,
    “Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets
    and Extinguishments of Liabilities,” and will require more
    information about transfers of financial assets, including
    securitization transactions, and where entities have continuing
    exposure to the risks related to transferred financial assets.
    ASU

2009-16

is effective at the start of a reporting entity’s first
    fiscal year beginning after November 15, 2009. Early
    application is not permitted. The Company will comply with the
    additional disclosures required by this guidance upon its
    adoption on January 1, 2010.

In August 2009, the FASB issued ASU

No. 2009-05,

“Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (Topic
    820) — Measuring Liabilities at Fair Value,”
    related to fair value measurement of liabilities. This update
    provides clarification that in circumstances in which a quoted
    price in an active market for an identical liability is not
    available, a reporting entity is required to measure fair value
    using one or more valuation techniques. This guidance is
    effective for the first reporting period beginning after
    issuance. The Company adopted this guidance effective
    October 1, 2009. The adoption of this guidance did not have
    any impact on the Company’s financial position, cash flows
    or results of operations.

In June 2009, the FASB issued guidance under ASC 105,
    “Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.” This
    guidance established a new hierarchy of GAAP sources for
    non-governmental entities under the FASB Accounting Standards
    Codification. The Codification is the sole source for
    authoritative U.S. GAAP and supersedes all accounting
    standards in U.S. GAAP, except for those issued by the SEC.
    The guidance was effective for financial statements issued for
    reporting periods ending after September 15, 2009. The
    Company adopted this guidance effective July 1, 2009. The
    adoption had no impact on the Company’s financial position,
    cash flows or results of operations.

In May 2009, the FASB issued guidance under ASC 855,
    “Subsequent Events,” which sets forth: (1) the
    period after the balance sheet date during which management of a
    reporting entity should evaluate events or transactions that may
    occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial
    statements, (2) the circumstances under which an entity
    should recognize events or transactions occurring after the
    balance sheet date in its financial statements and (3) the
    disclosures that an entity should make about events or
    transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date. The
    guidance was effective on a prospective basis for interim or
    annual financial periods ending after June 15, 2009. The
    Company adopted this guidance on June 30, 2009. See
    Note 19 for additional information.

In April 2009, the FASB updated its guidance under ASC 820,
    “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,” related to
    estimating fair value when the volume and level of activity for
    an asset or liability have significantly decreased and
    identifying circumstances that indicate a transaction is not
    orderly. The guidance was effective for interim and annual
    reporting periods ending after June 15, 2009 with early
    adoption permitted for periods ending after March 15, 2009.
    The adoption of this guidance on June 30, 2009 did not have
    any impact on the Company’s results of operations.

Also in April 2009, the FASB updated its guidance under ASC 825,
    “Financial Instruments,” which requires disclosures
    about fair value of financial instruments for interim reporting
    periods of publicly traded

F-15

December 31,

companies as well as in annual financial statements. This
    guidance also requires those disclosures in summarized financial
    information at interim reporting periods. The guidance was
    effective for interim reporting periods ending after
    June 15, 2009 with early adoption permitted for periods
    ending after March 15, 2009. The Company adopted this
    guidance on June 30, 2009. For additional information, see
    Note 9.

The FASB updated its guidance under ASC 805, “Business
    Combinations,” in April 2009, which addresses application
    issues on initial recognition and measurement, subsequent
    measurement and accounting, and disclosure of assets and
    liabilities arising from contingencies in a business
    combination. This guidance was effective for business
    combinations occurring on or after the beginning of the first
    annual period on or after December 15, 2008. The Company
    applied the guidance to its accounting for the sheet plant that
    was acquired on July 2, 2009. See Note 17 for
    additional information regarding this acquisition.

In December 2008, the FASB issued guidance under ASC 715,
    “Compensation — Retirement Benefits,” which
    requires detailed disclosures about employers’ plan assets,
    including employers’ investment strategies, major
    categories of plan assets, concentrations of risk within plan
    assets, and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value
    of plan assets. The disclosures required by this guidance must
    be provided in financial statements for fiscal years ending
    after December 15, 2009. Earlier application of the
    provisions of this guidance is permitted. The Company adopted
    this guidance on December 31, 2009. See Note 6 for the
    required disclosures.

In June 2008, the FASB updated its guidance under ASC 260,
    “Earnings Per Share.” This guidance clarified that all
    unvested share-based payment awards with a right to receive
    nonforfeitable dividends are participating securities and
    provides guidance on how to allocate earnings to participating
    securities and compute basic earnings per share using the
    two-class method. This guidance was effective for fiscal years
    beginning after December 15, 2008. The Company adopted this
    guidance on January 1, 2009. The adoption did not have a
    material impact on the Company’s earnings per share
    calculations.

In March 2008, the FASB issued guidance under ASC 815,
    “Derivatives and Hedging,” which changes the
    disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging
    activities. Entities will be required to provide enhanced
    disclosures about how and why an entity uses derivative
    instruments, how derivative instruments and related hedged items
    are accounted for, and how derivative instruments and related
    items affect an entity’s financial position, operations and
    cash flows. This guidance was effective as of the beginning of
    an entity’s fiscal year that begins after November 15,
    2008. The Company adopted this guidance on January 1, 2009.
    See Note 2 for the required disclosures.

STOCK-BASED
    COMPENSATION

In October 1999, the Company adopted a long-term equity
    incentive plan, which provides for grants of stock options,
    stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and performance
    awards to directors, officers and employees of PCA, as well as
    others who engage in services for PCA. Option awards granted to
    directors, officers and employees have contractual lives of
    seven or ten years. Options granted to officers and employees
    vest ratably over a three year period, and options granted to
    directors vest immediately. Restricted stock awards granted to
    employees vest at the end of a four-year period, and restricted
    stock awards granted to directors vest at the end of a six-month
    period. The plan, which was scheduled to terminate on
    October 19, 2009, was amended on May 27, 2009. The
    amendment extended the plan’s term by five years to
    October 19, 2014 and increased the number of shares that
    may be granted under the plan by 2,000,000 shares, to a
    total issuance of up to 8,550,000 shares of common stock
    over the life of the plan (including prior awards). As of
    December 31, 2009, options and restricted stock for
    6,539,183 shares have been granted, net of forfeitures.
    Forfeitures are added back to the pool of shares of common stock

    of grant. Expected volatilities are based on historical
    volatility of the Company’s common stock. The expected life
    of the option is estimated using historical data pertaining to
    option exercises and employee terminations. Separate groups of
    employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are
    considered separately for estimating the expected life. The
    risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury yields in
    effect at the time of grant. The fair value of restricted stock
    is determined based on the closing price of the Company’s
    common stock on the grant date. There were no option grants in
    2009 or 2008. The estimated weighted-average fair values of and
    related assumptions for the 2007 option grants were as follows:

EMPLOYEE
    BENEFIT PLANS AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

In connection with the acquisition from Pactiv, PCA and Pactiv
    entered into a human resources agreement which, among other
    items, granted PCA employees continued participation in the
    Pactiv pension plan for a period of up to five years following
    the closing of the acquisition for an agreed upon fee.

Effective January 1, 2003, PCA adopted a mirror-image
    pension plan for eligible hourly employees to succeed the Pactiv
    pension plan in which PCA hourly employees had participated
    though December 31, 2002. The PCA pension plan for hourly
    employees recognizes service earned under both the PCA plan and
    the prior Pactiv plan. Benefits earned under the PCA plan are
    reduced by retirement benefits earned under the Pactiv plan
    through December 31, 2002. All assets and liabilities
    associated with benefits earned through December 31, 2002
    for hourly employees and retirees of PCA were retained by the
    Pactiv plan.

Effective May 1, 2004, PCA adopted a grandfathered pension
    plan for eligible salaried employees who had previously
    participated in the Pactiv pension plan. The benefit formula for
    the new PCA pension plan for salaried employees is comparable to
    that of the Pactiv plan except that the PCA plan uses career
    average base pay in the benefit formula in lieu of final average
    base pay. The PCA pension plan for salaried employees recognizes
    service earned under both the PCA plan and the prior Pactiv
    plan. Benefits earned under the PCA plan are reduced by
    retirement benefits earned under the Pactiv plan through
    April 30, 2004. All assets and liabilities associated with
    benefits earned through April 30, 2004 for salaried
    employees and retirees of PCA were retained by the Pactiv plan.

PCA maintains a supplemental executive retirement plan
    (“SERP”), which augments pension benefits for eligible
    executives (excluding the CEO) earned under the PCA pension plan
    for salaried employees. Benefits are determined using the same
    formula as the PCA pension plan but in addition to counting
    career average base pay, the SERP also recognizes bonuses and
    any pay earned in excess of IRS qualified plan compensation
    limits. Benefits earned under the SERP are reduced by benefits
    paid from the PCA salaried pension plan and any prior qualified
    pension and SERP benefits earned under the Pactiv plan.

PCA previously maintained a separate SERP for its CEO which was
    paid out and terminated on March 15, 2009. The terminated
    plan was replaced by a lower cost deferred compensation benefit
    plan.

    Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

December 31,

PCA provides certain medical benefits for retired salaried
    employees and certain medical and life insurance benefits for
    certain hourly employees. For salaried employees, the plan
    covers employees retiring from PCA on or after attaining
    age 58 who have had at least 10 years of full-time
    service with PCA after attaining age 48. For hourly
    employees, the postretirement medical coverage, where
    applicable, is available according to the eligibility provisions
    in effect at the employee’s work location. Per the human
    resources agreement referred to above, Pactiv retained the
    liability relating to retiree medical and life benefits for PCA
    employees who had retired on or before April 12, 1999 or
    who were eligible to retire within two years of that date. On
    January 1, 2003, the Company adopted a new plan design for
    salaried employees incorporating annual dollar caps in
    determining the maximum amount of employer contributions made
    towards the total cost of postretirement medical coverage.

Adoption
    of the Measurement Provisions of ASC 715

On December 31, 2008, the Company adopted the measurement
    provision of ASC 715, which required the Company to measure the
    fair value of plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date
    of the Company’s year end. The Company had previously
    measured these as of September 30th of each year. The
    Company adopted the measurement provision using the transition
    method based on the data as of the September 30, 2007
    measurement date. As a result, the following adjustments were
    made to PCA’s balance sheet as of December 31, 2008:

The expected return on pension plan assets reflects the expected
    long-term rates of return for the categories of investments
    currently held in the plan as well as anticipated returns for
    additional contributions made in the future. The expected
    long-term rate of return is adjusted when there are fundamental
    changes in expected returns on the plan investments.

The discount rate assumptions used to calculate the present
    value of pension and postretirement benefit obligations reflect
    the rates available on high-quality, fixed-income debt
    instruments on December 31st beginning in 2008. Prior
    to 2008, the discount rate assumptions were based on rates as of
    September 30th of each year. The rate of compensation
    increase is another significant assumption used for pension
    accounting and is determined by the Company based upon annual
    reviews.

In determining net pension and postretirement benefit costs, the
    Company elected to amortize prior service cost on a
    straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of
    employees expected to receive benefits under the plans. A 10%
    corridor is used to determine the amount of the unrecognized net
    gain or loss to be amortized. The excess, if any, of the
    unrecognized net gain or loss over 10% of the greater of the
    projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan
    assets is amortized over the average remaining service period
    until retirement for active participants and included in the net
    periodic benefit cost.

The Company assumed health care cost trend rates for its
    postretirement benefits plans were as follows:

The Company makes pension plan contributions that are sufficient
    to fund its actuarially determined costs, generally equal to the
    minimum amounts required by the Employee Retirement Income
    Security Act (ERISA). However, from time to time the Company may
    make discretionary contributions in excess of the required
    minimum amounts. PCA currently expects to make pension
    contributions of $14.0 million and record pension plan
    expense of $25.1 million in 2010.

The Company has two defined contribution 401(k) benefit plans
    that cover all full-time salaried employees and certain hourly
    employees at several of the Company’s facilities. Employees
    can make voluntary contributions in accordance with the
    provisions of their respective plan. The Company made
    employer-matching contributions of $9.4 million,
    $9.4 million and $9.0 million during the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Salaried employees who are not participants in the grandfathered
    pension plan (generally those hired on or after April 12,
    1999) receive a service-related Company retirement
    contribution to their 401(k) account in addition to any employer
    matching contribution. This contribution increases with years of
    service and ranges from 3% to 5% of base pay. The Company
    expensed $2.8 million, $2.5 million and
    $2.2 million for this retirement contribution during the
    years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

On July 21, 2003, PCA closed its offering and private
    placement of $150.0 million of 4.375% senior notes due
    2008 and $400.0 million of 5.75% senior notes due
    2013. The 4.375% senior notes due 2008 were repaid on
    August 1, 2008, and the 5.75% senior notes are due
    August 1, 2013.

On March 25, 2008, PCA issued $150.0 million of
    6.50% senior notes due March 15, 2018 through a
    registered public offering. PCA used the proceeds of this
    offering, together with cash on hand, to repay all of the
    $150.0 million of outstanding 4.375% senior notes on
    August 1, 2008.

On April 15, 2008, PCA replaced its existing senior credit
    facility that was scheduled to expire later in 2008, with a new
    five-year $150.0 million senior revolving credit facility.
    The Company had $18.8 million of outstanding letters of
    credit under this facility, resulting in $131.2 million in
    unused borrowing capacity as of December 31, 2009.

On April 15, 2009, the Company extended its
    receivables-backed credit facility through April 14, 2010.
    The Company had $41.0 million in additional borrowing
    capacity available under this facility as of December 31,
    2009.

The instruments governing PCA’s indebtedness contain
    financial and other covenants that limit the ability of PCA and
    its subsidiaries to enter into sale and leaseback transactions,
    incur liens, incur indebtedness at the subsidiary level, enter
    into certain transactions with affiliates, merge or consolidate
    with any other person or sell or otherwise dispose of all or
    substantially all of its assets. The senior credit facility also
    requires PCA to comply with certain financial covenants,
    including maintaining a minimum net worth and maximum debt to
    total capitalization and minimum interest coverage ratios. A
    failure to comply with these restrictions could lead to an event
    of default, which could result in an acceleration of any
    outstanding indebtedness

and/or

prohibit the Company from drawing on the senior credit facility.
    Such an acceleration may also constitute an event of default
    under the senior notes indenture and the receivables credit
    facility. At December 31, 2009, the Company was in
    compliance with these covenants.

As of December 31, 2009, annual principal maturities for
    debt, excluding unamortized debt discount, are:
    $109.0 million (2010), $400.0 million (2013) and
    $150.0 million (2018).

Interest payments in connection with the Company’s debt
    obligations for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and
    2007, amounted to $35.7 million, $38.9 million, and
    $38.0 million, respectively.

PCA has an on-balance sheet securitization program for its trade
    accounts receivable that is accounted for as a secured borrowing
    under ASC 860, “Transfers and Servicing.” To
    effectuate this program, the Company formed a wholly owned
    limited purpose subsidiary, Packaging Credit Company, LLC
    (“PCC”), which in turn formed a wholly owned,
    bankruptcy-remote, special-purpose subsidiary, Packaging
    Receivables Company, LLC (“PRC”), for the purpose of
    acquiring receivables from PCC. Both of these entities are
    included in the consolidated financial statements of the
    Company. Under this program, PCC purchases on an ongoing basis
    substantially all of the receivables of the Company and sells
    such receivables to PRC. PRC and lenders established a
    $150.0 million receivables-backed revolving credit facility
    (“Receivables Credit Facility”) through which PRC
    obtains funds to purchase receivables from PCC. The receivables
    purchased by PRC are solely the property of PRC. In the event of
    liquidation of PRC, the creditors of PRC would be entitled to
    satisfy their claims from PRC’s assets prior to any
    distribution to PCC or the Company. Credit available under the
    receivables credit facility is on a borrowing-base formula. As a
    result, the full amount of the facility may not be available at
    all times. At December 31, 2009, $109.0 million was
    outstanding and included in “Short — term debt
    and current maturities of long — term debt” on
    the consolidated balance sheet. Approximately
    $239.9 million of accounts receivable at December 31,
    2009 have been sold to PRC and are included in “Accounts
    receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts and customer
    deductions” on the consolidated balance sheet. The highest
    outstanding principal balance under the receivables credit
    facility during 2009 was $109.0 million.

FAIR
    VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The following presents information about PCA’s assets and
    liabilities measured at fair value and the valuation techniques
    used to determine those fair values. The inputs used in the
    determination of fair values are categorized according to the
    fair value hierarchy as being Level 1, Level 2 or
    Level 3. The valuation techniques are as follows:

(a) Market approach — prices and other relevant
    information generated by market transactions involving identical
    or comparable assets or liabilities

(b) Cost approach — amount that would be required
    to replace the service capacity of an asset (replacement cost)

(c) Income approach — techniques to convert
    future amounts to a single present amount based on market
    expectations (including present value techniques, option-pricing
    and excess earnings models)

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring

STOCKHOLDERS’
    EQUITY

On October 17, 2007, PCA announced that its Board of
    Directors authorized a $150.0 million common stock
    repurchase program. There is no expiration date for the common
    stock repurchase program. Through December 31, 2008, the
    Company repurchased 3,818,729 shares of common stock, with
    3,142,600 shares repurchased during 2008 and
    676,129 shares repurchased during 2007. All repurchased
    shares were retired prior to December 31, 2008. There were
    no shares repurchased in 2009. As of December 31, 2009,
    $65.0 million of the $150.0 million authorization
    remained available for repurchase of the Company’s common
    stock.

COMMITMENTS
    AND CONTINGENCIES

Capital
    Commitments

The Company had authorized capital commitments of approximately
    $41.7 million and $43.0 million as of
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, in connection
    with the expansion and replacement of existing facilities and
    equipment. In addition, commitments at December 31, 2009
    for the major energy optimization projects at its Counce and
    Valdosta mills totaled $156.3 million.

Lease
    Obligations

PCA leases space for certain of its facilities and cutting
    rights to approximately 91,000 acres of timberland under
    long-term leases. The Company also leases equipment, primarily
    vehicles and rolling stock, and other assets under long-term
    leases with a duration of two to seven years. The minimum lease
    payments under non-cancelable operating leases with lease terms
    in excess of one year are as follows:

PCA was obligated under capital leases covering buildings and
    machinery and equipment in the amount of $23.1 million and
    $23.7 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company

Litigation

PCA is a party to various legal actions arising in the ordinary
    course of business. These legal actions cover a broad variety of
    claims spanning our entire business. As of the date of this
    filing, the Company believes it is not reasonably possible that
    the resolution of these legal actions will, individually or in
    the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on its financial
    position, results of operations, or cash flows.

Environmental
    Liabilities

The potential costs for various environmental matters are
    uncertain due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of
    possible cleanup costs, the complexity and evolving nature of
    governmental laws and regulations and their interpretations, and
    the timing, varying costs and effectiveness of alternative
    cleanup technologies. From 1994 through 2009, remediation costs
    at the Company’s mills and corrugated plants totaled
    approximately $3.2 million. As of December 31, 2009,
    the Company maintained an environmental reserve of
    $9.1 million relating to

on-site

landfills (see Note 13) and surface impoundments as
    well as ongoing and anticipated remedial projects. Liabilities
    recorded for environmental contingencies are estimates of the
    probable costs based upon available information and assumptions.
    Because of these uncertainties, PCA’s estimates may change.
    As of the date of this filing, the Company believes that it is
    not reasonably possible that future environmental expenditures
    and asset retirement obligations above the $9.1 million
    accrued as of December 31, 2009, will have a material
    impact on its financial condition, results of operations, or
    cash flows.

In connection with the sale to PCA of its containerboard and
    corrugated products business, Pactiv agreed to retain all
    liability for all former facilities and all sites associated
    with pre-closing off-site waste disposal and all environmental
    liabilities related to a closed landfill located near the
    Company’s Filer City mill.

13.

ASSET
    RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

Asset retirement obligations consist primarily of landfill
    capping and closure and post-closure costs. PCA is legally
    required to perform capping and closure and post-closure care on
    the landfills at each of the Company’s mills. In accordance
    with ASC 410, “ Asset Retirement and Environmental
    Obligations,” PCA recognizes the fair value of these
    liabilities as an asset retirement obligation for each landfill
    and capitalizes

F-31


Packaging
    Corporation of America

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

December 31,

that cost as part of the cost basis of the related asset. The
    liability is accreted to its estimated value of the asset
    retirement obligation over time, and the related assets are
    depreciated on a straight-line basis over their useful lives.
    Upon settlement of the liability, PCA will recognize a gain or
    loss for any difference between the settlement amount and the
    recorded liability.

federal benefit for state taxes during the third and fourth
    quarters of 2009. At December 31, 2009, PCA had
    $9.0 million unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest.
    Of the total, $6.6 million (net of the federal benefit for
    state taxes) would impact the effective tax rate if recognized.

During the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, PCA
    recorded $0.1 million gross ($0.06 million net) and
    $0.1 million gross ($0.06 million net), respectively,
    in its statement of income, increasing the accrual for interest
    to $1.8 million gross ($1.1 million net) and
    $1.7 million gross ($1.0 million, net) at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. No accrual for
    penalties was made.

PCA and its subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal income
    taxes, as well as income taxes of multiple state and city
    jurisdictions. A federal examination of the tax years 2002 and
    2004 have been concluded. The tax years 2006 — 2009
    remain open to federal examination. The tax years
    2002 — 2009 remain open to state examinations. PCA
    does not expect the unrecognized tax benefits to change
    significantly over the next 12 months.

ALTERNATIVE
    FUEL MIXTURE TAX CREDITS

PCA generates “black liquor” as a by-product of its
    pulp manufacturing process and uses it in a mixture with diesel
    fuel to produce energy at its Counce, Tennessee, Valdosta,
    Georgia, and Tomahawk, Wisconsin mills. Through
    December 31, 2009, the U.S. Internal Revenue Code
    provided a $0.50 per gallon refundable tax credit for taxpayers
    who used alternative fuels in their trade or business. The
    Company filed applications with the Internal Revenue Service
    (the “IRS”) in December 2008 to be registered as an
    alternative fuel mixer and received approval in April 2009. As a
    registered alternative fuel mixer, the Company believes the use
    of black liquor as an alternative fuel qualifies for this tax
    credit. The laws governing this credit, as well as the
    taxability of benefits received from this credit, are complex.
    After December 31, 2009, the IRS no longer provides an
    alternative fuel mixture credit for a mixture of black liquor
    and diesel fuel used. During the year ended December 31,
    2009, PCA recorded income of $171.3 million from these
    credits after deducting net after-tax operating expenses of
    $5.0 million. The Company applied $48.4 million of
    these credits against its 2009 federal cash tax payments,
    resulting in an alternative fuel mixture receivable balance at
    December 31, 2009 of $127.8 million that is included
    on the Company’s balance sheet at December 31, 2009.

RELATED
    PARTY TRANSACTIONS

At December 31, 2009 and 2008, PCA owned approximately 29%
    of Southern Timber Venture, LLC (“STV”) and had not
    guaranteed the debt of STV and has no future funding
    requirements. There is no carrying value of the Company’s
    investment in STV under the equity method at December 31,
    2009 and 2008. PCA did not receive any dividends from STV in
    2009, 2008 or 2007. STV currently owns approximately
    51,000 acres of land, including timberlands and higher
    beneficial use properties, located primarily in southern Georgia
    and northern Florida.

Currently, PCA purchases pulpwood directly from STV for its
    Valdosta mill in accordance with the terms of a fiber supply
    agreement between the two companies which expires
    December 31, 2017. The price of pulpwood in this agreement
    is based upon the market value of pulpwood and is adjusted
    annually for any changes in market value. PCA purchased
    $3.4 million, $3.0 million and $3.2 million of
    pulpwood for its Valdosta, Georgia mill from STV during the
    years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

In December 2007, PCA sold a portion of its interest in STV for
    $1.0 million and recognized a pre-tax gain of
    $1.0 million.

ACQUISITIONS

On July 2, 2009, the Company acquired a specialty sheet
    business located in Chicago, Illinois for approximately
    $3.1 million, net of cash required. The purchase method of
    accounting was used to account for the acquisition. Goodwill of
    $1.7 million (which is deductible for income tax purposes)
    was recorded in connection with the acquisition. Sales and total
    assets of the acquisition were not material to the
    Company’s overall sales and total assets prior to the
    acquisition. Operating results of the plant subsequent to the
    date of acquisition are included in the Company’s operating
    results.

BUSINESS
    INTERRUPTION INSURANCE RECOVERY

On October 24, 2007, PCA’s Counce, Tennessee
    linerboard mill incurred a major, unplanned outage due to a
    total mill power failure. The mill was down for


/


days
    and experienced operational difficulties through the end of the
    month. This outage resulted in about 11,000 tons of lost
    production as well as significant additional operating costs of
    $7.4 million ($4.7 million net of tax). In December
    2007, the Company received $2.4 million ($1.5 million
    net of tax) in business interruption insurance proceeds. The
    amount of the loss, net of the insurance recovery, is included
    in cost of sales in the statement of income for the year ended
    December 31, 2007. The insurance proceeds are included in
    net cash provided by operating activities in the statement of
    cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2007.

For the three months ended June 30, September 30, and
    December 31, 2009, net income was increased by
    $80.2 million or $0.79 per share, $47.3 million of
    $0.46 per share, and $43.7 million of $0.43 per share,
    respectively, due to the alternative fuel mixture tax credits.

For the three months ended December 31, 2009, net income
    was decreased by $1.2 million or $0.01 per share due to
    asset disposals related to the major energy projects at the
    Counce and Valdosta mills.

For the three months ended December 31, 2008, tax expense
    was reduced by $2.9 million or $0.03 per share primarily
    due to a reduction in the Company’s state tax rate.
