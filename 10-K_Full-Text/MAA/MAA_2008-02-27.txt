MID-AMERICA APARTMENT COMMUNITIES,
INC.

PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS.

Overview of
Mid-America

Founded in
1994, Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc., or Mid-America, is a Memphis,
Tennessee-based self-administered and self-managed umbrella partnership real
estate investment trust, or REIT, that focuses on acquiring, owning and
operating apartment communities. We, together with our subsidiaries, report as a
single business segment. As of December 31, 2007, Mid-America owned 100% of 137
properties representing 40,248 apartment units. Mid-America has from
time-to-time participated in various joint ventures. While no apartment
communities were held in a joint venture structure as of December 31, 2007,
Mid-America had entered into an agreement with a partner to form Mid-America
Multifamily Fund I, LLC, or Fund I, with the purpose of acquiring and
repositioning apartment communities. Mid-America has a 33.33% ownership interest
in Fund I and will receive a management fee, an asset management fee and have
the opportunity to earn an incentive fee. Subsequent to year end, Fund I
purchased its first community with 310 apartment units.

Mid-America’s business is conducted principally through Mid-America
Apartments, L.P., which we refer to as our operating partnership. Mid-America is
the sole general partner of the operating partnership, holding 264,594 common
units of partnership interest, or common units, comprising a 1% general
partnership interest in the operating partnership as of December 31, 2007.
Mid-America’s wholly-owned qualified REIT subsidiary, MAC II of Delaware, Inc.
is a limited partner in the operating partnership and, as of December 31, 2007,
held 23,770,950 common units, or 89.84% of all outstanding common units.

Mid-America
operated apartment communities in 13 states in 2007, employing 1,170 full time
and 83 part time employees at December 31, 2007.

Highlights for the year ended December 31,
2007:

Same store net operating income, or NOI, increased
  5.8% over the prior year, the third best performance for any year in the
  history of Mid-America.

Strong operating results for the year helped to generate
  a 6.6% increase in FFO per share/unit over the prior year.

FFO per share/unit performance is a record for
  Mid-America.

The common dividend was increased effective with the January
  31, 2008, distribution to a new annual rate of $2.46.

Physical occupancy at December 31,
  2007 for the same store portfolio was 94.8%, up 0.6% compared
  to December 31, 2006 and represents a record for the past 11
  years.

Mid-America completed the renovation and repositioning of
  2,075 apartments in 2007 which achieved rent increases averaging
  14%.

Mid-America continues to be in a strong financial position as
  its fixed charge coverage ratio reached 2.27 for the year, up from 2.15
  for 2006.


Operating
Philosophy

Mid-America’s primary objectives are to protect and grow existing
property values, to maintain a stable and increasing cash flow that will fund
its dividend through all parts of the real estate investment cycle, and to
create new shareholder value by growing Mid-America in a disciplined manner.
Mid-America focuses on growing shareholder value by effectively and efficiently
operating its existing investments and, when accretive to shareholder value,
through new investments.

Investment Focus

. Mid-America’s
primary investment focus is on apartment communities in the Sunbelt region of
the United States. Between 1994 and 1997, Mid-America grew largely through
acquisition and redevelopment of existing communities. Between 1998 and 2002,
its concentration was on development of new communities. Since 2003, we have
focused on the acquisition of properties that we believe can be repositioned
with appropriate use of capital and our operating management skills. We are
currently focusing on increasing our investments in properties in larger and
faster growing markets within our current geographic area, and intend to do this
through acquiring apartment communities with the potential for above average
growth. Beginning in 2005, Mid-America began an initiative of upgrading a
significant number of our existing apartment communities, as well as a limited
program of developing new apartments, principally as expansions of existing
communities. We will continue our established process of selling mature assets,
and will adapt our investment focus to opportunities and markets. In order to
improve our return on investment, we have from time-to-time invested with joint
venture partners and anticipate this will be a growing part of our strategy.

High
Quality Assets

. Mid-America strives to
maintain its assets in excellent condition, believing that continuous
maintenance will lead to higher long-run returns on investment. Mid-America
believes that being recognized by civic and industry trade organizations for the
high quality of our properties, landscaping, and property management will lead
to higher rents and profitability and illustrates the high quality of our
properties and operations. Mid-America periodically and selectively sells assets
to ensure that its portfolio consists primarily of high quality, well-located
properties within its market area.

Diversified Market Focus

. We believe
the stability of our cash flow is enhanced and it will generate higher risk
adjusted cash flow returns, with lower volatility, through our diversified
strategy of investments over high growth, growth and income, and stable markets throughout the
Sunbelt region of the United States.

Intensive
Property and Asset Management Focus

.
Mid-America has traditionally emphasized property management, and in the past
three years, we have deepened our asset management functions to provide
additional support in marketing, training, ancillary income and, most recently,
revenue management. At December 31, 2007, Mid-America employed approximately 106
Certified Apartment Managers, a designation established by the National
Apartment Association, which provides training for on-site manager
professionals.

Decentralized Operational Structure

.
Mid-America operates in a decentralized manner. We believe that our
decentralized operating structure capitalizes on specific market knowledge,
provides greater personal accountability than a centralized structure and is
beneficial in the acquisition and redevelopment processes. To support this
decentralized operational structure, senior and executive management, along with
various asset management functions, are proactively involved in supporting and
reviewing property management through extensive reporting processes and frequent
on-site visitations. In 2004, Mid-America completed the installation of the
property and accounting modules of a new web-based property management system
that increased the amount of information shared between senior and executive
management and the properties on a real time basis, improving the support
provided to on-site property operations.


In 2005, we made significant improvements
to our operating platform and we expect these enhancements will help capture
more operating efficiencies, continue to support effective expense control and
provide for various expanded revenue management practices. In the second quarter
of 2007, we implemented a new “yield management” pricing program that we expect
will help our property managers to optimize rental revenues. In the third
quarter of 2007, we installed new purchase order and accounts payable software
and implemented processes to provide improved controls and management
information.

Proactive Balance Sheet and
Portfolio Management

Mid-America
focuses on improving the net present value of each share of Mid-America common
stock. We routinely evaluate each asset and from time-to-time sell those that no
longer fit our strategy. Mid-America makes new investments and issues new equity
when management believes it can add to value per share. In the past, Mid-America
has sold assets to fund share repurchases when, in management’s view,
shareholder value would be enhanced.

Strategies

Mid-America
seeks to increase operating cash flow and earnings per share to maximize
shareholder value through a balanced strategy of internal and external growth.

Operating
Growth Strategy

. Mid-America's goal is to
maximize our return on investment in each apartment community by increasing
revenues, tightly controlling operating expenses, maintaining high occupancy
levels and reinvesting as appropriate. The steps taken to meet these objectives
include:

providing management information and improved
  customer services through technology innovations;

utilizing systems to enhance property managers’ ability to
  optimize revenue by adjusting rents in response to local market
  conditions;

developing new ancillary income programs aimed at offering
  new services to residents, including telephone, cable, and internet access, on
  which Mid-America generates fee and commission income;

implementing programs to control expenses through investment
  in cost-saving initiatives, such as the installation of individual apartment
  unit water and utility meters in certain apartment
  communities;

analyzing individual asset productivity performances to
  identify best practices and improvement areas;

proactively maintaining the physical condition of each
  property;

improving the “curb appeal” of the apartment communities
  through extensive landscaping and exterior improvements and repositioning
  apartment communities from time-to-time to maintain market leadership
  positions;

compensating employees through performance-based compensation
  and stock ownership programs;


maintaining a hands-on management style and “flat”
  organizational structure that emphasizes senior management's continued close
  contact with the market and employees;

selling or exchanging underperforming
  assets;

repurchasing or issuing shares of common or preferred stock
  when cost of capital and asset values permit;

aggressively managing lease expirations to align with peak
  leasing traffic patterns and to maximize productivity of property staffing;
  and

allocating additional capital, including capital for
  selective interior and exterior improvements, where the investment will
  generate the highest returns for Mid-America.

Joint
Venture Strategy

. One of Mid-America’s
strategies is to co-invest with partners in joint venture opportunities from
time-to-time to the extent we believe that a joint venture will enable us to
obtain a higher return on our investment through management and other fees,
which leverage our skills in acquiring, repositioning, redeveloping and managing
multifamily investments. In addition, the joint venture investment strategy can
provide a platform for creating more capital diversification and lower
investment risk for Mid-America.

Disposition Strategy

. Mid-America from
time-to-time disposes of mature assets, defined as those apartment communities
that no longer meet our investment criteria and long-term strategic objectives.
Typically, Mid-America selects assets for disposition that do not meet our
present investment criteria including estimated future return on investment,
location, market, potential for growth, and capital needs. Mid-America may from
time-to-time also dispose of assets for which we receive an offer meeting or
exceeding our return on investment criteria even though those assets may not
meet the disposition criteria disclosed above.

Acquisition Strategy

. One of
Mid-America’s growth strategies is to acquire and redevelop apartment
communities that meet our investment criteria and focus as discussed above.
Mid-America has extensive experience and research-based skills in the
acquisition and repositioning of multifamily communities. In addition,
Mid-America will acquire newly built and developed communities that can be
purchased on a favorable pricing basis. Mid-America will continue to evaluate
opportunities that arise, and will utilize this strategy to increase the number
of apartment communities in strong and growing markets in the Sunbelt region of
the United States.

Development Strategy

. In 2006,
Mid-America began some expansion development projects at existing apartment
communities on adjacent land. We do not currently intend to expand into
development in a significant way. We prefer to capture accretive new growth
through opportunistically acquiring new properties.

Common and Preferred
Stock

Mid-America
continuously reviews opportunities for lowering our cost of capital, and
increasing net present value per share. Mid-America evaluates opportunities to
repurchase stock when we believe that our stock price is below our net present
value and accordingly repurchased common stock, funded by asset sales, between
1999 and 2001. Mid-America also looks for opportunities where we can acquire or
develop apartment communities, selectively funded or partially funded by stock
sales, when the investment return is projected to substantially exceed our cost
of capital. Mid-America will also opportunistically seek to lower our cost of
capital through refinancing preferred stock as we did in 2003, 2006 and 2007.

On November
3, 2006, Mid-America entered into a sales agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald &
Co. to sell up to 2,000,000 shares of Mid-America’s common stock, from
time-to-time in at-the-market offerings or negotiated transactions through a
controlled equity offering program. From January through April of 2007,
Mid-America sold 323,700 shares of common stock for net proceeds of
approximately $18.8 million after underwriting commissions and SEC fees, an
average net price of $58.00 per share.

In October
2007, Mid-America redeemed all of our issued and outstanding 9¼% Series F
Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock for $11.9 million.

Mid-America
also has a direct stock purchase plan which allows for the optional purchase of
common stock of at least $250, but not more than $5,000 in any given month, free
of brokerage commissions and charges. We, in our absolute discretion, may grant
waivers to allow for optional cash payments in excess of $5,000. Throughout
2007, we issued a total of 136,483 shares through our direct stock purchase plan
at an average 1.5% discount. No waivers were granted during 2007.

Share Repurchase
Program

In 1999,
Mid-America’s Board of Directors approved an increase in the number of shares of
Mid-America’s common stock authorized to be repurchased to 4 million shares. As
of December 31, 2007, Mid-America had repurchased a total of approximately 1.86
million shares (8% of the shares of common stock and common units outstanding as
of the beginning of the repurchase program). From time-to-time, we intend to
sell assets based on our disposition strategy outlined in this Annual Report and
use the proceeds to repurchase shares when we believe that shareholder value is
enhanced. Factors affecting this determination include the share price, asset
dispositions and pricing, financing agreements and rates of return. No shares
were repurchased from 2002 through 2007 under this plan.


Competition

All of
Mid-America’s apartment communities are located in areas that include other
apartment communities. Occupancy and rental rates are affected by the number of
competitive apartment communities in a particular area. The owners of competing
apartment communities may have greater resources than Mid-America, and the
managers of these apartment communities may have more experience than
Mid-America’s management. Moreover, single-family rental housing, manufactured
housing, condominiums and the new and existing home markets provide housing
alternatives to potential residents of apartment communities.

Apartment
communities compete on the basis of monthly rent, discounts, and facilities
offered such as apartment size and amenities, and apartment community amenities,
including recreational facilities, resident services, and physical property
condition. Mid-America makes capital improvements to both our apartment
communities and individual apartments on a regular basis in order to maintain a
competitive position in each individual market.

Environmental
Matters

As part of
the acquisition process, Mid-America obtains environmental studies on all of our
apartment communities from various outside environmental engineering firms. The
purpose of these studies is to identify potential sources of contamination at
the apartment communities and to assess the status of environmental regulatory
compliance. These studies generally include historical reviews of the apartment
communities, reviews of certain public records, preliminary investigations of
the sites and surrounding properties, visual inspection for the presence of
asbestos, PCBs and underground storage tanks and the preparation and issuance of
written reports. Depending on the results of these studies, more invasive
procedures, such as soil sampling or ground water analysis, will be performed to
investigate potential sources of contamination. These studies must be
satisfactorily completed before Mid-America takes ownership of an acquisition
community; however, no assurance can be given that the studies identify all
significant environmental problems.

Under
various federal, state and local laws and regulations, an owner or operator of
real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain
hazardous or toxic substances on properties. Such laws often impose such
liability without regard to whether the owner caused or knew of the presence of
hazardous or toxic substances and whether the storage of such substances was in
violation of a resident’s lease. Furthermore, the cost of remediation and
removal of such substances may be substantial, and the presence of such
substances, or the failure to promptly remediate such substances, may adversely
affect the owner’s ability to sell such real estate or to borrow using such real
estate as collateral.

Mid-America
is aware of environmental concerns specifically relating to potential issues
resulting from mold in residential properties and has in place an active
management and preventive maintenance program that includes procedures
specifically related to mold. Mid-America has established a policy requiring
residents to sign a mold addendum to lease. Mid-America has also purchased a $5
million insurance policy that covers remediation and exposure to mold. The
current policy expires in 2010 but is renewable at that time. Mid-America,
therefore, believes that our exposure to this issue is limited and controlled.


The
environmental studies received by Mid-America have not revealed any material
environmental liabilities. Mid-America is not aware of any existing conditions
that would currently be considered an environmental liability. Nevertheless, it
is possible that the studies do not reveal all environmental liabilities or that
there are material environmental liabilities of which Mid-America is unaware.
Moreover, no assurance can be given concerning future laws, ordinances or
regulations, or the potential introduction of hazardous or toxic substances by
neighboring properties or residents.

Mid-America
believes that our apartment communities are in compliance in all material
respects with all applicable federal, state and local ordinances and regulations
regarding hazardous or toxic substances and other environmental matters.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.

In addition to the
other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following
risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business. Our
business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially
adversely affected by any of these risks. Please note that additional risks not
presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our
business and operations.


Failure to Generate Sufficient Cash
Flows Could Limit our Ability to Pay Distributions to Shareholders

Mid-America’s ability to generate sufficient cash flow in order to pay
common dividends to our shareholders depends on our ability to generate funds
from operations in excess of capital expenditure requirements and preferred
dividends, and/or to have access to the markets for debt and equity financing.
Funds from operations and the value of Mid-America’s apartment communities may
be insufficient because of factors which are beyond our control. Such events or
conditions could include:

competition from other apartment
  communities;

overbuilding of new apartment units or oversupply of
  available apartment units in Mid-America’s markets, which might adversely
  affect apartment occupancy or rental rates and/or require rent concessions in
  order to lease apartment units;

conversion of condominiums and single family houses to rental
  use;

increases in operating costs (including real estate taxes and
  insurance premiums) due to inflation and other factors, which may not be
  offset by increased rents;

inability to rent apartments on favorable economic
  terms;

changes in governmental regulations and the related costs of
  compliance;

changes in tax laws and housing laws including the enactment
  of rent control laws or other laws regulating multifamily
  housing;

an uninsured loss, resulting from a catastrophic storm or act
  of terrorism;

changes in interest rate levels and the availability of
  financing, which could lead renters to purchase homes (if interest rates
  decrease and home loans are more readily available) or increase Mid-America’s
  acquisition and operating costs (if interest rates increase and financing is
  less readily available);

weakness in the overall economy which lowers job growth and
  the associated demand for apartment housing; and

the relative illiquidity of real estate
  investments.

At times,
Mid-America relies on external funding sources to fully fund the payment of
distributions to shareholders and our capital investment program (including our
existing property expansion developments). While Mid-America has sufficient
liquidity to permit distributions at current rates through additional borrowings
if necessary, any significant and sustained deterioration in operations could
result in our financial resources being insufficient to pay distributions to
shareholders at the current rate, in which event Mid-America would be required
to reduce the distribution rate. Any decline in Mid-America’s funds from
operations could adversely affect Mid-America’s ability to make distributions to
our shareholders or to meet our loan covenants and could have a material adverse
effect on Mid-America’s stock price.


Mid-America’s Financing Could be
Impacted by Negative Capital Market Conditions.

Recently,
domestic financial markets have experienced unusual volatility and uncertainty.
While this condition has occurred most visibly within the “subprime” mortgage
lending sector of the credit market, liquidity has tightened in overall domestic
financial markets, including the investment grade debt and equity capital
markets. Consequently, there is greater risk that the financial institutions
Mid-America does business with could experience disruptions that would
negatively affect our current financing program.

Debt Level, Refinancing and Loan
Covenant Risk May Adversely Affect Financial Condition and Operating Results and
Our Ability to Maintain Our Status as a REIT

At December
31, 2007, Mid-America had total debt outstanding of $1.3 billion. Payments of
principal and interest on borrowings may leave Mid-America with insufficient
cash resources to operate the apartment communities or pay distributions that
are required to be paid in order for Mid-America to maintain our qualification
as a REIT. Mid-America currently intends to limit our total debt to
approximately 60% of the undepreciated book value of our assets, although our
charter and bylaws do not limit our debt levels. Circumstances may cause
Mid-America to exceed that target from time-to-time. As of December 31, 2007,
Mid-America’s ratio of debt to undepreciated book value was approximately 54%.
Mid-America’s Board of Directors can modify this policy at any time which could
allow Mid-America to become more highly leveraged and decrease our ability to
make distributions to our shareholders. In addition, Mid-America must repay its
debt upon maturity, and the inability to access debt or equity capital at
attractive rates could adversely affect Mid-America’s financial condition and/or
our funds from operations. Mid-America relies on Federal National Mortgage
Association, or FNMA, and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, or Freddie
Mac, which we refer to as the agencies, for the majority of our debt financing
and has agreements with the agencies and with other lenders that require us to
comply with certain covenants. The breach of any one of these covenants would
place Mid-America in default with our lenders and may have serious consequences
on the operations of Mid-America.

Variable Interest Rates May Adversely
Affect Funds from Operations

At December
31, 2007, effectively $226 million of Mid-America’s debt bore interest at a
variable rate and was not hedged by interest rate swaps or caps. Mid-America may
incur additional debt in the future that also bears interest at variable rates.
Variable rate debt creates higher debt service requirements if market interest
rates increase, which would adversely affect Mid-America’s funds from operations
and the amounts available to pay distributions to shareholders. Mid-America’s
$1.0 billion secured credit facilities with Prudential Mortgage Capital, credit
enhanced by FNMA, are predominately floating rate facilities. Mid-America also
has credit facilities with Freddie Mac totaling $300 million which are variable
rate facilities. At December 31, 2007, a total of $1.1 billion was outstanding
under these facilities. These facilities represent the majority of the variable
interest rates Mid-America was exposed to at December 31, 2007. Large portions
of the interest rates on these facilities have been hedged by means of a number
of interest rate swaps and caps. Upon the termination of these swaps and caps,
Mid-America will be exposed to the risks of varying interest rates.

Interest Rate Hedging may be
Ineffective

Mid-America
relies on the financial markets to refinance debt maturities, and also is
heavily reliant on the creditworthiness of FNMA, which provides credit
enhancement for approximately $906 million of Mid-America’s debt. The interest
rate market for FNMA Discount Mortgage Backed Securities, or DMBS, which in
Mid-America’s experience is highly correlated with three-month LIBOR interest
rates, is also an important component of Mid-America’s liquidity and interest
rate swap effectiveness.


Typically, for the credit facility we have
with FNMA, the DMBS rate has approximated three-month LIBOR less an average
spread of 0.05% - 0.09% over the life of the facility. We also pay a credit
enhancement fee, which in the case of FNMA facility, is 0.62%. In September
2007, however, the spread between three-month LIBOR and DMBS increased
significantly, and peaked at 0.57% in December before dropping back to 0.27% in
February 2008. While we believe that the current market illiquidity is an
anomaly and that this spread will return to more historic levels, Mid-America
cannot forecast when or if the uncertainty and volatility in the market may
change. Continued unusual volatility could cause us to lose hedge accounting
treatment for our interest rate swaps, resulting in material changes to our
consolidated statements of operations and balance sheets, and potentially cause
a breach with one of our debt covenants.

Issuances of Additional Debt or Equity
May Adversely Impact Our Financial Condition

Our capital
requirements depend on numerous factors, including the occupancy rates of our
apartment communities, dividend payment rates to our shareholders, development
and capital expenditures, costs of operations and potential acquisitions.
Mid-America cannot accurately predict the timing and amount of our capital
requirements. If our capital requirements vary materially from our plans,
Mid-America may require additional financing sooner than anticipated.
Accordingly, Mid-America could become more leveraged, resulting in increased
risk of default on our obligations and in an increase in our debt service
requirements, both of which could adversely affect our financial condition and
ability to access debt and equity capital markets in the future.

Increasing Real Estate Taxes and
Insurance Costs May Negatively Impact Financial Condition

As a result
of Mid-America’s substantial real estate holdings, the cost of real estate taxes
and insuring its apartment communities is a significant component of expense.
Real estate taxes and insurance premiums are subject to significant increases
and fluctuations which can be widely outside of the control of Mid-America. If
the costs associated with real estate taxes and insurance should rise,
Mid-America’s financial condition could be negatively impacted and Mid-America’s
ability to pay our dividend could be affected.

Losses from Catastrophes May Exceed Our
Insurance Coverage

Mid-America
carries comprehensive liability and property insurance on our communities, and
intends to obtain similar coverage for communities we acquire in the future.
Some losses, generally of a catastrophic nature, such as losses from floods,
hurricanes or earthquakes, are subject to limitations, and thus may be
uninsured. Mid-America exercises our discretion in determining amounts, coverage
limits and deductibility provisions of insurance, with a view to maintaining
appropriate insurance on our investments at a reasonable cost and on suitable
terms. If Mid-America suffers a substantial loss, our insurance coverage may not
be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement value
of our lost investment. Inflation, changes in building codes and ordinances,
environmental considerations and other factors also might make it infeasible to
use insurance proceeds to replace a property after it has been damaged or
destroyed.


Property Insurance Limits May be
Inadequate and Deductibles May be Excessive in the Event of a Catastrophic Loss
or a Series of Major Losses, and May Cause a Breach of a Loan Covenant

Mid-America
has a significant proportion of our assets in areas exposed to windstorms and to
the New Madrid earthquake zone. A major wind or earthquake loss, or series of
losses, could require that Mid-America pay significant deductibles as well as
additional amounts above the per occurrence limit of Mid-America’s insurance for
these risks. Mid-America may then be judged to have breached one or more of our
loan covenants, and any of the foregoing events could have a material adverse
effect on Mid-America’s assets, financial condition, and results of operation.

Mid-America is dependent on Key
Personnel

Our success depends in part on our
ability to attract and retain the services of executive officers and other
personnel. There is substantial competition for qualified personnel in the real
estate industry and the loss of several of our key personnel could have an
adverse effect on us.

New Acquisitions May Fail to Perform as
Expected and Failure to Integrate Acquired Communities and New Personnel Could
Create Inefficiencies

Mid-America
intends to actively acquire and improve multifamily communities for rental
operations. Mid-America may underestimate the costs necessary to bring an
acquired community up to standards established for our intended market position.
Additionally, to grow successfully, Mid-America must be able to apply our
experience in managing our existing portfolio of apartment communities to a
larger number of properties. Mid-America must also be able to integrate new
management and operations personnel as our organization grows in size and
complexity. Failures in either area will result in inefficiencies that could
adversely affect our overall profitability.

Mid-America May Not Be Able To Sell
Communities When Appropriate

Real estate
investments are relatively illiquid and generally cannot be sold quickly.
Mid-America may not be able to change our portfolio promptly in response to
economic or other conditions. This inability to respond promptly to changes in
the performance of our investments could adversely affect our financial
condition and ability to make distributions to our security holders.

Environmental Problems are Possible and
Can be Costly

Federal,
state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the
environment may require a current or previous owner or operator of real estate
to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product
releases at such community. The owner or operator may have to pay a governmental
entity or third parties for property damage and for investigation and clean-up
costs incurred by such parties in connection with the contamination. These laws
typically impose clean-up responsibility and liability without regard to whether
the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants. Even
if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination each
person covered by the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the
clean-up costs incurred. In addition, third parties may sue the owner or
operator of a site for damages and costs resulting from environmental
contamination emanating from that site. All of our communities have been the
subject of environmental assessments completed by qualified independent
environmental consultant companies. These environmental assessments have not
revealed, nor is Mid-America aware of, any environmental liability that our
management believes would have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Over the past several
years, there have been an increasing number of lawsuits against owners and
managers of multifamily properties alleging personal injury and property damage
caused by the presence of mold in residential real estate.


Some of these lawsuits have resulted in
substantial monetary judgments or settlements. Mid-America cannot be assured
that existing environmental assessments of our communities reveal all
environmental liabilities, that any prior owner of any of our properties did not
create a material environmental condition not known to Mid-America, or that a
material environmental condition does not otherwise exist.

Compliance or Failure to Comply with
Laws Requiring Access to Our Properties by Disabled Persons Could Result in
Substantial Cost

The
Americans with Disabilities Act, the Fair Housing Act of 1988 and other federal,
state and local laws generally require that public accommodations be made
accessible to disabled persons. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of
fines by the government or the award of damages to private litigants. These laws
may require Mid-America to modify our existing communities. These laws may also
restrict renovations by requiring improved access to such buildings by disabled
persons or may require Mid-America to add other structural features that
increase our construction costs. Legislation or regulations adopted in the
future may impose further burdens or restrictions on Mid-America with respect to
improved access by disabled persons. Mid-America cannot ascertain the costs of
compliance with these laws, which may be substantial.

Our Ownership Limit Restricts the
Transferability of Our Capital Stock

Our charter
limits ownership of our capital stock by any single shareholder to 9.9% of the
value of all outstanding shares of our capital stock, both common and preferred.
The charter also prohibits anyone from buying shares if the purchase would
result in our losing REIT status. This could happen if a share transaction
results in fewer than 100 persons owning all of our shares or in five or fewer
persons, applying certain broad attribution rules of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended, or the Code, owning 50% or more of our shares. If you
acquire shares in excess of the ownership limit or in violation of the ownership
requirements of the Code for REITs, we:

will consider the transfer to be null and
  void;

will not reflect the transaction on our
  books;

may institute legal action to enjoin the
  transaction;

will not pay dividends or other distributions with respect to
  those shares;

will not recognize any voting rights for those
  shares;

will consider the shares held in trust for our benefit;
  and

will either direct you to sell the shares and turn over any
  profit to us, or we will redeem the shares. If we redeem the shares, you will
  be paid a price equal to the lesser of:

(a)

the price you paid for the
      shares; or

(b)

the average of the last reported
      sales prices on the New York Stock Exchange on the ten trading days
      immediately preceding the date fixed for redemption by our Board of
      Directors.


If you acquire shares in violation of the
limits on ownership described above:

you may lose your power to dispose of the
  shares;

you may not recognize profit from the sale of such shares if
  the market price of the shares increases; and

you may be required to recognize a loss from the sale of such
  shares if the market price decreases.

Provisions of Our Charter and Tennessee
Law May Limit the Ability of a Third Party to Acquire Control of
Us

Ownership
Limit

The 9.9%
ownership limit discussed above may have the effect of precluding acquisition of
control of us by a third party without the consent of our Board of
Directors.

Preferred
Stock

Our charter authorizes our Board of
Directors to issue up to 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock. The Board of
Directors may establish the preferences and rights of any preferred shares
issued. The issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of delaying or
preventing someone from taking control of us, even if a change in control were
in our shareholders’ best interests. Currently, we have 6,200,000 shares of
8.30% Series H Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock issued and outstanding.

Tennessee Anti-Takeover
Statutes

As a
Tennessee corporation, we are subject to various legislative acts, which impose
restrictions on and require compliance with procedures designed to protect
shareholders against unfair or coercive mergers and acquisitions. These statutes
may delay or prevent offers to acquire us and increase the difficulty of
consummating any such offers, even if our acquisition would be in our
shareholders’ best interests.

Our Investments in Joint Ventures May
Involve Risks

Investments
in joint ventures may involve risks which may not otherwise be present in our
direct investments such as:

the potential inability of our joint venture
  partner to perform;

the joint venture partner may have economic or business
  interests or goals which are inconsistent with or adverse to
  ours;

the joint venture partner may take actions contrary to our
  requests or instructions or contrary to our objectives or policies;
  and

the joint venturers may not be able to agree on matters
  relating to the property they jointly own.


Although each joint owner will have a
right of first refusal to purchase the other owner’s interest, in the event a
sale is desired, the joint owner may not have sufficient resources to exercise
such right of first refusal.

Failure to Qualify as a REIT Would
Cause Mid-America to be Taxed as a Corporation

If
Mid-America fails to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes,
Mid-America will be taxed as a corporation. The Internal Revenue Service may
challenge our qualification as a REIT for prior years, and new legislation,
regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions may change the
tax laws with respect to qualification as a REIT or the federal tax consequences
of such qualification. For any taxable year that Mid-America fails to qualify as
a REIT, Mid-America would be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income
at corporate rates, plus any applicable alternative minimum tax. In addition,
unless entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions, Mid-America
would be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years
following the year during which qualification is lost. This treatment would
reduce our net earnings available for investment or distribution to shareholders
because of the additional tax liability for the year or years involved. In
addition, distributions would no longer qualify for the dividends paid deduction
nor be required to be made in order to preserve REIT status. Mid-America might
be required to borrow funds or to liquidate some of our investments to pay any
applicable tax resulting from our failure to qualify as a REIT.

Failure to Make Required Distributions
Would Subject Mid-America to Income Taxation

In order to
qualify as a REIT, each year Mid-America must distribute to stockholders at
least 90% of its REIT taxable income (determined without regard to the dividend
paid deduction and by excluding net capital gains). To the extent that
Mid-America satisfies the distribution requirement, but distributes less than
100% of taxable income, it will be subject to federal corporate income tax on
the undistributed income. In addition, Mid-America will incur a 4% nondeductible
excise tax on the amount, if any, by which the distributions in any year are
less than the sum of:

85% of ordinary income for that
  year;

95% of capital gain net income for that year;
  and

100% of undistributed taxable income from prior
  years.

Differences in timing between the
recognition of income and the related cash receipts or the effect of required
debt amortization payments could require Mid-America to borrow money or sell
assets to pay out enough of the taxable income to satisfy the distribution
requirement and to avoid corporate income tax and the 4% nondeductible excise
tax in a particular year.

Complying with REIT Requirements May
Cause Mid-America to Forgo Otherwise Attractive Opportunities or Engage in
Marginal Investment Opportunities

To qualify
as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, Mid-America must continually satisfy
tests concerning, among other things, the sources of income, the nature and
diversification of assets, the amounts distributed to shareholders and the
ownership of Mid-America’s stock. In order to meet these tests, Mid-America may
be required to forgo attractive business or investment opportunities or engage
in marginal investment opportunities. Thus, compliance with the REIT
requirements may hinder Mid-America’s ability to operate solely on the basis of
maximizing profits.


ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS.

None.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES.

Mid-America
seeks to acquire apartment communities located in the Sunbelt region of the
United States that are primarily appealing to middle income residents with the
potential for above average growth and return on investment. Approximately 73%
of Mid-America's apartment units are located in Georgia, Florida, Tennessee and
Texas markets. Mid-America's strategic focus is to provide our residents high
quality apartment units in attractive community settings, characterized by
extensive landscaping and attention to aesthetic detail. We utilize our
experience and expertise in maintenance, landscaping, marketing and management
to effectively reposition many of the apartment communities we acquire to raise
occupancy levels and per unit average rents.

The
following table sets forth certain historical information for the apartment
communities we owned at December 31, 2007:

Mid-America’s common stock on the NYSE was $46.44 per share, and there were
approximately 1,707 holders of record of the common stock. Mid-America believes
we have a significantly larger number of beneficial owners of our common stock.
The following table sets forth the quarterly high and low sales prices of our
common stock and the dividends declared by Mid-America with respect to the

In the first quarter of 2006, the
      Board of Directors began declaring the common dividend for the following
      quarter at their regularly scheduled board meeting. This timing change
      resulted in two dividend payments being declared in the same
      quarter.

Mid-America’s quarterly dividend rate is currently $0.615 per common
share. The Board of Directors reviews and declares the dividend rate quarterly.
Actual dividends made by Mid-America will be affected by a number of factors,
including the gross revenues received from the apartment communities, the
operating expenses of Mid-America, the interest expense incurred on borrowings
and unanticipated capital expenditures.

Mid-America
expects to make future quarterly distributions to shareholders; however, future
distributions by Mid-America will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors
and will depend on the actual funds from operations of Mid-America, our
financial condition, capital requirements, the annual distribution requirements
under the REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and such other factors as
the Board of Directors deems relevant.

Mid-America
has established the Direct Stock Purchase and Distribution Reinvestment Plan, or
DRSPP, under which holders of common stock, preferred stock and limited
partnership interests in Mid-America Apartments, L.P. can elect to automatically
reinvest their distributions in additional shares of common stock. The plan also
allows for the optional purchase of common stock of at least $250, but not more
than $5,000 in any given month, free of brokerage commissions and charges.
Mid-America, in our absolute discretion, may grant waivers to allow for optional

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS

This and
other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K contain certain
forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended, which are intended to be covered by the safe harbors created
thereby. These statements include, but are not limited to, statements about
anticipated market conditions, expected growth rates of revenues and expenses,
planned asset dispositions, disposition pricing, planned acquisitions,
developments and renovations, property financings, expected interest rates,
joint venture activity and planned capital expenditures. Although Mid-America
believes that the assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements are
reasonable, any of the assumptions could be inaccurate and, therefore, there can
be no assurance that the forward-looking statements included in this report on
Form 10-K will prove to be accurate. In light of the significant uncertainties
inherent in the forward-looking statements included herein, the inclusion of
such information should not be regarded as a representation by Mid-America or
any other person that the objectives and plans of Mid-America will be
achieved.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND
ESTIMATES

The
following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
operations are based upon Mid-America’s consolidated financial statements, and
the notes thereto, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these consolidated financial
statements requires Mid-America to make a number of estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial
statements. On an ongoing basis, Mid-America evaluates our estimates and
assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and
circumstances. Mid-America believes that our estimates and assumptions are
reasonable in the circumstances; however, actual results may differ from these
estimates and assumptions.


Mid-America
believes that the estimates and assumptions that are most important to the
portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations, in that they
require the most subjective judgments, form the basis of accounting policies
deemed to be most critical. These critical accounting policies include revenue
recognition, capitalization of expenditures and depreciation of assets,
impairment of long-lived assets, including goodwill, and fair value of
derivative financial instruments.

Revenue recognition

Mid-America
leases multifamily residential apartments under operating leases primarily with
terms of one year or less.

Rental revenues are recognized using a method that represents
a straight-line basis over the term of the lease and other revenues are recorded
when earned.

We record
all gains and losses on sales of real estate in accordance with Statement No.
66,

Accounting for Sales of Real
Estate

.

Capitalization of expenditures
and depreciation of assets

Mid-America
carries real estate assets at depreciated cost. Depreciation is computed on a
straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which
range from 8 to 40 years for land improvements and buildings, 5 years for
furniture, fixtures, and equipment, 3 to 5 years for computers and software, and
1 year for acquired leases, all of which are subjective determinations. Repairs
and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred while significant improvements,
renovations, and replacements are capitalized. The cost to complete any deferred
repairs and maintenance at properties acquired by Mid-America in order to
elevate the condition of the property to Mid-America’s standards are capitalized
as incurred.

Impairment of long-lived assets,
including goodwill

Mid-America
accounts for long-lived assets in accordance with the provisions of Statement
No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

, or Statement
144, and evaluates its goodwill for impairment under Statement No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets,

or Statement 142. Mid-America
evaluates goodwill for impairment on an annual basis in Mid-America’s fiscal
fourth quarter, or sooner if a goodwill impairment indicator is identified.
Mid-America periodically evaluates long-lived assets, including investments in
real estate and goodwill, for indicators that would suggest that the carrying
amount of the assets may not be recoverable. The judgments regarding the
existence of such indicators are based on factors such as operating performance,
market conditions, and legal factors.

In
accordance with Statement 144, long-lived assets, such as real estate assets,
equipment, and purchased intangibles subject to amortization, are reviewed for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to
be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset
to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the
asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash
flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying
amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Assets to be disposed
of are separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of
the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and are no longer
depreciated. The assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held
for sale are presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability
sections of the balance sheet.


Goodwill is
tested annually for impairment, and is tested for impairment more frequently if
events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. An
impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the
asset’s fair value. This determination is made at the reporting unit level and
consists of two steps. First, Mid-America determines the fair value of a
reporting unit and compares it to its carrying amount. In the apartment
industry, the primary method used for determining fair value is to divide annual
operating cash flows by an appropriate capitalization rate. Mid-America
determines the appropriate capitalization rate by reviewing the prevailing rates
in a property’s market or submarket. Second, if the carrying amount of a
reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for any
excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill over the implied
fair value of that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by
allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a
purchase price allocation, in accordance with Statement No. 141,

Business Combinations

. The
residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the
reporting unit goodwill.

Fair value of derivative
financial instruments

Mid-America
utilizes certain derivative financial instruments, primarily interest rate swaps
and caps, during the normal course of business to manage, or hedge, the interest
rate risk associated with Mid-America’s variable rate debt or as hedges in
anticipation of future debt transactions to manage well-defined interest rate
risk associated with the transaction. The valuation of the derivative financial
instruments under Statement No. 133

Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

, as amended, requires Mid-America to make estimates and judgments that
affect the fair value of the instruments.

In order for a derivative contract
to be designated as a hedging instrument, the relationship between the hedging
instrument and the hedged item must be highly effective. While Mid-America’s
calculation of hedge effectiveness contains some subjective determinations, the
historical correlation of the cash flows of the hedging instruments and the
underlying hedged item are measured by Mid-America before entering into the
hedging relationship and have been found to be highly correlated.

Mid-America
measures ineffectiveness using the change in the variable cash flows method at
the inception of the hedge and for each reporting period thereafter, through the
term of the hedging instruments. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are
recorded in earnings. The change in fair value of the interest rate swaps and
caps designated as cash flow hedges are recorded to accumulated other
comprehensive income in the statement of shareholders’ equity.

OVERVIEW OF THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,

Mid-America’s results for 2007 were positively influenced by both
improved operating performance from communities held throughout both the current
and prior period, or same store, and the positive impact from acquisitions in
recent years. Implementation of new operating platform systems is helping us to
optimize the balance between increased occupancy and rental rates.


Mid-America
has grown externally during the past three years by following its acquisition
strategy to invest in large and mid-sized growing markets in the Sunbelt region
of the United States. Mid-America acquired three properties in 2005 and six
properties in 2006, for which we benefited from full years of revenues in 2007.
Mid-America also acquired an additional four communities during 2007. Offsetting
some of this increased revenue stream is one property disposition in 2005 and
dispositions of four properties during 2007.

The
following is a discussion of the consolidated financial condition and results of
operations of Mid-America for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005.
This discussion should be read in conjunction with all of the consolidated
financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

As of
December 31, 2007, the total number of apartment units Mid-America owned or had
an ownership interest in was 40,248 in 137 communities, compared to 40,293
apartment units in 138 communities at December 31, 2006, and 38,227 apartment
units in 132 communities at December 31, 2005. For communities owned 100% by
Mid-America, the average monthly rental per apartment unit, excluding units in
lease-up, increased to $743 at December 31, 2007 from $726 at December 31, 2006,
and $695 at December 31, 2005. For these same units, overall occupancy at
December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005 was 94.7%, 94.2%, and 94.6%,
respectively.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

COMPARISON OF THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER
31, 2007, TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006

Property
revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007, increased by approximately $29.5
million from the year ended December 31, 2006, due to (i) an $11.5 million
increase in property revenues from the six properties acquired in 2006, or the
2006 acquisitions, (ii) a $4.8 million increase in property revenues from the
four properties acquired in 2007, or the 2007 acquisitions, (iii) a $0.8 million
increase in property revenues from our development communities, and (iv) a $12.4
million increase in property revenues from the properties held throughout both
periods. The increase in property revenues from properties held throughout both
periods was generated primarily by Mid-America’s same store portfolio and was
driven by an average 2.5% increase in average rent per unit in 2007 over 2006.

Property
operating expenses include costs for property personnel, building repairs and
maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance, utilities, landscaping and other
property related costs. Property operating expenses for the year ended December
31, 2007, increased by approximately $9.9 million from the year ended December
31, 2006, due primarily to increases of property operating expenses of (i) $5.0
million from the 2006 acquisitions, (ii) $2.1 million from the 2007
acquisitions, (iii) $0.3 million from our development communities, and (iv) $2.5
million from the properties held throughout both periods. The increase in
property operating expenses from the properties held throughout both periods
consisted primarily of Mid-America’s same store portfolio and represented an
average 2.9% increase over prior year expenses.

Depreciation
expense increased by approximately $7.3 million primarily due to the increases
of depreciation expense of (i) $3.3 million from the 2006 acquisitions, (ii)
$1.2 million from the 2007 acquisitions, (iii) $0.3 million from our development
communities, (iv) $0.7 million from the amortization of the fair market value of
leases of acquired communities, and (v) $1.8 million from fixed asset additions
at communities held throughout both periods.


Property
management expenses increased by approximately $4.8 million from the year ended
December 31, 2006, to the year ended December 31, 2007, partially due to
increased incentive compensation as a result of improved property performance,
increased franchise and excise taxes due to state tax law changes, and
implementation expenses associated with improved operating systems. General and
administrative expenses increased by approximately $0.9 million over this same
period also partially related to increased incentive compensation due to
improved performance.

Interest
expense increased approximately $1.3 million in 2007 from 2006 due primarily to
the approximate $42.4 million increase in the average debt outstanding from 2006
due to acquisitions and our development and redevelopment programs. The impact
from the increase in the average debt outstanding was partially offset by a
decrease in the average annual borrowing costs from 5.5% for 2006 to 5.4% in
2007.

For the year
ended December 31, 2007, Mid-America recorded total gains of approximately $5.4
million from the sale of a community owned by a joint venture of Mid-America.
The sale of this community resulted in an additional incentive fee being paid to
Mid-America of approximately $1.0 million in 2007. In 2007, Mid-America also
benefited from a $9.2 million gain resulting from the sale of four communities
owned directly by Mid-America. Mid-America had no dispositions in 2006.

For the year
ended December 31, 2007, Mid-America recorded net gains on insurance and other
settlement proceeds and gains on sale of land totaling $1.1 million. For the
year ended December 31, 2006, Mid-America recorded gains of $0.1 million for
these same items.

Primarily as
a result of the foregoing, net income increased by approximately $19.0 million
in 2007 over 2006.

COMPARISON OF THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER
31, 2006, TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005

Property
revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006, increased by approximately $30.0
million from the year ended December 31, 2005, due to (i) a $9.5 million
increase in property revenues from the 2006 acquisitions, (ii) a $5.3 million
increase in property revenues from the three properties acquired in 2005, or the
2005 acquisitions, and (iii) a $15.2 million increase in property revenues from
the properties held throughout both periods. The increase in property revenues
from properties held throughout both periods was generated primarily by
Mid-America’s same store portfolio and was driven by an average 3.1% increase in
average rent per unit in 2006 over 2005.

Property
operating expenses include costs for property personnel, building repairs and
maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance, utilities, landscaping and other
property related costs. Property operating expenses for the year ended December
31, 2006, increased by approximately $11.2 million from the year ended December
31, 2005, due primarily to increases of property operating expenses of (i) $4.6
million from the 2006 acquisitions, (ii) $2.1 million from the 2005
acquisitions, and (iii) $4.5 million from the properties held throughout both
periods. The increase in property operating expenses from the properties held
throughout both periods consisted primarily of Mid-America’s same store
portfolio and was driven by an increase in property insurance reflecting the
increase in premiums effective July 1, 2006. The same store property operating
expense increase also reflects increased utility rates as Mid-America
experienced an increase in electricity, natural gas and water and sewer prices.


Depreciation
expense increased by approximately $4.9 million primarily due to the increases
of depreciation expense of (i) $2.7 million from the 2006 acquisitions, (ii)
$1.2 million from the 2005 acquisitions, and (iii) $2.0 million from fixed asset
additions at the communities held throughout both periods. These increases were
partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense of $1.0 million from the
expiration of the amortization of fair market value of leases of acquired
communities.

Property
management expenses increased by approximately $2.0 million from the year ended
December 31, 2005, to the year ended December 31, 2006, partially due to
increased incentive compensation as a result of improved property performance
and increased franchise and excise taxes due to state tax law changes. General
and administrative expenses increased by approximately $0.2 million over this
same period also partially related to increased incentive compensation due to
improved performance.

Interest
expense increased approximately $5.0 million in 2006 from 2005 due primarily to
the approximate $49.7 million increase in the average debt outstanding from 2005
due to acquisitions and our development and redevelopment programs. Interest
expense was also impacted by an increase in the average annual borrowing costs
from 5.2% in 2005 to 5.5% in 2006.

For the year
ended December 31, 2005, Mid-America recorded total gains of approximately $3.0
million from the sale of two communities owned by a joint venture of
Mid-America. The sales of these communities resulted in an additional incentive
fee being paid to Mid-America of approximately $1.7 million in 2005. Mid-America
had no dispositions in 2006.

For the year
ended December 31, 2006, Mid-America recorded net gains on insurance and other
settlement proceeds and gains on sale of land totaling $0.1 million. For the
year ended December 31, 2005, Mid-America recorded gains of $1.1 million for
these same items.

Primarily as
a result of the foregoing, net income increased by approximately $1.2 million in
2006 over 2005.

FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS

Funds from
operations, or FFO, represents net income (computed in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP) excluding extraordinary
items, minority interest in operating partnership income, gains on disposition
of real estate assets, plus depreciation of real estate, and adjustments for
joint ventures to reflect FFO on the same basis. This definition of FFO is in
accordance with the NAREIT definition. Disposition of real estate assets
includes sales of discontinued operations as well as proceeds received from
insurance and other settlements from property damage.

In response
to the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Staff Policy Statement relating to
EITF Topic D-42 concerning the calculation of earnings per share for the
redemption of preferred stock, Mid-America has included the amount charged to
retire preferred stock in excess of carrying values in our FFO calculation.

Mid-America's policy is to expense the cost of interior painting, vinyl
flooring, and blinds as incurred for stabilized properties. During the
stabilization period for acquisition properties, these items are capitalized as
part of the total repositioning program of newly acquired properties, and, thus
are not deducted in calculating FFO.


FFO should
not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other GAAP measurement
of performance, as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to
cash flow from operating, investing, and financing activities as a
measure of liquidity. Mid-America believes that FFO is helpful to investors in
understanding Mid-America's operating performance in that such calculation
excludes depreciation expense on real estate
assets. Mid-America believes that GAAP historical cost depreciation of
real estate assets is generally not correlated with changes in the value of
those assets, whose value does not diminish predictably over time, as historical
cost depreciation implies. Mid-America’s calculation of FFO may differ from the
methodology for calculating FFO utilized by other REITs and, accordingly, may
not be comparable to such other REITs.

The
following table is a reconciliation of FFO to net income for the years ended
December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005 (dollars and shares in thousands):

and 2007 acquisitions as previously reviewed in the net income discussion

TRENDS

In 2007,
rental demand for apartments continued to improve throughout most of
Mid-America’s markets. Both our High Growth and our Growth and Income markets
reported same-store revenue growth for the year averaging over 5% and NOI growth
averaging 6.9%. Exceptional performers were markets in Texas and Tennessee.
Following several years of rapid growth, markets in Florida did not perform as
well.

Job
formation, which is the primary driver of demand by apartment residents,
continued to be strong in most of our markets. On the supply side, new apartment
construction continued to be limited, as in most markets, rents have yet to rise
sufficiently to offset the rapid run-up of costs of new construction over the
last five years. Competition from condominiums reverting back to being rental
units, or new condominiums being converted to rental, was not a major factor in
most of our markets because most of our markets and submarkets have not been
primary areas for condominium development. We have found the same to be true for
rental competition from single family homes: we have avoided committing a lot of
capital to markets where most of the excessive inflation in house prices has
occurred. We are seeing rental competition from condominiums and single family
houses in only a few submarkets.

The primary
reason that our residents leave us is to buy a house, but we have seen the
number drop over the past six months from approximately 28% of move-outs to
approximately 26%. Analysts point out that homeownership increased from 65% to
almost 69% of households over the past ten years, driven primarily by the
availability of new mortgage products, many requiring no down-payment and
minimal credit reporting. With a reversion of mortgage underwriting back to more
traditional standards, it is possible that a long-term correction will occur,
and that home ownership may return to more sustainable levels. This could be
quite significant for the apartment business, and we believe, if this occurs, it
could benefit us for several years.


While it
seems possible that we will face slower economic growth as a result of reduced
liquidity in the economy, we think that the supply of new apartments is not
excessive, and that positive absorption of apartments will occur for most of our
markets for the next two or three years. Should the economy fall into recession,
the limited new supply of apartments and the more controlled competition from
single family housing should ameliorate the impact.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL
RESOURCES

Net cash
flow provided by operating activities increased by approximately $17.0 million
to $117.9 million for 2007, compared to $100.9 million for 2006, mainly related
to the growth of Mid-America through acquisitions and improved operating results
in 2007. Net cash flow provided by operating activities increased by
approximately $2.1 million to $100.9 million for 2006 compared to $98.8 million
for 2005 mainly related to the growth of Mid-America through acquisitions and
improved operating results in 2006.

Net cash
used in investing activities decreased by approximately $131.5 million from
$239.6 million in 2006 to $108.1 million in 2007. Net cash used in investing
activities increased by approximately $133.2 million from $106.4 million in 2005
to $239.6 million in 2006. The change in net cash used in investing activities
resulted mainly from the varying levels of acquisition activity. A total of
approximately $88.6 million was invested in 2007 to acquire properties, this
compares to approximately $195.0 million in 2006, and $105.6 million in 2005.
Mid-America began limited development activities in 2006, which used net cash of
approximately $10.9 million in 2006 and $14.6 million in 2007. Mid-America also
expanded our renovation activities using net cash of approximately $0.4 million
in 2005, $6.1 million in 2006 and $11.3 million in 2007. Finally, Mid-America’s
net cash used in investing activities was influenced by different levels of
dispositions across the three years. In 2007, Mid-America received $29.3 million
from real estate dispositions, compared to $2.1 million in 2006 and $9.7 million
in 2005.

Net cash
provided by financing activities decreased approximately $128.3 million to $1.9
million in 2007 from $130.1 million in 2006. Net cash provided by financing
activities increased approximately $117.6 million to $130.1 million in 2006 from
$12.5 million in 2005. Net cash provided by financing activities was mainly
impacted by proceeds from issuances of common shares and units. Proceeds from
issuances of common shares and units increased in 2006 to approximately $151.9
million primarily due to Mid-America’s raising of funds through stock issuances
from our direct stock purchase plan, a controlled equity plan and an overnight
offering. During 2005 and 2007, Mid-America was not as active in raising funds
through these equity plans. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2007
was also impacted by the redemption of our 9¼% Series F Cumulative Redeemable
Preferred Stock, or Series F, for $11.9 million.

The weighted
average interest rate at December 31, 2007, for the $1.3 billion of debt
outstanding was 5.4% compared to 5.6% on $1.2 billion of debt outstanding at
December 31, 2006. Mid-America utilizes both conventional and tax exempt debt to
help finance our activities. Borrowings are made through individual property
mortgages and secured credit facilities. Mid-America utilizes fixed rate
borrowings, interest rate swaps and interest rate caps to manage our current and
future interest rate risk. More details on Mid-America’s borrowings are
disclosed in the schedule found later in this section.


At December 31, 2007, Mid-America
had secured credit facilities relationships with Prudential Mortgage Capital
which are credit enhanced by the Federal National Mortgage Association, or FNMA,
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, or Freddie MAC, and a group of banks led
by Regions Financial Corporation. Together, these credit facilities provided a
total borrowing capacity of $1.4 billion at December 31, 2007, with an
availability to borrow of $1.2 billion. At December 31, 2007, Mid-America had
total borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities of $1.1
billion.

Approximately 72% of Mid-America’s
outstanding obligations at December 31, 2007, were borrowed through facilities
with/or credit enhanced by FNMA, which we call the FNMA Facilities. The FNMA
Facilities have a combined line limit of $1.0 billion, most of which was
available to borrow at December 31, 2007. Various traunches of the facilities
mature from 2008 through 2014. The FNMA Facilities provide for both fixed and
variable rate borrowings. The interest rate on the majority of the variable
portion renews every 90 days and is based on the FNMA Discount Mortgage Backed
Security, or DMBS, rate on the date of renewal, which has typically approximated
three-month LIBOR less an average spread of 0.05% - 0.09% over the life of the
FNMA facilities, plus a credit enhancement fee of 0.62% to 0.795%. Recently,
however, the spread between three-month LIBOR and DMBS has increased up to
0.57%. While we feel the current liquidity market is an anomaly and believe that
this spread will return to more historic levels, Mid-America cannot forecast
when or if the uncertainty and volatility in the market may change.

Each of
Mid-America’s secured credit facilities is subject to various covenants and
conditions on usage, and are subject to periodic re-evaluation of collateral. If
Mid-America were to fail to satisfy a condition to borrowing, the available
credit under one or more of the facilities could not be drawn, which could
adversely affect Mid-America’s liquidity. In the event of a reduction in real
estate values the amount of available credit could be reduced. Moreover, if
Mid-America were to fail to make a payment or violate a covenant under a credit
facility, after applicable cure periods one or more of our lenders could declare
a default, accelerate the due date for repayment of all amounts outstanding
and/or foreclose on properties securing such facilities. Any such event could
have a material adverse effect on Mid-America.

On May 26,
2005, Mid-America gave the required one year notice to redeem all of the issued
and outstanding shares of its 8 5/8% Series G Cumulative Redeemable Preferred
Stock, or Series G, on May 26, 2006, for the total redemption price of $10
million. As a result, in accordance with Statement No. 150,

Accounting for
Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and
Equity

, Mid-America classified the Series G as a liability within notes
payable as of May 26, 2005, on the accompanying consolidated financial
statements. On May 26, 2006, Mid-America redeemed all of the issued and
outstanding shares of Series G.

On October
16, 2007, Mid-America redeemed all of the issued and outstanding shares of
Series F for the total redemption price of $11.9 million.

As of
December 31, 2007, Mid-America had interest rate swaps in effect totaling a
notional amount of approximately $756 million. To date, these swaps have proven
to be highly effective hedges. Mid-America had also entered into two forward
swaps as of December 31, 2007, with a total combined notional amount of $50
million. Mid-America had interest rate cap agreements totaling a notional amount
of approximately $47 million in effect as of December 31, 2007.

During 2007,
Mid-America offered an average 1.5% discount through our DRSPP and issued
approximately 120,000 shares of common stock through the direct stock purchase
feature of this plan, generating approximately $6 million in proceeds. During
2006, Mid-America offered an average 1.5% discount through our DRSPP and issued
approximately 1,340,000 shares of common stock through the direct stock purchase
feature of this plan, generating approximately $77 million in proceeds. During
2005, Mid-America offered an average 1.5% discount through our DRSPP and issued
approximately 784,000 shares of common stock through the direct stock purchase
feature of this plan, generating approximately $32 million in
proceeds.


In May 2006,
Mid-America sold 1,150,000 shares of common stock through a public offering
generating net proceeds of approximately $59.5 million.

During the
first two quarters of 2007, Mid-America sold 323,700 shares of common stock
through our continuous equity offering program generating approximately $18.8
million in net proceeds. In December 2006, Mid-America sold 194,000 shares of
common stock through this same program generating approximately $11.4 million in
net proceeds.

Mid-America
believes that it has adequate resources to fund its current operations and
annual refurbishment of our communities through our cash flow and credit
facilities. Mid-America is relying on the efficient operation of the financial
markets to finance debt maturities, and also is heavily reliant on the
creditworthiness of FNMA, which provides credit enhancement for approximately
$906 million of Mid-America’s debt. The interest rate market for FNMA DMBS,
which in Mid-America’s experience is highly correlated with three-month LIBOR
interest rates, is also an important component of Mid-America’s liquidity and
interest rate swap effectiveness. In the event that the FNMA DMBS market becomes
less efficient, or the credit of FNMA becomes impaired, Mid-America would seek
alternative sources of debt financing.

For the year
ended December 31, 2007, Mid-America’s net cash provided by operating activities
was in excess of covering improvements to existing real estate assets (excluding
renovations), distributions to unitholders, and dividends paid on common and
preferred shares by approximately $4.1 million. This compares to a shortfall in
2006 of approximately $4.5 million and excess coverage in 2005 of approximately
$3.1 million. While Mid-America has sufficient liquidity to permit distributions
at current rates, from time-to-time Mid-America may utilize additional
borrowings to cover shortfalls if necessary. Any significant deterioration in
operations could result in Mid-America’s financial resources to be insufficient
to pay distributions to shareholders at the current rate, in which event
Mid-America would be required to reduce the distribution rate.

The
following table reflects Mid-America’s total contractual cash obligations which
consist of our long-term debt and operating leases as of December 31, 2007

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

At December
31, 2007, and 2006, Mid-America did not have any relationships with
unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships established for the purpose of
facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or
limited purposes. Mid-America’s two joint ventures with Crow Holdings (one
terminated in 2005 and one in 2007) were established to acquire approximately
$200 million of multifamily properties and to enhance Mid-America’s return on
investment through the generation of fee income. Mid-America Multifamily Fund I,
LLC, was established to acquire $500 million of apartment communities with
redevelopment upside offering value creation opportunity through capital
improvements, operating enhancements and restructuring in-place financing. In
addition, Mid-America does not engage in trading activities involving
non-exchange traded contracts. As such, Mid-America is not materially exposed to
any financing, liquidity, market, or credit risk that could arise if we had
engaged in such relationships.


Mid-America does not have any
relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from
their non-independent relationships with Mid-America or our related parties
other than what is disclosed in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 14.

Mid-America’s investments in our real estate joint ventures are
unconsolidated and are recorded on the equity method as Mid-America does not
have a controlling interest.

INSURANCE

Mid-America
renegotiated our insurance programs effective July 1, 2007. Management believes
that the property and casualty insurance program in place provides appropriate
insurance coverage for financial protection against insurable risks such that
any insurable loss experienced would not have a significant impact on
Mid-America’s liquidity, financial position or results of operation. Management
expects to obtain a reduction in annual policy premiums of approximately $1.5
million from the renegotiated programs when compared to the higher rates
experienced after the July 1, 2006 renewal.

INFLATION

Substantially all of the resident leases at the apartment communities
allow, at the time of renewal, for adjustments in the rent payable there under,
and thus may enable Mid-America to seek rent increases. Almost all leases are
for one year or less. The short-term nature of these leases generally serves to
reduce the risk to Mid-America of the adverse effects of inflation.

IMPACT OF RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING
STANDARDS

In June
2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Interpretation
No. 48 “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes”, or FIN 48. FIN 48 clarifies
the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial
statements in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes

.
Mid-America adopted FIN 48 effective January 1, 2007. FIN 48 prescribes a
recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the recognition and
measurement of tax positions taken in tax returns. Mid-America has identified
and examined our tax positions, including our status as a real estate investment
trust, for all open tax years through December 31, 2006, and concluded that the
full benefit of each tax position taken should be recognized in the financial
statements. There are no significant changes in unrecognized tax benefits that
are reasonably likely to occur within the twelve months following the adoption
date.

FIN 48
requires that an enterprise must calculate interest and penalties related to
unrecognized tax benefits. The decision regarding where to classify interest and
penalties on the income statement is an accounting policy decision that should
be consistently applied. Interest and penalties calculated on any future
uncertain tax positions will be presented as a component of income tax expense.
No interest and penalties are accrued under FIN 48 on our balance sheet as of
December 31, 2007.

Mid-America’s tax years that remain subject to examination for U.S.
federal purposes range from 2003 through 2006. Our tax years that remain open
for state examination vary but range from 2002 through 2006.


In September 2006, the FASB issued
Statement No. 157

Fair Value
Measurements

,

or Statement 157. Statement 157
defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and
expands disclosures about fair value measurements. Statement 157 is effective
for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and interim periods within
those fiscal years. FASB Staff Position No. FAS 157-2

Effective Date of FASB Statement 157

,
or FSP 157-2, delays the effective date of Statement 157 for nonfinancial assets
and nonfinancial liabilities except for items that are recognized or disclosed
at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. For these items,
the effective date will be for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008.
Mid-America does not believe the adoption of Statement 157 will have a material
impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations taken as
a whole.

On December
4, 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 141 (Revised 2007),

Business Combinations

, or
Statement 141R. Statement 141R will significantly change the accounting for
business combinations. Under Statement 141R, an acquiring entity will be
required to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a
transaction at the acquisition-date fair value with limited exceptions.
Statement 141R will change the accounting treatment for certain specific items,
including acquisition costs which will generally be expensed as incurred. This
will have a material impact on the way Mid-America accounts for property
acquisitions and therefore will have a material impact on Mid-America’s
financial statements. Statement 141R applies prospectively to business
combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the
first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15,
2008.

On December
4, 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements - An Amendment of
ARB No. 51

, or Statement 160. Statement 160
establishes new accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling
interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary.
Specifically, this statement requires the recognition of a noncontrolling
interest (minority interest) as equity in the consolidated financial statements
and separate from the parent's equity. The amount of net income attributable to
the noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the
face of the income statement. Statement 160 clarifies that changes in a parent's
ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation are
equity transactions if the parent retains its controlling financial interest.
This will impact the financial statement presentation of Mid-America by
requiring the minority interests in the operating partnership to be presented as
a non-controlling interest as a component of equity. Statement 160 is effective
for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or
after December 15, 2008.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE
DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.

Mid-America's primary market risk exposure is to changes in
interest rates obtainable on our secured and unsecured borrowings. At
December 31, 2007, 48% of Mid-America's total
capitalization consisted of borrowings. Mid-America's interest rate
risk objective is to limit the impact of interest rate fluctuations on earnings
and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs. To achieve this
objective, Mid-America manages its exposure to fluctuations in market interest
rates for borrowings through the use of fixed rate debt instruments and interest
rate swaps and caps which mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial
instrument and effectively fix the interest rate on a portion of our variable
debt or on future refinancings. Mid-America uses our best efforts to ladder
fixed rate maturities thereby limiting our exposure to interest rate changes in
any one year. Mid-America does not enter into derivative instruments for trading
purposes. Approximately 82% of Mid-America's outstanding debt was subject to
fixed or capped rates after considering related derivative instruments with a
weighted average of 5.5% at December 31, 2007. Mid-America regularly reviews
interest rate exposure on outstanding borrowings in an effort to minimize the
risk of interest rate fluctuations.


The table
below provides information about Mid-America's financial instruments that are
sensitive to changes in interest rates. For debt obligations, the table presents
principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected
maturity dates. For Mid-America’s interest rate swaps and caps, the table
presents the notional amount of the swaps and caps and the years in which they
expire. Weighted average variable rates are based on rates in effect at the
reporting date (dollars in 000's).

PART III

ITEM 10. DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS
AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE.

The
information contained in Mid-America’s 2007 Proxy Statement in the sections
entitled “Information About The Board of Directors and Its Committees”,
“Proposal 1 - Election of Directors”, “Executive Officers” and “Section 16(a)
Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance,” is incorporated herein by reference
in response to this item.

Our Board of
Directors has adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics applicable to all
officers, directors and employees, which can be found on Mid-America’s website
at http://www.maac.net, on the Investor Relations page under Governance
Documents. Mid-America will provide a copy of this document to any person,
without charge, upon request, by writing to the Investor Relations Department at
Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc., 6584 Poplar Avenue, Suite 300, Memphis,
TN 38138. We intend to satisfy the disclosure requirement under Item 5.05 of

Management’s Report on Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting

Management of Mid-America is
responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(f) promulgated
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

Internal control over financial
reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of Mid-America’s
consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles.

Internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect
the transactions and dispositions of the assets of Mid-America; (ii) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the
preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of
Mid-America are being made only in accordance with appropriate authorizations of
management and directors of Mid-America; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or
disposition of Mid-America’s assets that could have a material effect on the
consolidated financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations,
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate.

Management conducted an assessment
of Mid-America’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2007 using the framework specified in

Internal
Control - Integrated Framework

, published by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on
such assessment, management has concluded that Mid-America’s internal control
over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2007.

The effectiveness of Mid-America’s internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007,
has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm,
as stated in their report which is presented in this Annual Report.

Report of Independent Registered
Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Shareholders
of

Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets of Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. as of
December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated statements of income,
shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2007. Our audits also included the financial statement
schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a). These consolidated financial
statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, the financial
statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. at
December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the consolidated results of its operations and
its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2007, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in
our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in
relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly in
all material respects the information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States), Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.’s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in
Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 26, 2008
expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of Independent Registered
Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Shareholders
of

Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.

We have audited Mid-America
Apartment Communities, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (the COSO criteria). Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.’s
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting included in Management’s Report on Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our
audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial
reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining
an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the
risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

A company’s internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations,
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Mid-America
Apartment Communities, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on the
COSO criteria.

Beginning in 2006, at their

      declaring dividends for payment in the following quarter. This can result
      in dividends declared during the year being different from dividends paid
      during the year. Mid-America paid dividends of $2.42, $2.38 and $2.35 in

In the first quarter of 2006, the
Board of Directors began declaring the quarterly common dividend at their
regularly scheduled meeting rather than in the month the dividend is paid. This
resulted in two dividend payments being declared in the first quarter of 2006,
even though only one dividend payment was paid.

Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Years ended December 31,
2007, 2006, and 2005

1. Organization and Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies

Organization and Formation of
Mid-America

Mid-America Apartment Communities,
Inc. (“Mid-America”) is a self-administrated and self-managed real estate
investment trust which owns, acquires and operates multifamily apartment
communities mainly in the Sunbelt region of the United States. Mid-America owned
and operated 137 apartment communities principally through its majority owned
subsidiary, Mid-America Apartments, L.P. (the “Operating Partnership”), as of
December 31, 2007. Mid-America also owned a 33.33% interest in a real estate
joint venture which owned no apartment communities at December 31,
2007.

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial
statements presented herein include the accounts of Mid-America, the Operating
Partnership, and all other subsidiaries (the “Company”). Mid-America owns 51% to
100% of all consolidated subsidiaries. Mid-America uses the equity method of
accounting for its investments in entities for which Mid-America exercises
significant influence, but does not have the ability to exercise control. All
significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation.

Minority Interest

Minority interest in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements relates to the ownership interest
in the Operating Partnership by the holders of Class A Common Units of the
Operating Partnership (“Operating Partnership Units”). Mid-America is the sole
general partner of the Operating Partnership. Net income is allocated to the
minority interest based on their respective ownership percentage of the
Operating Partnership. Issuance of additional common shares or Operating
Partnership Units changes the ownership of both the minority interest and
Mid-America. Such transactions and the related proceeds are treated as capital
transactions and result in an allocation between shareholders’ equity and
minority interest to account for the change in the respective percentage
ownership of the underlying equity of the Operating Partnership.

Mid-America’s Board of Directors
established economic rights in respect to each Operating Partnership Unit that
were equivalent to the economic rights in respect to each share of common stock.
The holder of each unit may redeem their units in exchange for one share of
common stock or cash, at the option of Mid-America. The Operating Partnership
has followed the policy of paying the same per unit distribution in respect to
the units as the per share distribution in respect to the common stock.
Operating Partnership net income for 2007, 2006 and 2005 was allocated
approximately 9.2%, 10.1%, and 11.4%, respectively, to holders of Operating
Partnership Units and 90.8%, 89.9%, and 88.6%, respectively, to Mid-America.

Use of Estimates

Management of Mid-America has made a
number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and
liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses to prepare these financial statements
and notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

F-9

Revenue Recognition

Mid-America leases multifamily
residential apartments under operating leases primarily with terms of one year
or less. Rental revenues are recognized using a method that represents a
straight-line basis over the term of the lease and other revenues are recorded
when earned.

Mid-America records all gains and
losses on real estate in accordance with Statement No. 66

Accounting for Sales of Real Estate

.

Rental Costs

Costs associated with rental
activities are expensed as incurred. Certain costs associated with the lease-up
of development projects, including cost of model units, their furnishings,
signs, and “grand openings” are capitalized and amortized over their respective
estimated useful lives. All other costs relating to renting development projects
are expensed as incurred.

Earnings Per Share

The computation of basic earnings
per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding.
The computation of diluted earnings per share is based on the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding plus the shares resulting from the assumed
exercise of all dilutive outstanding options using the treasury stock method.
For periods where Mid-America reports a net loss available for common
shareholders, the effect of dilutive shares is excluded from earnings per share
calculations because including such shares would be anti-dilutive.

A reconciliation of the numerators
and denominators of the basic and diluted earnings per share computations for
the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005 is presented on the
Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Cash and Cash
Equivalents

Mid-America considers cash,
investments in money market accounts and certificates of deposit with original
maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

Restricted Cash

Restricted cash consists of escrow
deposits held by lenders for property taxes, insurance, debt service and
replacement reserves.

Real Estate Assets and Depreciation

Real estate assets are carried at
depreciated cost. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred while
significant improvements, renovations, and recurring capital replacements are
capitalized. Recurring capital replacements typically include scheduled carpet
replacement, new roofs, HVAC units, plumbing, concrete, masonry and other
paving, pools and various exterior building improvements. These expenditures
extend the useful life of the property and increase the property’s fair market
value. The cost of interior painting, vinyl flooring and blinds are expensed as
incurred.

F-10

In conjunction with acquisitions of
properties, Mid-America’s policy is to provide in its acquisition budgets
adequate funds to complete any deferred maintenance items to bring the
properties to the required standard, including the cost of replacement
appliances, carpet, interior painting, vinyl flooring and blinds. These costs
are capitalized.

Development projects and the related
carrying costs, including interest, property taxes, insurance and allocated
development overhead during the construction period, are capitalized and
reported in the accompanying balance sheets as “construction in progress” during
the construction period. Upon completion and certification for occupancy of
individual units within a development, amounts representing the completed unit's
portion of total estimated development costs for the project are transferred to
land, buildings, and furniture, fixtures and equipment as real estate held for
investment. Capitalization of interest, property taxes, insurance and allocated
development overhead costs cease upon the transfer, and the assets are
depreciated over their estimated useful lives. Total interest capitalized during
2007, 2006 and 2005 was approximately $795,000, $297,000, and $0,
respectively.

Depreciation is computed on a
straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets which
range from 8 to 40 years for land improvements and buildings and 5 years for
furniture, fixtures and equipment and 3 to 5 years for computers and
software.

For real estate acquisitions
subsequent to June 30, 2001, the effective date of Statement No. 141,

Business Combinations

, the fair value of the real estate acquired is allocated to
the acquired tangible assets, consisting of land, building, furniture, fixtures
and equipment, and identified intangible assets and liabilities, consisting of
above and below market leases, resident relationship values and the value of
in-place leases.

The fair value of the tangible
assets of an acquired property (land, building, furniture, fixtures and
equipment) is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant. The
“as-if-vacant” value is then allocated to land, building, furniture, fixtures
and equipment based on management’s determination of the relative fair values of
these assets. Management determines the as-if-vacant fair value of a property
using methods similar to those used by independent appraisers. Factors
considered by management in performing these analyses include an estimate of
carrying costs during the period of time that would be required in the current
market conditions to lease-up the property to determine the fair value of the
in-place leases and resident relationships. Management includes real estate
taxes, insurance, operating expenses and lost rentals as well as the costs
required to execute similar leases in the estimated carrying costs.

In allocating the fair value of
identified intangible assets and liabilities of an acquired property, the
in-place leases are compared to current market conditions. Based on these
evaluations, management believes that the leases acquired on each of its
property acquisitions were at market rates since the lease terms generally do
not extend beyond one year.

The fair value of the in-place
leases and resident relationships is then amortized over the remaining term of
the resident leases. The amount of these resident lease intangibles included in
real estate assets totaled $20.7 million, $18.6 million, and $12.3 million as of
December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively, and the amortization recorded
as depreciation expense was $4.6 million, $3.9 million, and $4.9 million for the
years ending December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively.

F-11

Goodwill and Intangible
Assets

Mid-America accounts for long-lived
assets in accordance with the provisions of Statement No. 144, Accounting for
the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets (“Statement 144”) and evaluates
its goodwill for impairment under Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets (“Statement 142”). Mid-America evaluates its goodwill for
impairment on an annual basis in Mid-America’s fiscal fourth quarter, or sooner
if a goodwill impairment indicator is identified. Mid-America periodically
evaluates its long-lived assets, including its investments in real estate and
goodwill, for indicators that would suggest that the carrying amount of the
assets may not be recoverable. The judgments regarding the existence of such
indicators are based on factors such as operating performance, market
conditions, and legal factors.

In accordance with Statement 144,
long-lived assets, such as real estate assets, and equipment, and purchased
intangibles subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may
not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by
a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future
cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an
asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is
recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the
fair value of the asset. Assets to be disposed of are separately presented in
the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value
less costs to sell, and are no longer depreciated. The assets and liabilities of
a disposed group classified as held for sale are presented separately in the
appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet.

Goodwill is tested annually for
impairment, and is tested for impairment more frequently if events and
circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. An impairment loss is
recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset’s fair
value. This determination is made at the reporting unit level and consists of
two steps. First, Mid-America determines the fair value of a reporting unit and
compares it to its carrying amount. In the apartment industry, the primary
method used for determining fair value is to divide annual operating cash flows
by an appropriate capitalization rate. Mid-America determines the appropriate
capitalization rate by reviewing the prevailing rates in a property’s market or
submarket. Second, if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair
value, an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of
the reporting unit’s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill. The
implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the
reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation, in accordance
with Statement No. 141,

Business
Combinations

. The residual fair value after
this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill.

In 2005, Mid-America sold the
Eastview apartments and recorded an asset impairment charge to discontinued
operations of $243,000.

Land Held for Future Development

Real estate held for future
development are sites intended for future multifamily developments and are
carried at the lower of cost or fair value.

Investment In and Advances to Real
Estate Joint Ventures

Mid-America’s investments in its
unconsolidated real estate joint ventures are recorded on the equity method as
Mid-America is able to exert significant influence, but does not have a
controlling interest in the joint venture.

F-12

Deferred Financing Costs

Deferred financing costs are
amortized over the terms of the related debt using a method which approximates
the interest method.

Other Assets

Other assets consist of deferred
rental concessions which are recognized on a straight line basis over the life
of the leases, receivables and deposits from residents, and other prepaid
expenses including prepaid insurance and prepaid interest.

Accrued Expenses and Other
Liabilities

Accrued expenses consist of accrued
real estate taxes, accrued interest payable, other accrued expenses payable,
unearned income and the adjustment for the fair market value of Mid-America’s
derivative financial instruments.

Derivative Financial Instruments

In the normal course of business,
Mid-America uses certain derivative financial instruments to manage, or hedge,
the interest rate risk associated with Mid-America’s variable rate debt or as
hedges in anticipation of future debt transactions to manage well-defined
interest rate risk associated with the transaction.

Mid-America does not use derivative
financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. Further, Mid-America
has a policy of entering into contracts with major financial institutions based
upon their credit rating and other factors. When viewed in conjunction with the
underlying and offsetting exposure that the derivatives are designated to hedge,
Mid-America has not sustained any material loss from those instruments nor does
it anticipate any material adverse effect on its net income or financial
position in the future from the use of derivatives.

Mid-America requires that derivative
financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges be effective in reducing
the interest rate risk exposure that they are designated to hedge. This
effectiveness is essential for qualifying for hedge accounting. Instruments that
meet the hedging criteria are formally designated as hedging instruments at the
inception of the derivative contract. Mid-America formally documents all
relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk
management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction. This
process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as fair-value or
cash flow hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to
specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions. Mid-America also formally
assesses, both at the inception of the hedging relationship and on an ongoing
basis, whether the derivatives used are highly effective in offsetting changes
in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. When it is determined that a
derivative has ceased to be a highly effective hedge, Mid-America discontinues
hedge accounting prospectively.

All of Mid-America’s derivative
financial instruments are recorded at fair value and reported on the balance
sheet, and are characterized as cash flow hedges. These transactions hedge the
future cash flows of debt transactions through interest rate swaps that convert
variable payments to fixed payments and interest rate caps that limit the
exposure to rising interest rates. The fair value of these hedging instruments
are reported on the balance sheet in Other Assets and Accrued Expenses and Other
Liabilities with a corresponding adjustment for the unrealized gains/losses to
accumulated other comprehensive income, with any ineffective portion of the
hedging transactions reclassified to interest expense. During the years ended
December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, the ineffective portion of the hedging
transactions reclassified to earnings was approximately $470,000, $144,000 and
$0, respectively.

F-13

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2006, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Interpretation No. 48

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
Taxes

, or FIN 48. FIN 48 clarifies the
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements in
accordance with FASB Statement No. 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes

.
Mid-America adopted FIN 48 effective January 1, 2007. FIN 48 prescribes a
recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the recognition and
measurement of tax positions taken in tax returns. Mid-America has identified
and examined our tax positions, including our status as a real estate investment
trust, for all open tax years through December 31, 2006, and concluded that the
full benefit of each tax position taken should be recognized in the financial
statements. There are no significant changes in unrecognized tax benefits that
are reasonably likely to occur within the twelve months following the adoption
date.

FIN 48 requires that an enterprise
must calculate interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits. The
decision regarding where to classify interest and penalties on the income
statement is an accounting policy decision that should be consistently applied.
Interest and penalties calculated on any future uncertain tax positions will be
presented as a component of income tax expense. No interest and penalties are
accrued under FIN 48 on our balance sheet as of

December 31, 2007.

Mid-America’s tax years that remain
subject to examination for U.S. federal purposes range from 2003 through 2006.
Our tax years that remain open for state examination vary but range from 2002
through 2006.

In September 2006, the FASB issued
Statement No. 157

Fair Value
Measurements

,

or Statement 157. Statement 157
defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and
expands disclosures about fair value measurements. Statement 157 is effective
for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and interim periods within
those fiscal years. FASB Staff Position No. FAS 157-2

Effective Date of FASB Statement 157

,
or FSP 157-2, delays the effective date of Statement 157 for nonfinancial assets
and nonfinancial liabilities except for items that are recognized or disclosed
at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. For these items,
the effective date will be for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008.
Mid-America does not believe the adoption of Statement 157 will have a material
impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations taken as
a whole.

On December 4, 2007, the FASB issued
Statement No. 141 (Revised 2007),

Business

Combinations

, or Statement 141R. Statement 141R will significantly change the
accounting for business combinations. Under Statement 141R, an acquiring entity
will be required to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in
a transaction at the acquisition-date fair value with limited exceptions.
Statement 141R will change the accounting treatment for certain specific items,
including acquisition costs which will generally be expensed as incurred. This
will have a material impact on the way Mid-America accounts for property
acquisitions and therefore will have a material impact on Mid-America’s
financial statements. Statement 141R applies prospectively to business
combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the
first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15,
2008.

F-14

On December 4, 2007, the FASB issued
Statement No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
Statements - An Amendment of ARB No. 51

, or Statement 160. Statement 160
establishes new accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling
interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary.
Specifically, this statement requires the recognition of a noncontrolling
interest (minority interest) as equity in the consolidated financial statements
and separate from the parent's equity. The amount of net income attributable to
the noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the
face of the income statement. Statement 160 clarifies that changes in a parent's
ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation are
equity transactions if the parent retains its controlling financial interest.
This will impact the financial statement presentation of Mid-America by
requiring the minority interests in the operating partnership to be presented as
a non-controlling interest as a component of equity. Statement 160 is effective
for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or
after December 15, 2008.

Reclassifications

Certain prior period amounts have
been reclassified to conform to the 2007 presentation; specifically, certain
expenses previously classified as property management expenses have been
reclassified as property operating expenses and certain communities have been
reclassified as held for sale. The reclassifications had no effect on net income
available for common shareholders.

2. STOCK BASED COMPENSATION

In December 2004, FASB issued
Statement No. 123 (revised December 2004),

Share-Based Payment

(“Statement
123R”). Statement 123R replaces FASB Statement No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

, and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

. Statement 123R requires compensation costs related to
share-based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements. With
limited exceptions, the amount of compensation cost will be measured based on
the grant-date fair value of the equity or the liability instruments issued. In
addition, liability awards will be remeasured each reporting period.
Compensation cost will be recognized over the period that an employee provides
service in exchange for the award. Statement 123R is effective as of the
beginning of the first annual reporting period that begins after June 15,
2005.

Mid-America adopted Statement 123R
effective January 1, 2006 using the “modified prospective” method permitted by
Statement 123R in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the
effective date (a) based on the requirements of Statement 123R for all
share-based payments granted after the effective date and (b) based on the
requirements of Statement 123 for all awards granted to employees prior to the
effective date of Statement 123R that remain unvested on the effective date. The
effect of adopting Statement 123R for the twelve months ending December 31, 2006
was an increase of approximately $668,862 in net income from continuing
operations and in net income, resulting in an increase of approximately $0.03 in
basic earnings per share and $0.02 in diluted earnings per share. These
increases occurred primarily because the fair market values assigned to certain
plans at grant date were not impacted by the increase in share price that
Mid-America has experienced over the last two years, resulting in plans
generating higher payouts for participants than their fair market value models
would have predicted based on then stock price volatility. This series of events
resulted in the amount recorded to compensation expense in accordance with
Statement 123R being smaller than the actual number of shares issued times their
issue price. The adoption of Statement 123R had no impact on cash flow from
operations or cash flow from financing activities.

F-15

The modified prospective method of
Statement 123R does not require prior periods to be restated to reflect the
amount of compensation cost that would have been reflected in the financial
statements. The following table reflects the effect on net income if Statement
123R had been used by Mid-America along with the applicable assumptions utilized
in the Black-Scholes option pricing model calculation for those periods in which
option grants were issued (dollars and shares in thousands, except per share
data):

Employee Stock Purchase
Plan

The Mid-America Apartment
Communities, Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”) provides a means for
employees to purchase common stock of Mid-America. The Board of Directors has
authorized the issuance of 150,000 shares for the plan. The ESPP is administered
by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors who may annually grant
options to employees to purchase annually up to an aggregate of 15,000 shares of
common stock at a price equal to 85% of the market price of the common stock.
Shares are purchased semi-annually on June 30 and December 31. During the twelve
months ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, 4,894, 4,462 and 4,796 shares,
respectively, were purchased through the ESPP. Because it is not possible to
reasonably estimate fair value at the grant date, Mid-America estimates the
compensation costs based on intrinsic values updated until the date of the
settlement. Compensation cost recognized for the twelve months ending December
31, 2007 and 2006, was approximately $35,300 and $44,400, respectively.

F-16

Incentive Plans Overview and Summary

Mid-America’s stock compensation
plans consist of the ESPP and a number of incentives provided to attract and
retain independent directors, executive officers and key employees. Incentives
are currently granted under the 2004 Stock Plan which was approved at the May
24, 2004 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. This plan replaced the 1994 Restricted
Stock and Stock Option Plan (collectively, the “Plans”) under which no further
awards may be granted as of January 31, 2004. The 1994 Restricted Stock and
Stock Option Plan allowed for the grant of restricted stock and stock options up
to a total of 2.4 million shares. The 2004 Stock Plan allows for the grant of
restricted stock and stock options up to a total of 500,000 shares. Mid-America
believes that such awards better align the interests of its employees with those
of its shareholders. Total compensation costs under the Plans were approximately
$696,900, $857,700 and $495,500 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007,
2006 and 2005, respectively. As of December 31, 2007, the total unrecognized
compensation cost related to the Plans was approximately $2.0 million. This cost
is expected to be recognized over the weighted average period of 2.2 years.
Information concerning specific grants under the Plans is listed below.

Options

All option awards made under the
Plans have been granted with the exercise price equal to the market price on the
day of grant. The options vest over five years of continuous service at a rate
of 10%, 10%, 20%, 30% and 30%, and expire 10 years from grant date. Mid-America
issues new shares when options are exercised. Dividends are not paid on
unexercised options.

The fair value of each option award
is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes method, which utilizes
the assumptions noted in the following table. Volatility is based on the
historical volatility of Mid-America’s common stock. Expected life of the option
is estimated using historical data to estimate option exercise and employee
termination. Mid-America uses a U.S. constant-maturity Treasury close to the
same expected life of the option to represent the risk-free rate. Turnover is
based on the historical rate at which options are exercised. Mid-America uses
its current dividend yield at the time of grant to estimate the dividend yield
over the life of the option. No options were granted during the periods
presented in the following table; therefore, no fair value was calculated.

Executive 2000 Restricted Stock

In 2000, Mid-America issued 10,750
restricted shares of common stock to executive officers with a grant date fair
value of $22.1875 per share. The grant date fair value was determined by the
closing trading price of Mid-America’s shares on the day prior to the date of
the grant. These shares vest 10% each over ten years through 2010. The executive
officers have the option to accelerate the vesting in lieu of bonuses. As of
December 31, 2007, no shares have been vested early. Recipients receive dividend
payments on the shares of restricted stock prior to vesting.

Key Managers 2002 Restricted Stock

In 2002, Mid-America issued 97,881
restricted shares of common stock to key managers with a grant date fair value
of $25.65 per share. The grant date fair value was determined by the closing
trading price of Mid-America’s shares on the day prior to the date of the grant.

December 31, 2007, only 81,916 shares remain issued. These shares will vest 20%
on March 31 of each year for five consecutive years beginning in 2008.
Recipients receive dividend payments on the shares of restricted stock prior to
vesting.

Director Restricted Stock Plan

Beginning with the 2005 Annual
Meeting of Shareholders, non-employee directors elected to the Board of
Directors receive a grant of $75,000 worth of restricted shares of common stock.
The shares vest in three equal installments over the director’s three-year term.
To begin the program, non-employee directors not sitting for re-election at the
2005 Annual Meeting of Shareholders received a pro-rata grant representing the
number of years left in their term. Non-employee directors appointed to the
Board outside of the Annual Meeting of Shareholders may be issued partial or
initial grants. No shares of restricted stock were granted to non-employee
directors during 2007.

Key Managers 2005 Restricted
Stock

In 2005, the Board of Directors
adopted the 2005 Key Management Restricted Stock Plan (the “2005 Plan”), a
long-term incentive program for key managers and executive officers. The 2005
Plan grants shares of restricted stock based on a sliding scale of total
shareholder return over three 12-month periods ending in 2006, 2007 and 2008.
Any restricted stock earned will vest 100% three years after the date of the
restricted stock issuance. Recipients will receive dividend payments on the
shares of restricted stock during the restriction periods. There is no automatic
vesting of the shares. Based on Mid-America’s performance from July 1, 2005,
through June 30, 2006, 25,034 restricted shares of common stock were issued to
key managers and executive officers on June 30, 2006. No shares of restricted
stock were issued in 2007.

The fair value of the stock award
was estimated on the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation with the
assumptions noted in the following table. Volatility is based on the historical
volatility of Mid-America’s common stock. The expected term of the 2005 Plan is
based on the criteria for the plan and the expected life of the awards.
Mid-America uses a U.S. constant-maturity Treasury with the same term as the
expected term of the 2005 Plan to represent the risk-free rate. Turnover is
based on the historical experience for the key managers and executive officers.
Mid-America uses its current dividend yield at the time of grant to estimate the
dividend yield over the life of the plan.

As of December 31, 2007, there was
approximately $756,100 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to
nonvested share-based compensation arrangements granted. Mid-America’s policy is
to recognize compensation cost on a straight-line basis over the requisite
service period for an entire award (rather than each portion of an award).
Accordingly, the $756,100 million unrecognized cost will be recognized over the
weighted average period of 2.2 years. No shares vested during the twelve months
ended December 31, 2007 or 2006.

Long-Term Performance Based Incentive
Plan for Executive Officers

The Compensation Committee by
authorization of the Board of Directors of Mid-America submitted the Long-Term
Performance Based Incentive Plan for Executive Officers (the “Long-Term Plan”),
which was approved by shareholders on June 2, 2003. The Long-Term Plan allowed
executive management to earn performance units that converted into shares of
restricted stock based on achieving defined total shareholder investment
performance levels. Based on Mid-America’s performance from January 1, 2003,
through December 31, 2005, 74,895 restricted shares of common stock were issued
to executive management on March 14, 2006. While these shares of restricted
stock will be entitled to dividend payments, they will not be transferable or
have voting privileges until they vest. Dependent upon the executive officer’s
continued employment with Mid-America, these shares of restricted stock vest 20%
annually from 2006 through 2010.

The fair value of the stock award
was estimated on the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation with the
assumptions noted in the following table. Volatility is based on the historical
volatility of Mid-America’s common stock. The expected term of the Long-Term
Plan is based on the criteria for the plan and the expected life of the awards.
Mid-America uses a U.S. constant-maturity Treasury for the same term as the
expected term of the Long-Term Plan to represent the risk-free rate. Turnover is

unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share-based compensation
arrangements granted. This unrecognized cost will be recognized over the
weighted average period of 2.0 years. The total fair value of shares vesting
during the twelve months ended December 31, 2007, and 2006, was approximately
$66,200, and $66,200, respectively.

4. Real Estate Joint Ventures

At the beginning of 2005,
Mid-America owned a 33.33% interest in a joint venture (“CH/Realty”) with Crow
Holdings which was formed in 2002. In 2004, CH/Realty sold the Preserve at Arbor
Lakes apartments, a 284-unit community in Jacksonville, FL. In 2005, CH/Realty
sold Seasons at Green Oaks, a 300-unit community in Grand Prairie, TX and
Preston Hills, a 464-unit community in Buford, GA, the two remaining properties
owned by the joint venture. Following the sale of the final properties from the
joint venture, Mid-America’s relationship with Crow Holdings in CH/Realty ceased
to exist.

Mid-America entered into a second
joint venture (“CH/Realty II”) with Crow Holdings in 2004 with the purchase of
the Verandas at Timberglen apartments. Mid-America also owned a 33.33% interest
in CH/Realty II, and contributed 33.33% of the capital necessary to establish
the joint venture. On January 12, 2007, CH/Realty II sold the Verandas at
Timberglen apartments and Mid-America sold its ownership interest in CH/Realty
II to Crow Holdings. As a result, Mid-America booked a gain on sale of $5.4
million and an incentive fee of $1 million, both of which are recorded in
Mid-America’s 2007 consolidated financial statements. Following the sale of the
property from the joint venture, Mid-America’s relationship with Crow Holdings
in CH/Realty II ceased to exist.

In 2007, Mid-America entered into a
joint venture, Mid-America Multifamily Fund I, LLC (“Fund I”), with
institutional capital. Mid-America owns a 33.33% interest in Fund I with plans
to acquire $500 million of apartment communities. Mid-America expects to invest
approximately $60 million as investments are made. Fund I owned no apartment
communities as of December 31, 2007.

On January 17, 2008, Fund I acquired
its first property, Milstead Village, a 310-unit community in Kennesaw, GA.

F-22

The income, contributions,
distributions and ending investment balances related to Mid-America’s joint
ventures consisted of the following for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006,
and 2005 (dollars in thousands):

F-23

5. Borrowings

Mid-America maintains a total of
$1,044 million of secured credit facilities with Prudential Mortgage Capital,
credit enhanced by FNMA (the “FNMA Facilities”). The FNMA Facilities provide for
both fixed and variable rate borrowings and have traunches with maturities from
2008 through 2014. The interest rate on the majority of the variable portion
renews every 90 days and is based on the FNMA discount mortgage backed security
rate on the date of renewal, which, for Mid-America, has historically
approximated three-month LIBOR less an average spread of 0.05% - 0.09% over the
life of the FNMA Facilities, plus a fee of 0.62% to 0.795%. Borrowings under the
FNMA Facilities totaled $906 million at December 31, 2007, consisting of $90
million under a fixed portion at a rate of 7.5%, and the remaining $816 million
under the variable rate portion of the facility at an average rate of 5.0%. The
available borrowing base capacity at December 31, 2007, was $1,028 million.
Commitment fees related to our unused FNMA Facilities totaled approximately $283
thousand for the year ended December 31, 2007. Mid-America has 22 interest rate
swap agreements, totaling a notional amount of $601 million designed to fix the
interest rate on a portion of the variable rate borrowings outstanding under the
FNMA Facilities at approximately 5.4%. The interest rate swaps have maturities
between 2008 and 2014. The swaps are highly effective and are designated as cash
flow hedges. Mid-America has also entered into six interest rate caps totaling a
notional amount of $47 million which are designated against the FNMA Facilities.
These interest rate caps have maturities between 2009 and 2012 and five are set
at 6.0% and one is set at 6.5%. The FNMA Facilities are subject to certain
borrowing base calculations that effectively reduce the amount that may be
borrowed.

Mid-America has a $300 million
credit facility with Freddie MAC (the “Freddie Mac Facility”). At December 31,
2007, Mid-America had $167 million borrowed against the Freddie Mac Facility at
an interest rate of 5.0%. Commitment fees related to our Freddie Mac Facility
totaled approximately $143 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2007.
Mid-America has ten interest rate swap agreements, totaling a notional amount of
$130 million designed to fix the interest rate on a portion of the variable rate
borrowings outstanding under the Freddie Mac Facility at approximately 5.6%. The
interest rate swaps expire in 2011 and 2014.

Mid-America also maintains a $50
million secured credit facility with two banks led by Regions Bank (the “Regions
Credit Line”; formerly with AmSouth Bank before their merger in 2006). The
Regions Credit Line bears an interest rate of LIBOR plus a spread of 1.25%. This
credit line expires in May 2008 and is subject to certain borrowing base
calculations that effectively reduce the amount that may be borrowed. At
December 31, 2007, Mid-America had $43 million available to be borrowed under
the Regions Credit Line agreement with $2 million borrowed under this facility
at an interest rate of 6.6%. Approximately $7 million of the facility is used
for letters of credit.

Each of Mid-America’s credit
facilities is subject to various covenants and conditions on usage. If
Mid-America were to fail to satisfy a condition to borrowing, the available
credit under one or more of the facilities could not be drawn, which could
adversely affect Mid-America’s liquidity. Moreover, if Mid-America were to fail
to make a payment or violate a covenant under a credit facility, after
applicable cure periods one or more of its lenders could declare a default,
accelerate the due date for repayment of all amounts outstanding and/or
foreclose on properties securing such facilities. Any such event could have a
material adverse effect on Mid-America. Mid-America believes it was in
compliance with these covenants and conditions on usage at December 31, 2007.

Mid-America had outstanding at
December 31, 2007, a $40 million promissory note with Regions Bank, (formerly
with Union Planters Bank before their merger in July 2004) at a variable
interest rate based on three month LIBOR of 6.1% which matures in April 2009.
Mid-America has entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional
amount of $25 million and an interest rate of 5.0% which expires in 2009 and is
designated against the Regions Bank promissory note.

At December 31, 2007, Mid-America
had $133 million of fixed rate conventional individual property mortgages with
an average interest rate of 4.8% and an average maturity of 2013, a $12 million
fixed rate tax exempt individual property mortgage with an interest rate of 5.2%
and a maturity in 2028, and a $5 million variable rate tax exempt individual
property mortgage at an interest rate of 4.4% with a maturity in 2028.

F-24

At December 31, 2007, Mid-America
had $221 million

(after considering the impact of interest rate swap agreements in effect)
conventional variable rate debt outstanding at an average interest rate of 5.1%,
$5 million (after considering the impact of interest rate swap agreements) of
tax-free variable rate debt outstanding at an average rate of 4.4%, $18 million
of capped conventional variable rate debt at an average interest rate of 5.3%,
and an additional $29 million of capped tax-free variable rate debt at an
average rate of

4.1%. The interest rate on all other debt, totaling $991 million, was
hedged or fixed at an average interest rate of 5.5%.

As of December 31, 2007, Mid-America
estimated that the weighted average interest rate on Mid-America’s debt was
5.4%.

At December 31, 2007, all of
Mid-America’s interest rate swaps and interest rate caps were designated as cash
flow hedges in accordance with Statement No. 133 as amended. As of December 31,
2007 and 2006, Mid-America recorded approximately $16.0 million and $1.1
million, respectively, to accrued expenses and other liabilities in the
consolidated balance sheets. Mid-America also recorded approximately $0.0
million and $12.4 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, to
other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. These accrued expenses and
other liabilities, and other assets represented the fair values of the interest
rate swaps and interest rate caps.

7. Fair Value Disclosure of Financial
Instruments

Cash and cash equivalents,
restricted cash, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities and
security deposits are carried at amounts which reasonably approximate their fair
value due to their short term nature.

Fixed rate notes payable at December
31, 2007, and 2006, total $235 million and $249 million, respectively, and have
estimated fair values of $221 million and $228 million (excluding prepayment
penalties), respectively, based upon interest rates available for the issuance
of debt with similar terms and remaining maturities as of December 31, 2007, and
2006. The carrying value of variable rate notes payable (excluding the effect of
interest rate swap and cap agreements) at December 31, 2007, and 2006, total
$1,030 million and $947 million, respectively, which reasonably approximates
their fair value because the related variable interest rates available for the
issuance of debt with similar terms and remaining maturities reasonably
approximate market rates. The notional amount of interest rate and forward
interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2007, and 2006, total $806 million
and $679 million, respectively, and have an estimated net fair value of $(16.0)
million and $11.3 million, respectively, based upon interest rates available for
interest rate swaps with similar terms and remaining maturities as of December
31, 2007, and 2006. The notional amount of interest rate cap agreements at
December 31, 2007, and 2006, total $47 million and $42 million, respectively,
and have an estimated fair value of $11 thousand and $30 thousand, respectively,
based upon interest rates available for interest rate caps with similar terms
and remaining maturities as of December 31, 2007, and 2006.

The fair value estimates presented
herein are based on information available to management as of December 31, 2007,
and 2006. These estimates are not necessarily indicative of the amounts
Mid-America could ultimately realize.

8. Commitments and Contingencies

Mid-America is not presently subject
to any material litigation nor, to Mid-America’s knowledge, with advice of legal
counsel, is any material litigation threatened against Mid-America. Mid-America
is subject to routine litigation arising in the ordinary course of business,
some of which is expected to be covered by liability insurance and none of which
is expected to have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial
statements of Mid-America.

Mid-America had operating lease
expense of approximately $11,300, $12,000 and $12,000 for the years ended
December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Mid-America has commitments of
approximately $9,200 in 2008, $6,800 in 2009, $6,600 in 2010, $6,600 in 2011 and
$5,000 in 2012 under operating lease agreements outstanding at December 31,
2007.

9. Income Taxes

No provision for federal income
taxes has been made in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Mid-America has made an election to be taxed as a Real Estate Investment Trust
(“REIT”) under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code. As a REIT,
Mid-America is generally not subject to federal income tax on that portion of
its income that qualifies as REIT taxable income to the extent that it
distributes at least 90% of its taxable income to Mid-America’s shareholders and
complies with certain requirements. If Mid-America fails to qualify as a REIT in
any taxable year, Mid-America will be subject to the federal income tax
(including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on its taxable income at
regular corporate rates. Even though Mid-America qualifies for taxation as a
REIT, Mid-America may be subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on
its income and property and to federal income and excise tax on its
undistributed income.

Earnings and profits, which
determine the taxability of dividends to shareholders, differ from net income
reported for financial reporting purposes primarily because of differences in
depreciable lives, bases of certain assets and liabilities and in the timing of
recognition of earnings upon disposition of properties. For federal income tax
purposes, the following summarizes the taxability of cash distributions paid on
the common shares in 2006 and 2005 and the estimated taxability for 2007:

10. Shareholders’ Equity

Series D Preferred Stock - Shareholders
Rights Plan

In March 1999, the Board of Directors authorized a
Shareholders Rights Plan (the “Rights Plan”). In implementing the Rights Plan,
the Board declared a distribution of one right for each of Mid-America’s
outstanding common shares which would become exercisable only if a person or
group (the “Acquiring Person”) became the beneficial owner of 10% or more of the
common shares or announced a tender or exchange offer that would result in
ownership of 10% of Mid-America’s common shares. The rights would trade with
Mid-America’s common stock until exercisable. Each holder of a right, other than
the Acquiring Person, would in that event be entitled to purchase one common
share of Mid-America for each right at one half of the then current
price.

In November 2005, as a governance
initiative, the Board voted to terminate the Rights Plan.

Series F Preferred Stock

In 2002, Mid-America issued Series F
Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (“Series F Preferred Stock”) with a $25.00
per share liquidation preference and a preferential cumulative annual
distribution of $2.3125 per share, payable monthly. On October 16, 2007,
Mid-America redeemed all of the 474,500 issued and outstanding shares of the
Series F Preferred Stock for $11.9 million.

F-28

Series H Preferred Stock

In 2003, Mid-America issued the
Series H Preferred Stock with a $25.00 per share liquidation preference and a
preferential cumulative annual distribution of $2.075 per share, payable
quarterly. Mid-America has outstanding 6,200,000 Series H Preferred Stock shares
for which it received net proceeds of $150.1 million. On and after August 11,
2008, the Series H Preferred Stock shares will be redeemable for cash at the
option of Mid-America, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to the
liquidation preference plus dividends owed and unpaid to the redemption date.

Direct Stock Purchase and Distribution
Reinvestment Plan

Mid-America has a Direct Stock
Purchase and Distribution Reinvestment Plan (“DRSPP”) pursuant to which
Mid-America's shareholders have the ability to reinvest all or part of their
distributions from Mid-America’s common stock, preferred stock or limited
partnership interests in Mid-America Apartments, L.P. into Mid-America’s common
stock. The plan also provides the opportunity to make optional cash investments
in common shares of at least $250, but not more than $5,000 in any given month,
free of brokerage commissions and charges. Mid-America, in its absolute
discretion, may grant waivers to allow for optional cash payments in excess of
$5,000. To fulfill its obligations under the DRSPP, Mid-America may either issue
additional shares of common stock or repurchase common stock in the open market.
Mid-America has registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission the offer
and sale of up to 4,600,000 shares of common stock pursuant to the DRSPP.
Additional shares will be purchased at the market price on the “Investment Date”
each month, which shall in no case be later than ten business days following the
distribution payment date. Mid-America may elect to sell shares under the DRSPP
at up to a 5% discount.

Common stock shares totaling 136,483
in 2007, 1,356,015 in 2006, and 803,251 in 2005, were acquired by shareholders
under the DRSPP. Mid-America offered an average of a 1.5% discount for optional
cash purchases in 2007, 2006 and 2005.

Controlled Equity Offering

On November 3, 2006, Mid-America
entered into a sales agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. to sell up to
2,000,000 shares of Mid-America’s common stock, from time to time in
at-the-market offerings or negotiated transactions through a controlled equity
offering program. From November 3, 2006 until the end of 2006, Mid-America sold
194,000 shares of common stock for net proceeds of $11.5 million after
underwriting commissions and SEC fees. During the first two quarters of 2007,
Mid-America sold 323,700 shares of common stock for net proceeds of $18.8
million after underwriting commissions and SEC fees.

Stock Repurchase Plan

In 1999, Mid-America’s Board of
Directors approved a stock repurchase plan to acquire up to a total of 4.0
million shares of Mid-America’s common stock. Through December 31, 2007,
Mid-America has repurchased and retired approximately 1.9 million shares of
common stock for a cost of approximately $42 million at an average price per
common share of $22.54. No shares were repurchased in 2002 through 2007, under
the plan.

F-29

11. 8 5/8% Series G Cumulative
Redeemable Preferred Stock

In 2002, Mid-America issued 8 5/8%
Series G Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (“Series G”) with a $25.00 per
share liquidation preference and a preferential cumulative annual distribution
of $2.15625 per share, payable monthly. Mid-America has outstanding 400,000
Series G shares issued in a direct placement with private investors
(“Investors”) for which it received aggregate proceeds of $10 million. On or
after November 15, 2004, Mid-America or the Investors may give the required
one-year notice to redeem or put, respectively, all or part of the Series G
shares beginning on or after November 15, 2005, in increments of $1 million. In
the event the Investors elect to put all or a part of the Series G to
Mid-America, Mid-America has the option to redeem all or a portion of the shares
of the Series G in shares of common stock of Mid-America in lieu of
cash.

On May 26, 2005, Mid-America gave
the required one-year notice to redeem all of the issued and outstanding Series
G shares. As a result, in accordance with Statement No. 150,

Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with
Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity

(“Statement 150”), Mid-America classified the Series G as a liability
within notes payable as of May 26, 2005, on the accompanying consolidated
financial statements. Statement 150 also requires that all subsequent dividend
payments be classified as interest expense on the consolidated financial
statements.

On May 26, 2006, Mid-America
redeemed all of the issued and outstanding shares of Series G.

12. Employee Benefit Plans

Following are details of employee
benefit plans not previously discussed in Item 8. Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note
2.

401 (k) Savings Plan

The Mid-America Apartment
Communities, Inc. 401(k) Savings Plan is a defined contribution plan that
satisfies the requirements of Section 401(a) and 401(k) of the Code. Mid-America
may, but is not obligated to, make a matching contribution of $0.50 for each
$1.00 contributed, up to 6% of the participant’s compensation. Mid-America’s
contribution to this plan was approximately $482,900, $382,800, and $375,400, in
2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively.

Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation
Retirement Plan

Mid-America has adopted a
non-qualified deferred compensation retirement plan for key employees who are
not qualified for participation in Mid-America’s 401(k) Savings Plan. Under the
terms of the plan, employees may elect to defer a percentage of their
compensation and Mid-America matches a portion of their salary deferral. The
plan is designed so that the employees’ investment earnings under the
non-qualified plan should be the same as the earning assets in Mid-America’s
401(k) Savings Plan. Mid-America’s match to this plan in 2007, 2006, and 2005
was approximately $42,600, $60,200, and $31,200, respectively.

Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation
Plan for Outside Company Directors

In 1998, Mid-America established the
Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan for Outside Company Directors (the
“Directors Deferred Compensation Plan”), which allows non-employee directors to
defer their director fees by having the fees held by Mid-America as shares of
Mid-America common stock. Amounts deferred through the Directors Deferred
Compensation Plan are distributed to the directors in two annual installments
beginning in the first 90 days of the year following the director’s departure
from the board. Participating directors may chose to have the amount issued to
them in shares of Mid-America common stock or paid to them as cash at the market
value as of the end of the year the director ceases to serve on the
board.

F-30

During 2007, 2006, and 2005,
Mid-America issued 5,572, 4,146, and 5,742, shares of common stock,
respectively, with weighted-average grant date fair values of $51.29, $57.05,
and $43.35, respectively, to outside directors.

In accordance with ASR 268 and EITF
D-98: “Classification and Measurement of Redeemable Securities”, the share of
common stock held in the Directors Deferred Compensation Plan are classified
outside of permanent equity in redeemable stock because the directors have
redemption rights not solely within the control of Mid-America. Additionally,
any shares that become mandatorily redeemable because a departed director has
elected to receive a cash payout are recorded as a liability as required by FASB
150 “Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both
Liabilities and Equity.” Accordingly, $230,100 was recorded in accrued expenses
and other liabilities at December 31, 2007.

Employee Stock Ownership Plan

The Mid-America Apartment
Communities, Inc. Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the “ESOP”) is a
non-contributory stock bonus plan that satisfies the requirements of Section
401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. Each employee of Mid-America is eligible to
participate in the ESOP after attaining the age of 21 years and completing one
year of service with Mid-America. Participants' ESOP accounts will be 100%
vested after three years of continuous service, with no vesting prior to that
time. Mid-America contributed 22,500 shares of common stock to the ESOP upon
conclusion of the initial offering. During 2007, 2006, and 2005, Mid-America
contributed approximately $876,400, $774,200, and $700,300, respectively, to the
ESOP which purchased an additional 16,613, 13,804, and 16,447, shares of common
stock, with weighted-average grant date fair values of $52.75, $56.08, and
$42.58, respectively.

Restricted Stock and Stock Option
Plan

Mid-America adopted the 1994
Restricted Stock and Stock Option Plan (the “1994 Plan”) to provide incentives
to attract and retain independent directors, executive officers and key
employees. As of January 31, 2004, no further awards may be granted under this
plan. The 1994 Restricted Stock and Stock Option Plan was replaced by the 2004
Stock Plan (collectively the “Plans”) by shareholder approval at the May 24,
2004, Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The Plans provide(d) for the granting of
options to purchase a specified number of shares of common stock (“Options”) or
grants of restricted shares of common stock (“Restricted Stock”). The Plan also
allow(ed) Mid-America to grant options to purchase Operating Partnership Units
at the price of the common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the day prior
to issuance of the units (the “LESOP Provision”). The 1994 Plan authorized the
issuance of 2,400,000 common shares or options to acquire shares. The 2004 Stock
Plan authorizes the issuance of 500,000 common shares or options to acquire
shares. Under the terms of the 1994 Plan, Mid-America could advance directors,
executive officers, and key employees a portion of the cost of the common stock
or units. The employee advances mature five years from the date of issuance and
accrue interest, payable in arrears, at a rate established at the date of
issuance. Mid-America has also entered into supplemental bonus agreements with
the employees which are intended to fund the payment of a portion of the
advances over a five year period. Under the terms of the supplemental bonus
agreements, Mid-America will pay bonuses to these employees equal to 3% of the
original note balance on each anniversary date of the advance, limited to 15% of
the aggregate purchase price of the shares and units. In March of 2002,
Mid-America entered into duplicate supplemental bonus agreements on the then
existing options to executive officers, effectively doubling their advances. The
advances become due and payable and the bonus agreement will terminate if the
employees voluntarily terminate their employment with Mid-America. Mid-America
also agreed to pay a bonus to certain executive officers in an amount equal to
the debt service on the advances for as long as they remain employed by
Mid-America.

F-31

As of December 31, 2007, Mid-America
had advances outstanding relating to the Plan totaling approximately $230,200,
which is recorded in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets. All of the $230,200 advances at December 31, 2007, were to current and
one former executive officers and were at interest rates ranging from
5.59%-6.49% and maturing at various dates from 2007 to 2010.

13. Earnings from Discontinued
Operations

In accordance with Statement No.
144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” the four
communities that Mid-America sold in 2007, along with the one sold in 2005, have
been classified as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of
Operations. The following is a summary of earnings from discontinued operations

14. Related Party Transactions

Pursuant to management contracts
with Mid-America’s joint ventures, Mid-America manages the operations of the
joint venture apartment communities for a fee of 4% of the revenues of the joint
venture. Mid-America received approximately $34,000, $210,000, and $325,000, as
management fees from the joint ventures in 2007, 2006, and 2005,
respectively.

Mid-America earned interest on a
$4.5 million loan to CH/Realty at an average interest rate of 9% until its
closure following the sale of its remaining two properties in 2005.

Mid-America has certain advances to
current and one former executive officer through the 1994 Plan as discussed in
Note 12.

F-32

15. Segment Information

At December 31, 2007, Mid-America
owned or had an ownership interest in 137 multifamily apartment communities in
13 different states from which it derives all significant sources of earnings
and operating cash flows. Mid-America’s operational structure is organized on a
decentralized basis, with individual property managers having overall
responsibility and authority regarding the operations of their respective
properties. Each property manager individually monitors local and area trends in
rental rates, occupancy percentages, and operating costs. Property managers are
given the on-site responsibility and discretion to react to such trends in the
best interest of Mid-America. Mid-America’s senior management
evaluates the performance of each individual property based on its contribution
to net operating income in order to ensure that the individual property
continues to meet Mid-America’s return criteria and long term investment goals.
Mid-America defines each of its multifamily communities as an individual
operating segment. It has also determined that all of its communities have
similar economic characteristics and meet the other criteria which permit the
communities to be aggregated into one reportable segment, which is acquisition
and operation of the multifamily communities owned.

16. Subsequent Events

ACQUISITIONS.

On January 10, 2008, Mid-America purchased the Cascade at
Fall Creek apartments, a 246-unit community in Humble, TX. On January 17, 2008,
Fund I made its first acquisition and purchased the Milstead Village apartments,
a 310-unit community located in Kennesaw, GA.
