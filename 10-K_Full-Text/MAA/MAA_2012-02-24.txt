ITEM 1. BUSINESS

OVERVIEW

Founded in 1994, Mid-America Apartment
Communities, Inc. is a Memphis, Tennessee-based self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust, or REIT, that
focuses on acquiring, owning and operating apartment communities in the Sunbelt region of the United States. As of December 31,
2011, we owned 100% of 160 properties representing 46,872 apartment units. Three properties include retail components with approximately
93,000 square feet of gross leasable area. As of December 31, 2011, we also had 33.33% ownership interests in Mid-America Multifamily
Fund I, LLC, or Fund I, and Mid-America Multifamily Fund II, LLC, or Fund II, which owned two properties containing 626 apartment
units and five properties containing 1,635 apartment units, respectively. These apartment communities were located across 13 states.

Our business is conducted principally through
Mid-America Apartments, L.P., which we refer to as our operating partnership. We are the sole general partner of the operating
partnership, holding 36,602,619 common units of partnership interest, or common units, comprising a 95.0% general partnership interest
in the operating partnership as of December 31, 2011. Unless the context otherwise requires, all references in this Annual Report
on Form 10-K to “we,” “us,” “our,” “the company,” or “MAA” refer collectively
to Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. and its subsidiaries.

Our corporate offices are located at 6584 Poplar
Avenue, Memphis, Tennessee 38138 and our telephone number is (901) 682-6600. As of December 31, 2011, we had 1,399 full time employees
and 67 part time employees.


FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT SEGMENTS

As of December 31, 2011, we owned or had an
ownership interest in 167 multifamily apartment communities in 13 different states from which we derived all significant sources
of earnings and operating cash flows. Senior management evaluates performance and determines resource allocations by reviewing
apartment communities individually and in the following reportable operating segments:

·

Large market same store communities are generally communities in markets with a population of
at least 1 million and at least 1% of the total public multifamily REIT units that we have owned and that have been stabilized
for at least a full 12 months and have not been classified as held for sale. Communities are considered stabilized after achieving
and maintaining at least 90% occupancy for 90 days.

·

Secondary market same store communities are generally communities in markets with populations
of more than 1 million but less than 1% of the total public multifamily REIT units or markets with populations of less than 1 million
that we have owned and that have been stabilized for at least a full 12 months and have not been classified as held for sale. Communities
are considered stabilized after achieving and maintaining at least 90% occupancy for 90 days.

·

Non same store communities and other includes recent acquisitions, communities in development
or lease-up and communities that have been classified as held for sale. Also included in non same store communities are non multifamily
activities which represent less than 1% of our portfolio. .

On the first day
of each calendar year, we determine the composition of our same store operating segments for that year, which allows us to evaluate
full period-over-period operating comparisons.

We utilize net operating income, or NOI, in evaluating the performance. Total
NOI represents total property revenues less total property operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, for all
properties held during the period regardless of their status as held for sale. We believe NOI is a helpful tool in evaluating the
operating performance of our segments because it measures the core operations of property performance by excluding corporate level
expenses and other items not related to property operating performance.

A summary of segment operating results for 2011,
2010 and 2009 is included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,
Note 13. Additionally, segment operating performance for such years is discussed in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

BUSINESS OBJECTIVES

Our primary business objectives are to protect
and grow existing property values, to maintain a stable and increasing cash flow that will fund our dividend through all parts
of the real estate investment cycle, and to create new shareholder value by growing in a disciplined manner. To achieve these objectives,
we intend to continue to pursue the following goals and strategies:


·

effectively and efficiently operate our existing properties with an intense property and asset management focus and a decentralized
structure;

·

when accretive to long-term shareholder value, acquire or develop additional high-quality properties throughout the Sunbelt
region of the United States;

·

selectively dispose of properties that no longer meet our ownership guidelines;

·

develop, renovate and reposition existing properties;

·

diversify investment capital across both large and secondary markets to achieve a growing and less volatile operating performance
profile to better support dividend funding across the full real estate and economic market cycle;

·

enter into joint ventures to acquire and reposition properties; and

·

actively manage our capital structure.

OPERATION STRATEGY

Our goal is to maximize our return on investment
collectively and in each apartment community by increasing revenues, tightly controlling operating expenses, maintaining high occupancy
levels and reinvesting as appropriate. The steps taken to meet these objectives include:

·

diversifying portfolio investments across both large and secondary markets;

·

providing management information and improved customer services through technology innovations;

·

utilizing systems to enhance property managers’ ability to optimize revenue by adjusting rents in response to local market
conditions and individual unit amenities;

·

developing new ancillary income programs aimed at offering new services to residents, including, among others, cable and internet
access, on which we generate revenue;

·

implementing programs to control expenses through investment in cost-saving initiatives, including measuring and passing on
to residents the cost of various expenses, including water and other utility costs;

·

analyzing individual asset productivity performances to identify best practices and improvement areas;

·

proactively maintaining the physical condition of each property through ongoing capital investments;

·

improving the “curb appeal” of the apartment communities through extensive landscaping and exterior improvements,
and repositioning apartment communities from time-to-time to maintain market leadership positions;

·

aggressively managing lease expirations to align with peak leasing traffic patterns and to maximize productivity of property
staffing;

·

allocating additional capital, including capital for selective interior and exterior improvements, where the investment will
generate the highest returns;

·

compensating employees through performance-based compensation and stock ownership programs;

·

maintaining a hands-on management style and “flat” organizational structure that emphasizes senior management's
continued close contact with the market and employees;

·

selling or exchanging underperforming assets;

·

issuing or repurchasing shares of common or preferred stock when cost of capital and asset values permit;

·

acquiring and from time to time developing properties when expected returns exceed our investment hurdle rate; and

·

maintaining disciplined investment and capital allocation practices.


Decentralized Operational Structure

We operate in a decentralized
manner. We believe that our decentralized operating structure capitalizes on specific market knowledge, provides greater personal
accountability than a centralized structure and is beneficial in the acquisition and redevelopment processes. To support this decentralized
operational structure, senior and executive management, along with various asset management functions, are proactively involved
in supporting and reviewing property management through extensive reporting processes and frequent on-site visitations. To maximize
the amount of information shared between senior and executive management and the properties on a real time basis, we utilize a
web-based property management system. The system contains property and accounting modules which allow for operating efficiencies,
continued expense control, provide for various expanded revenue management practices, and improve the support provided to on-site
property operations. We

use a “yield management” pricing program that helps our property managers optimize rental
revenues, and we also utilize purchase order and accounts payable software to provide improved controls and management information.
We have also implemented revised utility billing processes, rolled out new web-sites enabling on-line lease applications and improved
web-based marketing programs.

Intensive Property and Asset Management
Focus

We have traditionally
emphasized property management, and over the past several years, we have deepened our asset management functions to provide additional
support in marketing, training, ancillary income and revenue management. A majority of our property managers are Certified Apartment
Managers, a designation established by the National Apartment Association, which provides training for on-site manager professionals.
We also provide our own

in-house leadership development program consisting of an 18-month, three-module program followed
by two comprehensive case studies, which was developed with the assistance of U.S. Learning, Inc.

ACQUISITION AND JOINT VENTURE STRATEGY

One of our growth strategies is to acquire and
redevelop apartment communities for our wholly-owned portfolio that are diversified over both large and secondary markets throughout
the Sunbelt region of the United States and that meet our investment criteria of expected leveraged returns exceeding our investment
hurdle rate, generally defined as our estimated cost of equity plus 20%. We have extensive experience and research-based skills
in the acquisition and repositioning of multifamily communities. In addition, we will acquire newly built and developed communities
that can be purchased on a favorable pricing basis. We will continue to evaluate opportunities that arise, and will utilize this
strategy to increase the number of apartment communities in strong and growing markets.

Another of our growth strategies is to co-invest
with partners in joint venture opportunities to the extent we believe that a joint venture will enable us to obtain a higher return
on our investment through management and other fees, which leverage our skills in acquiring, repositioning, redeveloping and managing
multifamily investments. In addition, the joint venture investment strategy can provide a platform for creating more capital diversification
and lower investment risk for us. At present, we have focused our joint venture investment strategy on properties seven years old
or older, with younger acquisitions becoming part of the wholly-owned portfolio.


As of December 31, 2011, we were partners in
two joint ventures: Mid-America Multifamily Fund I, LLC, or Fund I, and Mid-America Multifamily Fund II, LLC, or Fund II.

On August 27, 2008, we purchased 215 units of the 234-unit Village Oaks apartments located in Temple Terrace, Florida, a suburb
of Tampa. The remaining 19 units had previously been sold as condominiums and it is our intent to acquire these units if and when
they become available, and operate them as apartment rentals with the rest of the community. During the remainder of 2008, we acquired
four of the remaining 19 units and in 2009 we acquired an additional seven units and in 2010 we acquired an additional 3 units.

DISPOSITION STRATEGY

At 16 years average age, we have one of the
younger portfolios in the multifamily REIT sector, and strive to maintain a young portfolio of our assets in excellent condition,
believing that continuous capital replacement and maintenance will lead to higher long-run returns on investment. From time-to-time,
we dispose of mature assets, defined as those apartment communities that no longer meet our investment criteria and long-term strategic
objectives, to ensure that our portfolio consists primarily of high quality, well-located properties within our market area. Typically,
we select assets for disposition that do not meet our present investment criteria, including estimated future return on investment,
location, market, potential for growth and capital needs. From time-to-time we also may dispose of assets for which we receive
an offer meeting or exceeding our return on investment criteria even though those assets may not meet the disposition criteria
disclosed above. During 2011, we disposed of two properties totaling 534 units.


DEVELOPMENT, RENOVATION, AND REPOSITIONING STRATEGY

Periodically, we invest in limited expansion
development projects through fee based development agreements using fixed price construction contracts. These contracts can have
variability to cover any project cost overruns that may occur. Some development agreements require that cost overruns are contractually
shared with the developer up to a specified level, while other development agreements stipulate that cost overruns are the responsibility
of the developer. In October 2010, we purchased land in Franklin (Nashville), Tennessee and entered into an agreement to develop
a 428-unit apartment community on the site. Construction began in late 2010, but no units were completed by the end of the 2011.
During 2011, we also began developing a phase II to the 1225 South Church apartments in Charlotte, North Carolina that were purchased
in December 2010. In addition, we purchased land in Little Rock, Arkansas during 2011 and entered into a development agreement
to develop a 312-unit apartment community on the site. We are also under contract to purchase 10.7 acres of land and begin construction
on a new 270-unit community located in the Charleston, South Carolina metropolitan area. Closing on the land and initial construction
is expected to occur in the first quarter of 2012.While we seek opportunistic new development investments offering superior locations
with attractive long-term investment returns, we do not currently intend to maintain a dedicated development staff or to expand
into development in a significant way. We expect our investment in new development will remain a smaller component of overall growth
as compared to growth through acquiring existing properties.

Beginning in 2005, we began an initiative of
upgrading a significant number of our existing apartment communities in key markets across our portfolio. We focus on both interior
unit upgrades and shared exterior amenities above and beyond routine capital upkeep in markets that we believe continue to have
growth potential and can support the increased rent. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we renovated 3,118 units achieving
a combined 9.6% rent increase above the normal renewal rate.

CAPITAL STRUCTURE STRATEGY

We use a combination of debt and equity sources
to fund our portfolio of assets, focused on producing the overall lowest cost and most flexible capital structure. We focus on
improving the net present value of each share of our common stock by generating cash flows from our portfolio of investments above
the estimated total cost of debt and equity capital. We routinely make new investments when we believe it can add to value per
share. In the past, we have sold assets to fund share repurchases when, in management’s view, shareholder value would be
enhanced.

At December 31, 2011,
39% of our total capitalization consisted of borrowings, including 36% for secured borrowings and 3% for unsecured borrowings.

We currently intend to target our total debt to a range of approximately 45% to 55% of the undepreciated book value of our
assets, although our charter and bylaws do not limit our debt levels; however, our net-debt (total debt less excess cash on hand)
to undepreciated book value is limited to 60% by our debt covenants. We may issue new equity to maintain our debt within this target
range. As of December 31, 2011, our ratio of net-debt to undepreciated book value was approximately 46%. Our Board of Directors
can modify this policy at any time, which could allow us to become more highly leveraged but may decrease our ability to make distributions
to our shareholders.


We continuously review opportunities for lowering
our cost of capital, and increasing net present value per share. Recently we received a BBB credit rating from Fitch as part of
our strategy to access a broader financing market. This rating supported our issuance of $135 million in senior unsecured notes
and the opening of a $250 million unsecured credit facility. We evaluate opportunities to repurchase stock when we believe that
our stock price is below our net present value. We also look for opportunities where we can acquire or develop apartment communities,
selectively funded or partially funded by stock sales, when the investment return is projected to substantially exceed our cost
of capital. We will also opportunistically seek to lower our cost of capital through issuing, refinancing or redeeming preferred
stock as we did in 2010.

We have entered into
sales agreements with

Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Raymond James & Associates, Inc. and Merrill Lynch, Pierce,
Fenner & Smith Incorporated

to sell shares of our common stock, from time-to-time in at-the-market
offerings or negotiated transactions through controlled equity offering programs, or ATMs.

The following are the issuances of common stock
which have been made through these agreements through December 31, 2011:

We also have a direct stock purchase plan, which
allows for the optional cash purchase of common stock of at least $250, but not more than $5,000 in any given month, free of brokerage
commissions and charges. We, in our absolute discretion, may grant waivers to allow for optional cash payments in excess of $5,000.
During the year ended December 31, 2011, we issued a total of 495,645 shares through the optional cash purchase feature of our
direct stock purchase plan, resulting in net proceeds of $30.0 million.

SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM

In 1999, our Board of Directors approved
an increase in the number of shares of our common stock authorized to be repurchased to 4 million shares. As of December 31, 2011,
we had repurchased a total of approximately 1.86 million shares (8% of the shares of common stock and common units outstanding
as of the beginning of the repurchase program). From time-to-time, we intend to repurchase shares when we believe that shareholder
value is enhanced. Factors affecting this determination include, among others, the share price, financing agreements and rates
of return. No shares were repurchased from 2002 through 2011 under this plan.


COMPETITION

All of our apartment communities are located
in areas that include other apartment communities. Occupancy and rental rates are affected by the number of competitive apartment
communities in a particular area. The owners of competing apartment communities may have greater resources than us, and the managers
of these apartment communities may have more experience than our management. Moreover, single-family rental housing, manufactured
housing, condominiums and the new and existing home markets provide housing alternatives to potential residents of apartment communities.

Apartment communities compete on the basis of
monthly rent, discounts and facilities offered, such as apartment size and amenities, and apartment community amenities, including
recreational facilities, resident services and physical property condition. We make capital improvements to both our apartment
communities and individual apartments on a regular basis in order to maintain a competitive position in each individual market.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

As part of the acquisition process, we obtain
environmental studies on all of our apartment communities from various outside environmental engineering firms. The purpose of
these studies is to identify potential sources of contamination at the apartment communities and to assess the status of environmental
regulatory compliance. These studies generally include historical reviews of the apartment communities, reviews of certain public
records, preliminary investigations of the sites and surrounding properties, inspection for the presence of asbestos,

poly-chlorinated
biphenyls, or

PCBs, and underground storage tanks and the preparation and issuance of written reports. Depending on the
results of these studies, more invasive procedures, such as soil sampling or ground water analysis, will be performed to investigate
potential sources of contamination. These studies must be satisfactorily completed before we take ownership of an acquisition community;
however, no assurance can be given that the studies identify all significant environmental problems.

Under various federal, state and local laws
and regulations, an owner or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous
or toxic substances on properties. Such laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner caused or knew of
the presence of hazardous or toxic substances and whether the storage of such substances was in violation of a resident’s
lease. Furthermore, the cost of remediation and removal of such substances may be substantial, and the presence of such substances,
or the failure to promptly remediate such substances, may adversely affect the owner’s ability to sell such real estate or
to borrow using such real estate as collateral.

We are aware of environmental concerns specifically
relating to potential issues resulting from mold in residential properties and have in place an active management and preventive
maintenance program that includes procedures specifically related to mold. We have established a policy requiring residents to
sign a mold addendum to lease. We also have a $5 million insurance policy that covers remediation and exposure to mold. Therefore,
we believe that our exposure to this issue is limited and controlled.

The environmental studies we received have not
revealed any material environmental liabilities. We are not aware of any existing conditions that would currently be considered
a material environmental liability. Nevertheless, it is possible that the studies do not reveal all environmental liabilities or
that there are material environmental liabilities of which we are not aware. Moreover, no assurance can be given concerning future
laws, ordinances or regulations, or the potential introduction of hazardous or toxic substances by neighboring properties or residents.


We believe that our apartment communities are
in compliance in all material respects with all applicable federal, state and local ordinances and regulations regarding hazardous
or toxic substances and other environmental matters.

QUALIFICATION AS A REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT
TRUST

We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. To continue to qualify as a REIT, we must continue to meet certain
tests which, among other things, generally require that our assets consist primarily of real estate assets, our income be derived
primarily from real estate assets, and that we distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (other than our net capital gain)
to our shareholders annually. As a qualified REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes at the corporate
level on our net income to the extent we distribute such net income to our shareholders annually. Even if we continue to qualify
as a REIT, we will continue to be subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on our income and our property. In 2011, we
paid total distributions of $2.51 per common share to our shareholders, which was above the 90% REIT distribution requirement.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

Dispositions

On January 12, 2012, we closed on the sale of
the 320-unit Kenwood Club at the Park apartment community located in Katy (Houston), Texas, resulting in a gain of approximately
$9.6 million.


On February 9, 2012, we closed on
the sale of the 276-unit Cedar Mill apartment community located in Memphis, Tennessee, resulting in no material gain or loss.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

In addition to the other information contained
in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, We have identified the following additional risks and uncertainties that may have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Investors should carefully consider the risks described
below before making an investment decision. Our business faces significant risks and the risks described below may not be the only
risks we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also significantly impair
our business operations. If any of these risks occur, our business, results of operations or financial condition could suffer,
the market price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment in our common stock.

RISKS RELATED TO OUR REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS AND OUR OPERATIONS

Economic slowdown in the United States and downturns in the housing
and real estate markets may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations

There have been significant declines in economic
growth, both in the United States and globally. Both the real estate industry and the broader United States economy have experienced
unfavorable conditions which adversely affected our revenues. Although our industry and the United States economy showed signs
of improvement in 2010 and 2011, we cannot accurately predict that market conditions will continue to improve in the near future
or that our financial condition and results of operations will not continue to be adversely affected. Factors such as weakened
economies and related reduction in spending, falling home prices and job losses, price volatility, and/or dislocations and liquidity
disruptions in the financial and credit markets could, among other things, impede the ability of our tenants and other parties
with which we conduct business to perform their contractual obligations, which could lead to an increase in defaults by our tenants
and other contracting parties, which could adversely affect our revenues. Furthermore, our ability to lease our properties at favorable
rates, or at all, is adversely affected by increases in supply and deterioration in multifamily markets and is dependent upon the
overall level of spending in the economy, which is adversely affected by, among other things, job losses and unemployment levels,
recession, personal debt levels, downturns in the housing market, stock market volatility and uncertainty about the future. With
regard to our ability to lease our multifamily properties, the increasing rental of excess for-sale condominiums and single family
homes, which increases the supply of multifamily units and housing alternatives, may reduce our ability to lease our multifamily
units and depress rental rates in certain markets. When we experience a downturn, we cannot predict how long demand and other factors
in the real estate market will remain unfavorable, but if the markets remain weak over extended periods of time or deteriorate
significantly, our ability to lease our properties or our ability to increase or maintain rental rates in certain markets may weaken.

Failure to generate sufficient cash flows could limit our ability
to pay distributions to shareholders

Our ability to generate sufficient cash flow
in order to pay distributions to our shareholders depends on our ability to generate funds from operations in excess of capital
expenditure requirements and/or to have access to the markets for debt and equity financing. Funds from operations and the value
of our apartment communities may be insufficient because of factors which are beyond our control. Such events or conditions could
include:


·

competition from other apartment communities;

·

overbuilding of new apartment units or oversupply of available apartment units in our markets, which might adversely affect
apartment occupancy or rental rates and/or require rent concessions in order to lease apartment units;

·

conversion of condominiums and single family houses to rental use;

·

weakness in the overall economy which lowers job growth and the associated demand for apartment housing;

·

increases in operating costs (including real estate taxes and insurance premiums) due to inflation and other factors, which
may not be offset by increased rents;

·

inability to initially, or subsequently after lease terminations, rent apartments on favorable economic terms;

·

inability to complete or lease-up development communities on a timely basis, if at all;

·

changes in governmental regulations and the related costs of compliance;

·

changes in laws including, but not limited to, tax laws and housing laws including the enactment of rent control laws or other
laws regulating multifamily housing;

·

withdrawal of government support of apartment financing through its financial backing of the Federal National Mortgage Association,
or FNMA, or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, or Freddie Mac;

·

an uninsured loss, including those resulting from a catastrophic storm, earthquake, or act of terrorism;

·

changes in interest rate levels and the availability of financing, borrower credit standards, and down-payment requirements
which could lead renters to purchase homes (if interest rates decrease and home loans are more readily available) or increase our
acquisition and operating costs (if interest rates increase and financing is less readily available); and

·

the relative illiquidity of real estate investments.

At times, we rely on external funding sources
to fully fund the payment of distributions to shareholders and our capital investment program (including our existing property
expansion developments). While we have sufficient liquidity to permit distributions at current rates through additional borrowings
if necessary, any significant and sustained deterioration in operations could result in our financial resources being insufficient
to pay distributions to shareholders at the current rate, in which event we would be required to reduce the distribution rate.
Any decline in our funds from operations could adversely affect our ability to make distributions to our shareholders or to meet
our loan covenants and could have a material adverse effect on our stock price.

We may be adversely affected by new laws and regulations

The current United States administration and
Congress have enacted, or called for consideration of, proposals relating to a variety of issues, including with respect to health
care, financial regulation reform, climate control, executive compensation and others. We believe that these and other potential
proposals could have varying degrees of impact on us ranging from minimal to material. At this time, we are unable to predict with
certainty what level of impact specific proposals could have on us.


Certain rulemaking and administrative efforts
that may have an impact on us focus principally on the areas perceived as contributing to the global financial crisis and the continuing
economic downturn. These initiatives have created a degree of uncertainty regarding the basic rules governing the real estate industry
and many other businesses that is unprecedented in the United States at least since the wave of lawmaking and regulatory reform
that followed in the wake of the Great Depression. The federal legislative response in this area has culminated most recently in
the enactment on July 21, 2010 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act. Many
of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act have extended implementation periods and delayed effective dates and will require extensive
rulemaking by regulatory authorities; thus, the impact on us may not be known for an extended period of time. The Dodd-Frank Act,
including future rules implementing its provisions and the interpretation of those rules, along with other legislative and regulatory
proposals that are proposed or pending in the United States Congress, may limit our revenues, impose fees or taxes on us, and/or
intensify the regulatory framework in which we operate in ways that are not currently identifiable.

Changing laws, regulations and standards relating
to corporate governance and public disclosure in particular, including certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, have created uncertainty for public companies like ours and could significantly increase the
costs and risks associated with accessing the United States public markets. Because we are committed to maintaining high standards
of internal control over financial reporting, corporate governance and public disclosure, our management team will need to devote
significant time and financial resources to comply with these evolving standards for public companies. We intend to continue to
invest appropriate resources to comply with both existing and evolving standards, and this investment has resulted and will likely
continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue
generating activities to compliance activities.

We are dependent on key personnel

Our success depends in part on our ability to
attract and retain the services of executive officers and other personnel. There is substantial competition for qualified personnel
in the real estate industry, and the loss of several of our key personnel could have an adverse effect on us.

New acquisitions may fail to perform as expected, and failure
to integrate acquired communities and new personnel could create inefficiencies

We intend to actively acquire and improve multifamily
communities for rental operations. We may underestimate the costs necessary to bring an acquired community up to standards established
for our intended market position. Additionally, to grow successfully, we must be able to apply our experience in managing our existing
portfolio of apartment communities to a larger number of properties. We must also be able to integrate new management and operations
personnel as our organization grows in size and complexity. Failures in either area will result in inefficiencies that could adversely
affect our overall profitability.

We may not be able to sell communities when appropriate

Real estate investments are relatively illiquid
and generally cannot be sold quickly. We may not be able to change our portfolio promptly in response to economic or other conditions.
Further, we own seven communities, which are subject to restrictions on sale and are required to be exchanged through a 1031b tax-free
exchange, unless we pay the tax liability of the contributing partners. This inability to respond promptly to changes in the performance
of our investments could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to make distributions to our security holders.


Environmental problems are possible and can be costly

Federal, state and local laws and regulations
relating to the protection of the environment may require a current or previous owner or operator of real estate to investigate
and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at such community. The owner or operator may have to pay
a governmental entity or third parties for property damage and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred by such parties in
connection with the contamination. These laws typically impose clean-up responsibility and liability without regard to whether
the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants. Even if more than one person may have been responsible
for the contamination, each person covered by the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the clean-up costs incurred.
In addition, third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination
emanating from that site. All of our communities have been the subject of environmental assessments completed by qualified independent
environmental consultant companies. These environmental assessments have not revealed, nor are we aware of, any environmental liability
that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.

Over the past several years, there have been
an increasing number of lawsuits against owners and managers of multifamily properties alleging personal injury and property damage
caused by the presence of mold in residential real estate. Some of these lawsuits have resulted in substantial monetary judgments
or settlements. We cannot be assured that existing environmental assessments of our communities reveal all environmental liabilities,
that any prior owner of any of our properties did not create a material environmental condition not known to us, or that a material
environmental condition does not otherwise exist.

Changes in the system for establishing United States accounting
standards may materially and adversely affect our reported results of operations

Accounting for public companies in the United
States has historically been conducted in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as in effect in the United States,
or GAAP. GAAP is established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, an independent body whose standards are recognized
by the SEC as authoritative for publicly held companies. The International Accounting Standards Board, or IASB, is a London-based
independent board established in 2001 and charged with the development of International Financial Reporting Standards, or IFRS.
IFRS generally reflects accounting practices that prevail in Europe and in developed nations around the world.

IFRS differs in material respects from GAAP.
Among other things, IFRS has historically relied more on “fair value” models of accounting for assets and liabilities
than GAAP. “Fair value” models are based on periodic revaluation of assets and liabilities, often resulting in fluctuations
in such values as compared to GAAP, which relies more frequently on historical cost as the basis for asset and liability valuation.

The SEC has proposed the mandatory adoption
of IFRS by United States public companies possibly starting in 2015. It is unclear at this time how the SEC will propose that GAAP
and IFRS be harmonized if the proposed change is adopted. In addition, switching to a new method of accounting and adopting IFRS
will be a complex undertaking. We may need to develop new systems and controls based on the principles of IFRS. Since these are
new endeavors, and the precise requirements of the pronouncements ultimately adopted are not now known, the magnitude of costs
associated with this conversion are uncertain.


We are currently evaluating the impact of the
adoption of IFRS on our financial position and results of operations. Such evaluation cannot be completed, however, without more
clarity regarding the specific IFRS standards that will be adopted. Until there is more certainty with respect to the IFRS standards
to be adopted, prospective investors should consider that our conversion to IFRS could have a material adverse impact on our reported
results of operations.

Losses from catastrophes may exceed our insurance coverage

We carry comprehensive liability and property
insurance on our communities and intend to obtain similar coverage for communities we acquire in the future. Some losses, generally
of a catastrophic nature, such as losses from floods, hurricanes or earthquakes, are subject to limitations, and thus may be uninsured.
We exercise our discretion in determining amounts, coverage limits and deductibility provisions of insurance, with a view to maintaining
appropriate insurance on our investments at a reasonable cost and on suitable terms. If we suffer a substantial loss, our insurance
coverage may not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement value of our lost investment. Inflation,
changes in building codes and ordinances, environmental considerations and other factors also might make it infeasible to use insurance
proceeds to replace a property after it has been damaged or destroyed.

Increasing real estate taxes and insurance costs may negatively
impact financial condition

As a result of our substantial real estate holdings,
the cost of real estate taxes and insuring our apartment communities is a significant component of expense. Real estate taxes and
insurance premiums are subject to significant increases and fluctuations, which can be widely outside of our control. If the costs
associated with real estate taxes and insurance should significantly rise, our financial condition could be negatively impacted,
and our ability to pay our dividend could be affected.

We may experience increased costs arising from health care reform

In March 2010, the United States government
enacted comprehensive health care reform legislation which, among other things, includes guaranteed coverage requirements, eliminates
pre-existing condition exclusions and annual and lifetime maximum limits, restricts the extent to which policies can be rescinded
and imposes new and significant taxes on health insurers and health care benefits. The legislation imposes implementation effective
dates beginning in 2010 and extending through 2020, and many of the changes require additional guidance from government agencies
or federal regulations. Several states have challenged the constitutionality of certain provisions of the health care reform legislation,
and many of these challenges are still pending final adjudication in several jurisdictions, including the United States Supreme
Court. Therefore, due to the phased-in nature of the implementation, the lack of interpretive guidance, and the pending court challenges
to this legislation, it is difficult to determine at this time what impact the health care reform legislation will have on our
financial results. Possible adverse effects of the health reform legislation include increased costs, exposure to expanded liability
and requirements for us to revise ways in which we provide healthcare and other benefits to our employees. In addition, our results
of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.


Property insurance limits may be inadequate, and deductibles
may be excessive in the event of a catastrophic loss or a series of major losses, which may cause a breach of loan covenants

We have a significant proportion of our assets
in areas exposed to windstorms and to the New Madrid seismic zone. A major wind or earthquake loss, or series of losses, could
require that we pay significant deductibles as well as additional amounts above the per occurrence limit of our insurance for these
risks. We may then be judged to have breached one or more of our loan covenants, and any of the foregoing events could have a material
adverse effect on our assets, financial condition, and results of operation.

Compliance or failure to comply with laws requiring access to
our properties by disabled persons could result in substantial cost

The Americans with Disabilities Act, the Fair
Housing Act of 1988 and other federal, state and local laws generally require that public accommodations be made accessible to
disabled persons. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the government or the award of damages to private litigants.
These laws may require us to modify our existing communities. These laws may also restrict renovations by requiring improved access
to such buildings by disabled persons or may require us to add other structural features that increase our construction costs.
Legislation or regulations adopted in the future may impose further burdens or restrictions on us with respect to improved access
by disabled persons. We cannot ascertain the costs of compliance with these laws, which may be substantial.

Development and construction risks could
impact our profitability

Currently,
we have two development communities and a second phase to an existing community under construction totaling 950 units as of December
31, 2011. No units for the development projects were completed as of December 31, 2011. Our development and construction activities
are subject to the following risks:

·

we may be unable
to obtain, or face delays in obtaining, necessary zoning, land-use, building, occupancy and other required governmental permits
and authorizations, which could result in increased development costs, could delay initial occupancy dates for all or a portion
of a development community, and could require us to abandon our activities entirely with respect to a project for which we are
unable to obtain permits or authorizations;

·

yields may be less
than anticipated as a result of delays in completing projects, costs that exceed budget and/or higher than expected concessions
for lease up and lower rents than pro forma;

·

bankruptcy of developers
in our development projects could impose delays and costs on us with respect to the development of our communities and may adversely
affect our financial condition and results of operations;

·

we may abandon development
opportunities that we have already begun to explore, and we may fail to recover expenses already incurred in connection with exploring
such opportunities;


·

we may be unable
to complete construction and lease-up of a community on schedule, or incur development or construction costs that exceed our original
estimates, and we may be unable to charge rents that would compensate for any increase in such costs;

·

occupancy rates and
rents at a newly developed community may fluctuate depending on a number of factors, including market and economic conditions,
preventing us from meeting our profitability goals for that community; and

·

when we sell to third
parties communities or properties that we developed or renovated, we may be subject to warranty or construction defect that are
uninsured or exceed the limit of our insurance.

RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDEBTEDNESS AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES

A change in United States government policy with regard to FNMA
and Freddie Mac could seriously impact our financial condition

On February 11, 2011, the Obama Administration
released a report to Congress which included options, among others, to gradually shrink and eventually shut down FNMA and Freddie
Mac. In August 2011, Standard & Poor’s Rating Services downgraded the credit ratings of FNMA and Freddie Mac from AAA
to AA+. We do not know when or if FNMA or Freddie Mac will restrict their support of lending to the multifamily industry or to
us in particular. As of December 31, 2011, 69% of our outstanding debt was borrowed through credit facilities provided by or credit-enhanced
by FNMA or Freddie Mac with agency rate-based maturities ranging from 2012 through 2018. While the report to Congress recognized
the critically important role that FNMA and Freddie Mac play in the housing finance market and committed to ensuring they have
sufficient capital to perform under any guarantees issued now or in the future and the ability to meet any of their debt obligations,
should they be unable to meet their obligations it would have a material adverse effect on both us and the multifamily industry,
and we would seek alternative sources of funding. This could jeopardize the effectiveness of our interest rate swaps, require us
to post collateral up to the market value of the interest rate swaps, and either of these occurrences could potentially cause a
breach in one or more of our loan covenants, and through reduced loan availability, impact the value of multifamily assets, which
could impair the value of our properties.

Our financing could be impacted by negative capital market conditions

Over the past three and a half years, domestic
financial markets have experienced unusual volatility and uncertainty. Liquidity tightened in financial markets, including the
investment grade debt, the CMBS, commercial paper, and equity capital markets. A large majority of apartment financing, and as
of December 31, 2011, 69% of our outstanding debt, was borrowed through credit facilities provided by or credit-enhanced by FNMA
and Freddie Mac, which are now under the conservatorship of the United States government, but for which, on February 11, 2011,
the Obama Administration released a report to Congress which included options to gradually shrink and eventually shut down FNMA
and Freddie Mac. We have seen an increase in the volatility of short term interest rates and changes in historic relationships
between LIBOR (which is the basis for the majority of the payments to us by our swap counterparties) and the actual interest rate
we pay through the FNMA Discount Mortgage Backed Security, or DMBS, and the Freddie Mac Reference Bill programs. This creates a
risk that our interest expense will fluctuate to a greater extent than it has in the past, and it makes forecasting more difficult.
Were our credit arrangements with Prudential Mortgage Capital, credit-enhanced by FNMA, or with Financial Federal, credit-enhanced
by Freddie Mac, to fail, or their ability to lend money to finance apartment communities to become impaired or cease, we would
have to seek alternative sources of capital, which might not be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. In addition, any
such event would most likely cause our interest costs to rise. This could also cause our interest rate swaps and caps to become
ineffective, triggering a default in one or more of our credit agreements. If any of the foregoing events were to occur, it could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and prospects.


Various agency rate-based traunches of our credit
facilities with FNMA and Freddie Mac mature from 2012 through 2018, and we anticipate that replacement financing, whether with
FNMA, Freddie Mac, or other options in the financial markets, will be at a higher cost.

A change in the value of our assets could cause us to experience
a cash shortfall, to be in default of our loan covenants, or to incur a charge for the impairment of assets

We borrow on a secured basis from FNMA, Freddie
Mac, and on an unsecured basis from a syndicate of banks led by Key Bank. A significant reduction in the value of our assets could
require us to post additional collateral. While we believe that we have significant excess collateral and capacity, future asset
values are uncertain. If we were unable to meet a request to add collateral to a credit facility, this would have a material adverse
effect on our liquidity and our ability to meet our loan covenants. We may determine that the value of an individual asset, or
group of assets, was irrevocably impaired, and that we may need to record a charge to write-down the value of the asset to reflect
its current value.

Debt level, refinancing and loan covenant risk may adversely
affect our financial condition and operating results and our ability to maintain our status as a REIT

At December 31, 2011, we had total debt outstanding
of $1.65 billion. Payments of principal and interest on borrowings may leave us with insufficient cash resources to operate the
apartment communities or to pay distributions that are required to be paid in order for us to maintain our qualification as a REIT.
We currently intend to limit our total debt to a range of approximately 45% to 55% of the undepreciated book value of our assets,
although our charter and bylaws do not limit our debt levels. Our net-debt to undepreciated book value is limited to 60% by our
debt covenants. As of December 31, 2011, our ratio of net-debt to undepreciated book value was approximately 46%. Our Board of
Directors can modify this policy at any time, which could allow us to become more highly leveraged and decrease our ability to
make distributions to our shareholders. In addition, we must repay our debt upon maturity, and the inability to access debt or
equity capital at attractive rates could adversely affect our financial condition and/or our funds from operations. We rely on
FNMA and Freddie Mac, which we refer to as the Agencies, for the majority of our debt financing and have agreements with the Agencies
and with other lenders that require us to comply with certain covenants, including maintaining adequate collateral that is subject
to revaluation annually. The breach of any one of these covenants would place us in default with our lenders and may have serious
consequences on our operations.

Interest rate hedging may be ineffective

We rely on the financial markets to refinance
debt maturities, and also rely on the Agencies, which provided credit or credit enhancement for the majority of our outstanding
debt as of December 31, 2011. The debt is provided under the terms of credit facilities with Prudential Mortgage Capital (credit-enhanced
by FNMA) and Financial Federal (credit-enhanced by Freddie Mac). We pay fees to the credit facility providers and the Agencies
plus interest which is based on the FNMA DMBS rate, and the Freddie Mac Reference Bill Rate.


The interest rate market for the FNMA DMBS rate
and the Freddie Mac Reference Bill Rate, both of which have been highly correlated with LIBOR interest rates, are also an important
component of our liquidity and interest rate swap and cap effectiveness. In our experience, the FNMA DMBS rate has historically
averaged 16 basis points below three-month LIBOR, and the Freddie Mac Reference Bill rate has averaged 32 basis points below the
associated LIBOR rate, but in the past 3 years the spreads increased significantly and have been more volatile than we have historically
seen. We cannot forecast when or if the uncertainty and volatility in the market may change. Continued unusual volatility over
a period of time could cause us to lose hedge accounting treatment for our interest rate swaps and caps, resulting in material
changes to our consolidated statements of operations and balance sheet, and potentially cause a breach with one of our debt covenants.

Fluctuations in interest rate spreads between
the DMBS and Reference Bill rates and three-month LIBOR causes ineffectiveness to flow through interest expense in the current
period if we are in an overhedged position, and together with the unrecognized ineffectiveness, reduces the effectiveness of the
swaps and caps.

We also rely on the credit of the counterparties
that provide swaps and caps to hedge the interest rate risk on our credit facilities. We use four major banks to provide approximately
98% of our derivative fair value, all of which have investment grade ratings from Moody’s and S&P. In the event that
one of our derivative providers should suffer a significant downgrade of its credit rating or fail, our swaps or caps may become
not effective, in which case the value of the swap or cap would be recorded in earnings, possibly causing a substantial loss sufficient
to cause a breach of one of our debt covenants.

One or more interest rate swap or cap counterparties could default,
causing us significant financial exposure

We enter into interest rate swap and interest
rate cap agreements only with counterparties that are highly rated (A or above by Standard & Poors, or Aa3 or above by Moody’s).
We also try to diversify our risk amongst several counterparties. In the event one or more of these counterparties were to go into
liquidation or to experience a significant rating downgrade, this could cause us to liquidate the interest rate swap or to lose
the interest rate protection of an interest rate cap. Liquidation of an interest rate swap could cause us to be required to pay
the swap counter party the net present value of the swap, which may represent a significant current period cash charge, possibly
sufficient to cause us to breach one or more loan covenants.

Variable interest rates may adversely affect funds from operations

At December 31, 2011, effectively $249 million
of our debt bore interest at a variable rate and was not hedged by interest rate swaps or caps. We may incur additional debt in
the future that also bears interest at variable rates. Variable rate debt creates higher debt service requirements if market interest
rates increase, which would adversely affect our funds from operations and the amount of cash available to pay distributions to
shareholders. Our $964 million secured credit facilities with Prudential Mortgage Capital, credit enhanced by FNMA, are predominately
floating rate facilities. We also have credit facilities with Freddie Mac totaling $200 million that are variable rate facilities.
At December 31, 2011, a total of $1.1 billion was outstanding under these facilities. These facilities represent the majority of
the variable interest rates we were exposed to at December 31, 2011. Large portions of the interest rates on these facilities have
been hedged by means of a number of interest rate swaps and caps. Upon the termination of these swaps and caps, we will be exposed
to the risks of varying interest rates unless acceptable replacement swaps or caps are obtainable.


Issuances of additional debt or equity may adversely impact our
financial condition

Our capital requirements depend on numerous
factors, including the occupancy and turnover rates of our apartment communities, development and capital expenditures, costs of
operations and potential acquisitions. We cannot accurately predict the timing and amount of our capital requirements. If our capital
requirements vary materially from our plans, we may require additional financing sooner than anticipated. Accordingly, we could
become more leveraged, resulting in increased risk of default on our obligations and in an increase in our debt service requirements,
both of which could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to access debt and equity capital markets in the future.
If we issue additional equity securities to obtain additional financing, the interest of our existing shareholders could be diluted.

RISKS RELATED TO OUR ORGANIZATION AND OWNERSHIP OF OUR STOCK

Our ownership limit restricts the transferability of our capital
stock

Our charter limits ownership of our capital
stock by any single shareholder to 9.9% of the value of all outstanding shares of our capital stock, both common and preferred.
The charter also prohibits anyone from buying shares if the purchase would result in our losing REIT status. This could happen
if a share transaction results in fewer than 100 persons owning all of our shares or in five or fewer persons, applying certain
broad attribution rules of the Code, owning 50% or more of our shares. If you acquire shares in excess of the ownership limit or
in violation of the ownership requirements of the Code for REITs, we:

·

will consider the transfer to be null and void;

·

will not reflect the transaction on our books;

·

may institute legal action to enjoin the transaction;

·

will not pay dividends or other distributions with respect to those shares;

·

will not recognize any voting rights for those shares;

·

will consider the shares held in trust for our benefit; and

·

will either direct you to sell the shares and turn over any profit to us, or we will redeem the shares. If we redeem the shares,
you will be paid a price equal to the lesser of the price you paid for the shares; or the average of the last reported sales prices
on the New York Stock Exchange on the ten trading days immediately preceding the date fixed for redemption by our Board of Directors.

If you acquire shares in violation of the limits
on ownership described above:

·

you may lose your power to dispose of the shares;

·

you may not recognize profit from the sale of such shares if the market price of the shares increases; and

·

you may be required to recognize a loss from the sale of such shares if the market price decreases.


Provisions of our charter and Tennessee law may limit the ability
of a third party to acquire control of us

Ownership Limit

The 9.9% ownership limit discussed above may
have the effect of precluding acquisition of control of us by a third party without the consent of our Board of Directors.

Preferred Stock

Our charter authorizes our Board of Directors
to issue up to 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock. The Board of Directors may establish the preferences and rights of any preferred
shares issued. The issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of delaying or preventing someone from taking control of us,
even if a change in control were in our shareholders’ best interests. As of December 31, 2011, no shares of preferred stock
were issued and outstanding.

Tennessee Anti-Takeover Statutes

As a Tennessee corporation, we are subject to
various legislative acts, which impose restrictions on and require compliance with procedures designed to protect shareholders
against unfair or coercive mergers and acquisitions. These statutes may delay or prevent offers to acquire us and increase the
difficulty of consummating any such offers, even if our acquisition would be in our shareholders’ best interests.

Our investments in joint ventures may involve risks

Investments in joint ventures may involve risks
that may not otherwise be present in our direct investments such as:

·

the potential inability of our joint venture partner to perform;

·

the joint venture partner may have economic or business interests or goals which are inconsistent with or adverse to ours;

·

the joint venture partner may take actions contrary to our requests or instructions or contrary to our objectives or policies;
and

·

the joint venturers may not be able to agree on matters relating to the property they jointly own.

Although each joint owner will have a right
of first refusal to purchase the other owner’s interest, in the event a sale is desired, the joint owner may not have sufficient
resources to exercise such right of first refusal.

Market interest rates and low trading volume may have an adverse
effect on the market value of our common shares

The market price of shares of a REIT may be
affected by the distribution rate on those shares, as a percentage of the price of the shares, relative to market interest rates.
If market interest rates increase, prospective purchasers of our shares may expect a higher annual distribution rate. Higher interest
rates would not, however, result in more funds for us to distribute and, in fact, would likely increase our borrowing costs and
potentially decrease funds available for distribution. This could cause the market price of our common shares to go down. In addition,
although our common shares are listed on The New York Stock Exchange, or The NYSE, the daily trading volume of our shares may be
lower than the trading volume for other industries. As a result, our investors who desire to liquidate substantial holdings may
find that they are unable to dispose of their shares in the market without causing a substantial decline in the market value of
the shares.


Changes in market conditions or a failure to meet the market’s
expectations with regard to our earnings and cash distributions could adversely affect the market price of our common shares

We believe that the market value of a REIT’s
equity securities is based primarily upon the market’s perception of the REIT’s growth potential and its current and
potential future cash distributions, and is secondarily based upon the real estate market value of the underlying assets. For that
reason, our shares may trade at prices that are higher or lower than the net asset value per share. To the extent we retain operating
cash flow for investment purposes, working capital reserves or other purposes, these retained funds, while increasing the value
of our underlying assets, may not correspondingly increase the market price of our common shares. In addition, we are subject to
the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to pay distributions to our shareholders. Our failure to meet the market’s
expectations with regard to future earnings and cash distributions would likely adversely affect the market price of our shares.

The stock markets, including The NYSE, on which
we list our common shares, have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. As a result, the market price of our common
shares could be similarly volatile, and investors in our common shares may experience a decrease in the value of their shares,
including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects. Among the market conditions that may affect the market
price of our publicly traded securities are the following:

·

our financial condition and operating performance and the performance of other similar companies;

·

actual or anticipated differences in our quarterly and annual operating results;

·

changes in our revenues or earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts;

·

publication of research reports about us or our industry by securities analysts;

·

additions and departures of key personnel;

·

inability to access the capital markets;

·

strategic decisions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions, dispositions, spin-offs, joint ventures, strategic investments
or changes in business strategy;

·

the issuance of additional shares of our common stock, or the perception that such sales may occur, including under our at-the-market
controlled equity offering programs;

·

the reputation of REITs generally and the reputation of REITs with portfolios similar to ours;

·

the attractiveness of the securities of REITs in comparison to securities issued by other entities (including securities issued
by other real estate companies);

·

an increase in market interest rates, which may lead prospective investors to demand a higher distribution rate in relation
to the price paid for our shares;

·

the passage of legislation or other regulatory developments that adversely affect us or our industry;

·

speculation in the press or investment community;


·

actions by institutional shareholders or hedge funds;

·

changes in accounting principles;

·

terrorist acts; and

·

general market conditions, including factors unrelated to our performance.

In the past, securities class action litigation
has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in their stock price. This type of litigation could
result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources.

RISKS RELATED TO TAX LAWS

Failure to qualify as a REIT would cause us to be taxed as a
corporation

If we failed to qualify as a REIT for federal
income tax purposes, we would be taxed as a corporation. The Internal Revenue Service may challenge our qualification as a REIT
for prior years, and new legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions may change the tax laws with
respect to qualification as a REIT or the federal tax consequences of such qualification. For any taxable year that we fail to
qualify as a REIT, we would be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at corporate rates, plus any applicable alternative
minimum tax. In addition, unless entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions, we would be disqualified from treatment
as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost. This treatment would reduce our net
earnings available for investment or distribution to shareholders because of the additional tax liability for the year or years
involved. In addition, distributions would no longer qualify for the dividends paid deduction nor be required to be made in order
to preserve REIT status. We might be required to borrow funds or to liquidate some of our investments to pay any applicable tax
resulting from our failure to qualify as a REIT.

Failure to make required distributions would subject us to income
taxation

In order to qualify as a REIT, each year we
must distribute to stockholders at least 90% of our taxable income (determined without regard to the dividend paid deduction and
by excluding net capital gains). To the extent that we satisfy the distribution requirement, but distribute less than 100% of taxable
income, we will be subject to federal corporate income tax on the undistributed income. In addition, we would incur a 4% nondeductible
excise tax on the amount, if any, by which our distributions in any year are less than the sum of:

·

85% of ordinary income for that year;

·

95% of capital gain net income for that year; and

·

100% of undistributed taxable income from prior years.

Differences in timing between the recognition
of income and the related cash receipts or the effect of required debt amortization payments could require us to borrow money or
sell assets to pay out enough of the taxable income to satisfy the distribution requirement and to avoid corporate income tax and
the 4% nondeductible excise tax in a particular year.


Complying with REIT requirements may cause us to forgo otherwise
attractive opportunities or engage in marginal investment opportunities

To qualify as a REIT for federal income tax
purposes, we must continually satisfy tests concerning, among other things, the sources of income, the nature and diversification
of assets, the amounts distributed to shareholders and the ownership of our stock. In order to meet these tests, we may be required
to forgo attractive business or investment opportunities or engage in marginal investment opportunities. Thus, compliance with
the REIT requirements may hinder our ability to operate solely on the basis of maximizing profits.

ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS.

None.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES.

We seek to acquire newer apartment communities
and those with opportunities for repositioning through capital additions and management improvement located in the Sunbelt region
of the United States that are primarily appealing to middle income residents with the potential for above average growth and return
on investment. Approximately 75% of our apartment units are located in Georgia, Florida, Tennessee, and Texas markets. Our strategic
focus is to provide our residents high quality apartment units in attractive community settings, characterized by extensive landscaping
and attention to aesthetic detail. We utilize our experience and expertise in maintenance, landscaping, marketing and management
to effectively reposition many of the apartment communities we acquire to raise occupancy levels and per unit average rents.

Monthly average rent per unit represents the average of gross monthly rent amounts charged for occupied units plus prevalent market rates asked for unoccupied units in the property, divided by the total number of units in the property. This information is provided to represent average pricing for the period and does not represent actual rental revenue collected per unit.

(20)

Average Occupancy is calculated by dividing the number of units occupied at each property by the total number of units at each property.

(21)

Effective rent per unit is equal to the average of gross rent amounts after the effect of leasing concessions for occupied units plus prevalent market rates asked for unoccupied units in the property, divided by the total number of units in the property. Leasing concessions represent discounts to the current market rate. These discounts may be offered from time-to-time by a property for various reasons, including to assist with the initial lease-up of a newly developed property or as a response to a property’s local market economics. Concessions are not part of our standard rent offering. Concessions for the year ended December 31, 2011 were $3.6 million. As of December 31, 2011 approximately 11.4%

of total leases were subject to concessions. Effective rent is provided to represent average pricing for the period and does not represent actual rental revenue collected per unit.

Generally, our Board of Directors
declares dividends prior to the quarter in which they are paid. The dividend of $0.66 per share declared in the fourth quarter
of 2011 was paid on January 31, 2012 to shareholders of record on January 13, 2012.

Our quarterly dividend rate is currently $0.66
per common share. Our Board of Directors reviews and declares the dividend rate quarterly. Actual dividends made by us will be
affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the gross revenues received from the apartment communities, our
operating expenses, the interest expense incurred on borrowings and unanticipated capital expenditures.


We expect to make future quarterly distributions
to shareholders; however, future distributions by us will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our
actual funds from operations, our financial condition, capital requirements, the annual distribution requirements under the REIT
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and such other factors as our Board of Directors deems relevant.

We have established the Direct Stock Purchase
and Distribution Reinvestment Plan, or DRSPP, under which holders of common stock, preferred stock and limited partnership interests
in our operating partnership can elect to automatically reinvest their distributions in additional shares of common stock. The
plan also allows for the optional purchase of common stock of at least $250, but not more than $5,000 in any given month, free
of brokerage commissions and charges. In our absolute discretion, we may grant waivers to allow for optional cash payments in excess
of $5,000. To fulfill our obligations under the DRSPP, we may either issue additional shares of common stock or repurchase common
stock in the open market. We may elect to sell shares under the DRSPP at up to a 5% discount.

In 2009, we issued a total of 25,406 shares
through our DRSPP and did not offer a discount for optional cash purchases. In 2010, we issued a total of 568,323 shares through
our DRSPP and offered an average discount of 2.0% for optional cash purchases. In 2011, we issued a total of 509,116 shares through
our DRSPP and offered an average discount of 2.0% for optional cash purchases.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION
AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

The following discussion and analysis of financial
condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto, which have been
prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make a number of estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. On an ongoing basis,
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances. We believe
that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances; however, actual results may differ from these estimates
and assumptions.

We believe that the estimates and assumptions
listed below are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations because they require the
greatest subjective determinations and form the basis of accounting policies deemed to be most critical. These critical accounting
policies include revenue recognition, capitalization of expenditures and depreciation and amortization of assets, impairment of
long-lived assets, including goodwill, acquisition of real estate assets, and fair value of derivative financial instruments.

Revenue recognition

We lease multifamily residential apartments
under operating leases primarily with terms of one year or less. Rental revenues are recognized using a method that represents
a straight-line basis over the term of the lease and other revenues are recorded when earned.

We
record all gains and losses on real estate in accordance with accounting standards governing the sale of real estate.

Capitalization of expenditures and depreciation
and amortization of assets

We carry real estate assets at depreciated cost.
Depreciation and amortization is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which
range from 8 to 40 years for land improvements and buildings, 5 years for furniture, fixtures, and equipment, 3 to 5 years for
computers and software, and 6 months for acquired leases, all of which are subjective determinations. Repairs and maintenance costs
are expensed as incurred while significant improvements, renovations and replacements are capitalized. The cost to complete any
deferred repairs and maintenance at properties acquired by us in order to elevate the condition of the property to our standards
are capitalized as incurred.

Development costs are capitalized in accordance
with accounting standards for costs and initial rental operations of real estate projects and standards for the capitalization
of interest cost, real estate taxes and personnel expense.

Acquisition of Real Estate Assets

We account for our acquisitions of investments
in real estate in accordance with ASC 805-10,

Business Combinations

, which requires the fair value of the real estate acquired
to be allocated to the acquired tangible assets, consisting of land, building and furniture, fixtures and equipment, and identified
intangible assets, consisting of the value of in-place leases.


We allocate the purchase price to the fair value
of the tangible assets of an acquired property (which includes the land, building, and furniture, fixtures, and equipment) determined
by valuing the property as if it were vacant,

based on management’s determination of the relative
fair values of these assets. Management determines the as-if-vacant fair value of a property using methods similar to those used
by independent appraisers. These methods include using stabilized NOI and market specific capitalization and discount rates.

In allocating the fair value of identified intangible
assets of an acquired property, the in-place leases are valued based on current rent rates and time and cost to lease a unit. Management
concluded that the leases acquired on each of its property acquisitions are approximately at market rates since the lease terms
generally do not extend beyond one year.

Impairment of long-lived assets, including
goodwill

We account for long-lived assets in accordance
with the provisions of accounting standards for the impairment or disposal on long-lived assets and evaluate our goodwill for impairment
under accounting standards for goodwill and other intangible assets. We evaluate goodwill for impairment on at least an annual
basis, or more frequently if a goodwill impairment indicator is identified. We periodically evaluate long-lived assets, including
investments in real estate and goodwill, for indicators that would suggest that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable.
The judgments regarding the existence of such indicators are based on factors such as operating performance, market conditions
and legal factors.

Long-lived assets, such as real estate assets,
equipment and purchased intangibles subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured
by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the
asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount
by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Assets to be disposed of are separately presented
on the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and are no longer depreciated.
The assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale are presented separately in the appropriate asset and
liability sections of the balance sheet.

Goodwill is tested annually for impairment,
and is tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. An impairment
loss for goodwill is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill. This determination
is made at the reporting unit level and consists of two steps. First, we determine the fair value of a reporting unit and compare
it to its carrying amount. In the apartment industry, the primary method used for determining fair value is to divide annual operating
cash flows by an appropriate capitalization rate. We determine the appropriate capitalization rate by reviewing the prevailing
rates in a property’s market or submarket. Second, if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an
impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill over the implied fair
value of that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in
a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in accordance with accounting standards for business combinations. The residual
fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill.


Fair value of derivative financial instruments

We utilize certain derivative financial instruments,
primarily interest rate swaps and interest rate caps, during the normal course of business to manage, or hedge, the interest rate
risk associated with our variable rate debt or as hedges in anticipation of future debt transactions to manage well-defined interest
rate risk associated with the transaction.

In order for a derivative contract to be designated
as a hedging instrument, changes in the hedging instrument must be highly effective at offsetting changes in the hedged item. The
historical correlation of the hedging instruments and the underlying hedged items are assessed before entering into the hedging
relationship and on a quarterly basis thereafter, and have been found to be highly effective.

We measure ineffectiveness using the change
in the variable cash flows method for interest rate swaps and the hypothetical derivative method for interest rate caps for each
reporting period through the term of the hedging instruments. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded in earnings
if in an overhedged position. The change in fair value of the interest rate swaps and the intrinsic value or fair value of interest
rate caps designated as cash flow hedges are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income in the statement of shareholders’
equity.

The valuation of our derivative financial instruments
is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of
each derivative.

The fair values of interest rate swaps are determined using the market standard methodology of netting
the discounted future fixed cash payments and the discounted expected variable cash receipts.  The variable cash receipts
are based on an expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rate curves. 
The fair values of interest rate caps are determined using the market standard methodology of discounting the future expected
cash receipts that would occur if variable interest rates rise above the strike rate of the interest rate caps.  The variable
interest rates used in the calculation of projected receipts on the interest rate cap are based on an expectation of future interest
rates derived from observable market interest rate curves and volatilities.

Additionally, we incorporate credit valuation
adjustments to appropriately reflect both our own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty’s nonperformance risk
in the fair value measurements. Changes in the fair values of our derivatives are primarily the result of fluctuations in interest
rates. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Notes 5 and
6 for further discussion.

OVERVIEW OF THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011

We experienced
an increase in income from continuing operations in 2011 as increases in revenues outpaced increases in expenses. The increases
in revenues came from a 4.2% increase in our large market same store segment, a 4.6% increase in our secondary market same store
segment and a 150.6% increase in our non-same store and other segment which was primarily a result of acquisitions. The increase
in expense came from a 4.0% increase in our large market same store segment, a 3.3% increase in our secondary market same store
segment and a 119.4% increase in our non-same store and other segment which was primarily a result of acquisitions as well as an
approximately $5.8 million increase in general and administrative costs, the majority of which was related to a $1.8 million out
of period adjustment related to our restricted stock plans and a $1.4 million increase in employee medical insurance. Our same
store portfolio represents those communities that

have been held and have been stabilized for at least 12 months. Communities
excluded from the same store portfolio would include recent acquisitions, communities being developed or in lease-up, communities
undergoing extensive renovations, and communities identified as discontinued operations.


We have grown externally during the past three
years by following our acquisition strategy to invest in large and mid-sized growing markets in the Sunbelt region of the United
States. We acquired four properties for our 100% owned portfolio in 2009, eight in 2010 and eleven in 2011. We also purchased two
properties through one of our joint ventures in 2009, two in 2010 and one in 2011. Offsetting some of this increased revenue stream
were three property dispositions in 2009 and two dispositions in 2011.

We continued to benefit from reduced interest
rates in 2011; however because a reduction in average interest rates did not offset the impact from an increase in the average
amount of debt outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2011 from the year ended December 31, 2010, interest expense increased
by $2.7 million.

As of December 31, 2011, the total number of
apartment units that we owned or had an ownership interest in was 49,133 apartment units in 167 communities as compared to 46,310
in 157 communities at December 31, 2010, and 43,604 apartment units in 147 communities at December 31, 2009. For communities owned
100% by us, the average effective rent per apartment unit, excluding units in lease-up, increased to $793.46 at December 31, 2011
from $736.51 at December 31, 2010 and $715 at December 31, 2009. For these same units, overall occupancy at December 31, 2011,
2010, and 2009 was 95.1%, 95.8%, 95.2%, respectively.

Average
effective rent per unit is equal to the average of gross rent amounts after the effect of leasing concessions for occupied units
plus prevalent market rates asked for unoccupied units, divided by the total number of units. Leasing concessions represent discounts
to the current market rate. We believe average effective rent

is a helpful measurement in evaluating

average pricing. It does not represent actual rental revenue collected per unit.

The following is a discussion of our consolidated
financial condition and results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009. This discussion should be
read in conjunction with all of the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2011, to the Year Ended
December 31, 2010

Property revenues for the year ended
December 31, 2011 were approximately $448.0 million, an increase of $50.7 million from the year ended December 31, 2010 due to
(i) a $8.2 million increase in property revenues from our large market same store group primarily as a result of increased average
rent per unit (ii) a $8.2 million increase in property revenues from our secondary market same store group primarily as a result
of increased average rent per unit and (iii) a $34.3 million increase in property revenues from our non-same store and other group,
mainly as a result of acquisitions. See further discussion on revenue growth in the Trends section below.


Property operating expenses include costs
for property personnel, property personnel bonuses, building repairs and maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance, utilities,
landscaping and depreciation and amortization. Property operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, for the year
ended December 31, 2011 were approximately $191.5 million, an increase of approximately $19.1 million from the year ended December
31, 2010 due primarily to increases in property operating expenses of (i) $3.3 million from our large market same store group,
(ii) $2.6 million from our secondary market same store group, and (iii) $13.2 million from our non-same store and other group,
mainly as a result of acquisitions. The increases in the large and secondary market same store groups are primarily due to an additional
$1.9 million in bulk cable expense and $0.9 million increase in expense due to our Level one call center program. Other increases
are the result of normal operating costs.

Depreciation
and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2011 was approximately $115.6 million, an increase of approximately $12.5
million from the year ended December 31, 2010 primarily due to the increases in depreciation and amortization expense of (i) $0.9
million from our large market same store group, (ii) $1.0 million from our secondary market same store group, and (iii) $10.6 million
from our non-same store and other group, mainly as a result of acquisitions.

Increases in depreciation and amortization
expense from our

large and secondary market same store groups

resulted from asset additions made
during the normal course of business.

General and Administrative expense for
the year ended December 31, 2011 was approximately $18.1 million, an increase of $5.8 million from the year ended December 31,
2010. The majority of the increase was related to a one-time charge of $1.8 million for an out of period adjustment to our restricted
stock plans and a $1.4 million increase in employee medical insurance. For more discussion on the out of period adjustment, see
Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1.

Interest expense for the year ended December
31, 2011 was approximately $58.6 million, an increase of $2.7 million from the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase was primarily
the result of an increase in our average debt outstanding from December 31, 2010 to the year ended December 31, 2011 of approximately
$127.6 million.

During the year ended December 31, 2010,
we recorded an asset impairment charge of approximately $1.9 million related to one of our original initial public offering communities.
This community was part of our secondary market same store segment.  Fair value of the community was determined by an offer. 
No asset impairment charges were recorded during the year ended December 31, 2011.

During the year ended December 31, 2011,
we recorded a gain on sale of discontinued operations of $12.8 million. There was no material gain (loss) on sale of discontinued
operation during the year ended December 31, 2010.

Primarily as a result of the foregoing and other
various increases in expenses, net income attributable to Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. increased by approximately $19.1
million in the year ended December 31, 2011 from the year ended December 31, 2010.

Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2010, to the Year Ended
December 31, 2009

Property revenues for the year ended
December 31, 2010, increased by approximately $23.3 million from the year ended December 31, 2009, due to (i) a $6.0 million increase
in property revenues from our large market same store group and (ii) a $8.1 million increase in property revenues from our secondary
market same store group and (iii) a $9.2 million increase in property revenues from our non-same store and other group, mainly
as a result of acquisitions. The increase in our same store portfolio is largely attributable to the bulk cable program.


Property operating expenses include costs
for property personnel, building repairs and maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance, utilities, landscaping and other property
related costs. Property operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased by approximately $14.8 million from
the year ended December 31, 2009, due primarily to increases of property operating expenses of (i) $4.7 million from our large
market same store group, (ii) a $5.8 million from our secondary market same store group, and (ii) $4.3 million from our non-same
store and other group, mainly as a result of acquisitions. The increase in our large and secondary same store groups is largely
attributable to accounting for the bulk cable program.

Depreciation
and amortization expense increased by approximately $8.0 million primarily due to the increases of depreciation and amortization
expense of (i) $1.1 million from our large market same store group, (ii) $2.5 million from our secondary market same store group,
and (iii) $4.4 million from our non-same store and other group, mainly as a result of acquisitions.

Increases of depreciation
and amortization expense from our

large and secondary market same store groups

resulted from
asset additions made during the normal course of business.

Interest expense decreased approximately
$1.1 million in 2010 from 2009 due primarily to the decrease in our average annual borrowing cost from 4.31% in 2009 to 3.95% in
2010. This decrease was somewhat offset by an increase in our average debt outstanding by approximately $88.2 million from 2009
to 2010 to fund acquisitions and our development and redevelopment programs.

During the year ended December 31, 2010,
we recorded an asset impairment charge of approximately $1.9 million related to one of our original initial public offering communities.
This community was part of our secondary market same store segment.  Fair value of the community was determined by an offer. 
No asset impairment charges were recorded during the year ended December 31, 2009.

For the year ended December 31, 2009, we recorded
total gains of approximately $4.6 million from the sale of three communities. We had no property dispositions in 2010. Income from
discontinued operations decreased $1.3 million from approximately $2.2 million during the year 2009 to $0.9 million in 2010.

Primarily as a result of
the foregoing, net income attributable to Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. decreased by approximately $7.5 million in 2010
from 2009.

Funds from Operations

Funds from operations, or FFO, represents net
income (computed in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP) excluding extraordinary items, net
income attributable to noncontrolling interest, asset impairment, gains or losses on disposition of real estate assets, plus depreciation
and amortization of real estate, and adjustments for joint ventures to reflect FFO on the same basis. This definition of FFO is
in accordance with the NAREIT definition. Disposition of real estate assets includes sales of discontinued operations as well as
proceeds received from insurance and other settlements from property damage.

In response to the Securities and Exchange Commission’s
Staff Policy Statement relating to EITF Topic D-42 concerning the calculation of earnings per share for the redemption of preferred
stock, we have included the amount charged to retire preferred stock in excess of carrying values in our FFO calculation.


Our policy is to expense the cost of interior
painting, vinyl flooring, and blinds as incurred for stabilized properties. During the stabilization period for acquisition properties,
these items are capitalized as part of the total repositioning program of newly acquired properties, and, thus are not deducted
in calculating FFO.

FFO should not be considered as an alternative
to net income or any other GAAP measurement of performance, as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash
flow from operating, investing, and financing activities as a measure of liquidity. We believe that FFO is helpful to investors
in understanding our operating performance in that such calculation excludes depreciation and amortization expense on real estate
assets. We believe that GAAP historical cost depreciation of real estate assets is generally not correlated with changes in the
value of those assets, whose value does not diminish predictably over time, as historical cost depreciation implies. Our calculation
of FFO may differ from the methodology for calculating FFO utilized by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such
other REITs.


The following table is a reconciliation of FFO
to consolidated net income for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 (dollars in thousands):

In accordance with NAREIT's current guidance, FFO has been updated to exclude asset impairment write downs.

FFO for the
year ended December 31, 2011 increased approximately $31.6 million from the year ended December 31, 2010 primarily as a result
of the increase in property revenues of approximately $50.7 million discussed above that was only partially offset by the $19.1
million increase in property operating expenses. FFO for the year ended December 31, 2010 was impacted by a distribution in preferred
dividends of $6.5 million and by the

recognition of approximately $5.1 million on the consolidated statements
of operations representing the write-off of premiums and original issuance costs for the Series H preferred stock redemption. There
were no such charges for 2011.

FFO for the
year ended December 31, 2010 increased approximately $7.2 million from the year ended December 31, 2009 primarily as a result of
the increase in property revenues of approximately $23.3 million discussed above that was only partially offset by the $14.8 million
increase in property operating expenses.

Trends

During 2011, rental demand for apartments continued
to improve relative to 2010.  This was evident through physical occupancy that was consistent with 2010 combined with steady
price increases on both new leases and renewals signed throughout the year.  We have maintained this momentum with job formation,
one of the primary drivers of apartment demand, continuing to be slow to return.  The stagnant job market across the nation
and in our markets continues to cause us to be cautious about apartment demand and pricing but optimistic about the long term prospects
for apartment demand as job growth returns.


An important part of our portfolio strategy is to maintain a broad diversity of markets across the Sunbelt region of the United
States. The diversity of markets tends to mitigate exposure to economic issues in any one geographic market or area. We have found
that a well diversified portfolio, including both large and select secondary markets, has tended to perform well in “up”
cycles as well as weather “down” cycles better. As of December 31, 2011, with the addition of assets in Richmond, Virginia
and Fredericksburg, Virginia, we were invested in over 50 separate markets, with 59% of our gross assets in large markets and 41%
of our gross assets in select secondary markets.

We also continue to benefit on the supply side.  New supply entering the market was low in 2011 and continues to run well
below historical new supply delivery averages. Competition from condominiums reverting back to rental units, or new condominiums
being converted to rental, was not a major factor in our portfolio because most of our submarkets have not been primary areas for
condominium development. We have found the same to be true for rental competition from single family homes. We have avoided committing
a significant amount of capital to markets where most of the excessive inflation in house prices has occurred. We saw significant
rental competition from condominiums or single family houses in only a few of our submarkets.  We expect this relative new
supply compression to continue to be a positive factor to our business as the new supply remains limited.

Our focus throughout 2011 was on pushing pricing where possible through our revenue management system, while maintaining strong
physical occupancy. Effective rent per unit for the year was higher than 2010 by 3.8%, with each individual quarter’s growth
higher than the previous quarter.  This pricing trend is expected to continue in 2012.  As pricing continued to move
forward throughout the year, our average same store physical occupancy (large market same store and secondary market same store
segments combined) in 2011 remained strong at 96%.

Overall same store revenues increased 4.4% for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010.
This included an increase of $3.1 million due to our new bulk cable program. With cable expense netted into cable revenues, same
store revenues increased 4.0% over this period. As expected, more robust revenue growth resumed in 2011 as compared to 2010 as
rents continued the upward trend that began in the latter part of 2010.  Although some increase in development is expected,
we believe the continued reduced availability of financing for new apartment construction will likely limit new apartment construction
to levels well below pre-recession deliveries.  Also, more sustainable credit terms for residential mortgages should work
to favor rental demand at existing multi-family properties. Long term, we expect demographic trends (including the growth of prime
age groups for rentals and immigration and population movement to the southeast and southwest) will continue to build apartment
rental demand for our markets.

Should the economy fall into a recession, the limited new supply of apartments and the more disciplined mortgage financing for
single family home buying should lessen the impact to some degree, but a weak economy and employment market would nevertheless
limit rent growth prospects.


We continue to develop improved products, operating systems and procedures that enable us to capture more revenues.  The continued
roll-out of ancillary services (such as our cable saver and deposit saver programs), improved collections and utility reimbursements
enable us to capture increased revenue dollars. We also actively work on improving processes and products to reduce expenses, such
as new web-sites and internet access for our residents that enable them to transact their business with us more simply and effectively.

Throughout 2011, we continued to have the benefit of lower interest rates resulting from a continued strong market for FNMA and
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation debt securities.  Short term interest rates continue to be at historically low levels,
and as a result, we are forecasting a continuation of favorable interest rates in the near term with the expectation of rising
rates as the economy improves.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Net cash flow provided by operating activities
increased to $172.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $133.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. This
change was a result of various items, including changes in cash flows associated with the timing of accrual payments and higher
revenue as discussed above.

Net cash used in investing activities was approximately
$ 442.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $254.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2010, mainly
related to acquisition activity and development costs. In the year ended December 31, 2011, we had acquisition cash outflows of
$362.7 million compared to $278.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. During 2011, we had cash outflows of $38.2 million
for development activities, compared to $16.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. During 2011, we also had cash outflows
of $52.1 million for improvements to existing real estate assets compared to $31.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.
The increase in cash outflows also included a decrease in cash inflows from disposition activity. During the year ended December
31, 2011, we had cash inflows of approximately $23.7 million, related to the sale of two properties from our same store portfolio.
In the year ended December 31, 2010, we had cash inflows of $90.3 million, mainly related to the contributions of three communities
to Fund II.

Net cash provided by financing activities was
approximately $281.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to $152.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.
In the year ended December 31, 2011, we had cash inflows of $285.4 million from proceeds of notes payable compared to $137.9 million
for the year ended December 31, 2010. In the year ended December 31, 2011, we received proceeds of approximately $235.7 million
primarily from the issuance of common stock through our at-the-market program, or ATM and a waiver through our Dividend and Distribution
Reinvestment and Share Purchase Plan, or DRSPP. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we received proceeds of approximately
$305.5 million primarily through these same programs. We used $155.0 million of these proceeds to fund the redemption of our 8.30%
Series H Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, or Series H during 2010.

During 2011, we sold 3,303,273 shares of common
stock for net proceeds of approximately $204.5 million through our ATM. This compares to 5,077,201 shares of common stock for net
proceeds of approximately $274.6 million for 2010.

During 2011, we issued 495,645 shares
at an average discount of 2% for net proceeds of $30.0 million through the direct stock purchase feature of our DRSPP. During 2010,
we issued 551,895 shares at an average discount of 2% for net proceeds of $30.0 million through the direct stock purchase feature
of our DRSPP. During 2009, we did not offer a discount through our DRSPP and issued approximately 1,100 shares of common stock,
generating approximately $39,000 in proceeds.


On June 2, 2010, we redeemed 3,100,001 shares
of the 6,200,000 shares of our Series H preferred stock for approximately $77.5 million. On August 5, 2010 we redeemed all of the
remaining and outstanding shares of Series H for approximately $77.5 million, resulting in a combined write-off for the year ended
December 31, 2010 of approximately $5.1 million on the consolidated statements of operations related to premiums and original issuance
costs. There was no redemption of preferred stock during 2011.

The weighted average interest rate at December
31, 2011 for the $1.6 billion of debt outstanding was 3.7%, compared to the weighted average interest rate of 3.8% on $1.5 billion
of debt outstanding at December 31, 2010. We utilize both conventional and tax exempt debt to help finance our activities. Borrowings
are made through individual property mortgages as well as company-wide secured and unsecured credit facilities. We utilize fixed
rate borrowings, interest rate swaps and interest rate caps to manage our current and future interest rate risk. More details on
our borrowings can be found in the schedules presented later in this section.

At December 31, 2011, we had secured credit
facility relationships with Prudential Mortgage Capital which are credit enhanced by the FNMA, Financial Federal which are credit
enhanced by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, or Freddie Mac, and a $250 million bank unsecured facility with a syndicate
of banks. Together, these credit facilities provided a total line capacity of $1.4 billion with all but $2.9 million collateralized
and available to borrow at December 31, 2011. We had total borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities of $1.1 billion
at December 31, 2011.

Approximately 57%
of our outstanding obligations at December 31, 2011 were borrowed through credit facilities with/or credit enhanced by FNMA, also
referred to as the FNMA Facilities. The FNMA Facilities have a combined line limit of $964 million, all of which was collateralized
and available to borrow at December 31, 2011. We had total borrowings outstanding under the FNMA Facilities of approximately $948
million at December 31, 2011. Various FNMA rate traunches of the FNMA Facilities mature from 2012 through 2018. The FNMA Facilities
provide for both fixed and variable rate borrowings. The interest rate on the majority of the variable portion is based on the
FNMA Discount Mortgage Backed Security, or DMBS, rate which are credit-enhanced by FNMA and are typically sold every 90 days by
Prudential Mortgage Capital at interest rates approximating three-month LIBOR less a spread that has averaged 0.16% over the life
of the FNMA Facilities, plus a credit enhancement

fee of 0.49% to 0.67%. We have seen more volatility in the spread between
the DMBS and three-month LIBOR since late 2007 than was historically prevalent.

Approximately 12% of our outstanding obligations
at December 31, 2011 were borrowed through a credit facility with/or credit enhanced by Freddie Mac, also referred to as the Freddie
Mac Facility. The Freddie Mac Facility has a combined line limit of $200 million, of which $198 million was collateralized and
available to borrow at December 31, 2011.

We had total borrowings outstanding under the Freddie Mac
Facility of approximately $198 million at December 31, 2011.

The Freddie Mac facility matures in 2014. The interest rate
on the Freddie Mac Facility renews every 30 or 90 days and is based on the Freddie Mac Reference Bill Rate on the date of renewal,
which has historically

approximated the equivalent 30 or 90-day LIBOR, plus a credit enhancement fee
of 0.65%. The Freddie Mac Reference Bill rate has traded consistently below LIBOR, and the historical average spread was 0.32%
below LIBOR at December 31, 2011.


We also maintain a $250 million unsecured credit
facility with nine banks led by Key Bank.

The Key Bank Credit Line bears an interest rate of LIBOR
plus a spread of 1.65% to 2.40% based on a leveraged based pricing grid. This credit line expires in November 2015 with a one year
extension option. At December 31, 2011, we had $249 million available to be borrowed under the Key Bank Credit Line agreement with
$0 million borrowed under this facility.

Approximately $1 million of the facility is used to support
letters of credit.

Each of our credit facilities is subject to
various covenants and conditions on usage, and the secured facilities are subject to periodic re-evaluation of collateral. If we
were to fail to satisfy a condition to borrowing, the available credit under one or more of the facilities could not be drawn,
which could adversely affect our liquidity. In the event of a reduction in real estate values the amount of available credit could
be reduced. Moreover, if we were to fail to make a payment or violate a covenant under a credit facility, after applicable cure
periods, one or more of our lenders could declare a default, accelerate the due date for repayment of all amounts outstanding and/or
foreclose on properties securing such facilities. A default on an obligation to repay outstanding debt could also create a cross
default on a separate piece of debt, whereby one or more of our lenders could accelerate the due date for repayment of all amounts
outstanding and/or foreclose on properties securing the related facilities. Any such event could have a material adverse effect.

On July 29, 2011, we issued $135 million of
Senior Unsecured Notes. The notes were offered in a private placement with three maturity traunches: $50.00 million 7-year maturity
at 4.7%, $72.75 million 10-year maturity at 5.4%, and $12.25 million 12-year maturity at 5.6%. At December 31, 2011, $135 million
was outstanding with an average remaining maturity of 8.7 years and an average interest rate of 5.1%.

We believe that we have adequate resources to
fund our current operations, annual refurbishment of our properties, and incremental investment in new apartment properties. We
rely on the efficient operation of the financial markets to finance debt maturities, and on FNMA and Freddie Mac, or the Agencies.
The Agencies provided credit enhancement for approximately $1.1 billion of our outstanding debt through credit facilities as of
December 31, 2011.

The interest rate markets for FNMA DMBS and
Freddie Mac Reference Bills, which in our experience are highly liquid and highly correlated with three-month LIBOR interest rates,
are also an important component of our liquidity and interest rate swap effectiveness. Prudential Mortgage Capital, a DUS lender
for Fannie Mae, markets 90-day Fannie Mae Discount Mortgage Backed Securities monthly, and is obligated to advance funds to us
at DMBS rates plus a credit spread under the terms of the credit agreements between Prudential and us. Financial Federal, a Freddie
Mac Program Plus Lender and Servicer, is obligated to advance funds under the terms of credit agreements between Financial Federal
and us.


For the year ended December 31, 2011, our net
cash provided by operating activities was in excess of covering funding improvements to existing real estate assets, distributions
to unitholders, and dividends paid on common and preferred shares by approximately $22.9 million, as compared to $12.2 million
and $12.3 million for the same periods in 2010 and 2009, respectively. While we had sufficient liquidity to permit distributions
at current rates through additional borrowings, if necessary, any significant deterioration in operations could result in our financial
resources being insufficient to pay distributions to shareholders at the current rate, in which event we would be required to reduce
the distribution rate.

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements

At December 31, 2011, and 2010, we
did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships established for the purpose of facilitating
off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Mid-America Multifamily Fund I, LLC, was established
to acquire $500 million of apartment communities with redevelopment upside offering value creation opportunity through capital
improvements, operating enhancements and restructuring in-place financing. As of December 31, 2011, Mid-America Multifamily Fund
I, LLC owned two properties but does not expect to acquire any additional communities. Mid-America Multifamily Fund II, LLC, was
established to acquire $250 million of apartment communities with redevelopment upside offering value creation opportunity through
capital improvements, operating enhancements and restructuring in-place financing. As of December 31, 2011, Mid-America Multifamily
Fund II, LLC owned five properties. In addition, we do not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts.
As such, we are not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market, or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in
such relationships. We do not have any relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non-independent
relationships with us or our related parties other than those disclosed in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
- Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 12.

Our investments in our real estate joint ventures
are unconsolidated and are recorded using the equity method as we do not have a controlling interest.


Insurance

We renegotiated our insurance programs effective
July 1, 2011. We believe that the property and casualty insurance program in place provides appropriate insurance coverage for
financial protection against insurable risks such that any insurable loss experienced that can be reasonably anticipated would
not have a significant impact on our liquidity, financial position or results of operation.

Inflation

Substantially all of the resident leases at
the apartment communities allow, at the time of renewal, for adjustments in the rent payable there under, and thus may enable us
to seek rent increases. Almost all leases are for one year or less. The short-term nature of these leases generally serves to reduce
our risk to adverse effects of inflation.

Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In June 2011, the FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update (ASU) No. 2011-05,

Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income.

This ASU allows
an entity the option to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive
income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. In both choices,
an entity is required to present each component of net income along with total net income, each component of other comprehensive
income along with a total for other comprehensive income, and a total amount for comprehensive income. ASU 2011-05 eliminates the
option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of equity. The amendments do not change
the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified
to net income. ASU 2011-05 will be applied retrospectively.

The amendments are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods
within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011, but allows for early adoption.

We adopted ASU
2011-05 for the Annual Report for fiscal year 2011, and this changed the presentation of our financial statements but not our consolidated
financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole.

In November 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU)
No. 2011-12,

Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications
of Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-05

. This ASU supersedes certain
paragraphs in ASU 2011-05 addressing reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income. The effective
dates and expected changes to our presentation are the same as noted in ASU 2011-05 above.

In May 2011, the FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update (ASU) No. 2011-04,

Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement
and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRS.

The amendments change the wording, mainly for clarification, used
to describe many of the requirements in U.S. GAAP for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements.
For many of the requirements, the Board does not intend for the amendments in this update to result in a change in the application
of the requirements in Topic 820.

The amendments in this ASU are to be applied prospectively. The amendments
are effective during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. We will adopt ASU 2011-04 in the interim and
annual periods of fiscal year 2012.

The adoption of ASU 2011-04 will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial
condition or results of operations taken as a whole.


ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Our primary market risk exposure is to changes
in interest rates obtainable on our borrowings. At December 31, 2011, 39% of our total capitalization consisted of borrowings.
Our interest rate risk objective is to limit the impact of interest rate fluctuations on earnings and cash flows and to lower our
overall borrowing costs. To achieve this objective, we manage our exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates for borrowings
through the use of fixed rate debt instruments and interest rate swaps and caps which mitigate our interest rate risk on a related
financial instrument and effectively fix the interest rate on a portion of our variable debt or on future refinancings. We use
our best efforts to ladder fixed rate maturities thereby limiting our exposure to interest rate changes in any one year. We do
not enter into derivative instruments for trading or other speculative purposes. Approximately 84% of our outstanding debt was
subject to fixed or capped rates after considering related derivative instruments at December 31, 2011. We regularly review interest
rate exposure on outstanding borrowings in an effort to minimize the risk of interest rate fluctuations.

The table below provides information about our
financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For debt obligations, the table presents principal cash
flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates. For our interest rate swaps and caps, the table presents
the notional amount of the swaps and caps and the years in which they expire. Weighted average variable rates are based on rates
in effect at the reporting date (dollars in 000's).

MANAGEMENT’S
REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Management of MAA is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(f) promulgated under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

Internal control over financial reporting is
a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of MAA’s
consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Internal control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of MAA; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded
as necessary to permit the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of MAA are being made only in accordance with appropriate authorizations of management
and directors of MAA; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,
use or disposition of MAA’s assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.

Due to its inherent limitations, internal control
over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management conducted an assessment of MAA’s
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011 using the framework specified in

Internal Control - Integrated
Framework

, published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on such assessment, management
has concluded that MAA’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2011.

The effectiveness of MAA’s internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered
public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is presented herein.

Report of Independent Registered Public
Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Shareholders
of

Mid-America Apartment Communities,
Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011. Our audits also
included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a). These consolidated financial statements and schedule
are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on
a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. at December 31,
2011 and 2010, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2011, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial
statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material
respects the information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.’s internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 24, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion
thereon.

Report of Independent Registered Public
Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Shareholders
of

Mid-America Apartment Communities,
Inc.

We have audited Mid-America Apartment
Communities, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal
Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria).
Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records
that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject
to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. maintained,
in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.
as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, equity, and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011, of Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. and our report
dated February 24, 2012, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and

ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Organization and Formation of Mid-America
Apartment Communities, Inc.

Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc., or MAA, is a self-administrated
and self-managed real estate investment trust which owns, acquires and operates multifamily apartment communities mainly in the
Sunbelt region of the United States. We owned and operated 160 apartment communities principally through our majority owned subsidiary,
Mid-America Apartments, L.P., or the Operating Partnership, as of December 31, 2011. MAA also owned a 33.33% interest in two real
estate joint ventures, Mid-America Multifamily Fund I, LLC, or Fund I, and Mid-America Multifamily Fund II, LLC, or Fund II, at
December 31, 2011. Through these joint ventures MAA owned interest in an additional 7 communities as of December 31, 2011.

Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements presented herein include the
accounts of MAA, the Operating Partnership, and all other subsidiaries. MAA owns approximately 95% to 100% of all consolidated
subsidiaries.

MAA uses the equity method of accounting
for its investments in entities for which we exercise significant influence, but do not have the ability to exercise control. These

entities are not variable interest entities. The factors considered in determining that MAA does not have the ability to
exercise control included ownership of voting interests and participatory rights of investors.

All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation.

Use of Estimates

Management of MAA has made a number of estimates and assumptions
relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses to prepare these financial statements and notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Revenue Recognition

MAA leases multifamily residential apartments under operating leases
primarily with terms of one year or less. Rental revenues are recognized using a method that represents a straight-line basis over
the term of the lease and other revenues are recorded when earned.

MAA records gains and losses on real
estate sales in accordance with accounting standards governing the sale of real estate. For properties contributed to joint ventures,
MAA records gains on the partial sale related to the outside partners’ interest in the venture

.

F-


Rental Costs

Costs associated with rental activities, including advertising costs,
are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses were approximately $8.7 million, $7.2 million, and $7.0 million for the years ended
December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Certain costs associated with the lease-up of development projects, including
cost of model units, their furnishings, signs, and “grand openings” are capitalized and amortized over their respective
estimated useful lives. All other costs relating to renting development projects are expensed as incurred.

Earnings Per Share

In accordance with the provisions of accounting standards for earnings
per share, basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average
number of shares outstanding during the period. All outstanding unvested restricted share awards, which contain rights to non-forfeitable
dividends, participate in undistributed earnings with common shareholders and, accordingly, are considered participating securities
that are included in the two-class method of computing basic earnings per share. Both the unvested restricted shares and other
potentially dilutive common shares, and the related impact to earnings, are considered when calculating earnings per share on a
diluted basis

with our diluted earnings per share being the more dilutive of the treasury stock or two
class methods.  Operating partnership units are included in dilutive earnings per share calculations when they are dilutive
to earnings per share. For periods where we report a net loss available for common shareholders, the effect of dilutive shares
is excluded from earnings per share calculations because including such shares would be anti-dilutive.

and diluted earnings per share computations for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 is presented below:

F-


Cash and Cash Equivalents

MAA considers cash, investments in money market accounts, and certificates
of deposit with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

Restricted Cash

Restricted cash consists of escrow deposits held by lenders for
property taxes, insurance, debt service and replacement reserves.

Real Estate Assets and Depreciation and Amortization

Real estate assets are carried at depreciated cost. Repairs and
maintenance costs are expensed as incurred while significant improvements, renovations, and recurring capital replacements are
capitalized. Recurring capital replacements typically include scheduled carpet replacement, new roofs, HVAC units, plumbing, concrete,
masonry and other paving, pools and various exterior building improvements. In addition to these costs, we also capitalize salary
costs directly identifiable with renovation work. These expenditures extend the useful life of the property and increase the property’s
fair market value. The cost of interior painting, vinyl flooring and blinds are expensed as incurred.

In conjunction with acquisitions of properties, MAA’s policy
is to provide in its acquisition budgets adequate funds to complete any deferred capital improvement items to bring the properties
to the required standard, including the cost of replacement appliances, carpet, interior painting, vinyl flooring and blinds. These
costs are capitalized.

Development projects and the related carrying costs, including interest,
property taxes, insurance and allocated direct development salary cost during the construction period, are capitalized and reported
in the accompanying balance sheets as “construction in progress” during the construction period. Interest is capitalized
in accordance with accounting standards governing the capitalization of interest. Upon completion and certification for occupancy
of individual units within a development, amounts representing the completed unit's portion of total estimated development costs
for the project are transferred to land, buildings, and furniture, fixtures and equipment as real estate held for investment

.
Capitalization of interest, property taxes, insurance and allocated direct development salary costs cease upon the transfer. The
assets are depreciated over their estimated useful lives. Total interest capitalized during 2011, 2010 and 2009 was approximately
$1,156,000, $66,000, and $252,000, respectively.

Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated
useful lives of the related assets which range from 8 to 40 years for land improvements and buildings and 5 years for furniture,
fixtures and equipment and 3 to 5 years for computers and software.

Acquisition of Real Estate Assets

In accordance with accounting standards for business combinations,
the fair value of the real estate acquired is allocated to the acquired tangible assets, consisting of land, building, furniture,
fixtures and equipment, and identified intangible assets, consisting of the value of in-place leases.

MAA allocates the purchase price to the fair value of the tangible
assets of an acquired property (which includes the land, building, and furniture, fixtures, and equipment) determined by valuing
the property as if it were vacant,

based on management’s determination of the relative fair values
of these assets. Management determines the as-if-vacant fair value of a property using methods similar to those used by independent
appraisers. These methods include using stabilized net operating income, or NOI, and market specific capitalization and discount
rates.

F-


In allocating the fair value of identified intangible assets of
an acquired property, the in-place leases are valued based on current rent rates and time and cost to lease a unit. Management
concluded that the leases acquired on each of its property acquisitions are approximately at market rates since the lease terms
generally do not extend beyond one year.

The
fair value of the in-place leases and resident relationships is then amortized over six months, the estimated remaining term of
the resident leases. The amount of these resident lease intangibles included in Other assets totaled $1.8 million, $1.8 million,
and $1.7 million as of December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. The amortization recorded as depreciation and amortization
expense was $3.5 million, $3.0 million, and $1.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively, with
accumulated amortization totaling $0.7 million, $1.0 million, and $0.3 million as of December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Impairment
of Long-lived Assets, including Goodwill

MAA accounts for long-lived assets in accordance with the provisions
of accounting standards for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets and evaluates goodwill for impairment under accounting
standards for goodwill and other intangible assets. MAA makes these evaluations for impairment on at least an annual basis, or
more frequently if an impairment indicator is identified. MAA periodically evaluates its long-lived assets, including its investments
in real estate and goodwill, for indicators that would suggest that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. The
judgments regarding the existence of such indicators are based on factors such as operating performance, market conditions, and
legal factors.

Long-lived assets, such as real estate assets, and equipment, and
purchased intangibles subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison
of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying
amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying
amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Assets to be disposed of are separately presented in the balance sheet
and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and are no longer depreciated. The assets and
liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale are presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections
of the balance sheet.

During the year ended December 31, 2010, we
received an offer to purchase our 276-unit Cedar Mill apartment community. As a result of the offer received and management’s
reconsideration of its long-term intentions related to this property, MAA determined that an impairment indicator existed. As the
estimated undiscounted future cash flows were no longer sufficient to recover the asset carrying amount, we recorded an impairment
charge of $1,914,000 during the year ended December 31, 2010 to adjust the asset carrying

value to estimated
fair value. The operations of the Cedar Mill community are included in our secondary market same store operating segment.

Goodwill is tested annually for impairment, and is tested for impairment
more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. An impairment loss is recognized to the
extent that the carrying amount exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill. This determination is made at the reporting unit
level and consists of two steps. First, MAA determines the fair value of a reporting unit and compares it to its carrying amount.
In the apartment industry, the primary method used for determining fair value is to divide annual operating cash flows by an appropriate
capitalization rate. MAA determines the appropriate capitalization rate by reviewing the prevailing rates in a property’s
market or submarket. Second, if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized
for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill. The
implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase
price allocation, in accordance with accounting standards for business combinations. The residual fair value after this allocation
is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill. There has been no impairment of goodwill in the three year period ended
December 31, 2011.

F-


Land Held for Future Development

Real estate held for future development are sites intended for future
multifamily developments and are carried at the lower of cost or fair value in accordance with GAAP.

Investment in Real Estate Joint Ventures

MAA’s investments in our unconsolidated real estate
joint ventures are recorded using the equity method as we are able to exert significant influence, but do not have a controlling
interest in the joint venture.

Deferred Financing Costs

Deferred financing costs are amortized over the terms of the related
debt using a method which approximates the interest method.

Other Assets

Other assets consist of deferred rental concessions which are recognized
on a straight line basis over the life of the leases, receivables and deposits from residents, value of derivative contracts and
other prepaid expenses including prepaid insurance and prepaid interest.

Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities

Accrued expenses consist of accrued dividend payable, accrued real
estate taxes, accrued interest payable, other accrued expenses payable, and unearned income. Significant accruals included accrued
dividend payable of $27.0 million and $23.4 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively and accrued real estate taxes of
$25.4 million and $19.9 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Out of Period Adjustment

In the twelve months ended December 31, 2011, we recorded a $1.8
million non-cash adjustment to general and administrative expenses related to restricted stock grants issued to certain employees.
This adjustment was made during the second quarter of 2011. This error correction represents a cumulative adjustment
for the 3.5 year period ended June 30, 2011, required by Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, 718 to record expense
under certain of our restricted stock grant based incentive plans using liability accounting rather than treating these grants
as equity awards. We deemed the out of period portion of this adjustment to be immaterial to all periods presented. Liability accounting
was required as a result of a past practice by MAA which allowed participants to sell shares of vested restricted stock back to
MAA in excess of the amount required to cover the participant’s taxes upon vesting of the shares. This practice was discontinued
after the end of the second quarter.

F-


Reclassifications

In order to present comparative financial statements, certain reclassifications
have been made. These classifications are the result of presenting the fair market value of leases and related accumulated amortization
from buildings and improvements into intangible assets, which are recorded in Other Assets on the balance sheets.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2011, the FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update (ASU) No. 2011-05,

Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income.

This ASU allows
an entity the option to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive
income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. In both choices,
an entity is required to present each component of net income along with total net income, each component of other comprehensive
income along with a total for other comprehensive income, and a total amount for comprehensive income. ASU 2011-05 eliminates the
option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of equity. The amendments do not change
the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified
to net income. ASU 2011-05 will be applied retrospectively.

The amendments are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods
within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011, but allows for early adoption.

We adopted ASU
2011-05 for the Annual Report for fiscal year 2011, and this changes the presentation of our financial statements but not our consolidated
financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole.

In November 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU)
No. 2011-12,

Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications
of Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-05

. This ASU supersedes certain
paragraphs in ASU 2011-05 addressing reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income. The effective
dates and expected changes to our presentation are the same as noted in ASU 2011-05 above.

In May 2011, the FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update (ASU) No. 2011-04,

Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement
and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRS.

The amendments change the wording, mainly for clarification, used
to describe many of the requirements in U.S. GAAP for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements.
For many of the requirements, the Board does not intend for the amendments in this update to result in a change in the application
of the requirements in Topic 820.

The amendments in this ASU are to be applied prospectively. The amendments
are effective during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. We will adopt ASU 2011-04 in the interim and
annual periods of fiscal year 2012.

The adoption of ASU 2011-04 will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial
condition or results of operations taken as a whole.

2.	STOCK BASED COMPENSATION

In accordance with accounting standards governing stock based
compensation MAA measures the amount of compensation cost based on the grant-date fair value of the equity or the liability instruments
issued, and remeasures liability awards at each reporting period. Compensation cost is recognized over the period that an employee
provides service in exchange for the award.

Incentive Plans Overview and Summary

MAA’s stock compensation plans consist of an employee
stock purchase plan and a number of incentives provided to attract and retain independent directors, executive officers and key
employees. Incentives are currently granted under the 2004 Stock Plan which was approved at the May 24, 2004 Annual Meeting of
Shareholders. This plan replaced the 1994 Restricted Stock and Stock Option Plan (collectively, the “Plans”) under
which no further awards may be granted as of January 31, 2004. The 1994 Restricted Stock and Stock Option Plan allowed for the
grant of restricted stock and stock options up to a total of 2.4 million shares. The 2004 Stock Plan allows for the grant of restricted
stock and stock options up to a total of 500,000 shares. MAA believes that such awards better align the interests of our employees
with those of our shareholders.

In general, restricted stock is
earned based on either a service condition, performance condition, or a market condition, or a combination thereof, and vest ratably
over multiple periods. Service based awards are earned when the employee remains employed over the requisite service period. Service
based awards are expensed over the vesting period on a straight line basis adjusted for expected and actual forfeitures. If a market
condition affects a service based vesting period, the award is expensed using the accelerated amortization method. Performance
based awards are earned when MAA reaches certain operational goals such as EPS or FFO targets. Performance based awards are expensed
over the requisite service period on a graded basis based on grant date fair value and a probability analysis on the likelihood
of reaching stated targets. It is also adjusted for expected forfeitures, actual forfeitures, and assessment of the probability
of reaching performance targets each reporting period. Market based awards are earned when MAA reaches a specified stock price
or specified return on the stock price (price appreciation plus dividends). Market based awards are expensed over the vesting period
on a graded basis calculated with a Monte Carlo simulation adjusted for forfeitures. Awards that allow employees to sell shares
of vested restricted stock back to

MAA in excess of the amount required to cover the participant’s taxes upon vesting
of the shares require liability accounting and are marked to market each reporting period. Awards that do not allow for share repurchases
are classified as equity and are generally valued based on grant date fair value and are not adjusted to market each reporting
period.

Total compensation costs under the Plans were approximately
$5,522,000, $3,033,000 and $1,314,000 for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. As of December 31, 2011,
the total unrecognized compensation cost related to the Plans was approximately $1,557,000. This cost is expected to be recognized
over the remaining weighted average period of 0.6 years. Total cash paid for the settlement of plan shares totaled $1,604,000,
$321,000, $466,000 for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 respectively. Information concerning specific grants under
the Plans is listed below.

F-


Employee Stock Purchase Plan

The Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. Employee Stock Purchase
Plan, or ESPP, provides a means for employees to purchase common stock of MAA at a discounted price. The Board of Directors has
authorized the issuance of 150,000 shares for the plan. The ESPP is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of
Directors who may annually grant options to employees to purchase up to an aggregate of 15,000 shares of common stock at a price
equal to 85% of the market price of the common stock. Shares are purchased semi-annually on June 30 and December 31. The plan determines
the purchase price using one of three measurement formulas based on the market activity during the measurement period. The variability
caused by the combination of varying number of participants, market price fluctuations and potential changes in formula used each
measurement period makes it not possible to reasonably estimate fair value at the grant date. During the years ended December 31,
2011, 2010 and 2009, 5,732 shares, 5,279 shares and 6,427 shares, respectively, were purchased through the ESPP. The plan does
not meet the criteria to be a noncompensatory plan and therefore compensation cost of approximately $59,000, $44,000, and $38,000
was recognized for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Options

All option awards made under the Plans have been granted with the
exercise price equal to the market price on the date of grant. The options vest over five years of continuous service at a rate
of 10%, 10%, 20%, 30% and 30%, and expire 10 years from grant date. MAA issues new shares when options are exercised. Dividends
are not paid on unexercised options.

The fair value of each option award is estimated on the grant date
using the Black-Scholes method. Volatility is based on the historical volatility of MAA’s common stock. Expected life of
the option is estimated using historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination. MAA uses a U.S. constant-maturity
Treasury close to the same expected life of the option to represent the risk-free rate. Turnover is based on the historical rate
at which options are exercised. MAA uses its current dividend yield at the time of grant to estimate the dividend yield over the
life of the option. No options were granted during 2011, 2010 or 2009.

A summary of option activity under the Plans as of December 31,
2011, and the changes during the year then ended follows:

Executive 2000 Restricted Stock Plan

In 2000, MAA issued 10,750 restricted shares of common stock to
executive officers with a grant date fair value of $22.1875 per share. The grant date fair value was determined by the closing
trading price of MAA’s shares on the day prior to the date of the grant. These shares vested 10% each over ten years through
2010.

There were no changes in nonvested shares for the year ended
December 31, 2011. As of December 31, 2011, there were no nonvested shares granted and no unrecognized compensation cost. The total
fair value of shares vesting during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, was approximately $0, $24,000 and $24,000,
respectively.

Key Management 2002 Restricted Stock Plan

In 2002, MAA issued 97,881 restricted
shares of common stock to key managers and executive officers with a grant date fair value of $25.65 per share. The grant date
fair value was determined by the closing trading price of MAA’s shares on the day prior to the date of the grant. As a result
of three managers leaving the employment of MAA, as of December 31, 2011, only 81,916 shares remain issued.

These
shares vest 20% on March 31 of each year for five consecutive years beginning in 2008. Recipients receive dividend payments on
the shares of restricted stock prior to vesting. This plan was modified on August 2, 2011 recategorizing 7,316 of the shares previously
categorized as a liability to equity due to the discontinuation of a practice

allowing participants to sell shares of vested
restricted stock back to MAA in excess of the amount required to cover the participant’s taxes upon vesting of the shares.
No other plan terms were changed. The new grant date fair value for these shares is $69.37 per share.

The grant date fair value was determined by the closing trading price of MAA’s shares on the modification date. All remaining
shares were earned and issued by the modification date and therefore the valuation was calculated on issued plan shares adjusted
for forfeitures based on the historical experience for turnover by the key managers and executive officers. No additional compensation
cost was recognized as a result of this modification.

Director Restricted Stock Plan

Non-employee Directors elected to the Board of Directors receive
an annual grant of restricted shares of common stock. The annual grants were equivalent to $30,000 per non-employee Director in
2009, $40,000 per non-employee Director in 2010 and $50,000 per non-employee Director in 2011. Directors have the right to receive
their grants either in restricted shares of common stock of MAA that will vest after one year of service on the Board of Directors
or have them issued into a deferred compensation plan.

As of December 31, 2011, there was approximately $80,000 of total
unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share-based compensation arrangements granted. This cost is expected to be
recognized over the remaining weighted average period of 0.2 years. The total fair value of shares vesting during the years ended
December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, was approximately $200,000, $120,000 and $140,000, respectively.

Key Management 2005 Restricted Stock Plan

In 2005, the Board of Directors adopted the 2005 Key Management
Restricted Stock Plan, or the 2005 Plan, a long-term market based incentive program for key managers and executive officers. The
2005 Plan granted shares of restricted stock based on a sliding scale of total shareholder return over three 12-month periods ending
in 2006, 2007 and 2008. Any restricted stock earned vested 100% three years after the date of the restricted stock issuance. There
was no automatic vesting of the shares. Based on MAA’s performance from July 1, 2005, through June 30, 2006, 25,034 restricted
shares of common stock were issued to key managers and executive officers on June 30, 2006. No shares of restricted stock were
issued in 2007 or 2008. As of January 1, 2011, all remaining shares were issued and vested under this plan.

The fair value of the stock award was estimated on the grant date
using a Monte Carlo simulation with the assumptions noted in the following table. Volatility is based on the historical volatility
of MAA’s common stock. The expected term of the 2005 Plan was based on the criteria for the plan and the expected life of
the awards. MAA uses a U.S. constant-maturity Treasury with the same term as the expected term of the 2005 Plan to represent the
risk-free rate. Turnover is based on the historical experience for the key managers and executive officers. MAA used its current
dividend yield at the time of grant to estimate the dividend yield over the life of the plan.

As of December 31, 2011, there was no unrecognized compensation

was approximately $996,000.

Long-Term Market Based Incentive Plan for Executive Officers

The Compensation Committee, by authorization of the Board of Directors
of MAA, submitted the Long-Term Market Based Incentive Plan for Executive Officers, or Long-Term Plan, which was approved by shareholders
on June 2, 2003. The Long-Term Plan allowed executive management to earn market performance units that converted into restricted
shares of common stock based on achieving defined total shareholder investment performance levels. Based on MAA’s performance
from January 1, 2003, through December 31, 2005, 74,895 restricted shares of common stock were issued to executive management on
March 14, 2006. While these restricted shares of common stock were entitled to dividend payments, they were not transferable and
did not have voting privileges until they vested. Dependent upon the executive officer’s continued employment with MAA, these
restricted shares of common stock vested 20% annually from 2006 through 2010.

The fair value of the stock award was estimated on the grant date
using a Monte Carlo simulation with the assumptions noted in the following table. Volatility was based on the historical volatility
of MAA’s common stock. The expected term of the Long-Term Plan was based on the criteria for the plan and the expected life
of the awards. MAA uses a U.S. constant-maturity Treasury for the same term as the expected term of the Long-Term Plan to represent
the risk-free rate. Turnover is based on the historical experience for executive officers. MAA uses its current dividend yield
at the time of grant to estimate the dividend yield over the life of the plan.

and no unrecognized compensation cost. The total fair value of shares vesting during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and
2009, was approximately $0, $66,000 and $66,000, respectively.

Key Management 2008 Restricted Stock Plan

In 2008, the Board of Directors adopted the 2008 Key Management
Restricted Stock Plan, or the 2008 Plan, a long-term incentive program for key managers and executive officers. The 2008 Plan consists
of both an annual and three year program. Under the annual program participants can earn both service and market based shares of
restricted stock. The service based shares are awarded at the beginning of the 2008 Plan with the timing of vesting dependent on
employment and total shareholder return performance. The earning of restricted shares under the market based program is based on
employment and total shareholder return performance. No shares were earned through the annual market program. Participation in
the three year program is limited to the executive officers and awards shares of restricted stock based upon both MAA’s total
shareholder return performance over a three year period and that performance in relation to that of MAA’s peers. Any shares
earned through the three year program will be issued on January 3, 2012 and will vest 25% annually beginning on January 1, 2013.
Recipients will receive dividend payments on any restricted shares of common stock earned and issued during the restriction periods.
On July 1, 2008, MAA issued 15,920 restricted shares of common stock under the annual service based program of the 2008 Plan. As
a result of three managers leaving the employment of MAA, as of December 31, 2011, 523 shares have been forfeited and 473 shares
early vested. On January 3, 2012, MAA issued 17,343 restricted shares of common stock under the three year program of the 2008
Plan.

The fair value of the stock award was estimated on the grant date
using a multifactor Monte Carlo simulation. The valuation used an interest rate term structure as of July 1, 2008 based on a zero
coupon risk-free rate to represent the risk-free rate for the simulation which varied between 1.95% for 0.25 years to 3.24% for
4.00 years. The dividend yield assumption was 4.669% and was based on the closing stock price of $52.69 on July 1, 2008. Volatility
for MAA and our peers was obtained by using a blend of both historical and implied volatility calculations. Historical volatility
was based on the standard deviation of daily total continuous returns and implied volatility was based on the trailing month average
of interpolating between the volatilities implied by stock call option contracts that were closest to the terms and closest to
the money. Volatility for MAA was 34.87% for year 1, 30.92% for year 2, 29.63% for year 3, and 28.61% for year 4. Volatilities
for our peers ranged from 25.05% to 49.94%. The requisite service period of the 2008 Plan is based on the criteria for the separate
programs and is 5.5 years for the annual service based program, 2.5 years for the annual market based program and 7.5 years for
the three-year program. Turnover is based on the historical experience for the key managers and executive officers.

This plan was modified on August 2, 2011
recategorizing 6,374 of the shares previously categorized as a liability to equity due to the discontinuation of a practice

allowing
participants to sell shares of vested restricted stock back to MAA in excess of the amount required to cover the participant’s
taxes upon vesting of the shares. No other plan terms were changed. The new grant date fair value for these shares is $69.37 per
share.

The grant date fair value was determined by the closing trading price of MAA’s shares on
the modification date as all market conditions had been determined at such time. The measurement period was completed and all earned
shares were issued by the modification date and the valuation was calculated on issued plan shares adjusted for forfeitures based
on the historical experience for turnover by the key managers and executive officers. No additional compensation cost was recognized
as a result of this modification.

Key Management 2010 Restricted Stock Plan

In 2010, the Board of Directors adopted the 2010 Key Management
Restricted Stock Plan, or the 2010 Plan, a long-term incentive program for key managers and executive officers. Under the 2010
Plan participants can earn both service and market based shares of restricted stock. The service based shares are awarded at the
beginning of the 2010 Plan with the timing of vesting dependent on employment and total shareholder return performance. The earning
of restricted shares under the market program is based on employment and total shareholder return performance. Recipients will
receive dividend payments on any shares of restricted stock earned and issued during the restriction periods. On March 23, 2010,
MAA issued 18,171 shares of restricted stock under the service based program of the 2010 Plan. As a result of a manager leaving
the employment of MAA, as of December 31, 2011, only 17,885 shares remain issued. On January 3, 2011, MAA issued 37,002 shares
of restricted stock under the market program of the 2010 Plan. All shares, including service shares, vest 50% annually beginning
on January 1, 2011. As a result of a manager leaving the employment of MAA, as of December 31, 2011, only 36,430 shares remain
issued.

The fair value of the stock award was estimated on the grant date
using a Monte Carlo simulation. The valuation used an interest rate term structure as of March 23, 2010 based on a zero coupon
risk-free rate to represent the risk-free rate for the simulation which varied between 0.14% for 0.25 years to 0.41% for 1.00 year.
The dividend yield assumption was 4.52% and was based on the closing stock price of $54.38 on March 23, 2010. Volatility for MAA
was obtained by using a blend of both historical and implied volatility calculations. Historical volatility was based on the standard
deviation of daily total continuous returns and implied volatility was based on the trailing month average of interpolating between
the volatilities implied by stock call option contracts that were closest to the terms and closest to the money. Volatility for
MAA was 24.12% for 0.50 years, 27.14% for 0.75 years and 35.65% for 1.00 year. The requisite service period of the 2010 Plan is
based on the criteria for the separate programs and is 1.79 years for the service and market based programs. Turnover is based
on the historical experience for the key managers and executive officers.

2010 Executive Restricted Stock Plan

In 2010, The Board of Directors of MAA approved a restricted stock
grant for certain members of executive management. On March 23, 2010, MAA issued 2,710 shares of restricted common stock to those
executive officers with a grant date fair value of $54.38 per share. The grant date fair value was determined by the closing trading
price of MAA’s shares on the date of the grant. These shares vest 1/3

rd

annually beginning on March 23, 2011.
Recipients receive dividend payments on the shares of restricted stock prior to vesting.

December 31, 2011 was approximately $49,000. No shares vested during the year ended December 31, 2010.

Key Management 2011 Restricted Stock Plan

In 2011, the Board of Directors adopted the 2011 Key Management
Restricted Stock Plan, or the 2011 Plan, a long-term incentive program for key managers and executive officers. Under the 2011
Plan participants can earn both performance and market based shares of restricted stock. The earning of restricted shares under
the performance program is based on employment and relative FFO per share performance. Any performance shares earned will be issued
on March 1, 2012 and will vest 50% annually beginning on March 1, 2012. The earning of restricted shares under the market program
is based on employment and both absolute and relative total shareholder return performance. Any market shares earned will be issued
on March 1, 2012 and will vest 50% annually beginning on March 1, 2012. Recipients will receive dividend payments on any shares
of restricted stock earned and issued during the restriction periods.

The fair value of the performance based stock award was estimated
using the grant date stock price of $63.96 and the probability of MAA reaching the plan’s FFO targets. The fair value of
the market based stock award was estimated on the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation. The valuation used an interest rate
term structure as of January 3, 2011 based on a zero coupon risk-free rate to represent the risk-free rate for the simulation which
varied between 0.13% for 0.25 years to 0.28% for 1.00 year. The dividend yield assumption was 3.92% for MAA and was based on the
closing stock price of $63.96 on January 3, 2011. Volatility for MAA was obtained by using a blend of both historical and implied
volatility calculations. Historical volatility was based on the standard deviation of daily total continuous returns and implied
volatility was based on the trailing month average of interpolating between the volatilities implied by stock call option contracts
that were closest to the terms and closest to the money. Volatility for MAA was 22.56% for six months, 24.14% for nine months and
23.46% for twelve months. The requisite service period of the 2011 Plan is based on the criteria for the separate programs and
is 2.2 years. Turnover is based on the historical experience for the key managers and executive officers.

This plan was modified on August 2, 2011
recategorizing shares for 52 participants previously categorized as a liability to equity due to the discontinuation of a practice

allowing participants to sell shares of vested restricted stock back to MAA in excess of the amount required to cover the
participant’s taxes upon vesting of the shares. No other plan terms were changed. The new grant date fair value is $69.37
per share.

The grant date fair value was determined by the closing trading price of MAA’s shares
on the modification date. The fair value of the modified performance based award was estimated using the grant date stock price
of $69.37 and the probability of MAA reaching the plan’s FFO targets. The fair value of the modified market based award was
estimated on the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation. The valuation used an interest rate term structure as of August 2,
2011 based on a zero coupon risk-free rate to represent the risk-free rate for the simulation which varied between 0.06% for 0.25
years to 0.16% for 1.00 year. The dividend yield assumption was 3.618% for MAA and was based on the closing stock price of $69.37
on August 2, 2011. Volatility for MAA was obtained by using a blend of both historical and implied volatility calculations. Historical
volatility was based on the standard deviation of daily total continuous returns and implied volatility was based on the trailing
month average of interpolating between the volatilities implied by stock call option contracts that were closest to the terms and
closest to the money. Volatility for MAA was 18.47% for six months, 18.16% for nine months and 18.71% for twelve months. The requisite
service period of the modified 2011 Plan is based on the criteria for the separate programs and is 1.6 years. Turnover is based
on the historical experience for the key managers and executive officers. No additional compensation cost was recognized as a result
of this modification.

F-


As of December 31, 2011,
there was approximately $891,000 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share-based compensation arrangements
granted. MAA’s policy is to recognize compensation cost over the requisite service period for each portion of an award which
contains a market or performance condition. The $891,000 unrecognized cost will be recognized accordingly over the remaining weighted
average period of 0.4 years. No equity shares vested and no liabilities settled during the year ended December 31, 2011.

3.	REAL ESTATE JOINT

4.	BORROWINGS

MAA maintains a total of $964 million

of
secured credit facilities with Prudential Mortgage Capital, credit enhanced by FNMA, or FNMA Facilities. The FNMA Facilities provide
for both fixed and variable rate borrowings and have FNMA rate traunches with maturities from 2012 through 2018.

The interest rate on the majority of the variable portion renews every 90 days and is based on the FNMA discount mortgage
backed security rate on the date of renewal, which, for MAA, has historically approximated three-month LIBOR less an average of
0.16% over

the life of the FNMA Facilities, plus a fee of 0.49% to 0.67%.

Borrowings under the FNMA Facilities totaled $948 million at December 31, 2011, consisting of $50 million under a fixed
portion at a rate of 4.7%, and the remaining $898 million under the variable rate portion of the facility at an average rate of
0.7%. The available borrowing base capacity at December 31, 2011, was $964 million. Commitment fees related to our unused FNMA
Facilities totaled $151 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2011. MAA has 13 interest rate swap agreements, totaling a notional
amount of $425 million designed to fix the interest rate on a portion of the variable rate borrowings outstanding under the FNMA
Facilities at approximately 4.5%. The interest rate swaps have maturities between 2012 and 2015. The swaps are highly effective
and are designed as cash flow hedges. MAA has also entered into 20 interest rate caps totaling a notional amount of $256 million
which are designed to cap a portion of the FNMA Facilities. These interest rate caps have maturities between 2012 and 2018 and
nine are set at 6.0%, nine set at 4.5%, and two set at 5.0%. The FNMA Facilities are subject to certain borrowing base calculations
that can effectively reduce the amount that may be borrowed.

MAA has a $200 million credit facility with Freddie MAC, or Freddie
Mac Facility. At December 31, 2011, MAA had $198 million borrowed against the Freddie Mac Facility at an interest rate of 0.7%.
Commitment fees related to our Freddie Mac Facility totaled $3 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2011.

MAA has 8 interest rate swap agreements, totaling a notional amount of $134 million designed to fix the interest rate on
a portion of the variable rate borrowings outstanding under the Freddie Mac Facility at approximately 4.4%. The interest rate swaps
expire in 2013 and 2014. MAA has also entered into one interest rate cap totaling a notional amount of $15 million which is designated
against the Freddie Mac Facility. This interest rate cap has a 2014 maturity and is set at 5.0%.

MAA also maintains a $250 million unsecured credit facility with
nine banks led by Key Bank.

The Key Bank Credit Line bears an interest rate of LIBOR plus a spread
of 1.65% to 2.40% based on a leveraged based pricing grid. This credit line expires in November 2015 with a one year extension
option. At December 31, 2011, MAA had $249 million available to be borrowed under the Key Bank Line agreement with nothing borrowed
under this facility.

Approximately $1 million of the facility is used to support letters of credit.
Commitment fees related to this facility totaled $63 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2011.

Each of MAA’s credit facilities is subject to various covenants
and conditions on usage. If MAA were to fail to satisfy a condition to borrowing, the available credit under one or more of the
facilities could not be drawn, which could adversely affect MAA’s liquidity. Moreover, if MAA were to fail to make a payment
or violate a covenant under a credit facility, after applicable cure periods, one or more of its lenders could declare a default,
accelerate the due date for repayment of all amounts outstanding and/or foreclose on properties securing such facilities. Any such
event could have a material adverse effect on MAA. MAA believes it was in compliance with these covenants and conditions on usage
at December 31, 2011.

At December 31, 2011, MAA had $353 million of fixed rate conventional
property mortgages with an average interest rate of 5.0% and an average maturity of 2020 and a $15 million variable rate mortgage
with an embedded cap rate of 7% at an interest rate of 3.5% with a maturity in 2015.

At December 31, 2011, MAA had $264 million

(after considering the impact of interest rate swap and cap agreements in effect) of conventional variable rate debt outstanding
at an average interest rate of 0.9%, $198 million of capped conventional variable rate debt at an average interest rate of 0.7%,
and $73 million of capped tax-free variable rate debt at an average rate of

0.9%. The interest
rate on all other secured debt, totaling $980 million, was hedged or fixed at an average interest rate of 5.1%. Additionally, MAA
had $135 million of senior unsecured notes fixed at an interest rate of 5.1%.

As of December 31, 2011, MAA estimated that the weighted average
interest rate on MAA’s debt was 3.7%.

5.   DERIVATIVES
AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

Risk Management Objective of Using Derivatives

We are exposed to certain risk arising from both our business operations
and economic conditions. We principally manage our exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management
of our core business activities. We manage economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity and credit risk, primarily by managing
the amount, sources and duration of our debt funding and the use of derivative financial instruments. Specifically, we enter into
derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the payment of future contractual
and forecasted cash amounts, principally related to our borrowings, the value of which are determined by changing interest rates.

Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk

Our objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability
to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish this objective, we use interest rate swaps
and interest rate caps as part of our interest rate risk management strategy. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges
involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty in exchange for us making fixed-rate payments over the life of the
agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount. Interest rate caps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt
of variable amounts from a counterparty if interest rates rise above the strike rate on the contract in exchange for an up front
premium.

The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives
designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and is subsequently reclassified
into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. During the years ended December 31, 2011,
2010 and 2009, such derivatives were used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with existing variable-rate debt.  The
ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the derivatives is recognized directly in earnings. During the years ended December
31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, we recorded ineffectiveness of $188,000, $235,000 and $724,000, respectively, as an increase to interest
expense attributable to a mismatch in the underlying indices of the derivatives and the hedged interest payments made on our variable-rate
debt.

During the year ended December 31, 2011, we also had eight
interest rate caps with a total notional amount of $51.2 million, (two of these caps with a collective notional of $19.5 million
matured during the first quarter of 2011), where only the changes in intrinsic value are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive
income.  Changes in fair value of these interest rate caps due to changes in time value (e.g. volatility, passage of
time, etc.) are excluded from effectiveness testing and are recognized directly in earnings.  During the years ended
December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, we recorded losses of $7,000, $34,000 and $4,000, respectively, due to changes in the time value
of these interest rate caps.

F-


Amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income related
to derivatives designated in qualifying cash flow hedges will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made
on our variable-rate debt. During the next twelve months, we estimate that an additional $18.2 million will be reclassified to
earnings as an increase to interest expense, which primarily represents the difference between our fixed interest rate swap payments
and the projected variable interest rate swap payments.

As of December 31, 2011 we had the following outstanding interest
rate derivatives that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk:

Non-designated Hedges

Derivatives not designated as hedges are not speculative and are
used to manage the Company’s exposure to interest rate movements and other identified risks but do not meet the strict hedge
accounting requirements of FASB ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging. Changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated in hedging
relationships are recorded directly in earnings and resulted in a loss of $24,000 for the year ended December 31, 2011. We did
not have any derivatives not designated as hedges for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009.

As of December 31, 2011 we had the following outstanding interest

Credit-risk-related Contingent Features

As of December 31, 2011, derivatives that were in a net liability
position and subject to credit-risk-related contingent features had a termination value of $36.4 million, which includes accrued
interest but excludes any adjustment for nonperformance risk. These derivatives had a fair value, gross of asset positions, of
$33.1 million at December 31, 2011.

Certain of our derivative contracts contain a provision where if
we default on any of our indebtedness, including default where repayment of the indebtedness has not been accelerated
by the lender, then we could also be declared in default on our derivative obligations. As of December 31, 2011, we had not
breached the provisions of these agreements.  If we had breached these provisions, we could have been required to settle
our obligations under the agreements at their termination value of $17.6 million.

F-


Certain of our derivative contracts are credit enhanced by either
FNMA or Freddie Mac.  These derivative contracts require that our credit enhancing party maintain credit ratings above
a certain level.  If our credit support providers were downgraded below Baa1 by Moody’s or BBB+ by Standard &
Poor’s, or S&P, we may be required to either post 100 percent collateral or settle the obligations at their termination
value of $36.4 million as of December 31, 2011.  Both FNMA and Freddie Mac are currently rated Aaa by Moody’s and
AA+ by S&P, and therefore, the provisions of this agreement have not been breached and no collateral has been posted related
to these agreements as of December 31, 2011.

Although our derivative contracts are subject to master netting
arrangements, which serve as credit mitigants to both us and our counterparties under certain situations, we do not net our derivative
fair values or any existing rights or obligations to cash collateral on the consolidated balance sheet.

See also discussions in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 6.

6.  Fair
Value Disclosure of Financial Instruments

Cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts payable, accrued
expenses and other liabilities and security deposits are carried at amounts that reasonably approximate their fair value due to
their short term nature.

Fixed rate notes payable at December 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010,
totaled $538 million and $267 million, respectively, and had estimated fair values of $560 million and $238 million (excluding
prepayment penalties), respectively, based upon interest rates available for the issuance of debt with similar terms and remaining
maturities as of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010. The carrying value of variable rate notes payable (excluding the effect
of interest rate swap and cap agreements) at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, totaled $1,112 million and $1,233 million,
respectively, and had estimated fair values of $1,053 million and $1,151 million (excluding prepayment penalties), respectively,
based upon interest rates available for the issuance of debt with similar terms and remaining maturities as of December 31, 2011
and December 31, 2010.

On January 1, 2008, we adopted FASB ASC 820

Fair Value Measurements
and Disclosures,

or ASC 820.

ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value,
and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. ASC 820 applies to reported balances that are required or permitted to be
measured at fair value under existing accounting pronouncements; accordingly, the standard does not require any new fair value
measurements of reported balances.

ASC 820 emphasizes that fair value is a market-based measurement,
not an entity-specific measurement.  Therefore, a fair value measurement should be determined based on the assumptions
that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.  As a basis for considering market participant
assumptions in fair value measurements, ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant
assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity (observable inputs that are classified
within Levels 1 and 2 of the hierarchy) and the reporting entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions (unobservable
inputs classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy).

Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets
for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access. Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices
included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs may include quoted
prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, as well as inputs that are observable for the asset or liability (other
than quoted prices), such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals.
Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, which are typically based on an entity’s own assumptions,
as there is little, if any, related market activity. In instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based
on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair
value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Our
assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and considers
factors specific to the asset or liability.

F-


Derivative financial instruments

Currently, we use interest rate swaps and interest rate caps (options)

to
manage our interest rate

risk.

The valuation of these instruments is determined using widely accepted
valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative. This analysis reflects
the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including
interest rate curves and implied volatilities. The fair values of interest rate swaps are determined using the market standard
methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash receipts (or payments) and the discounted expected variable cash payments
(or receipts). The variable cash payments (or receipts) are based on an expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived
from observable market interest rate curves.

The fair values of interest rate options are determined using the
market standard methodology of discounting the future expected cash receipts that would occur if variable interest rates rise
above the strike rate of the caps. The variable interest rates used in the calculation of projected receipts on the cap are based
on an expectation of future interest rates derived from observable market interest rate curves and volatilities.

To comply with the provisions of ASC 820, we incorporate credit
valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both our own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty’s nonperformance
risk in the fair value measurements. In adjusting the fair value of our derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk,
we have considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings, thresholds,
mutual puts and guarantees.

Although we have determined that the majority of the inputs
used to value our derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with
our derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by our
self and our counterparties. In prior periods, we classified our derivative valuations within the Level 3 fair value hierarchy
because those valuations contain certain Level 3 inputs (e.g. credit spreads). Commencing with the year ended December 31, 2010,
we determined that the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments made to our derivative contracts, which determination
was based on the fair value of each individual contract, was not significant to the overall valuation. As a result, all of our
derivatives held as of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010 were classified as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

The table below presents our assets and liabilities measured at
fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, aggregated by the level in the fair value hierarchy
within which those measurements fall.

7.	COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Mid-America is not presently subject to any material litigation
nor, to MAA’s knowledge, with advice of legal counsel, is any material litigation threatened against us. We are subject to
routine litigation arising in the ordinary course of business, some of which is expected to be covered by liability insurance and
none of which is expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.

MAA had operating lease expense of approximately $18,000,
$18,000, and $18,000 for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. MAA has commitments of approximately $13,000
in 2012, $4,000 in 2013, and $4,000 thereafter under operating lease agreements outstanding at December 31, 2011. MAA also has
commitments of $10.3 million in 2012 and $2.4 million in 2013 under development contract agreements outstanding at December 31,
2011.

8.	INCOME TAXES

No provision for federal income taxes has been made in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements. MAA has made an election to be taxed as a Real Estate Investment Trust, or REIT, under Sections
856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code. As a REIT, MAA is generally not subject to federal income tax to the extent that
we distribute 100% of our taxable income to our shareholders. We must meet certain requirements, including the requirement to distribute
at least 90% of our taxable income, to maintain REIT status. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, MAA will be subject
to the federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates.
Even though we qualify for taxation as a REIT, MAA may be subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on our income and property
and to federal income and excise tax on our undistributed income.

Earnings and profits, which determine the taxability of dividends
to shareholders, differ from net income reported for financial reporting purposes primarily because of differences in depreciable
lives, bases of certain assets and liabilities and in the timing of recognition of earnings upon disposition of properties. For
federal income tax purposes, the following summarizes the taxability of cash distributions paid on the common shares in 2010 and
2009 and the estimated taxability for 2011:

ASC 740-10-50 prescribes a recognition threshold and
measurement attribute for the recognition and measurement of tax positions taken in tax returns. MAA has identified and examined
our tax positions, including our status as a real estate investment trust, for all open tax years through December 31, 2006, and
concluded that the full benefit of each tax position taken should be recognized in the financial statements. There have been no
significant changes in unrecognized tax benefits following the adoption date.

ASC 740-10-50 requires that an enterprise must calculate interest
and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits. The decision regarding where to classify interest and penalties on the
income statement is an accounting policy decision that should be consistently applied. Interest and penalties calculated on
any future uncertain tax positions will be presented as a component of income tax expense. No interest and penalties are accrued
on our balance sheet as of December 31, 2011 and 2010.

MAA’s tax years that remain subject to examination for U.S.
federal purposes range from 2008 through 2010. Our tax years that remain open for state examination vary but range from 2007 through
2010.

9.	SHAREHOLDER’S EQUITY

Noncontrolling Interest

Noncontrolling interest in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements relates to the ownership interest in the Operating Partnership by the holders of Class A Common Units of the Operating
Partnership, or Operating Partnership Units. Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. is the sole general partner of the Operating
Partnership. Net income is allocated to the noncontrolling interest based on their respective ownership percentage of the Operating
Partnership. Issuance of additional common shares or Operating Partnership Units changes the ownership of both the noncontrolling
interest and Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. Such transactions and the related proceeds are treated as capital transactions
and result in an allocation between shareholders’ equity and noncontrolling interest to account for the change in the respective
percentage ownership of the underlying equity of the Operating Partnership.

MAA’s Board of Directors established economic rights in respect
to each Operating Partnership Unit that were equivalent to the economic rights in respect to each share of common stock. The holder
of each unit may redeem their units in exchange for one share of common stock or cash, at the option of MAA. At December 31, 2011,
a total of 1,937,669 units were outstanding and redeemable to MAA by the holders of the units for 1,937,669 shares of common stock
or approximately $121,201,000, based on the closing price of MAA’s common stock on December 31, 2011 of $62.55 per share,
at MAA’s option. At December 31, 2010, a total of 2,191,361 units were outstanding and redeemable to MAA by the holders of
the units for 2,191,361 shares of common stock or approximately $139,130,000, based on the closing price of MAA’s common
stock on December 31, 2010 of $63.49 per share, at MAA’s option.

The Operating Partnership has followed the policy of paying the
same per unit distribution in respect to the units as the per share distribution in respect to the common stock. Operating Partnership
net income for 2011, 2010 and 2009 was allocated approximately 5.3%, 6.9% and 8.2%, respectively, to holders of Operating Partnership
Units and 94.7%, 93.1% and 91.8%, respectively, to MAA.

Series H Preferred Stock

In 2003, MAA issued the Series H Preferred Stock with a $25.00 per
share liquidation preference and a preferential cumulative annual distribution of $2.075 per share, payable quarterly. MAA issued
6,200,000 shares of Series H Preferred Stock for which it received net proceeds of $150.1 million. On and after August 11, 2008,
the Series H Preferred Stock shares became redeemable for cash at the option of MAA, in whole or in part, at a redemption price
equal to the liquidation preference plus dividends owed and unpaid to the redemption date.

On June 2, 2010, MAA redeemed 3,100,001 shares of the 6,200,000
shares of the Series H Preferred Stock. On August 5, 2010 MAA redeemed all of the remaining and outstanding shares of the Series
H Preferred Stock, resulting in a combined write-off for the year ended December 31, 2010 of approximately $5.1 million on the
consolidated statements of operations related to premiums and original issuance costs.

F-


Direct Stock Purchase and Distribution Reinvestment
Plan

MAA has a Dividend and Distribution Reinvestment and Share Purchase
Plan, or DRSPP, pursuant to which MAA’s shareholders have the ability to reinvest all or part of their distributions from
MAA’s common stock, preferred stock or limited partnership interests in Mid-America Apartments, L.P. into MAA’s common
stock. The plan also provides the opportunity to make optional cash investments in common shares of at least $250, but not more
than $5,000 in any given month, free of brokerage commissions and charges. MAA, in our absolute discretion, may grant waivers to
allow for optional cash payments in excess of $5,000. To fulfill our obligations under the DRSPP, we may either issue additional
shares of common stock or repurchase common stock in the open market. We have registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission
the offer and sale of up to 7,600,000 shares of common stock pursuant to the DRSPP. We may elect to sell shares under the DRSPP
at up to a 5% discount.

Common stock shares totaling 509,116 in 2011, 568,323 in 2010 and
25,406 in 2009 were acquired by shareholders under the DRSPP. MAA offered an average discount of 2.0% for optional cash purchases
in 2011 and 2010. No discount was offered for optional cash purchases through the DRSPP in 2009.

Controlled Equity Offering

On July 3, 2008, MAA entered into a sales agreement with Cantor
Fitzgerald & Co. to sell up to 1,350,000 shares of our common stock, from time to time in at-the-market offerings or negotiated
transactions through a controlled equity offering program, or ATM. On November 5, 2009, we entered into another ATM arrangement
with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. with materially the same terms for an additional 4,000,000 shares.

On August 26, 2010, MAA entered into sales agreements with Cantor
Fitzgerald & Co., Raymond James & Associates, Inc. and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated
to sell up to a combined total of 6,000,000 shares of our common stock, from time to time in at-the-market offerings or negotiated
transactions through a controlled equity offering program. These agreements had materially similar terms to our previous ATM agreements.

During the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, MAA sold
3,303,273 shares, 5,077,201 shares and 763,000 shares, respectively of common stock for net proceeds of $204.5 million, $274.6
million and $32.8 million, respectively through our ATM programs.

Stock Repurchase Plan

In 1999, MAA’s Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase
plan to acquire up to a total of 4.0 million shares of MAA’s common stock. Through December 31, 2011, MAA has repurchased
and retired approximately 1.9 million shares of common stock for a cost of approximately $42 million at an average price per common
share of $22.54. No shares were repurchased in 2002 through 2011 under the plan.

10. 	EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

Following are details of employee benefit plans not previously discussed
in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 2.

F-


401(k) Savings Plan

The Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. 401(k) Savings Plan,
or 401(k) Plan, is a defined contribution plan that satisfies the requirements of Section 401(a) and 401(k) of the Code. MAA’s
Board of Directors has the discretion to approve matching contributions. MAA’s contribution to this plan was approximately
$597,000, $507,000 and $161,000 in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Retirement Plan

MAA has adopted a non-qualified deferred compensation retirement
plan for key employees who are not qualified for participation in MAA’s 401(k) Plan. Under the terms of the plan, employees
may elect to defer a percentage of their compensation and MAA may, but is not obligated to, match a portion of their salary deferral.
The plan is designed so that the employees’ investment earnings under the non-qualified plan should be the same as the earning
assets in MAA’s 401(k) Plan. MAA’s match to this plan in 2011, 2010 and 2009 was approximately $51,000, $57,000 and
$4,000, respectively.

Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan for Outside Company
Directors

In 1998, MAA established the Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation
Plan for Outside Company Directors, or the Directors Deferred Compensation Plan, which allows non-employee directors to defer their
director fees by having the fees held by MAA as shares of MAA common stock. Directors can also choose to have their annual restricted
stock grants issued into the Directors Deferred Compensation Plan. Amounts deferred through the Directors Deferred Compensation
Plan are distributed to the directors in two annual installments beginning in the first 90 days of the year following the director’s
departure from the board. Participating directors may choose to have the amount issued to them in shares of MAA common stock or
paid to them as cash at the market value as of the end of the year the director ceases to serve on the board.

During 2011, 2010 and 2009, directors deferred 5,328 shares, 4,422
shares and 6,100 shares of common stock, respectively, with weighted-average grant date fair values of $64.55, $56.90 and $37.26,
respectively, into the Directors Deferred Compensation Plan.

The shares of common stock held in the Directors Deferred Compensation
Plan are classified outside of permanent equity in redeemable stock with changes in redemption amount recorded immediately in earnings
because the directors have redemption rights not solely within the control of MAA. Additionally, any shares that become mandatorily
redeemable because a departed director has elected to receive a cash payout are recorded as a liability. Accordingly, approximately
$78,000 and $143,000 was recorded in accrued expenses and other liabilities at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. There
were no accrued expenses related to these shares at December 31, 2009.

Employee Stock Ownership Plan

The Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. Employee Stock Ownership
Plan, or ESOP, is a non-contributory stock bonus plan that satisfies the requirements of Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code. Each employee of MAA is eligible to participate in the ESOP after completing one year of service with MAA. Participants'
ESOP accounts will be 100% vested after three years of continuous service, with no vesting prior to that time. MAA contributed
22,500 shares of common stock to the ESOP upon conclusion of the initial offering. MAA did not contribute to the ESOP during 2011,
2010 or 2009. As of December 31, 2011, there were 222,010 shares outstanding with a fair value of $13.9 million.

F-


Restricted Stock and Stock Option Plan

MAA adopted the 1994 Restricted Stock and Stock Option Plan, or
the 1994 Plan, to provide incentives to attract and retain independent directors, executive officers and key employees. As of January
31, 2004, no further awards may be granted under this plan. The 1994 Restricted Stock and Stock Option Plan was replaced by the
2004 Stock Plan, collectively the Plans, by shareholder approval at the May 24, 2004, Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The Plans
provide(d) for the granting of options to purchase a specified number of shares of common stock, or Options, or grants of restricted
shares of common stock, or Restricted Stock. The Plans also allow(ed) MAA to grant options to purchase Operating Partnership Units
at the price of the common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the day prior to issuance of the units, or the LESOP Provision.
The 1994 Plan authorized the issuance of 2,400,000 common shares or options to acquire shares. The 2004 Stock Plan authorizes the
issuance of 500,000 common shares or options to acquire shares. Under the terms of the 1994 Plan, MAA could advance directors,
executive officers, and key employees a portion of the cost of the common stock or units. The employee advances mature five years
from the date of issuance and accrue interest, payable in arrears, at a rate established at the date of issuance. MAA has also
entered into supplemental bonus agreements with the employees which are intended to fund the payment of a portion of the advances
over a five year period. Under the terms of the supplemental bonus agreements, MAA will pay bonuses to these employees equal to
3% of the original note balance on each anniversary date of the advance, limited to 15% of the aggregate purchase price of the
shares and units. In March of 2002, MAA entered into duplicate supplemental bonus agreements on the then existing options to executive
officers, effectively doubling their advances. The advances become due and payable and the bonus agreement will terminate if the
employees voluntarily terminate their employment with MAA. MAA also agreed to pay a bonus to certain executive officers in an amount
equal to the debt service on the advances for as long as they remain employed by MAA.

In May 2010, the last outstanding advance for $35,000 matured. As
of December 31, 2011, MAA had no advances outstanding relating to the LESOP Provision of the Plans.

F-


11.	EARNINGS FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

The three communities
that MAA sold in 2009 as well as the two properties sold by MAA during 2011 have been classified as discontinued operations in
the Consolidated Statements of Operations. All properties sold during 2011 were previously included in our large market same-store
portfolio. The following is a summary of earnings from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and
2009 (dollars in thousands):

12.	RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

Pursuant to management contracts with MAA’s joint ventures,
MAA manages the operations of the joint venture apartment communities for a fee of 4.00% to 4.25% of the revenues of the joint
venture. MAA received approximately $1,017,000, $680,000, and $293,000 as management fees from the joint ventures in 2011, 2010,
and 2009, respectively. MAA also received approximately $124,000, $442,000, and $83,000 of acquisition fees in 2011, 2010 and 2009,
respectively, $426,000, $360,000, and $245,000 in asset management fees in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively and $3,000, $6,000,
and $17,000 in construction management fees in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively from our joint ventures.

13. 	SEGMENT INFORMATION

As of December 31, 2011, MAA owned or had an ownership interest
in 167 multifamily apartment communities in 13 different states from which we derived all significant sources of earnings and operating
cash flows. Senior management evaluates performance and determines resource allocations by reviewing apartment communities individually
and in the following reportable operating segments:

·

Large market same store communities are generally communities in markets with a population of
at least 1 million and at least 1% of the total public multifamily REIT units that we have owned and have been stabilized for at
least a full 12 months and have not been classified as held for sale.

·

Secondary market same store communities are generally communities in markets with populations
of more than 1 million but less than 1% of the total public multifamily REIT units or markets with populations of less than 1 million
that we have owned and have been stabilized for at least a full 12 months and have not been classified as held for sale.

F-


·

Non same store communities and other includes recent acquisitions, communities in development
or lease-up and communities that have been classified as held for sale. Also included in non same store communities are non multifamily
activities which represent less than 1% of our portfolio.

On the first day of each calendar year,
we determine the composition of our same store operating segments for that year, which allows us to evaluate full period-over-period
operating comparisons.

We utilize NOI, in evaluating the performance. Total NOI represents total property revenues less
total property operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, for all properties held during the period regardless
of their status as held for sale. We believe NOI is a helpful tool in evaluating the operating performance of our segments because
it measures the core operations of property performance by excluding corporate level expenses and other items not related to property
operating performance.

During 2011 we acquired properties totaling 3,057 units for a total
purchase price of $362.7 million, paid in cash, which does not include land acquired for future development or the property acquired
by our joint venture. These acquisitions account for $17.0 million of consolidated revenue as reported and $3.5 million included
in the total consolidated net income for 2011. The unaudited pro forma information set forth below is based on MAA’s historical
Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, adjusted to give effect to these transactions
at the beginning of the earliest year presented. Pro forma results are not necessarily indicative of future results.
