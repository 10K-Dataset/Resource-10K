OVERVIEW OF THE COMPANY

Founded in 1994, Mid-America Apartment
Communities, Inc. (the “Company”) is a Memphis, Tennessee-based self-administered and self-managed umbrella partnership real estate
investment trust (“REIT”) that focuses on acquiring, owning and operating apartment communities. As of December 31, 2005, the Company owned
100% of 131 properties representing 37,705 apartment units. The Company has from time to time participated in various joint ventures including, as of
December 31, 2005, a joint venture with Crow Holdings, Mid-America CH/Realty II LP, (the “Crow JV”). The Crow JV owned one property with 522
apartment units at December 31, 2005. The Company has a 33.33% ownership interest in the Crow JV and is paid a management fee of 4% of revenues from
the property owned by the Crow JV. In total, the Company owned or had an ownership interest in 132 properties with 38,227 apartment units at December
31, 2005.

The Company’s business is
conducted principally through Mid-America Apartments, L.P. (the “Operating Partnership”). The Company is the sole general partner of the
Operating Partnership, holding 234,017 common units of partnership interest (“Common Units”) comprising a 1% general partnership interest in
the Operating Partnership as of December 31, 2005. The Company’s wholly-owned qualified REIT subsidiary, MAC II of Delaware, Inc., a Delaware
corporation, is a limited partner in the Operating Partnership and, as of December 31, 2005, held 20,496,954 Common Units, or 87.59% of all outstanding
Common Units.

The Company operated apartment
communities in 12 states in 2005, employing 1,148 full time and 97 part time employees at December 31, 2005.

OPERATING PHILOSOPHY

The Company’s primary objectives
are to protect and grow existing property values to maintain a stable and increasing cash flow that will fund its dividend through all parts of the
real estate investment cycle and create new shareholder value by growing the Company in a disciplined manner. The Company focuses on growing
shareholder value through operating its existing investments and, when accretive to cash flow and shareholder value, through new
investments.

INVESTMENT
FOCUS

.    The Company’s primary investment focus is on apartment communities in the Southeastern United States. Between
1994 and 1997, the Company grew largely through the acquisition and redevelopment of existing communities. Between 1998 and 2002, its concentration was
on development of new communities. The Company’s present focus is on the acquisition of properties that it believes can be


repositioned with appropriate use
of capital and its operating management skills. The Company is currently focusing on increasing its investment in properties in larger and faster
growing markets within its current geographic area, and intends to do this through acquiring apartment communities with the potential for above average
growth. On a small scale, the Company is beginning to develop expansions at existing communities. The Company will continue its established process of
selling mature assets, and will adapt its investment focus to opportunities and markets.

HIGH QUALITY
ASSETS

.    The Company strives to maintain its assets in excellent condition, believing that continuous maintenance will lead
to higher long-run returns on investment. It believes that being recognized by civic and industry trade organizations for the high quality of its
properties, landscaping, and property management will lead to higher rents and profitability and further supports the high quality of its properties
and operations. The Company periodically and selectively sells assets to ensure that its portfolio consists primarily of high quality, well-located
properties within its market area.

DIVERSIFIED MARKET
FOCUS

.    The Company believes the stability of its cash flow is enhanced and it will generate higher risk adjusted cash flow
returns, with lower volatility, through its diversified strategy of investments over large, middle and small-tier markets throughout the southeastern
United States.

INTENSIVE MANAGEMENT
FOCUS

.    The Company strongly emphasizes on-site property management. Particular attention is paid to opportunities to
increase rents, raise average occupancy rates, and control costs. Property managers, area managers and regional managers are given the responsibility
for monitoring market trends and the discretion to react to such trends. The Company, as part of its intense management focus, has established a number
of training programs to produce highly competent property managers, leasing consultants and service technicians who work on-site at the Company’s
apartment communities (the “Communities”) to generate the highest possible income from the Company’s assets. At December 31, 2005, the
Company employed approximately 103 Certified Apartment Managers, a designation established by the National Apartment Association which provides
training for on-site manager professionals. The Company has enhanced its focus on asset management over the last several years by increasing regional
staffing in the areas of maintenance, capital improvement oversight, landscaping, marketing and pricing management.

DECENTRALIZED OPERATIONAL
STRUCTURE

.    The Company operates in a decentralized manner. Management believes that its decentralized operating structure
capitalizes on specific market knowledge, provides greater personal accountability than a centralized structure and is beneficial in the acquisition
and redevelopment processes. To support this decentralized operational structure, senior and executive management, along with various asset management
functions, are proactively involved in supporting and reviewing property management through extensive reporting processes and frequent on-site
visitations. In 2004, the Company completed the installation of the property and accounting modules of a new web-based property management system that
increased the amount of information shared between senior and executive management and the properties on a real time basis, improving the support
provided to on-site property operations. In 2005, the Company made significant improvements to its operating platform and expects these enhancements
will help capture more operating efficiencies, continue to support effective expense control and provide for various expanded revenue management
practices.

PROACTIVE BALANCE SHEET AND PORTFOLIO
MANAGEMENT

The Company focuses on improving the
value of each share of the Company’s common stock. It routinely evaluates each asset and sells those that no longer fit its strategy. The Company
makes new investments and issues new equity when management believes it can add to value per share. In the past, the Company has sold assets to fund
share repurchases when, in management’s view, shareholder value would be enhanced.

STRATEGIES

The Company seeks to increase operating
cash flow and earnings per share to maximize shareholder value through a balanced strategy of internal and external growth.

OPERATING GROWTH
STRATEGY

.    Management’s goal is to maximize the Company’s return on investment in each Community by increasing
rental rates and reducing operating expenses while maintaining high occupancy levels. The steps taken to meet these objectives
include:


•

providing real-time information through technology innovations;
such as the implementation of the Company’s new web-based property management system that shares information between properties and
management;

•

empowering the Company’s property managers to adjust rents
in response to local market conditions and to concentrate resident turnover during peak rental demand months;

•

developing new ancillary income programs aimed at offering new
services to residents, including telephone, cable, and internet access, on which the Company generates fee and commission income;

•

implementing programs to control expenses through investment in
cost-saving initiatives, such as the installation of individual apartment unit water and utility meters in certain Communities;

•

analyzing individual asset productivity performances to identify
best practices and improvement areas;

•

proactively maintaining the physical condition of each
property;

•

improving the “curb appeal” of the Communities through
extensive landscaping and exterior improvements and repositioning Communities from time to time to maintain market leadership positions;

•

compensating employees through performance-based compensation
and stock ownership programs;

•

maintaining a hands-on management style and “flat”
organizational structure that emphasizes senior management’s continued close contact with the market and employees;

•

selling or exchanging underperforming assets and repurchasing or
issuing shares of common and preferred stock when cost of capital and asset values permit;

•

aggressively managing lease expirations to align with peak
leasing traffic patterns and to maximize productivity of property staffing; and

•

allocating additional capital, including capital for selective
interior improvements, where the investment will generate the highest returns for the Company.

JOINT VENTURE
STRATEGY

.    One of the Company’s strategies is to co-invest with private capital partners in joint venture opportunities
from time to time to the extent the Company believes that a joint venture will enable it to obtain a higher return on its investment through management
and other fees, which leverage the Company’s skills in acquiring, repositioning, redeveloping and managing multifamily investments. In addition,
the joint venture investment strategy can provide a platform for creating more capital diversification and lower investment risk for the Company. The
Company is currently invested in a joint venture with Crow Holdings that was established in early 2004.

DISPOSITION
STRATEGY

.    The Company from time to time disposes of mature assets, defined as those apartment communities that no longer
meet the Company’s investment criteria and long-term strategic objectives. Typically, the Company selects assets for disposition that do not meet
its present investment criteria including estimated future return on investment, location, market, potential for growth, and capital needs. The Company
may from time to time also dispose of assets for which the Company receives an offer meeting or exceeding its return on investment criteria even though
those assets may not meet the disposition criteria disclosed above.

ACQUISITION
STRATEGY

. One of the Company’s growth strategies is to acquire and redevelop apartment communities that meet its investment criteria and focus
as discussed above. The Company has extensive experience and research-based skills in the acquisition and repositioning of multifamily properties. In
addition, the Company will acquire newly built and developed properties that can be purchased on a favorable pricing basis. The Company will continue
to evaluate opportunities that arise, and will utilize this strategy to increase the number of properties in strong and growing markets in the
Southeast.

DEVELOPMENT
STRATEGY

.    In late 1997, the Company’s emphasis shifted from acquisitions to development because of its belief that
under then-current market conditions, such development would generate higher quality assets and higher long-term investment returns. In 1999,
management decided to exit the construction and development business upon completion of the Company’s existing development pipeline after
determining that market conditions were changing, making it unlikely that future proposed projects would meet the Company’s profitability targets
over the next few years. In 2002, the Company completed the $300 million construction program of high quality apartments.

At December 31, 2005, the Company had
no properties in development.

In 2006, the Company plans to begin
some expansion development projects at existing communities on adjacent land currently owned by the Company. The Company does not currently intend to
return to development in a significant way, preferring to capture accretive new growth through opportunistically acquiring new
properties.

COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCK

The Company continuously reviews
opportunities for lowering its cost of capital, and increasing value per share. The Company evaluates opportunities to repurchase stock when it
believes that its stock price is below the value of its assets and accordingly repurchased common stock, funded by asset sales, between 1999 and 2001.
The Company also looks for opportunities where it can acquire or develop communities, selectively funded or partially funded by stock sales, when it
will add to shareholder value and the investment return is projected to substantially exceed its cost of capital. The Company will also
opportunistically seek to lower its cost of capital through refinancing preferred stock as it did in 2003.


On May 26, 2005, the Company gave the
required one-year notice to redeem all of the issued and outstanding 8 5/8% Series G Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock shares on May 26, 2006, at a
total redemption price of $10 million.

SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM

In 1999, the Company’s Board of
Directors approved an increase in the number of shares of the Company’s common stock authorized to be repurchased to 4 million shares. As of
December 31, 2005, the Company had repurchased a total of approximately 1.86 million shares (8% of the shares of common stock and Common Units
outstanding as of the beginning of the repurchase program). From time to time, the Company intends to sell assets based on its disposition strategy
outlined in this Annual Report and use the proceeds to repurchase shares when it believes that shareholder value is enhanced. Factors affecting this
determination include the share price, asset dispositions and pricing, financing agreements and rates of return of alternative investments. No shares
were repurchased from 2002 through 2005 under this plan.

COMPETITION

All of the Company’s Communities
are located in areas that include other apartment communities. Occupancy and rental rates are affected by the number of competitive apartment
communities in a particular area. The owners of competing apartment communities may have greater resources than the Company, and the managers of these
communities may have more experience than the Company’s management. Moreover, single-family rental housing, manufactured housing, condominiums and
the new and existing home markets provide housing alternatives to potential residents of apartment communities.

Apartment communities compete on the
basis of monthly rent, discounts, and facilities offered such as apartment size and amenities, and apartment community amenities, including
recreational facilities, resident services, and physical property condition. The Company makes capital improvements to both the Communities and
individual apartments on a regular basis in order to maintain a competitive position in each individual market.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

As part of the acquisition process, the
Company obtains environmental studies on all of its Communities from various outside environmental engineering firms. The purpose of these studies is
to identify potential sources of contamination at the Communities and to assess the status of environmental regulatory compliance. These studies
generally include historical reviews of the Communities, reviews of certain public records, preliminary investigations of the sites and surrounding
properties, visual inspection for the presence of asbestos, PCBs and underground storage tanks and the preparation and issuance of written reports.
Depending on the results of these studies, more invasive procedures, such as soil sampling or ground water analysis, will be performed to investigate
potential sources of contamination. These studies must be satisfactorily completed before the Company takes ownership of an acquisition property,
however, no assurance can be given that the studies identify all significant environmental problems.

Under various Federal, state and local
laws and regulations, an owner or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic
substances on properties. Such laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner caused or knew of the presence of hazardous or
toxic substances and whether or not the storage of such substances was in violation of a resident’s lease. Furthermore, the cost of remediation
and removal of such substances may be substantial, and the presence of such substances, or the failure to promptly remediate such substances, may
adversely affect the owner’s ability to sell such real estate or to borrow using such real estate as collateral.

The Company is aware of environmental
concerns specifically relating to potential issues resulting from mold in residential properties and has in place an active management and preventive
maintenance program that includes procedures specifically related to mold. The Company has established a policy requiring residents to sign a mold
addendum to lease. The Company has also purchased a $2 million insurance policy that covers remediation and exposure to mold. The current policy
expires in 2007 but is renewable at that time. The Company, therefore, believes that its exposure to this issue is limited and
controlled.


The environmental studies received by
the Company have not revealed any material environmental liabilities. The Company is not aware of any existing conditions that would currently be
considered an environmental liability. Nevertheless, it is possible that the studies do not reveal all environmental liabilities or that there are
material environmental liabilities of which the Company is unaware. Moreover, no assurance can be given concerning future laws, ordinances or
regulations, or the potential introduction of hazardous or toxic substances by neighboring properties or residents.

The Company believes that its
Communities are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable Federal, state and local ordinances and regulations regarding hazardous or
toxic substances and other environmental matters.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

DISTRIBUTION

.    In January 2006, the Company announced a quarterly distribution to common shareholders of $0.595
per share, which was paid on January 31, 2006.

In February 2006, the Company announced
a monthly distribution to its Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock shareholders of $0.1927 per share, which is payable on March 15,
2006.

ACQUISITIONS.

On January 19, 2006, the Company acquired the Preserve at Brier Creek apartments in Raleigh, NC
with 250 units.

ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS

The Company’s ability to generate
sufficient cash flow in order to pay common dividends to its shareholders depends on its ability to generate funds from operations in excess of capital
expenditure requirements and preferred dividends, and/or to have access to the markets for debt and equity financing. Funds from operations and the
value of the Company’s properties may be insufficient because of factors which are beyond the Company’s control. Such events or conditions
could include:

•

competition from other apartment communities;

•

overbuilding of new apartment units or oversupply of available
apartment units in the Company’s markets, which might adversely affect apartment occupancy or rental rates and/or require rent concessions in
order to lease apartment units;

•

increases in operating costs (including real estate taxes and
insurance premiums) due to inflation and other factors, which may not be offset by increased rents;

•

the Company’s inability to rent apartments on favorable
economic terms;

•

changes in governmental regulations and the related costs of
compliance;

•

changes in tax laws and housing laws including the enactment of
rent control laws or other laws regulating multifamily housing;

•

changes in interest rate levels and the availability of
financing, which could lead renters to purchase homes (if interest rates decrease and home loans are more readily available) or increase the
Company’s acquisition and operating costs (if interest rates increase and financing is less readily available);

•

weakness in the overall economy which lowers job growth and the
associated demand for apartment housing; and

•

the relative illiquidity of real estate investments.

At times, the Company relies on
external funding sources to fully fund the payment of distributions to shareholders and its capital investment program (including its existing property
expansion developments). While the Company has sufficient liquidity to permit distributions at current rates through additional borrowings if
necessary, any significant and sustained deterioration in operations could result in the Company’s financial resources being insufficient to pay
distributions to shareholders at the current rate, in which event the Company would be required to reduce the distribution rate. Any decline in the
Company’s


funds from operations could
adversely affect the Company’s ability to make distributions to its shareholders or to meet its loan covenants and could have a material adverse
effect on the Company’s stock price.

Debt Level, Refinancing and Loan Covenant Risk May Adversely
Affect Financial Condition and Operating Results

At December 31, 2005, the Company had
total debt outstanding of $1.14 billion. Payments of principal and interest on borrowings may leave the Company with insufficient cash resources to
operate the Communities or pay distributions that are required to be paid in order for the Company to maintain its qualification as a REIT. The Company
currently intends to limit its total debt to approximately 60% of the undepreciated book value of its assets, although the Company’s charter and
bylaws do not limit its debt levels. Circumstances may cause the Company to exceed that target from time to time. As of December 31, 2005, the
Company’s ratio of debt to undepreciated book value was approximately 56%. The Company’s Board of Directors can modify this policy at any
time which could allow the Company to become more highly leveraged and decrease its ability to make distributions to its shareholders. In addition, the
Company must repay its debt upon maturity, and the inability to access debt or equity capital at attractive rates could adversely affect the
Company’s financial condition and/or its funds from operations. The Company relies on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (the “Agencies”) for
the majority of its debt financing and has agreements with the Agencies and with other lenders that require it to comply with certain covenants. The
breach of any one of these covenants would place the Company in default with its lenders and may have serious consequences on the operations of the
Company.

Variable Interest Rates May Adversely Affect Funds from
Operations

At December 31, 2005, effectively $173
million of the Company’s debt bore interest at a variable rate and was not hedged by interest rate swaps or caps. An additional $25 million also
bore interest at a variable rate at December 31, 2005, but was hedged by an interest rate swap that became operative in February 2006. The Company may
incur additional debt in the future that also bears interest at variable rates. Variable rate debt creates higher debt service requirements if market
interest rates increase, which would adversely affect the Company’s funds from operations and the amounts available to pay distributions to
shareholders. The Company’s $950 million secured credit facilities with Prudential Mortgage Capital, credit enhanced by Fannie Mae, are
predominately floating rate facilities. The Company also has a $100 million credit facility with Freddie Mac which is a variable rate facility. At
December 31, 2005, a total of $907.8 million was outstanding under these facilities. These facilities represent the majority of the variable interest
rates the Company was exposed to at December 31, 2005. Large portions of the interest rates on these facilities have been hedged by means of a number
of interest rate swaps and caps. Upon the termination of these swaps and caps, the Company will be exposed to the risks of varying interest
rates.

Issuances of Additional Debt or Equity May Adversely Impact
Our Financial Condition

Our capital requirements depend on
numerous factors, including the occupancy rates of our apartment properties, dividend payment rates to our shareholders, development and capital
expenditures, costs of operations and potential acquisitions. The Company cannot accurately predict the timing and amount of our capital requirements.
If our capital requirements vary materially from our plans, the Company may require additional financing sooner than anticipated. Accordingly, the
Company could become more leveraged, resulting in increased risk of default on our obligations and in an increase in our debt service requirements,
both of which could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to access debt and equity capital markets in the future.

Increasing Real Estate Taxes and Insurance Costs May
Negatively Impact Financial Condition

Because the Company has substantial
real estate holdings, the cost of real estate taxes and insuring its Communities is a significant component of expense. Real estate taxes and insurance
premiums are subject to significant increases and fluctuations which can be widely outside of the control of the Company. If the costs associated with
real estate taxes and insurance should rise, the Company’s financial condition could be negatively impacted and the Company’s ability to pay
its dividend could be affected.


Losses from Catastrophes May Exceed Our Insurance
Coverage

The Company carries comprehensive
liability and property insurance on our properties, which the Company believes is of the type and amount customarily obtained on real property assets.
The Company intends to obtain similar coverage for properties the Company acquires in the future. However, some losses, generally of a catastrophic
nature, such as losses from floods, hurricanes or earthquakes, may be subject to limitations. The Company exercises its discretion in determining
amounts, coverage limits and deductibility provisions of insurance, with a view to maintaining appropriate insurance on our investments at a reasonable
cost and on suitable terms. If the Company suffers a substantial loss, its insurance coverage may not be sufficient to pay the full current market
value or current replacement value of our lost investment. Inflation, changes in building codes and ordinances, environmental considerations and other
factors also might make it infeasible to use insurance proceeds to replace a property after it has been damaged or destroyed.

New Acquisitions May Fail to Perform as Expected and Failure
to Integrate Acquired Communities and New Personnel Could Create Inefficiencies

The Company intends to actively acquire
and improve multifamily properties for rental operations. The Company may underestimate the costs necessary to bring an acquired property up to
standards established for its intended market position. Additionally, to grow successfully, the Company must be able to apply our experience in
managing our existing portfolio of apartment communities to a larger number of properties. The Company must also be able to integrate new management
and operations personnel as our organization grows in size and complexity. Failures in either area will result in inefficiencies that could adversely
affect our overall profitability.

The Company May Not Be Able To Sell Properties When
Appropriate

Real estate investments are relatively
illiquid and generally cannot be sold quickly. The Company may not be able to change our portfolio promptly in response to economic or other
conditions. This inability to respond promptly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our financial condition and
ability to make distributions to our security holders.

Failure to Qualify as a REIT Would Cause The Company to be
Taxed as a Corporation

If the Company fails to qualify as a
REIT for federal income tax purposes, the Company will be taxed as a corporation. The Internal Revenue Service may challenge our qualification as a
REIT for prior years, and new legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions may change the tax laws with respect to
qualification as a REIT or the federal tax consequences of such qualification. For any taxable year that the Company fails to qualify as a REIT, the
Company would be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at corporate rates, plus any applicable alternative minimum tax. In addition,
unless entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions, the Company would be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years
following the year during which qualification is lost. This treatment would reduce our net earnings available for investment or distribution to
shareholders because of the additional tax liability for the year or years involved. In addition, distributions would no longer qualify for the
dividends paid deduction nor be required to be made in order to preserve REIT status. The Company might be required to borrow funds or to liquidate
some of our investments to pay any applicable tax resulting from our failure to qualify as a REIT.

Environmental Problems are Possible and can be
Costly

Federal, state and local laws and
regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require a current or previous owner or operator of real estate to investigate and clean
up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at such property. The owner or operator may have to pay a governmental entity or third
parties for property damage and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred by such parties in connection with the contamination. These laws
typically impose clean-up responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the
contaminants. Even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination each person covered by the environmental laws may be held
responsible for all of the clean-up costs incurred. In addition, third parties may sue the


owner or operator of a site for
damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from that site. All of our properties have been the subject of environmental
assessments completed by qualified independent environmental consultant companies. These environmental assessments have not revealed, nor is the
Company aware of, any environmental liability that our management believes would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations,
financial condition or liquidity. Over the past four years, there have been an increasing number of lawsuits against owners and managers of multifamily
properties alleging personal injury and property damage caused by the presence of mold in residential real estate. Some of these lawsuits have resulted
in substantial monetary judgments or settlements. The Company cannot be assured that existing environmental assessments of our properties reveal all
environmental liabilities, that any prior owner of any of our properties did not create a material environmental condition not known to the Company, or
that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist.

Compliance or Failure to Comply with Laws Requiring Access to
Our Properties by Disabled Persons Could Result in Substantial Cost

The Americans with Disabilities Act,
the Fair Housing Act of 1988 and other federal, state and local laws generally require that public accommodations be made accessible to disabled
persons. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines by the government or the award of damages to private litigants. These laws may require
the Company to modify our existing properties. These laws may also restrict renovations by requiring improved access to such buildings by disabled
persons or may require the Company to add other structural features that increase our construction costs. Legislation or regulations adopted in the
future may impose further burdens or restrictions on the Company with respect to improved access by disabled persons. The Company cannot ascertain the
costs of compliance with these laws, which may be substantial.

Our Investments in Joint Ventures May Involve
Risks

Investments in joint ventures may
involve risks which may not otherwise be present in our direct investments such as:

•

the potential inability of our joint venture partner to
perform;

•

the joint venture partner may have economic or business
interests or goals which are inconsistent with or adverse to ours;

•

the joint venture partner may take actions contrary to our
requests or instructions or contrary to our objectives or policies; and

•

the joint venturers may not be able to agree on matters relating
to the property they jointly own.

Although each joint owner will have a
right of first refusal to purchase the other owner’s interest, in the event a sale is desired, the joint owner may not have sufficient resources
to exercise such right of first refusal.

ITEM 1B.  UNRESOLVED STAFF
COMMENTS

None.

rents.

The Company’s quarterly dividend
rate is currently $0.595 per common share. The Board of Directors reviews and declares the dividend rate quarterly. Actual dividends made by the
Company will be affected by a number of factors, including the gross revenues received from the Communities, the operating expenses of the Company, the
interest expense incurred on borrowings and unanticipated capital expenditures.

The Company currently pays a
preferential regular distribution on the Series F stock, Series G stock and Series H stock at annual rates of $2.3125, $2.15625 and $2.075 per share,
respectively. No distribution may be made on the Company’s common stock unless all accrued distributions have been made with respect to each
series of the Company’s preferred stock. No assurance can be given that the Company will be able to maintain its distribution rate on its common
stock or make required distributions with respect to the Series F, Series G and Series H preferred stock.

The Company expects to make future
quarterly distributions to shareholders; however, future distributions by the Company will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will
depend on the actual funds from operations of the Company, its financial condition, capital requirements, the annual distribution requirements under
the REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and such other factors as the Board of Directors deems relevant.


The Company has established the Direct
Stock Purchase and Distribution Reinvestment Plan (the “DRSPP”) under which holders of common stock, preferred stock and limited partnership
interests in Mid-America Apartments, L.P. can elect automatically to reinvest their distributions in additional shares of common stock. The plan also
allows for the optional purchase of common stock of at least $250, but not more than $5,000 in any given month, free of brokerage commissions and
charges. The Company, in its absolute discretion, may grant waivers to allow for optional cash payments in excess of $5,000. To fulfill its obligations
under the DRSPP, the Company may either issue additional shares of common stock or repurchase common stock in the open market. The Company may elect to
sell shares under the DRSPP at up to a 5% discount.

In 2004, the Company issued a total of
413,598 shares through its DRSPP and offered a 2% discount for optional cash purchases in the months of August through December. Throughout 2005, the
Company issued a total of 803,251 shares through its DRSPP and offered an average 1.5% discount for optional cash purchases.

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS

This and other sections of this Annual
Report contain certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which are intended to be covered by the safe harbors created thereby. These statements include, but are
not limited to, statements about anticipated market conditions, expected growth rates of revenues and expenses, planned asset dispositions, disposition
pricing, planned acquisitions and developments, property financings, expected interest rates and planned capital expenditures. Although the Company
believes that the assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements are reasonable, any of the assumptions could be inaccurate and, therefore,
there can be no assurance that the forward-looking statements included in this report on Form 10-K will prove to be accurate. In light of the
significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements included herein, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a
representation by the Company or any other person that the objectives and plans of the Company will be achieved.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND
ESTIMATES

The following discussion and analysis
of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company’s consolidated financial statements, and the notes thereto, which have
been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the
Company to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. On an
ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances. The
Company believes that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable in the circumstances; however, actual results may differ from these estimates and
assumptions.

The Company believes that the estimates
and assumptions that are most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations, in that they require the most subjective
judgments, form the basis of accounting policies deemed to be most critical. These critical accounting policies include revenue recognition,
capitalization of expenditures and depreciation of assets, impairment of long-lived assets, including goodwill, and fair value of derivative financial
instruments.

Revenue Recognition

The Company leases multifamily
residential apartments under operating leases primarily with terms of one year or less. Rental revenues are recognized using a method that represents a
straight-line basis over the term of the lease and other revenues are recorded when earned.

The Company records all gains and
losses on real estate in accordance with Statement No. 66 “Accounting for Sales of Real Estate”.

Capitalization of expenditures and depreciation of
assets

The Company carries its real estate
assets at their depreciated cost. Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which range
from 8 to 40 years for land improvements and buildings, 5 years for furniture, fixtures, and equipment, and 3 to 5 years for computers and software,
all of which are subjective determinations. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred while significant improvements, renovations, and
replacements are capitalized. The cost to complete any deferred repairs and maintenance at properties acquired by the Company in order to elevate the
condition of the property to the Company’s standards are capitalized as incurred.

Impairment of long-lived assets, including
goodwill

The Company accounts for long-lived
assets in accordance with the provisions of Statement No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

(“Statement
144”) and evaluates its goodwill


for impairment
under Statement No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

(“Statement 142”). The Company evaluates its goodwill for impairment on
an annual basis in the Company’s fiscal fourth quarter, or sooner if a goodwill impairment indicator is identified. The Company periodically
evaluates its long-lived assets, including its investments in real estate and goodwill, for indicators that would suggest that the carrying amount of
the assets may not be recoverable. The judgments regarding the existence of such indicators are based on factors such as operating performance, market
conditions, and legal factors.

In accordance with
Statement 144, long-lived assets, such as real estate assets, equipment, and purchased intangibles subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held
and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the
asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the
carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Assets to be disposed of are separately presented in the balance sheet and reported
at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and are no longer depreciated. The assets and liabilities of a disposed group
classified as held for sale are presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet.

Goodwill is tested
annually for impairment, and is tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. An
impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset’s fair value. This determination is made at the reporting
unit level and consists of two steps. First, the Company determines the fair value of a reporting unit and compares it to its carrying amount. In the
apartment industry, the primary method used for determining fair value is to divide annual operating cash flows by an appropriate capitalization rate.
The Company determines the appropriate capitalization rate by reviewing the prevailing rates in a property’s market or submarket. Second, if the
carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting
unit’s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the
reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation, in accordance with Statement No. 141,

Business Combinations

. The residual
fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill.

Fair value of derivative financial
instruments

The Company utilizes certain derivative
financial instruments, primarily interest rate swaps and caps, during the normal course of business to manage, or hedge, the interest rate risk
associated with the Company’s variable rate debt or as hedges in anticipation of future debt transactions to manage well-defined interest rate
risk associated with the transaction. The valuation of the derivative financial instruments under Statement No. 133 as amended requires the Company to
make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments.

In order for a derivative contract to
be designated as a hedging instrument, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item must be highly effective. While the
Company’s calculation of hedge effectiveness contains some subjective determinations, the historical correlation of the cash flows of the hedging
instruments and the underlying hedged item are measured by the Company before entering into the hedging relationship and have been found to be highly
correlated.

The Company performs ineffectiveness
tests using the change in the variable cash flows method at the inception of the hedge and for each reporting period thereafter, through the term of
the hedging instruments. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded in earnings. The change in fair value of the interest rate swaps and
caps designated as cash flow hedges are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income in the statement of shareholders’
equity.

OVERVIEW OF THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,

The Company’s results for 2005
were positively influenced by both the improvement in operational results of communities held throughout both the current and prior period (“same
store”) and the positive impact from acquisitions in 2004 and 2005.


The Company’s 2005 same store
operating results were helped by signs of economic recovery in the Company’s geographic areas of operation. Same store occupancy and average
rental rates were both improved from the prior year.

The Company grew externally during 2004
by following its acquisition strategy to invest in large and mid-sized growing markets in the southeastern United States. The Company acquired six
properties in 2004 for which it benefited from a full year of revenues in 2005. The Company acquired an additional three properties in
2005.

The Company sold one property in 2005.
A joint venture the Company was invested in with Crow Holdings sold two properties in 2005 resulting in the winding up of the joint venture and
generating approximately $3 million in gains and $1.7 million related to a one-time incentive fee for the Company.

The Company did experience an increase
in interest expense in 2005 as its total debt outstanding and average borrowing costs both increased from prior year levels.

The following is a discussion of the
consolidated financial condition and results of operations of the Company for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003. This discussion should
be read in conjunction with all of the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

As of December 31, 2005, the total
number of apartment units the Company owned or had an ownership interest in, including the properties owned by the Crow JV was 38,227 in 132
Communities compared to the 37,904 apartment units in 132 Communities owned at December 31, 2004, and the 35,734 apartment units in 127 Communities
owned at December 31, 2003. For properties owned 100% by the Company, the average monthly rental per apartment unit, excluding units in lease-up,
increased to $695 at December 31, 2005, from $680 at December 31, 2004, and $667 at December 31, 2003. For these same units, overall occupancy at
December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003 was 94.6%, 93.6%, and 92.7%, respectively.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

COMPARISON OF THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005, TO THE YEAR
ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004

Property revenues for the year ended
December 31, 2005, increased by approximately $29,928,000 from the year ended December 31, 2004, due to (i) a $12,816,000 increase in property revenues
from the six properties acquired in 2004 (the “2004 Acquisitions”), (ii) a $8,934,000 increase in property revenues from the properties held
throughout both periods, and (iii) a $8,178,000 increase in property revenues from the three properties acquired in 2005 (the “2005
Acquisitions”).

Property operating expenses include
costs for property personnel, building repairs and maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance, utilities, landscaping and other property related
costs. Property operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2005, increased by approximately $10,968,000 from the year ended December 31, 2004,
due primarily to increases of property operating expenses of (i) $5,356,000 from the 2004 Acquisitions, (ii) $3,336,000 from the 2005 Acquisitions, and
(iii) $2,276,000 from the properties held throughout both periods.

Depreciation expense increased by
approximately $6,397,000 primarily due to the increases of depreciation expense of (i) $4,217,000 from the 2004 Acquisitions, (ii) $3,954,000 from the
2005 Acquisitions, and (iii) $1,424,000 from the communities held throughout both periods. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in
depreciation expense of $3,198,000 from the expiration of the amortization of fair market value of leases of 13 communities acquired by the Company in
2003.

Property management expenses increased
by approximately $1,514,000 from the year ended December 31, 2004, to the year ended December 31, 2005, partially due to increased personnel expenses
and incentive compensation both related to property acquisitions. General and administrative expenses increased by approximately $1,114,000 over this
same period. Property management expenses and general and administrative expenses for 2005 were both impacted by a cumulative charge to amortize four
years of a ten year senior management incentive plan which the Company previously expected would expense from 2007 through 2011.

Interest expense increased
approximately $7,893,000 in 2005 from 2004 due primarily to the increase in the amount of debt outstanding from 2004 and the increase in the
Company’s average borrowing cost from 5.0% over the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, to 5.3% over the twelve months ended December 31,
2005.


For the year ended December 31, 2005,
the Company recorded total gains of approximately $3,034,000 from the sale of two properties owned by a joint venture of the Company. The sales of
these properties resulted in an additional incentive fee being paid to the Company of approximately $1,723,000 in 2005. For the year ended December 31,
2004, the Company recorded a total of approximately $9,074,000 in gains from two property sales, of which approximately $3,249,000 represented the
Company’s share of the gain from the sale of a property which was owned by a joint venture of the Company.

In 2005 and 2004, the Company
refinanced the debt on several of its communities primarily to take advantage of the lower interest rate environment. In 2005, this resulted in a loss
on debt extinguishment of approximately $409,000 due to the write-off of deferred financing costs and prepayment penalties. In 2004, the Company
recorded a gain of approximately $1,095,000 related to the early extinguishment of debt.

For the years ended December 31, 2005,
and 2004, the Company recorded net gains on insurance and other settlement proceeds totaling approximately $749,000 mainly related to insurance
settlements from hurricane damage experienced at some of the Company’s Communities and $2,683,000 mainly related to insurance settlements from
fires at some of the Company’s Communities, respectively.

Primarily as a result of the foregoing,
net income decreased by approximately $5,454,000 in 2005 over 2004.

COMPARISON OF THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004, TO THE YEAR
ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003

Comparisons of income from property
operations for the years ended December 31, 2004, and 2003, were impacted by various factors. As a result of the buyout in August of 2003 of the
partnership interest in Bre/Maac Associates, LLC, (the “BreMaac Buyout”), the Company’s joint venture with Blackstone Real Estate
Advisors (“Blackstone”), the Company’s consolidated financial statements for 2003 include the impact of approximately only four months
of operations of the 10 properties which were previously owned by the joint venture and accounted for using the equity method. The Company’s
consolidated financial statements for 2004 include a full twelve months of operations for these 10 properties. The Company’s consolidated
financial statements for 2003 also included only partial year results for the four properties acquired during 2003 (one of which was subsequently
transferred to Mid-America CH/Realty, LP, the Company’s joint venture with Crow Holdings (the “Green Oaks Transfer”)). The Company also
acquired an additional six properties during the course of 2004. During 2003, the Company had two development communities which completed lease-up.
Finally, the Company’s performance during 2004 and 2003 was impacted by changes in performance of the communities that were held throughout both
periods.

Property revenues for the year ended
December 31, 2004, increased by approximately $31,262,000 from the year ended December 31, 2003, due to (i) a $12,481,000 increase in property revenues
from the BreMaac Buyout, (ii) a $7,759,000 increase in property revenues from 2004 Acquisitions, (iii) a $7,372,000 increase in property revenues from
the acquisitions of the Los Rios Park, Lighthouse Court and Legacy Pines communities in 2003 (the “2003 Acquisitions”), (iv) a $4,062,000
increase in property revenues from the communities held throughout both periods, and (v) a $189,000 increase in property revenues from the communities
in lease-up in 2003 (the “Communities in Lease-up”). These increases were partially offset by a decrease in property revenues of $601,000 due
to the Green Oaks Transfer.

Property operating expenses include
costs for property personnel, building repairs and maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance, utilities, landscaping and other property related
costs. Property operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2004, increased by approximately $14,056,000 from the year ended December 31, 2003,
due primarily to increases of property operating expenses of (i) $6,008,000 from the BreMaac Buyout, (ii) $3,966,000 from the 2003 Acquisitions, (iii)
$3,307,000 from the 2004 Acquisitions, (iv) $593,000 from the communities held throughout both periods, (v) $514,000 from expenses related to the
extraordinary hurricane season in 2004, and (vi) $27,000 from the Communities in Lease-up. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in
property operating expenses of $359,000 from the Green Oaks Transfer.

Depreciation expense increased by
approximately $10,579,000 primarily due to the increases of depreciation expense of (i) $3,659,000 from the 2003 Acquisitions, (ii) $3,362,000 from the
2004 Acquisitions, (iii) $2,781,000 from the BreMaac Buyout, and (iv) $802,000 from the communities held


throughout both periods. These
increases were partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense of $25,000 from the Communities in Lease-up.

Property management expenses increased
by approximately $1,922,000 from the year ended December 31, 2003, to the year ended December 31, 2004, partially due to increased personnel expenses
and incentive compensation related to property acquisitions. General and administrative expenses increased by approximately $2,005,000 over this same
period partially related to expenses associated with the implementation of new property management software and expenses resulting from new regulatory
requirements.

Interest expense increased
approximately $5,867,000 from 2003 due primarily to the increase in the amount of debt outstanding from 2003. The Company’s average borrowing cost
at December 31, 2004, and 2003, was 5.4%.

For the year ended December 31, 2004,
the Company recorded a total of approximately $9,074,000 in gains from two property sales, of which approximately $3,249,000 represented the
Company’s share of the gain from the sale of a property which was owned by one of the Company’s joint ventures. In 2003, the Company sold one
property and recorded a gain of approximately $1,919,000.

In 2004, and 2003, the Company
refinanced the debt on several of its communities primarily to take advantage of the lower interest rate environment. This resulted in gains of
approximately $1,095,000 and $111,000 related to the early extinguishment of debt in 2004 and 2003, respectively.

For the years ended December 31, 2004,
and 2003, the Company recorded net gains on insurance and other settlement proceeds totaling approximately $2,683,000, mainly related to insurance
settlements from fires at some of the Company’s Communities, and approximately $2,860,000, mainly related to insurance settlements from the fire
at the Company’s headquarters in March 2002, respectively.

Primarily as a result of the foregoing,
net income increased by $4,992,000 in 2004 over 2003.

FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS

Funds from operations (“FFO”)
represents net income (computed in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or “GAAP”) excluding extraordinary items,
minority interest in Operating Partnership income, gain on disposition of real estate assets, plus depreciation of real estate, and adjustments for
joint ventures to reflect FFO on the same basis. This definition of FFO is in accordance with the National Association of Real Estate Investment
Trust’s (“NAREIT”) definition. Disposition of real estate assets includes sales of discontinued operations as well as proceeds received
from insurance and other settlements from property damage.

In response to the Securities and
Exchange Commission’s Staff Policy Statement relating to EITF Topic D-42 concerning the calculation of earnings per share for the redemption of
preferred stock, the Company has included the amount charged to retire preferred stock in excess of carrying values in its FFO
calculation.

The Company’s policy is to expense
the cost of interior painting, vinyl flooring, and blinds as incurred for stabilized properties. During the stabilization period for acquisition
properties, these items are capitalized as part of the total repositioning program of newly acquired properties, and, thus are not deducted in
calculating FFO.

FFO should not be considered as an
alternative to net income or any other GAAP measurement of performance, as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow from
operating, investing, and financing activities as a measure of liquidity. The Company believes that FFO is helpful to investors in understanding the
Company’s operating performance in that such calculation excludes depreciation expense on real estate assets. The Company believes that GAAP
historical cost depreciation of real estate assets is generally not correlated with changes in the value of those assets, whose value does not diminish
predictably over time, as historical cost depreciation implies. The Company’s calculation of FFO may differ from the methodology for calculating
FFO utilized by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs.


The following table is a reconciliation
of FFO to net income for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003 (dollars and shares in thousands):

FFO increased during
2005 by approximately $7,389,000 to $77,414,000 versus $70,025,000 in 2004 principally because of improved operation results both from the
Company’s same store portfolio and the addition of properties from the 2004 Acquisitions and 2005 Acquisitions as previously reviewed in the net
income discussion above. FFO increased during 2004 by approximately $14,658,000 to $70,025,000 versus $55,367,000 in 2003 principally because of the
addition of properties through the BreMaac Buyout and 2003 Acquisitions and 2004 Acquisitions as previously reviewed in the net income discussion
above. FFO for 2003 included a charge of $5,987,000 for premiums and original issuance costs associated with the redemption of preferred
stock.

TRENDS

Property performance over the past four
years has been pressured by an imbalance between supply and demand for apartment units in many of the Company’s markets, but has begun to show
signs of improvement.

The Company believes that demand by
apartment renters is most impacted by household formation, which is driven by job formation. Job formation has been quite weak in many of the
Company’s markets, and most noticeably in the larger metro areas, such as Atlanta, Houston and Dallas. Some of the smaller and mid-size markets in
which the Company operates, such as Jackson, Mississippi, Jacksonville, Florida, and Columbus, Georgia have been less impacted.

On the supply side, low interest rates
encouraged over-building of apartments, especially in the larger metropolitan areas. Delivery of new apartment units during this period of weakened
apartment demand increased competition, reducing apartment occupancy levels, especially in the larger markets. In addition, single-family homes, which
are direct competition for apartments, became even more affordable, and home ownership continued to climb in the Company’s
markets.

In 2005, the Company began to see a
turn in many of its markets, particularly in Florida and Georgia, where there are some signs of improving demand coupled with a slight slow down in
supply. The Company’s large-tier markets, which have been under the most pressure during the economic downturn, are beginning to show signs of
absorbing the oversupply of new apartments and returning to historical occupancy and pricing levels, while the Company’s smaller tier and
mid-sized markets are benefiting from improving market fundamentals which support continued stable growth. The policies of the Federal Reserve, which
has raised short-term interest rates by 300 basis points in a short span of time, also seem to be having some early impact


on the supply of new apartments.
Development costs of apartments and of single-family homes also appear to be rising, as are mortgage interest rates, with the likelihood that this may
slightly alleviate this competition.

The Company believes that the impact of
higher demand from apartment renters, a reduced rate of increase in supply, and reduced competition from single-family homes will contribute to better
operating results in 2006. While rising interest rates will also increase the Company’s cost of borrowing, the Company has mitigated part of the
impact of this by putting in place $25 million of forward swap, such that the interest rate on approximately 87% of its debt has been fixed, swapped,
forward swapped, or capped, compared to 81% at the end of 2004.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Net cash flow provided by operating
activities increased by approximately $11,458,000 to $99,687,000 for 2005 compared to $88,229,000 for 2004 mainly related to the growth of the Company
through acquisitions and improved operating results in 2005. Net cash flow provided by operating activities increased by approximately $11,709,000 to
$88,229,000 for 2004 compared to $76,520,000 for 2003 mainly related to the growth of the Company through the BreMaac Buyout and the 2003 Acquisitions
and 2004 Acquisitions.

Net cash used in investing activities
decreased by approximately $60,031,000 from $168,383,000 in 2004 to $108,352,000 in 2005. Net cash used in investing activities in 2003 was
approximately $139,555,000. A total of approximately $105,643,000 was invested in 2005 to acquire properties, this compares to approximately
$155,088,000 in 2004, and $138,688,000 in 2003. Capital improvements to existing real estate assets during 2005, 2004 and 2003 totaled approximately
$27,301,000, $30,413,000 and $22,832,000, respectively.

Net cash provided by financing
activities decreased approximately $66,896,000 to $13,596,000 in 2005 from $80,492,000 in 2004 and $61,680,000 in 2003. Cash provided from credit lines
and notes payable decreased approximately $223,851,000 from approximately $280,930,000 in 2004 to $57,079,000 in 2005. Cash provided from credit lines
and notes payable was approximately $245,897,000 in 2003. Principal payments on notes payable dropped to approximately $10,921,000 in 2005 from
$152,046,000 in 2004 and $175,852,000 in 2003 as the Company had fewer refinancings in 2005. Proceeds from issuances of common shares and units
increased in 2005 to approximately $39,459,000 mainly related to the Company’s use of its DRSPP. Proceeds from issuances of common shares and
units decreased approximately $34,628,000 from 2003 to 2004 as the Company sold 1,765,000 shares of common stock to certain advisory clients of Cohen
& Steers Capital Management, Inc. and to Scudder RREEF Real Estate Fund II, Inc. in 2003 to partially fund the BreMaac Buyout and 2003
Acquisitions.

The weighted average interest rate at
December 31, 2005, for the $1.14 billion of debt outstanding was 5.4% compared to 5.4% on $1.08 billion of debt outstanding at December 31, 2004. The
Company utilizes both conventional and tax exempt debt to help finance its activities. Borrowings are made through individual property mortgages and
secured credit facilities. The Company utilizes fixed rate borrowings, interest rate swaps and interest rate caps to manage its current and future
interest rate risk. More details on the Company’s borrowings can be found in the schedule on page 28.

At December 31, 2005, the Company had
secured credit facilities relationships with Prudential Mortgage Capital which are credit enhanced by the Federal National Mortgage Association
(“FNMA”), FNMA, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“Freddie MAC”), and a group of banks led by AmSouth Bank. Together, these
credit facilities provided a total borrowing capacity of $1.1 billion at December 31, 2005, with an availability to borrow of $1.0 billion. At December
31, 2005, the Company had total borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities of $920 million.

Approximately 71% of the Company’s
outstanding obligations at December 31, 2005, were borrowed through facilities with/or credit enhanced by FNMA (the “FNMA Facilities”). The
FNMA Facilities have a combined line limit of $950 million, $881 million of which was available to borrow at December 31, 2005. Various traunches of
the facilities mature from 2010 through 2014. The FNMA Facilities provide for both fixed and variable rate borrowings. The interest rate on the
majority of the variable portion renews every 90 days and is based on the FNMA Discount Mortgage Backed Security (“DMBS”) rate on the date of
renewal,


which has typically approximated
three-month LIBOR less an average spread of 0.04% over the life of the FNMA Facilities, plus a credit enhancement fee of 0.62% to
0.795%.

Each of the Company’s secured
credit facilities is subject to various covenants and conditions on usage, and are subject to periodic re-evaluation of collateral. If the Company were
to fail to satisfy a condition to borrowing, the available credit under one or more of the facilities could not be drawn, which could adversely affect
the Company’s liquidity. In the event of a reduction in real estate values the amount of available credit could be reduced. Moreover, if the
Company were to fail to make a payment or violate a covenant under a credit facility, after applicable cure periods one or more of its lenders could
declare a default, accelerate the due date for repayment of all amounts outstanding and/or foreclose on properties securing such facilities. Any such
event could have a material adverse effect on the Company.

On May 26, 2005, the Company gave the
required one year notice to redeem all of the issued and outstanding shares of its 8-5/8% Series G Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (“Series
G”) on May 26, 2006, for the total redemption price of $10 million. As a result, in accordance with Statement No. 150,

Accounting for Certain
Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity

, the Company classified the Series G as a liability within notes payable
as of May 26, 2005, on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

As of December 31, 2005, the Company
had interest rate swaps in effect totaling a notional amount of approximately $659 million. To date, these swaps have proven to be highly effective
hedges. The Company also had entered into a future interest rate swap totaling a notional amount of $25 million. This swap goes into effect in February
2006. The Company also had interest rate cap agreements totaling a notional amount of approximately $23 million in effect as of December 31,
2005.

During 2005, the Company offered an
average 1.5% discount through its DRSPP and issued approximately 784,000 shares of common stock through the direct stock purchase feature of this plan,
generating approximately $32.3 million in proceeds. During 2004, the Company offered an average discount of 2.0% from August through December through
its DRSPP. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, the Company issued approximately 392,000 shares of common stock through the direct stock
purchase feature of this plan, generating approximately $15.1 million in proceeds.

On July 10, 2003, in an underwritten
public offering, the Company sold 5,600,000 shares of its 8.30% Series H Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (“Series H”) at $25 per share
less an underwriting discount of $0.7875 per share. The net proceeds of the sale were applied to the redemption of all the issued and


outstanding shares of the
Company’s 9.5% Series A Cumulative Preferred Stock and 9-3/8% Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock as well as 1,600,000 shares of the
1,938,830 issued and outstanding shares of the Company’s 8-7/8% Series B Cumulative Preferred Stock (“Series B”) on August 12,
2003.

On July 16, 2003, the underwriters of
the Company’s Series H offering exercised an option to purchase an additional 525,000 shares of the Series H preferred stock for $25 per share
less the underwriting discount, and on August 4, 2003, the underwriters exercised an option to purchase the remaining additional 75,000 shares of the
Series H preferred stock for $25 per share less the underwriting discount. The net proceeds were used to redeem the remaining issued and outstanding
shares of the Series B preferred stock on August 18, 2003.

On August 22, 2003, the Company sold
700,000 shares of its common stock to certain advisory clients of Cohen & Steers Capital Management, Inc. The stock was sold at a price of $28.40
per share. The $19,870,000 in net proceeds from the sale were used to partially fund the BreMaac Buyout.

On September 19, 2003, the Company sold
665,000 shares of its common stock to certain advisory clients of Cohen & Steers Capital Management, Inc. and to Scudder RREEF Real Estate Fund II,
Inc. The stock was sold at a price of $29.36 per share. The $19,500,000 in net proceeds from the sale were used to partially fund the purchase of the
Los Rios Park apartments.

On December 2, 2003, the Company sold
400,000 shares of its common stock to RREEF America, L.L.C. on behalf of itself and Scudder RREEF Real Estate Fund II, Inc. The stock was sold at a
price of $30.00 per share. The $11,996,000 in net proceeds from the sale were used to partially fund the acquisition of the Lighthouse Court
apartments.

The Company believes that it has
adequate resources to fund its current operations, annual refurbishment of its properties, and incremental investment in new apartment properties. The
Company is relying on the efficient operation of the financial markets to finance debt maturities, and also is heavily reliant on the creditworthiness
of FNMA, which provides credit enhancement for approximately $811 million of the Company’s debt. The interest rate market for FNMA DMBS, which in
the Company’s experience is highly correlated with three-month LIBOR interest rates, is also an important component of the Company’s
liquidity and interest rate swap effectiveness. In the event that the FNMA DMBS market becomes less efficient, or the credit of FNMA becomes impaired,
the Company would seek alternative sources of debt financing.

For the year ended December 31, 2005,
the Company’s net cash provided by operating activities exceeded improvements to existing real estate assets, distributions to unitholders, and
dividends paid on common and preferred shares by approximately $1.6 million. This compares to shortfalls for the years ended December 31, 2004, and
2003, of approximately $10.9 million and $11.0 million, respectively. While the Company has sufficient liquidity to permit distributions at current
rates, from time to time the Company may utilize additional borrowings to cover shortfalls if necessary. Any significant deterioration in operations
could result in the Company’s financial resources to be insufficient to pay distributions to shareholders at the current rate, in which event the
Company would be required to reduce the distribution rate.

The following table reflects the
Company’s total contractual cash obligations which consists of its long-term debt and operating leases as of December 31, 2005, (dollars in

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

At December 31, 2005, and 2004, the
Company did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as “structured
finance” or “special purpose entities,” established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other
contractually


narrow or limited purposes. The
Company’s joint venture with Blackstone (terminated in 2003) was established in order to raise capital through asset sales to fund development
(while acquiring management fees to help offset the reduction in FFO from the sale), share repurchases, and other capital requirements. The
Company’s joint ventures with Crow Holdings were established to acquire approximately $200 million of multifamily properties. In addition, the
Company does not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts. As such, the Company is not materially exposed to any financing,
liquidity, market, or credit risk that could arise if it had engaged in such relationships. The Company does not have any relationships or transactions
with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non-independent relationships with the Company or its related parties other than what is
disclosed in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 13.

The Company’s investments in its
real estate joint ventures are unconsolidated and are recorded on the equity method as the Company does not have a controlling
interest.

INSURANCE

In the opinion of management, property
and casualty insurance is in place that provides adequate coverage to provide financial protection against normal insurable risks such that it believes
that any loss experienced would not have a significant impact on the Company’s liquidity, financial position, or results of
operations.

INFLATION

Substantially all of the resident
leases at the Communities allow, at the time of renewal, for adjustments in the rent payable there under, and thus may enable the Company to seek rent
increases. Almost all leases are for one year or less. The short-term nature of these leases generally serves to reduce the risk to the Company of the
adverse effects of inflation.

IMPACT OF RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING
STANDARDS

In December 2004, the FASB issued
Statement No. 153,

Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29

(“Statement 153”). Statement 153 was a result
of a joint effort by the FASB and the IASB to improve financial reporting by eliminating certain narrow differences between their existing accounting
standards. Statement 153 amends APB Opinion No. 29 to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it
with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance. A nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if
the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange. Statement 153 is applied prospectively for
nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The adoption of Statement 153 did not have a material impact on
the Company’s consolidated financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole.

In December 2004, the FASB issued
Statement No. 123 (revised December 2004),

Share-Based Payment

(“Statement 123(R)”). Statement 123(R) replaces FASB Statement No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

, and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

. Statement 123(R)
will require compensation costs related to share-based payment transactions to be recognized in the financial statements. With limited exceptions, the
amount of compensation cost will be measured based on the grant date fair value of the equity or the liability instruments issued. In addition,
liability awards will be remeasured each reporting period. Compensation cost will be recognized over the period that an employee provides service in
exchange for the award. Statement 123(R) is effective as of the beginning of the first annual reporting period that begins after June 15, 2005. The
Company will adopt Statement 123(R) effective January 1, 2006, and does not believe it will have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated
financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole.

In March 2005, the SEC issued SAB 107
to provide public companies additional guidance in applying the provisions of Statement 123(R). Among other things, SAB 107 describes the SEC
staff’s expectations in determining the assumptions that underlie the fair value estimates and discusses the interaction of Statement 123(R) with
certain existing SEC guidance. The guidance is also beneficial to users of financial statements in


analyzing the information provided
under statement 123(R). SAB 107 will be applied upon the adoption of Statement 123(R).

In March 2005, the FASB issued
Interpretation No. 47,

Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations-an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143

(“Interpretation
47”). Interpretation 47 clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in FASB Statement No. 143,

Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations

, (“Statement 143”) refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and/or
method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. Interpretation 47 is effective no later
than the end of fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005, (December 31, 2005, for calendar-year enterprises). Retrospective application for interim
financial information is permitted but is not required. The adoption of Interpretation 47 did not have a material impact on the Company’s
consolidated financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole.

In June 2005, the FASB ratified EITF
04-5:

Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited
Partners Have Certain Rights

(“EITF 04-5”). EITF 04-5 provides a framework for determining whether a general partner is required to
consolidate limited partners. The new framework is significantly different than the guidance in SOP 78-9 and would make it more difficult for a general
partner to overcome the presumption that it controls the limited partnership, requiring the limited partner to have substantive “kick-out” or
“participating” rights. Kick-out rights are the right to dissolve or liquidate the partnership or to otherwise remove the general partner
without cause and participating rights are the right to effectively participate in significant decisions made in the ordinary course of the
partnership’s business. EITF 04-5 became effective immediately for all newly formed limited partnerships and existing limited partnerships which
are modified. The guidance will become effective for existing limited partnerships which are not modified the beginning of the first reporting period
in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. The Company does not believe the adoption of EITF 04-5 will have a material impact on the
Company’s consolidated financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole.

ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
ABOUT MARKET RISK

The Company’s primary market risk
exposure is to changes in interest rates obtainable on its secured and unsecured borrowings. At December 31, 2005, 45.6% of the Company’s total
capitalization consisted of borrowings. The Company’s interest rate risk objective is to limit the impact of interest rate fluctuations on
earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs. To achieve this objective, the Company manages its exposure to fluctuations in market
interest rates for its borrowings through the use of fixed rate debt instruments to the extent that reasonably favorable rates are obtainable with such
arrangements, and may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps and caps to mitigate its interest rate risk on a related
financial instrument or to effectively fix the interest rate on a portion of its variable debt or on future refinancings. The Company does not enter
into derivative instruments for trading purposes. Approximately 85% of the Company’s outstanding debt was subject to fixed rates after considering
related derivative instruments with a weighted average of 5.6% at December 31, 2005. After considering the $25 million forward interest rate swap which
becomes operative in February 2006, approximately 87% of the Company’s debt was fixed or hedged by interest rate swaps or caps at December 31,
2005. The Company regularly reviews interest rate exposure on its outstanding borrowings in an effort to minimize the risk of interest rate

ITEM 8.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY
DATA

The Reports of Independent Registered
Public Accounting Firm, Consolidated Financial Statements and Selected Quarterly Financial Information are set forth on pages F-1 to F-29 of this
Annual Report on Form 10-K.

ITEM 9.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING
AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

On September 19, 2005, and effective
October 31, 2005, upon the filing of its Form 10-Q for the third quarter of 2005, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company
dismissed KPMG LLP as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm and engaged Ernst & Young LLP as its new independent
registered public accounting firm to conduct the audit of the Company’s financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31,
2005.

The reports of KPMG LLP on the
financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2004, and 2003, did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion, nor were they
qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principle.

There have been no disagreements with
the Company’s independent accountants on any matter of accounting principles or practices or financial statement disclosure.

ITEM 9A.  CONTROLS AND
PROCEDURES

Management’s Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
Procedures

The Company maintains disclosure
controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company’s filings under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s
rules and forms, and to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management necessarily applied its
judgment in assessing the costs and benefits of such controls and procedures which, by their nature, can provide only reasonable assurance regarding
management’s control objectives. The Company also has an investment in an unconsolidated entity


which is not under its control.
Consequently, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures with respect to this entity are necessarily more limited than those it maintains
with respect to its consolidated subsidiaries.

Our management, with the participation
of our principal executive officer and financial officers has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure
controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act. Based on their evaluation as of December 31, 2005, our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely
alerting them to material information relating to the Company (including its consolidated subsidiaries) that is required to be included in the
Company’s Exchange Act filings.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting

Management’s report on our
internal control over financial reporting is presented on page F-1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The reports of Ernst & Young LLP relating to
the consolidated financial statements, financial statement schedule, management’s assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
financial reporting and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting are presented on pages F-2 and F-4 of this Annual Report on
Form 10-K.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting

During the Company’s evaluation of
internal controls over financial reporting, management identified items which would have been classified as deficiencies or significant deficiencies
within the framework utilized by management to assess the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Management communicated these
items to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company and all of the significant deficiencies were either remediated or the Company had
a remediation plan in place as of the end of the period covered by this report. No material weaknesses were identified by management during its
assessment.

During the three months ended December
31, 2005, there were no significant changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that materially affected, or that are
reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting

Management of the Company is
responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(f)
promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

Internal control over financial
reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the
Company’s consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary
to permit the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with appropriate authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii)
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that
could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations,
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management conducted an assessment of
the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005 using the framework specified in

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework

, published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on such assessment,
management has concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2005.

Management’s assessment of the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an
independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is presented in this Annual Report.

Report of Independent Registered Accounting
Firm

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

of Mid-America
Apartment Communities, Inc.

We have audited the consolidated
balance sheet of Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2005, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for the year then ended. Our audit also included the information as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2005 contained in the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a). These financial statements and schedule are the
responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our
audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial
statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2005 referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial
position of Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. and subsidiaries at December 31, 2005 and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash
flows for the year ended December 31, 2005, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related
financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects
the information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2005 set forth therein.

We have also audited, in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of Mid-America Apartment Communities,
Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 27, 2006 expressed an
unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting
Firm

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

of Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.

We have audited management’s
assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that Mid-America Apartment Communities,
Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal
Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Mid-America
Apartment Communities, Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment
of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an
opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit
included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and
fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures
of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material
effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations,
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s
assessment that Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, is
fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. maintained, in all
material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet of Mid-America Apartment
Communities, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2005, and the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders’ equity, and cash
flows for the year then ended and our report dated February 27, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.

Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements

Years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003

1.

Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies

Organization and Formation of the Company

Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.
(“Mid-America”) is a self-administrated and self-managed real estate investment trust which owns, acquires and operates multifamily apartment
communities mainly in the southeastern United States. Mid-America owns and operates 131 apartment communities principally through its majority owned
subsidiary, Mid-America Apartments, L.P. (the “Operating Partnership”). Mid-America also owns a 33.33% interest in a real estate joint
venture which owned one apartment community at December 31, 2005, for which the Company provides management services.

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements
presented herein include the accounts of Mid-America, the Operating Partnership, and all other subsidiaries (“the Company”). The Company owns
51% to 100% of all consolidated subsidiaries. The Company uses the equity method of accounting for its investments in 20 to 50 percent owned entities
for which the Company does not have the ability to exercise control. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation.

Minority Interest

Minority interest in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements relates to the ownership interest in the Operating Partnership by the holders of Class A Common Units of the
Operating Partnership (“Operating Partnership Units”). Mid-America is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership. Net income is
allocated to the minority interest based on their respective ownership percentage of the Operating Partnership. Issuance of additional common shares or
Operating Partnership Units changes the ownership of both the minority interest and Mid-America. Such transactions and the proceeds there from are
treated as capital transactions and result in an allocation between shareholders’ equity and minority interest to account for the change in the
respective percentage ownership of the underlying equity of the Operating Partnership.

The Company’s Board of Directors
established economic rights in respect to each Operating Partnership Unit that were equivalent to the economic rights in respect to each share of
common stock. The holder of each unit may redeem their units in exchange for one share of common stock or cash, at the option of the Company. The
Operating Partnership has followed the policy of paying the same per unit distribution in respect to the units as the per share distribution in respect
to the common stock. Operating Partnership net income for 2005, 2004 and 2003 was allocated approximately 11.4%, 12.1%, and 14.6%, respectively, to
holders of Operating Partnership Units and 88.6%, 87.9%, and 85.4%, respectively, to Mid-America.

Use of Estimates

Management of the Company has made a
number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses to prepare these financial statements and notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Revenue Recognition

The Company leases multifamily
residential apartments under operating leases primarily with terms of one year or less. Rental revenues are recognized using a method that represents a
straight-line basis over the term of the lease and other revenues are recorded when earned.

The Company records all gains and
losses on real estate in accordance with Statement No. 66 “Accounting for Sales of Real Estate”.

F-10

Rental Costs

Costs associated with rental activities
are expensed as incurred. Certain costs associated with the lease-up of development projects, including cost of model units, their furnishings, signs,
and “grand openings” are capitalized and amortized over their respective estimated useful lives. All other costs relating to renting
development projects are expensed as incurred.

Earnings Per Share

The computation of basic earnings per
share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. The computation of diluted earnings per share is based on the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding plus the shares resulting from the assumed exercise of all dilutive outstanding options using the treasury
stock method. For periods where the Company reports a net loss available for common shareholders, the effect of dilutive shares is excluded from
earnings per share calculations because including such shares would be anti-dilutive.

A reconciliation of the numerators and
denominators of the basic and diluted earnings per share computations for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003 is presented on the
Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company considers cash, investments
in money market accounts and certificates of deposit with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

Restricted Cash

Restricted cash consists of escrow
deposits held by lenders for property taxes, insurance, debt service and replacement reserves.

Real Estate Assets and Depreciation

Real estate assets are carried at
depreciated cost. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred while significant improvements, renovations, and recurring capital
replacements are capitalized. Recurring capital replacements typically include whole unit carpet replacement, new roofs, HVAC units, plumbing,
concrete, masonry and other paving, pools and various exterior building improvements. These expenditures extend the useful life of the property and
increase the property’s fair market value. The cost of interior painting, vinyl flooring and blinds are expensed as incurred.

In conjunction with acquisitions of
properties, the Company’s policy is to provide in its acquisition budgets adequate funds to complete any deferred maintenance items to bring the
properties to the required standard, including the cost of replacement appliances, carpet, interior painting, vinyl flooring and blinds. These costs
are capitalized.

Depreciation is computed on a
straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets which range from 8 to 40 years for land improvements and buildings and 5
years for furniture, fixtures and equipment and 3 to 5 years for computers and software.

For real estate acquisitions subsequent
to June 30, 2001, the effective date of Statement 141,

Business Combinations

, the fair value of the real estate acquired is allocated to the
acquired tangible assets, consisting of land, building, furniture, fixtures and equipment, and identified intangible assets and liabilities, consisting
of above and below market leases, resident relationship values and the value of in-place leases.

The fair value of the tangible assets
of an acquired property (land, building, furniture, fixtures and equipment) is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant. The
“as-if-vacant” value is then allocated to land, building, furniture, fixtures and equipment based on management’s determination of the
relative fair values of these assets. Management determines the as-if-vacant fair value of a property using methods similar to those used by
independent appraisers. Factors considered by management in performing these analyses include an estimate of carrying costs during the period of time
that would be required in the

F-11

current market conditions to
lease-up the property. Management includes real estate taxes, insurance, operating expenses and lost rentals as well as the costs required to execute
similar leases in the estimated carrying costs.

In allocating the fair value of
identified intangible assets and liabilities of an acquired property, the in-place leases are compared to current market conditions. Based on these
evaluations, management believes that the leases acquired on each of its property acquisitions were at market rates since the lease terms generally do
not extend beyond one year.

The fair value of the in-place leases
and resident relationships is measured by the excess of the purchase price over the as-if-vacant value of the property as described above. The fair
value of the in-place leases and resident relationships is then amortized over the remaining term of the resident leases. The amount of these resident
lease intangibles included in real estate assets totaled $12.3 million, $9.1 million and $4.9 million as of December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003,
respectively, and the amortization recorded as depreciation expense was $4.9 million, $4.9 million and $1.4 million for the years ending December 31,
2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

The Company accounts for long-lived
assets in accordance with the provisions of Statement No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets (“Statement
144”) and evaluates its goodwill for impairment under Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (“Statement 142”). The
Company evaluates its goodwill for impairment on an annual basis in the Company’s fiscal fourth quarter, or sooner if a goodwill impairment
indicator is identified. The Company periodically evaluates its long-lived assets, including its investments in real estate and goodwill, for
indicators that would suggest that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. The judgments regarding the existence of such indicators
are based on factors such as operating performance, market conditions, and legal factors.

In accordance with Statement 144,
long-lived assets, such as real estate assets, and equipment, and purchased intangibles subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used
is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If
the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount
of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Assets to be disposed of are separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of
the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and are no longer depreciated. The assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held
for sale are presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet.

Goodwill is tested annually for
impairment, and is tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. An impairment loss is
recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset’s fair value. This determination is made at the reporting unit level and
consists of two steps. First, the Company determines the fair value of a reporting unit and compares it to its carrying amount. In the apartment
industry, the primary method used for determining fair value is to divide annual operating cash flows by an appropriate capitalization rate. The
Company determines the appropriate capitalization rate by reviewing the prevailing rates in a property’s market or submarket. Second, if the
carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting
unit’s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the
reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation, in accordance with Statement No. 141,

Business Combinations

. The residual
fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill.

In 2005, the Company sold the Eastview
apartments and recorded an asset impairment charge to discontinued operations of $243,000. In 2004, the Eastview apartments were classified as held for
sale and the annual evaluation indicated an impairment of goodwill related to the property resulting in an asset impairment charge to discontinued
operations of $200,000.

F-12

Land Held for Future Development

Real estate held for future development
are sites intended for future multifamily developments and are carried at the lower of cost or fair value.

Investment In and Advances to Real Estate Joint
Ventures

The Company’s investment in its
unconsolidated real estate joint venture is recorded on the equity method as the Company is able to exert significant influence, but does not have a
controlling interest in the joint venture.

Deferred Financing Costs

Deferred financing costs are amortized
over the terms of the related debt using a method which approximates the interest method.

Other Assets

Other assets consist of deferred rental
concessions which are recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the leases, receivables and deposits from residents, and other prepaid
expenses including prepaid insurance and prepaid interest.

Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities

Accrued expenses consist of accrued
real estate taxes, accrued interest payable, other accrued expenses payable, unearned income and the adjustment for the fair market value of the
Company’s derivative financial instruments.

Derivative Financial Instruments

In the normal course of business, the
Company uses certain derivative financial instruments to manage, or hedge, the interest rate risk associated with the Company’s variable rate debt
or as hedges in anticipation of future debt transactions to manage well-defined interest rate risk associated with the transaction.

The Company does not use derivative
financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. Further, the Company has a policy of entering into contracts with major financial
institutions based upon their credit rating and other factors. When viewed in conjunction with the underlying and offsetting exposure that the
derivatives are designated to hedge, the Company has not sustained any material loss from those instruments nor does it anticipate any material adverse
effect on its net income or financial position in the future from the use of derivatives.

The Company requires that derivative
financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges be effective in reducing the interest rate risk exposure that they are designated to hedge. This
effectiveness is essential for qualifying for hedge accounting. Instruments that meet the hedging criteria are formally designated as hedging
instruments at the inception of the derivative contract. The Company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items,
as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction. This process includes linking all derivatives that are
designated as fair-value or cash flow hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific firm commitments or forecasted
transactions. The Company also formally assesses, both at the inception of the hedging relationship and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives
used are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. When it is determined that a derivative has ceased to be
a highly effective hedge, the Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively.

All of the Company’s derivative
financial instruments are recorded at fair value and reported on the balance sheet, and are characterized as cash flow hedges. These transactions hedge
the future cash flows of debt transactions through interest rate swaps that convert variable payments to fixed payments and interest rate caps that
limit the exposure to rising interest rates. The unrealized gains/losses in the fair value of these hedging instruments are reported on the balance
sheet with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income, with any ineffective portion of the hedging transactions reclassified
to earnings.

F-13

During the years ended December 31,
2005, 2004, and 2003, the ineffective portion of the hedging transactions was not significant.

Stock-Based Compensation

Upon shareholder approval at the May
24, 2004, Annual Meeting of Shareholders, the Company adopted the 2004 Stock Plan to provide incentives to attract and retain independent directors,
executive officers and key employees. This plan replaced the 1994 Restricted Stock and Stock Option Plan under which no further awards may be granted
as of January 31, 2004. See Note 11 for further details.

The Company has adopted the disclosure
provisions of Statement No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

, as amended by Statement No. 148,

Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation—Transition and Disclosure—an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123

which requires the impact of the fair value of employee
stock based compensation plans on net income and earnings per share be disclosed on a pro forma basis in a footnote to the financial statements for
awards granted after December 15, 1994, if the accounting for such awards continues to be in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.
25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

, (“APB 25”). The Company will continue such accounting under the provisions of APB
25.

The following table reflects the effect
on net income (loss) if the fair value method of accounting allowed under Statement No. 123 had been used by the Company along with the applicable
assumptions utilized in the Black-Scholes option pricing model calculation (dollars and shares in thousands, except per share data):

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2004, the FASB issued
Statement No. 153,

Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29

(“Statement 153”). Statement 153 was a result
of a joint effort by the FASB and the IASB to improve financial reporting by eliminating certain narrow differences between their existing accounting
standards. Statement 153 amends APB Opinion No. 29 to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it
with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance. A nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if
the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange. Statement 153 is applied prospectively for
nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods

F-14

beginning after June 15, 2005. The
adoption of Statement 153 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial condition or results of operations taken as a
whole.

In December 2004, the FASB issued
Statement No. 123 (revised December 2004),

Share-Based Payment

(“Statement 123(R)”). Statement 123(R) replaces FASB Statement No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

, and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

. Statement 123(R)
will require compensation costs related to share-based payment transactions to be recognized in the financial statements. With limited exceptions, the
amount of compensation cost will be measured based on the grant-date fair value of the equity or the liability instruments issued. In addition,
liability awards will be remeasured each reporting period. Compensation cost will be recognized over the period that an employee provides service in
exchange for the award. Statement 123(R) is effective as of the beginning of the first annual reporting period that begins after June 15, 2005. The
Company will adopt Statement 123(R) effective January 1, 2006, and does not believe it will have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated
financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole.

In March 2005, the SEC issued SAB 107
to provide public companies additional guidance in applying the provisions of Statement 123(R). Among other things, SAB 107 describes the SEC
staff’s expectations in determining the assumptions that underlie the fair value estimates and discusses the interaction of Statement 123(R) with
certain existing SEC guidance. The guidance is also beneficial to users of financial statements in analyzing the information provided under statement
123(R). SAB 107 will be applied upon the adoption of Statement 123(R).

In March 2005, the FASB issued
Interpretation No. 47,

Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations-an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143

(“Interpretation
47”). Interpretation 47 clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in FASB Statement No. 143,

Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations

, (“Statement 143”) refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and/or
method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. Interpretation 47 is effective no later
than the end of fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005, (December 31, 2005, for calendar-year enterprises). Retrospective application for interim
financial information is permitted but is not required. The adoption of Interpretation 47 did not have a material impact on the Company’s
consolidated financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole.

In June 2005, the FASB ratified EITF
04-5:

Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited
Partners Have Certain Rights

(“EITF 04-5”). EITF 04-5 provides a framework for determining whether a general partner is required to
consolidate limited partners. The new framework is significantly different than the guidance in SOP 78-9 and would make it more difficult for a general
partner to overcome the presumption that it controls the limited partnership, requiring the limited partner to have substantive “kick-out” or
“participating” rights. Kick-out rights are the right to dissolve or liquidate the partnership or to otherwise remove the general partner
without cause and participating rights are the right to effectively participate in significant decisions made in the ordinary course of the
partnership’s business. EITF 04-5 became effective immediately for all newly formed limited partnerships and existing limited partnerships which
are modified. The guidance will become effective for existing limited partnerships which are not modified the beginning of the first reporting period
in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. The Company does not believe the adoption of EITF 04-5 will have a material impact on the
Company’s consolidated financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole.

Reclassifications

Certain prior year amounts have been
reclassified to conform to 2005 presentation. The reclassifications had no effect on net income available for common shareholders.

Real Estate Joint Ventures

At the beginning of 2005, the Company
owned a 33.33% interest in a joint venture (“CH/Realty”) with Crow Holdings which was formed in 2002. In 2004, CH/Realty sold the Preserve at
Arbor Lakes apartments, a 284-unit community in Jacksonville, FL. In 2005, CH/Realty sold Seasons at Green Oaks, a 300-unit community in Grand Prairie,
TX and Preston Hills, a 464-unit community in Buford, GA, the two remaining properties owned by the joint venture. Following the sale of the final
properties from the joint venture, the Company’s relationship with Crow Holdings in CH/Realty ceased to exist.

The Company entered into a second joint
venture (“CH/Realty II”) with Crow Holdings in 2004 with the purchase of the Verandas at Timberglen apartments. The Company also owns a
33.33% interest in CH/Realty II, and contributed 33.33% of the capital necessary to establish the joint venture. While the joint venture agreement does
provide for methods of establishing subsequent capital contributions, CH/Realty II has generated sufficient cash flow to meet the debt service
requirements of its non-recourse debt and provide monthly distributions to the owners. At December 31, 2005, CH Realty II owned one apartment community
with 522 apartment units.

Through August 25, 2003, the Company
owned a 33.33% interest in a joint venture (“Bre/MAAC”) with Blackstone Real Estate Acquisitions, LLC (“Blackstone”) which was
formed in 1999 when the Company sold 10 apartment communities containing 2,793 apartment units to Bre/MAAC for $97.9 million. On August 25, 2003, the
Company paid $21.9 million in cash and assumed $53.2 million in debt to purchase Blackstone’s 66.67% interest in the joint venture. This
acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141,

Business Combinations

. The purchase accounting adjustments include an adjustment to the carrying value of the real estate asset resulting from
the previously unrecognized deferred gain on the Company’s retained interest from the original sale of the properties to Bre/MAAC in 1999 and the
recording of certain intangible assets. The operating results of Bre/MAAC are included in the accompanying statement of operations commencing August
25, 2003.

Borrowings

The Company maintains a total of $950
million of secured credit facilities with Prudential Mortgage Capital, credit enhanced by FNMA (the “FNMA Facilities”). The FNMA Facilities
provide for both fixed and variable rate borrowings and have traunches with maturities from 2010 through 2014. The interest rate on the majority of the
variable portion renews every 90 days and is based on the FNMA discount mortgage backed security rate on the date of renewal, which, for the Company,
has historically approximated three-month LIBOR less an average of 0.04% over the life of the FNMA Facilities, plus a fee of 0.62% to 0.795%.
Borrowings under the FNMA Facilities totaled $811 million at December 31, 2005, consisting of $110 million under a fixed portion at a rate of 7.2%, and
the remaining $701 million under the variable rate portion of the facility at an average rate of 4.8%. The available borrowing base capacity at
December 31, 2005, was $881 million. The Company has 21 interest rate swap agreements, totaling a notional amount of $551 million designed to fix the
interest rate on a portion of the variable rate borrowings outstanding under the FNMA Facilities at approximately 5.5%. The interest rate swaps have
maturities between 2006 and 2013. The Company also has a forward interest rate swap for an additional notional amount of $25 million at an interest
rate of 5.3% which goes into effect in February 2006 and matures in 2013. The swaps are highly effective and

F-17

are designed as cash flow hedges.
The Company has also entered into three interest rate caps totaling a notional amount of $23 million which are designated against the FNMA Facilities.
These interest rate caps mature in 2007 and 2009 and are set at 6.0%. The FNMA Facilities are subject to certain borrowing base calculations that
effectively reduce the amount that may be borrowed.

The Company has a $100 million credit
facility with Freddie MAC (the “Freddie Mac Facility”). At December 31, 2005, the Company had $96 million borrowed against the Freddie Mac
Facility at an interest rate of 5.0%. The Company has five interest rate swap agreements, totaling a notional amount of $83 million designed to fix the
interest rate on a portion of the variable rate borrowings outstanding under the Freddie Mac Facility at approximately 5.4%. The interest rate swaps
expire in 2011.

The Company also maintains a $40
million secured credit facility with two banks led by AmSouth Bank (the “AmSouth Credit Line”). The AmSouth Credit Line bears an interest
rate of LIBOR plus a spread ranging from 1.35% to 1.75% based on certain quarterly coverage calculations established by the agreement. This credit line
expires in May 2007 and is subject to certain borrowing base calculations that effectively reduce the amount that may be borrowed. At December 31,
2005, the Company had $30 million available to be borrowed under the AmSouth Credit Line agreement with $12 million borrowed under this facility at an
interest rate of 6.0%. Approximately $7 million of the facility is used for letters of credit.

Each of the Company’s credit
facilities is subject to various covenants and conditions on usage. If the Company were to fail to satisfy a condition to borrowing, the available
credit under one or more of the facilities could not be drawn, which could adversely affect the Company’s liquidity. Moreover, if the Company were
to fail to make a payment or violate a covenant under a credit facility, after applicable cure periods one or more of its lenders could declare a
default, accelerate the due date for repayment of all amounts outstanding and/or foreclose on properties securing such facilities. Any such event could
have a material adverse effect on the Company. The Company believes it was in compliance with these covenants and conditions on usage at December 31,
2005.

The Company had outstanding at December
31, 2005, a $40 million promissory note with Union Planters Bank at a variable interest rate based on three month LIBOR of 5.4% which matures in April
2009. The Company has entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $25 million and an interest rate of 5.0% which expires in
2009 and is designated against the Union Planters Bank promissory note.

At December 31, 2005, the Company had
$139 million of fixed rate conventional individual property mortgages with an average interest rate of 5.0% and an average maturity of 2014, $26
million of fixed rate tax exempt individual property mortgages with an average interest rate of 5.5% and an average maturity of 2024, and a $5 million
variable rate tax exempt individual property mortgage at an interest rate of 4.2% with a maturity in 2028.

At December 31, 2005, the Company had
$162 million (after considering the impact of interest rate swap agreements in effect) conventional variable rate debt outstanding at an average
interest rate of 4.8%, $11 million (after considering the impact of interest rate swap agreements) of tax-free variable rate debt outstanding at an
average rate of 4.0%, and an additional $23 million of capped tax-free variable rate debt at an average rate of 4.4%. As of December 31, 2005, the
Company had also entered into a forward interest rate swap agreement which goes into effect in February 2006 and hedges an additional $25 million of
conventional variable rate debt outstanding at an average interest rate of 5.3%. The interest rate on all other debt, totaling $944 million, was hedged
or fixed at an average interest rate of 5.6%.

As of December 31, 2005, the Company
estimated that the weighted average interest rate on the Company’s debt was 5.4%.

Derivative Financial Instruments

Following are the details of the
interest rate swaps that were entered into as of December 31, 2005 (dollars in thousands):

F-20

At December 31, 2005, all of the
Company’s interest rate swaps and interest rate caps were designated as cash flow hedges in accordance with Statement No. 133 as amended and have
a net liability fair value of $7.3 million recorded in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet and an asset fair value
of $30,000 recorded in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet, respectively.

6.

Fair Value Disclosure of Financial
Instruments

Cash and cash equivalents, restricted
cash, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities and security deposits are carried at amounts which reasonably approximate their fair
value due to their short term nature.

Fixed rate notes payable at December
31, 2005, and 2004, total $285.0 million and $290.3 million, respectively, and have an estimated fair value of $258.7 million and $240.5 million
(excluding prepayment penalties), respectively, based upon interest rates available for the issuance of debt with similar terms and remaining
maturities as of December 31, 2005, and 2004. The carrying value of variable rate notes payable (excluding the effect of interest rate swap agreements)
at December 31, 2005, and 2004, total $855.0 million and $793.2 million, respectively, which reasonably approximates their fair value because the
related variable interest rates available for the issuance of debt with similar terms and remaining maturities reasonably approximate market rates. The
notional amount of interest rate and forward interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2005, and 2004, total $684.3 million and $569.0 million,
respectively, and have an estimated fair value of $7.3 million and ($14.6) million, respectively, based upon interest rates available for interest rate
swaps with similar terms and remaining maturities as of December 31, 2005, and 2004. The notional amount of interest rate cap agreements at December
31, 2005, and 2004, total $22.6 million and $22.6 million, respectively, and have an estimated fair value of $30 thousand and $66 thousand,
respectively, based upon interest rates available for interest rate caps with similar terms and remaining maturities as of December 31, 2005, and
2004.

The fair value estimates presented
herein are based on information available to management as of December 31, 2005, and 2004. These estimates are not necessarily indicative of the
amounts the Company could ultimately realize.

Commitments and Contingencies

The Company is not presently subject to
any material litigation nor, to the Company’s knowledge, with advice of legal counsel, is any material litigation threatened against the Company.
The Company is subject to routine litigation arising in the ordinary course of business, some of which is expected to be covered by liability insurance
and none of which is expected to have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements of the Company.

The Company had operating lease expense
of approximately $4,000 for the years ended December 31, 2005, and 2004, and none for the year ended December 31, 2003. The Company has commitments of
approximately $4,000 annually through 2008 under operating lease agreements outstanding at December 31, 2005.

8.

Income Taxes

No provision for Federal income taxes
has been made in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The Company has made an election to be taxed as a Real Estate Investment Trust
(“REIT”) under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code. As a REIT, the Company is generally not subject to Federal income tax
on that portion of its income that qualifies as REIT taxable income to the extent that it distributes at least 90% of its taxable income to the
Company’s shareholders and complies with certain requirements. If the Company fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, the Company will be
subject to the Federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on its taxable income at regular corporate rates. Even though the
Company qualifies for taxation as a REIT, the Company may be subject to certain Federal, state and local taxes on its income and property and to
Federal income and excise tax on its undistributed income.

F-21

Earnings and profits, which determine
the taxability of dividends to shareholders, differ from net income reported for financial reporting purposes primarily because of differences in
depreciable lives, bases of certain assets and liabilities and in the timing of recognition of earnings upon disposition of properties. For Federal
income tax purposes, the following summarizes the taxability of cash distributions paid on the common shares in 2004 and 2003 and the estimated
taxability for 2005:

Shareholders’ Equity

Series A Preferred Stock

Series A Cumulative Preferred Stock
(“Series A Preferred Stock”) had a $25.00 per share liquidation preference and a preferential cumulative annual distribution of $2.375 per
share, payable monthly. In August 2003, the Company used part of the proceeds from the issuance of the Series H Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock
(“Series H Preferred Stock”) to redeem all of the 2,000,000 outstanding shares of its Series A Preferred Stock for $50
million.

Series B Preferred Stock

Series B Cumulative Preferred Stock
(“Series B Preferred Stock”) had a $25.00 per share liquidation preference and a preferential cumulative annual distribution of $2.21875 per
share, payable monthly. In August 2003, the Company used part of the proceeds from the issuance of the Series H Preferred Stock to redeem all 1,938,830
outstanding shares of its Series B Preferred Stock for $48.5 million.

Series C Preferred Stock

Series C Cumulative Redeemable
Preferred Stock (“Series C Preferred Stock”) had a $25.00 per share liquidation preference and a preferential cumulative annual distribution
of $2.34375 per share, payable quarterly. In August 2003, the Company used part of the proceeds from the issuance of the Series H Preferred Stock to
redeem all 2,000,000 outstanding shares of its Series C Preferred Stock for $50 million.

Series D Preferred Stock—Shareholders Rights
Plan

The Board of Directors authorized a
Shareholders Rights Plan (the “Rights Plan”). In implementing the Rights Plan, the Board declared a distribution of one right for each of the
Company’s outstanding common shares which would become exercisable only if a person or group (the “Acquiring Person”) became the
beneficial owner of 10% or more of the common shares or announced a tender or exchange offer that would result in ownership of 10% of the
Company’s common shares. The rights would trade with the Company’s common stock until exercisable. Each holder of a right, other than the
Acquiring Person, would in that event be entitled to purchase one common share of the Company for each right at one half of the then current
price.

In November 2005, as a governance
initiative, the Board voted to terminate the Rights Plan.

Series F Preferred Stock

In 2002, the Company issued Series F
Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (“Series F Preferred Stock”) with a $25.00 per share liquidation preference and a preferential
cumulative annual distribution of $2.3125 per share, payable monthly. The Company has outstanding 474,500 Series F Preferred shares for which it
received aggregate proceeds of $11.9 million. On and after October 16, 2007, the Series F Preferred shares will be redeemable for cash at the option of
the Company, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to the liquidation preference plus dividends accrued and unpaid to the redemption
date.

F-22

Series H Preferred Stock

In 2003, the Company issued the Series
H Preferred Stock with a $25.00 per share liquidation preference and a preferential cumulative annual distribution of $2.075 per share, payable
quarterly. The Company has outstanding 6,200,000 Series H Preferred Stock shares for which it received net proceeds of $150.1 million. On and after
August 11, 2008, the Series H Preferred Stock shares will be redeemable for cash at the option of the Company, in whole or in part, at a redemption
price equal to the liquidation preference plus dividends owed and unpaid to the redemption date.

Direct Stock Purchase and Distribution Reinvestment
Plan

The Company has a Direct Stock Purchase
and Distribution Reinvestment Plan (“DRSPP”) pursuant to which the Company’s shareholders have the ability to reinvest all or part of
their distributions from the Company’s common stock, preferred stock or limited partnership interests in Mid-America Apartments, L.P. into the
Company’s common stock. The plan also provides the opportunity to make optional cash investments in common shares of at least $250, but not more
than $5,000 in any given month, free of brokerage commissions and charges. The Company, in its absolute discretion, may grant waivers to allow for
optional cash payments in excess of $5,000. To fulfill its obligations under the DRSPP, the Company may either issue additional shares of common stock
or repurchase common stock in the open market. The Company has registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission the offer and sale of up to
4,600,000 shares of common stock pursuant to the DRSPP. Additional shares will be purchased at the market price on the “Investment Date” each
month, which shall in no case be later than ten business days following the distribution payment date. The Company may elect to sell shares under the
DRSPP at up to a 5% discount.

Common stock shares totaling 803,251 in
2005, 413,598, in 2004, and 31,697 in 2003, were acquired by shareholders under the DRSPP. The Company offered an average of a 1.5% discount for
optional cash purchases in 2005 and a 2% discount in the months of August through December in 2004. No discounts were offered in 2003.

Stock Repurchase Plan

In 1999, the Company’s Board of
Directors approved a stock repurchase plan to acquire up to a total of 4.0 million shares of the Company’s common stock. Through December 31,
2005, the Company has repurchased and retired approximately 1.9 million shares of common stock for a cost of approximately $42 million at an average
price per common share of $22.54. No shares were repurchased in 2002, 2003, 2004 or 2005 under the plan.

10.

8-5/8% Series G Cumulative Redeemable Preferred
Stock

In 2002, the Company issued 8-5/8%
Series G Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (“Series G”) with a $25.00 per share liquidation preference and a preferential cumulative
annual distribution of $2.15625 per share, payable monthly. The Company has outstanding 400,000 Series G shares issued in a direct placement with
private investors (“Investors”) for which it received aggregate proceeds of $10 million. On or after November 15, 2004, the Company or the
Investors may give the required one-year notice to redeem or put, respectively, all or part of the Series G shares beginning on or after November 15,
2005, in increments of $1 million. In the event the Investors elect to put all or a part of the Series G to the Company, the Company has the option to
redeem all or a portion of the shares of the Series G in shares of common stock of the Company in lieu of cash.

In accordance with EITF D-98:
Classification and Measurement of Redeemable Securities, as of March 31, 2005, the Company classified the Series G outside of permanent equity as the
Company determined that in the event of a put by the Investors, there were two possible circumstances which were not wholly in control of the Company
that could require the Series G to be redeemed by the Company for cash as opposed to common stock, and thus the Series G should be presented outside of
permanent equity. These circumstances were the delisting of the Company’s common stock from the New York Stock Exchange and the failure to
complete a registration of the Company’s common stock exchanged for the Series G. The December 31, 2004, consolidated balance sheet was adjusted
to conform to such presentation as were the December 31, 2004 and 2003, Statements of Shareholders’ Equity.

F-23

On May 26, 2005, the Company gave the
required one-year notice to redeem all of the issued and outstanding Series G shares on May 26, 2006. As a result, in accordance with Statement No.
150,

Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity

(“Statement 150”), the Company
classified the Series G as a liability within notes payable as of May 26, 2005, on the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Statement 150
also requires that all subsequent dividend payments be classified as interest expense on the consolidated financial statements.

Employee Benefit Plans

401 (k) Savings Plan

The Mid-America Apartment Communities,
Inc. 401(k) Savings Plan is a defined contribution plan that satisfies the requirements of Section 401(a) and 401(k) of the Code. The Company may, but
is not obligated to, make a matching contribution of $0.50 for each $1.00 contributed, up to 6% of the participant’s compensation. The
Company’s contribution to this plan was approximately $389,000, $330,000, and $251,000 in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.

Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Retirement
Plan

The Company has adopted a non-qualified
deferred compensation retirement plan for key employees who are not qualified for participation in the Company’s 401(k) Savings Plan. Under the
terms of the plan, employees may elect to defer a percentage of their compensation and the Company matches a portion of their salary deferral. The plan
is designed so that the employees’ investment earnings under the non-qualified plan should be the same as the earning assets in the Company’s
401(k) Savings Plan. The Company’s match to this plan in 2005, 2004, and 2003 was approximately $31,800, $30,400, and $23,700,
respectively.

Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan for Outside Company
Directors

The Company has adopted a non-qualified
deferred compensation plan for the non-employee directors who serve on the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Directors Deferred Compensation
Plan”). The Directors Deferred Compensation Plan allows directors to receive shares of phantom stock in place of cash fees in increments of 25%.
The phantom stock is then issued either in shares of common stock of the Company or in a comparable cash value in two annual installments following the
director’s retirement from the Board of Directors. In 2005, 2004, and 2003, the Company issued 5,742, 5,931, and 7,879, shares of phantom stock,
with weighted-average grant date fair values of $43.35, $36.59 and $27.67, respectively, to outside directors.

Director Restricted Stock Plan

Beginning with the 2005 Annual Meeting
of Shareholders, non-employee directors elected to the Board of Directors receive a grant of $75,000 worth of restricted shares of common stock. The
shares vest in three equal installments over the director’s three-year term. To begin the program, non-employee directors not sitting for
re-election at the 2005 Annual Meeting of Shareholders received a pro-rata grant representing the number of years left in their term. In 2005, 8,596
shares of restricted stock were granted to non-employee directors with a grant date fair value of $40.71.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

The Mid-America Apartment Communities,
Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”) provides a means for employees to purchase common stock of the Company. The Board of Directors
has authorized the issuance of 150,000 shares for the plan. The ESPP is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors who may
annually grant options to employees to purchase annually up to an aggregate of 15,000 shares of common stock at a price equal to 85% of the market
price of the common stock. For 2005, 2004, and 2003, the ESPP purchased 4,796, 4,801, and 5,162 shares of common stock, with weighted-average grant
date fair values of $37.41, $31.63 and $23.84, respectively.

Inc. Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the “ESOP”) is a non-contributory stock bonus plan that satisfies the requirements of Section 401(a) of
the Internal Revenue Code. Each employee of the Company is eligible to participate in the ESOP after attaining the age of 21 years and completing one
year of service with the Company. Participants’ ESOP accounts will be 100% vested after five years of continuous service, with no vesting prior to
that time. The Company contributed 22,500 shares of common stock to the ESOP upon conclusion of the initial offering. During 2005, 2004, and 2003, the
Company contributed approximately $700,000, $554,000, and $568,000, respectively, to the ESOP which purchased an additional 16,447, 15,104, and 20,489,
shares of common stock, with weighted-average grant date fair values of $42.58, $36.66, and $27.74, respectively.

Restricted Stock and Stock Option Plan

The Company adopted the 1994 Restricted
Stock and Stock Option Plan (the “1994 Plan”) to provide incentives to attract and retain independent directors, executive officers and key
employees. As of January 31, 2004, no further awards may be granted under this plan. The 1994 Restricted Stock and Stock Option Plan was replaced by
the 2004 Stock Plan (collectively the “Plans”) by shareholder approval at the May 24, 2004, Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The Plans
provide(d) for the granting of options to purchase a specified number of shares of common stock (“Options”) or grants of restricted shares of
common stock (“Restricted Stock”). The Plan also allow(ed) the Company to grant options to purchase Operating Partnership Units at the price
of the common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the day prior to issuance of the units (the “LESOP Provision”). The 1994 Plan
authorized the issuance of 2,400,000 common shares or options to acquire shares. The 2004 Stock Plan authorizes the issuance of 500,000 common shares
or options to acquire shares. Under the terms of the 1994 Plan, the Company could advance directors, executive officers, and key employees a portion of
the cost of the common stock or units. The employee advances mature five years from the date of issuance and accrue interest, payable in arrears, at a
rate established at the date of issuance. The Company has also entered into supplemental bonus agreements with the employees which are intended to fund
the payment of a portion of the advances over a five year period. Under the terms of the supplemental bonus agreements, the Company will pay bonuses to
these employees equal to 3% of the original note balance on each anniversary date of the advance, limited to 15% of the aggregate purchase price of the
shares and units. In March of 2002, the Company entered into duplicate supplemental bonus agreements on the then existing options to executive
officers, effectively doubling their advances. The advances become due and payable and the bonus agreement will terminate if the employees voluntarily
terminate their employment with the Company. The Company also agreed to pay a bonus to certain executive officers in an amount equal to the debt
service on the advances for as long as they remain employed by the Company.

As of December 31, 2005, the Company
had advances outstanding relating to the Plan totaling approximately $840,000, which is presented as a reduction to shareholders’ equity in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets. All of the $840,000 advances at December 31, 2005, were to current and one former executive officers and were
at interest rates ranging from 5.59%-6.49% and maturing at various dates from 2007 to 2010.

In 2005, the Company issued 8,852
restricted shares of common stock to executive management under the 2004 Stock Plan with a grant date fair value of $38.50. These shares will vest in
two equal amounts in 2006 and 2007. Recipients will receive dividend payments on the shares of restricted stock prior to vesting.

In 2003, the Company issued 7,471
restricted shares of common stock to executive management with a grant date fair value of $23.42. These shares vested in 2004. Recipients received
dividend payments on the shares of restricted stock prior to vesting.

In 2005, the Board of Directors adopted
the 2005 Key Management Restricted Stock Plan (the “2005 Plan”), a long-term incentive program for key managers and executive officers. The
2005 Plan grants shares of restricted stock based on a sliding scale of total shareholder return over three 12-month periods. Any restricted stock
earned will vest 100% at the end of a three-year restriction period. Recipients will receive dividend payments on the shares of restricted stock during
the restriction period. There is no automatic vesting of the shares.

F-25

In 2002, the Company issued 97,881
restricted shares of common stock to key managers with a grant date fair value of $25.65. As a result of two managers leaving the employment of the
Company, as of December 31, 2005, only 86,477 shares remain issued. These shares will vest 20% a year for five consecutive years beginning in 2007.
Recipients receive dividend payments on the shares of restricted stock prior to vesting. In the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company expensed
approximately $887,000 representing a cumulative charge to amortize the first four years of this plan which the Company previously expected would
expense over the vesting period from 2007 through 2011.

In 2000, the Company issued 10,750
restricted shares of common stock to executive officers with a grant date fair value of $22.1875. These shares vest 10% each over ten years through
2010. The executive officers have the option to accelerate the vesting in lieu of bonuses. As of December 31, 2005, no shares have been vested early.
Recipients receive dividend payments on the shares of restricted stock prior to vesting.

Options granted to employees through
the 1994 Plan vest(ed) annually over five years in the following consecutive amounts: 10%, 10%, 20%, 30%, and 30%. No options have been granted through
the 2004 Stock Plan. A summary of changes in options to acquire shares of the Company’s common stock and Operating Partnership Units, including
grants and exercises pursuant to the LESOP provision, for the three years ended December 31, 2005, is as follows:

Exercise prices for options outstanding
as of December 31, 2005, ranged from $22.14 to $29.50. The weighted average remaining contractual life of those options is 4.4 years.

Long-Term Performance Based Incentive Plan for Executive
Officers

The Compensation Committee by
authorization of the Board of Directors of the Company submitted the Long-Term Performance Based Incentive Plan for Executive Officers (the
“Long-Term Plan”) which was approved by shareholders on June 2, 2003. The Long-Term Plan allows executive management to earn performance
units that convert into shares of restricted stock based on achieving defined total shareholder investment performance levels. The potential award of
performance units which convert into shares of restricted stock is based on the Company’s performance from January 1, 2003, through December 31,
2005. Any performance units earned will be granted based on the closing market price on December 31, 2005, and are immediately convertible into shares
of restricted stock. While these shares of restricted stock will be entitled to dividend payments, they will not be transferable or have voting
privileges until they vest. Dependent upon the executive officer’s continued employment with the Company, any shares of restricted stock awarded
will vest 20% annually from 2006 through 2010.

Segment Information

At December 31, 2005, the Company owned
or had an ownership interest in 132 multifamily apartment communities, including the apartment community owned by the Company’s joint venture, in
12 different states from which it derives all significant sources of earnings and operating cash flows. The Company’s operational structure is
organized on a decentralized basis, with individual property managers having overall responsibility and authority regarding the operations of their
respective properties. Each property manager individually monitors local and area trends in rental rates, occupancy percentages, and operating costs.
Property managers are given the on-site responsibility and discretion to react to such trends in the best interest of the Company. The Company’s
chief operating decision maker evaluates the performance of each individual property based on its contribution to net operating income in order to
ensure that the individual property continues to meet the Company’s return criteria and long term investment goals. The Company defines each of
its multifamily communities as an individual operating segment. It has also determined that all of its communities have similar economic
characteristics and meet the other criteria which permit the communities to be aggregated into one reportable segment, which is acquisition and
operation of the multifamily communities owned.
