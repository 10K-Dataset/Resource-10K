OVERVIEW OF THE COMPANY
Founded in 1994,
Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;) is a Memphis, Tennessee-based
self-administered and self-managed umbrella partnership real estate investment
trust (&#147;REIT&#148;) that focuses on acquiring, owning and operating apartment
communities.  Between 1994 and December
31, 2003, the Company increased the number of properties of which it is the
sole owner from 22 to 124 properties with 34,686 apartment units, representing
an increase of 29,106 apartment units. 
The Company is also a participant in a joint venture with Crow Holdings,
Mid-America CH/Realty LP (&#147;CH/Realty&#148;). 
CH/Realty owned three properties with 1,048 apartment units at December
31, 2003.  The Company retains a 33.33%
ownership interest in the joint venture and is paid a management fee of 4% of
revenues from the apartment communities owned by the joint venture.   
The Company&#146;s business is
conducted principally through Mid-America Apartments, L.P. (the &#147;Operating
Partnership&#148;).  The Company is the sole
general partner of the Operating Partnership, holding 201,502 common units of
partnership interest (&#147;Common Units&#148;) comprising a 1% general partnership
interest in the Operating Partnership as of December 31, 2003.  The Company&#146;s wholly-owned qualified REIT
subsidiary, MAC II of Delaware, Inc., a Delaware corporation, is a limited
partner in the Operating Partnership and, as of December 31, 2003, held
17,010,015 Common Units, or 84.42% of all outstanding Common Units.
The Company employed
1,069 full time and 82 part time employees at December 31, 2003.

OPERATING PHILOSOPHY
The Company&#146;s primary
objective is to maintain a stable cash flow that will fund its dividend through
all parts of the real estate investment cycle. 
The Company focuses on growing through its existing investments and,
when accretive to cash flow and shareholder value, through external
investments.
INVESTMENT
FOCUS.  The Company&#146;s
primary investment focus is on apartment communities in the Southeastern United
States and Texas.  Between 1994 and
1997, the Company grew largely through the acquisition and redevelopment of
existing communities.  Between 1998 and
2000, its concentration was on development of new communities.  








The
Company&#146;s present  focus is on the acquisition of properties that it believes can be
repositioned  with appropriate use of capital and its operating management skills. The
Company is also interested in increasing its investment in properties in larger  and
faster growing markets within its current market area to balance its  portfolio between
small, middle and large-tier markets, and intends to do this  through acquiring apartment
communities with the potential for above average  growth and return through investments
in joint ventures and in direct  purchases. The Company will continue its established
process of selling mature  assets, and will adapt its investment focus to opportunities
and markets.

HIGH
QUALITY ASSETS.  The
Company maintains its assets in excellent condition, believing that continuous
maintenance will lead to higher long-run returns on investment.  It believes that being recognized by civic
and industry trade organizations for the high quality of its properties,
landscaping, and property management will lead to higher rents and
profitability.  The Company periodically
sells assets selectively in order to ensure that its portfolio consists only of
high quality, well-located assets within its market area.
DIVERSIFIED MARKET FOCUS.  The Company believes the stability of its
cash flow is enhanced and it will generate higher risk adjusted cash flow
returns with lower volatility through its diversified investments over large,
middle and small-tier markets throughout the southeastern United States and
Texas. 

INTENSIVE MANAGEMENT FOCUS.  The Company strongly emphasizes on-site
property management. Particular attention is paid to opportunities to increase
rents, raise average occupancy rates, and control costs.  Property managers and regional managers are
given the responsibility for monitoring market trends and the discretion to
react to such trends.  The Company, as
part of its intense management focus, has established a number of training
programs to produce highly competent property managers, leasing consultants and
service technicians who work on-site at the Company&#146;s apartment communities
(the &#147;Communities&#148;) to generate the highest possible income from the Company&#146;s
assets. 

DECENTRALIZED OPERATIONAL STRUCTURE.  The Company operates in a decentralized
manner.  Management believes that its
decentralized operating structure capitalizes on specific market knowledge,
provides greater personal accountability than a centralized structure and is
beneficial in the acquisition, redevelopment and development processes.  To support this decentralized operational
structure, senior and executive management are proactively involved in
supporting and reviewing property operations through extensive asset management
programs and frequent on-site visitations. The Company is currently in the
process of installing a new web-based property management system which
increases the amount of information shared between senior and executive
management and the properties, and does so on a real time basis, improving the
support provided to the operating environment. 


PROACTIVE  BALANCE
SHEET AND PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT

The Company focuses on
maximizing the return on assets and adding to the intrinsic underlying value of
each share of the Company&#146;s common stock, routinely reviewing each asset based
on its determined value and selling those which no longer fit its investment
criteria.  The Company constantly
evaluates the effectiveness of its capital allocations and makes adjustments to
its strategy, including investing in existing and new apartment communities,
debt retirement, and repurchases or issuances of shares of the Company&#146;s
preferred and common stock.









STRATEGIES
The Company seeks to
increase operating cash flow and earnings per share to maximize shareholder
value through a balanced strategy of internal and external growth.
OPERATING GROWTH STRATEGY.  Management&#146;s goal is to maximize the
Company&#146;s return on investment in each Community by increasing rental rates and
reducing operating expenses while maintaining high occupancy levels.  The Company seeks higher net rental revenues
by enhancing and maintaining the competitiveness of the Communities and
managing expenses through its system of detailed management reporting and
accountability in order to achieve increases in operating cash flow.  The steps taken to meet these objectives
include: 

 
  
  &#149;
  
  empowering the Company&#146;s property managers to adjust
  rents in response to local market conditions and to concentrate resident
  turnover during peak rental demand months;
 
 
  
   
  
   
 
 
  
  &#149;
  
  offering new services to residents, including
  telephone, cable, and internet access, on which the Company generates fee and
  commission income;
 
 
  
   
  
   
 
 
  
  &#149;
  
  implementing programs to control expenses through
  investment in cost-saving initiatives, such as the installation of individual
  apartment unit water and utility meters in certain Communities;
 
 
  
   
  
   
 
 
  
  &#149;
  
  analyzing individual asset productivity performances
  to identify best practices and improvement areas;
 
 
  
   
  
   
 
 
  
  &#149;
  
  improving the &#147;curb appeal&#148; of the Communities
  through extensive landscaping and exterior improvements and repositioning
  Communities from time to time to maintain market leadership positions;
 
 
  
   
  
   
 
 
  
  &#149;
  
  compensating employees through performance-based
  compensation and stock ownership programs; 
 
 
  
   
  
   
 
 
  
  &#149;
  
  maintaining a hands-on management style and &#147;flat&#148;
  organizational structure that emphasizes senior management&#146;s continued close
  contact with the market and employees; 
 
 
  
   
  
   
 
 
  
  &#149;
  
  selling or exchanging underperforming assets and
  repurchasing or issuing shares of common and preferred stock when cost of
  capital and asset values permit;
 
 
  
   
  
   
 
 
  
  &#149;
  
  allocating additional capital where the investment
  will generate the highest returns for the Company; and
 
 
  
   
  
   
 
 
  
  &#149;
  
  developing new ancillary income programs aimed at
  delivering new consumer services and products to its residents while
  generating fee income for the Company.
 


JOINT VENTURE STRATEGY.  One of the Company&#146;s strategies is to
co-invest with private capital partners in joint venture opportunities which
enable it to obtain a higher return on its investment through management fees,
which leverages the Company&#146;s recognized skills in acquiring, repositioning,
redeveloping and managing multifamily investments. In addition, the joint
venture investment strategy provides a platform for creating more capital
diversification and lower investment risk for the Company. The Company is
actively seeking attractively priced opportunities in which it and its joint
venture partner









can  invest.  The
Company established a joint  venture in 2002 with Crow Holdings and established a second
joint venture with  Crow Holdings in early 2004.

DISPOSITION STRATEGY.  The Company is committed to the selective
disposition of mature assets, defined as those apartment communities that no
longer meet the Company&#146;s investment criteria and long-term strategic
objectives.  Typically, the Company
selects assets for disposition that do not meet its present investment criteria
including future return on investment, location, market, potential for growth,
and capital needs. 
On July 10, 2003, the
Company sold the Crossings apartments, an 80-unit apartment community in
Memphis, Tennessee, that was built in 1973. 
ACQUISITION STRATEGY.  One of the Company&#146;s growth strategies is to
acquire and redevelop apartment communities that meet its investment criteria
and focus as discussed above. The Company has extensive experience and
research-based skills in the acquisition and repositioning of multifamily
properties. In addition, the Company will acquire newly built and developed
properties that can be purchased on a favorable pricing basis. The Company will continue to evaluate
opportunities that arise, and will utilize this strategy to increase the share
of its assets in faster growing and larger markets in the Southeast and Texas.
On January 20, 2003,
CH/Realty acquired The Preserve at Arbor Lakes, a 284-unit apartment community
in Jacksonville, Florida.  
On February 7, 2003, the
Company acquired the Green Oaks apartments, a 300-unit apartment community
located in Grand Prairie, Texas.  On May
1, 2003 the Company transferred the Green Oaks apartments to CH/Realty.
On May 6, 2003, the
Company acquired the Jefferson Pines apartments, a 308-unit apartment community
located in Houston, Texas.
On August 25, 2003, the
Company purchased the limited partnership interest held by Blackstone Real
Estate Advisors (&#147;Blackstone&#148;) in BRE/MAAC Associates, LLC (&#147;BreMaac&#148;), a joint
venture between the Company and Blackstone which owned 10 properties containing
2,793 apartment units. 
On September 30, 2003,
the Company acquired Los Rios Park apartments, a 498-unit community located in
Plano, Texas.

On December 3, 2003, the
Company acquired the Lighthouse Court apartments, a 501-unit community located
in Jacksonville, Florida.
DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY.  In late 1997, the Company&#146;s emphasis shifted
from acquisitions to development because of its belief that under then-current
market conditions, such development would generate higher quality assets and
higher long-term investment returns.  In
2002, the Company completed a $300 million construction program of high quality
apartments in several markets.  This
represents the completion of the development program initiated in 1997.  In 1999, management decided to exit the
construction and development business upon completion of the Company&#146;s existing
development pipeline after determining that market conditions were changing,
making it unlikely that future proposed projects would meet the Company&#146;s
profitability targets over the next few years.









As  of December
31, 2003, the Company had no properties in development.  The Company periodically
evaluates  opportunities for profitable future development investments.

COMMON
AND PREFERRED STOCK.  
The Company continuously
reviews opportunities for lowering its cost of capital, and increasing value
per share. The Company evaluates opportunities to repurchase stock when it
believes that its stock price is below the value of its assets and accordingly
repurchased common stock, funded by asset sales, between 1999 and 2001. The
Company also looks for opportunities where it can acquire or develop
communities, selectively funded by stock sales, when it will add to shareholder
value and the investment return is projected to substantially exceed its cost
of capital. The Company also opportunistically seeks to lower its cost of
capital through refinancing preferred stock and debt such as it did in 2003.
On July 10, 2003, in an underwritten public
offering, the Company sold 5,600,000 shares of its 8.30% Series H Cumulative
Redeemable Preferred Stock (&#147;Series H&#148;) at $25 per share less an underwriting
discount of $0.7875 per share.  The net
proceeds of the sale were applied to the redemption of all the issued and
outstanding shares of the Company&#146;s 9.5% Series A Cumulative Preferred Stock
and 9 3/8% Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock as well as 1,600,000
shares of the 1,938,830 issued and outstanding shares of the Company&#146;s 8 7/8%
Series B Cumulative Preferred Stock (&#147;Series B&#148;) on August 12, 2003.
On July 16, 2003, the underwriters of the Company&#146;s
Series H offering exercised an option to purchase an additional 525,000 shares
of the Series H preferred stock for $25 per share less the underwriting
discount, and on August 4, 2003, the underwriters exercised an option to
purchase the remaining additional 75,000 shares of the Series H preferred stock
for $25 per share less the underwriting discount.  The net proceeds were used to redeem the remaining issued and
outstanding shares of the Series B preferred stock on August 18, 2003.

On August 22, 2003, the Company sold 700,000 shares
of its common stock to certain advisory clients of Cohen &amp; Steers Capital
Management, Inc. The stock was sold at a price of $28.40 per share. The
$19,870,000 in net proceeds from the sale were used to partially fund the purchase
of the BreMaac limited partnership interest held by Blackstone.
On September 19, 2003, the Company sold 665,000
shares of its common stock to certain advisory clients of Cohen &amp; Steers
Capital Management, Inc. and to Scudder RREEF Real Estate Fund II, Inc. The
stock was sold at a price of $29.36 per share. The $19,500,000 in net proceeds
from the sale were used to partially fund the purchase the Los Rios Park
apartments.
On December 2, 2003, the Company sold 400,000
shares of its common stock to RREEF America, L.L.C. on behalf of itself and
Scudder RREEF Real Estate Fund II, Inc. The stock was sold at a price of $30.00
per share. The $11,996,000 in net proceeds from the sale were used to partially
fund the acquisition of the Lighthouse Court apartments.
SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM
In 1999, the Company&#146;s
Board of Directors approved an increase in the number of shares of the
Company&#146;s common stock authorized to be repurchased to 4 million shares.  As of December 31, 2003 the Company had
repurchased a total of approximately 1.86 million shares (8% of the shares of
common stock and Common Units outstanding as of the beginning of the repurchase
program).  From time to time the Company
intends to sell assets based on its disposition strategy outlined in this
Annual Report and 








use  the
proceeds to repurchase shares when it believes that shareholder value is  enhanced.  Factors
affecting this  determination include the share price, asset dispositions and pricing,
financing agreements and rates of return of alternative investments.  No shares were
repurchased during 2002 or  2003 under this plan.

COMPETITION
All of the Company&#146;s
Communities are located in areas that include other apartment communities.  Occupancy and rental rates are affected by
the number of competitive apartment communities in a particular area.  The owners of competing apartment
communities may have greater resources than the Company, and the managers of
these communities may have more experience than the Company&#146;s management.  Moreover, single-family rental housing,
manufactured housing, condominiums and the new and existing home markets
provide housing alternatives to potential residents of apartment communities.
Apartment
communities compete on the basis of monthly rent, discounts, and facilities
offered such as apartment size and amenities, and apartment community
amenities, including recreational facilities, resident services, and physical
property condition.  The Company makes
capital improvements to both the Communities and individual apartments on a
regular basis in order to maintain a competitive position in each individual
market.
ENVIRONMENTAL
MATTERS
As
part of the acquisition process, the Company generally obtains environmental
studies on all of its Communities from various outside environmental
engineering firms.  The purpose of these
studies is to identify potential sources of contamination at the Communities
and to assess the status of environmental regulatory compliance.  These studies generally include historical
reviews of the Communities, reviews of certain public records, preliminary
investigations of the sites and surrounding properties, visual inspection for
the presence of asbestos, PCBs and underground storage tanks and the
preparation and issuance of written reports. 
Depending on the results of these studies, more invasive procedures,
such as soil sampling or ground water analysis, will be performed to
investigate potential sources of contamination.  These studies must be satisfactorily completed before the Company
takes ownership of an acquisition property, however, no assurance can be given
that the studies identify all significant environmental problems.
Under
various federal, state and local laws and regulations, an owner or operator of
real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain
hazardous or toxic substances on properties. 
Such laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the
owner caused or knew of the presence of hazardous or toxic substances and
whether or not the storage of such substances was in violation of a resident&#146;s
lease.  Furthermore, the cost of
remediation and removal of such substances may be substantial, and the presence
of such substances, or the failure to promptly remediate such substances, may
adversely affect the owner&#146;s ability to sell such real estate or to borrow
using such real estate as collateral.

The
Company is aware of environmental concerns specifically relating to potential
issues resulting from mold in residential properties and has in place an active
management and preventive maintenance program that includes procedures
specifically related to mold.  The
Company has established a policy requiring residents to sign a mold addendum to
lease.  The Company has also purchased a
$2 million insurance policy that covers remediation and exposure to mold.  The current policy expires in 2007, but is
renewable at that time. The Company, therefore, believes that its exposure to
this issue is limited and controlled.








The
environmental studies received by the Company have not revealed any material
environmental liabilities.  The Company
is not aware of any existing conditions that would currently be considered an
environmental liability.  Nevertheless,
it is possible that the studies do not reveal all environmental liabilities or
that there are material environmental liabilities of which the Company is
unaware.  Moreover, no assurance can be
given concerning future laws, ordinances or regulations, or the potential introduction
of hazardous or toxic substances by neighboring properties or residents. 
The
Company believes that its Communities are in compliance in all material
respects with all applicable federal, state and local ordinances and
regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances and other environmental

The Company&#146;s quarterly
dividend rate is currently $0.585 per common share.  The Board of Directors reviews and declares the dividend rate
quarterly.  Actual dividends made by the
Company will be affected by a number of factors, including the gross revenues
received from the Communities, the operating expenses of the Company, the
interest expense incurred on borrowings and unanticipated capital expenditures.
The Company currently
pays a preferential regular distribution on the Series F, Series G and Series H
Preferred Stock at annual rates of $2.3125, $2.15625 and $2.075 per share,
respectively.  No distribution may be made
on the Company&#146;s common stock unless all accrued distributions have been made
with respect to each series of the Company&#146;s preferred stock.  No assurance can be given that the Company 









will  be able
to maintain its distribution rate on its common stock or make required  distributions
with respect to the Series F, Series G and Series H Preferred  Stock.

Future distributions by
the Company will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend
on the actual funds available for distribution of the Company, its financial
condition, capital requirements, the annual distribution requirements under the
REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and such other factors as the
Board of Directors deems relevant.
The Company has
established the Direct Stock Purchase and Distribution Reinvestment Plan (the
&#147;DSPDRP&#148;) under which holders of common stock (and Series F, Series G and
Series H Preferred Stock) can elect automatically to reinvest their
distributions in additional shares of common stock and/or to make optional
purchases of common stock free of brokerage commissions and charges of at least
$250, but not more than $5,000 in any given month.  To fulfill its obligations under the DSPDRP, the Company may
either issue additional shares of common stock or repurchase common stock in
the open market.  The Company may elect
to sell shares under the DSPDRP at up to a 5% discount, but did not sell any
shares at a discount in 2003.  
Information related to
securities authorized for issuance under equity compensation plans as required
in paragraph (d)(2) of this Item is incorporated by reference to the Company&#146;s
definitive proxy statement to be filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.

ITEM
7.   MANAGEMENT&#146;S DISCUSSION AND  ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This and other sections
of this Annual Report contain certain forward-looking statements within the
meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section
21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which are intended to
be covered by the safe harbors created thereby. These statements include, but
are not limited to, statements about anticipated growth rate of revenues and
expenses, planned asset dispositions, disposition pricing, and planned
acquisition and developments.  Although
the Company believes that the assumptions underlying the forward-looking
statements are reasonable, any of the assumptions could be inaccurate and,
therefore, there can be no assurance that the forward-looking statements
included in this report on Form 10-K will prove to be accurate. In light of the
significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements included
herein, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a
representation by the Company or any other person that the objectives and plans
of the Company will be achieved. 
The following are risks
that the Company believes could cause results to differ from projected or
forecasted results or could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s
business.
The
Company&#146;s ability to make distributions may be adversely affected by factors
beyond its control
The Company&#146;s ability to
generate sufficient cash flow in order to pay common dividends to its
shareholders depends on its ability to generate funds from operations in excess
of capital expenditure requirements and common dividends, and/or to have access to
the markets for debt and equity financing. Funds from operations and the value
of the Company&#146;s properties may be less because of factors which are beyond the
Company&#146;s control. Such events or conditions could include:


  
  &#149;
  
  
  competition from other apartment communities;
 
 
  
   
  
   
 
 
  
  &#149;
  
  overbuilding of new apartment units or oversupply of
  available apartment units in the Company&#146;s markets, which might adversely
  affect apartment occupancy or rental rates and/or require rent concessions in
  order to lease apartment units;
 
 
  
   
  
   
 
 
  
  &#149;
  
  increases in operating costs (including real estate
  taxes and insurance premiums) due to inflation and other factors, which may
  not be offset by increased rents;
 
 
  
   
  
   
 
 
  
  &#149;
  
  the Company&#146;s inability to rent apartments on favorable
  economic terms;
 
 
  
   
  
   
 
 
  
  &#149;
  
  changes in governmental regulations and the related
  costs of compliance;
 
 
  
   
  
   
 
 
  
  &#149;
  
  changes in tax laws and housing laws including the
  enactment of rent control laws or other laws regulating multifamily housing;
 
 
  
   
  
   
 
 
  
  &#149;
  
  changes in interest rate levels and the availability
  of financing, which could lead renters to purchase homes (if interest rates
  drop and home loans are more readily available) or increase the Company&#146;s
  acquisition and operating costs (if interest rates increase and financing is
  less readily available);
 










 
  
   
  
   
  
   
 
 
 
  
  &#149;
  
  weakness in the overall economy which lowers job
  growth and the associated demand for apartment housing;
 
 
  
   
  
   
  
   
 
 
  
  &#149;
  
  decisions relating to the dispositions of assets by
  the Company&#146;s joint ventures; and
 
 
  
   
  
   
  
   
 
 
  
  &#149;
  
  the relative illiquidity of real estate
  investments.  
 


Currently, the Company
relies on external funding sources to fully fund the payment of distributions
to shareholders at the current rate. 
While the Company has sufficient liquidity to permit distributions at
current rates through additional borrowings, any significant and sustained
deterioration in operations could result in the Company&#146;s financial resources
being insufficient to pay distributions to shareholders at the current rate, in
which event the Company would be required to cut the distribution rate.  Any decline in the Company&#146;s funds from
operations or property values because of these factors which are beyond its
control could adversely affect the Company&#146;s ability to make distributions to
its shareholders and could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s
stock price.
Debt
level and refinancing risk may adversely affect financial condition and
operating results

At December 31, 2003, the
Company had total debt outstanding of $951.9 million. Payments of principal and
interest on borrowings may leave the Company with insufficient cash resources
to operate the Communities or pay distributions required to be paid in order
for the Company to maintain its qualification as a REIT. The Company currently
intends to limit its total debt to around 60% of the undepreciated book value
of its assets, although the Company&#146;s charter and bylaws do not limit its debt
levels. Circumstances may cause the Company to exceed that target from time to
time. As of December 31, 2003, the Company&#146;s ratio of debt to undepreciated
book value was approximately 54%. The Company&#146;s Board of Directors can modify
this policy at any time which could allow the Company to become more highly
leveraged and decrease its ability to make distributions to its
shareholders.  In addition, the Company
must repay its debt upon maturity, and the inability to access debt or equity
capital at attractive rates could adversely affect the Company&#146;s financial condition
and/or its funds from operations.

Variable
interest rates may adversely affect our funds from operations
At December 31, 2003,
effectively $216.6 million of the Company&#146;s debt bore interest at a variable
rate and was unhedged and uncapped. In addition, the Company may incur
additional debt in the future that also bears interest at variable rates.
Variable-rate debt creates higher debt service requirements if market interest
rates increase, which would adversely affect the Company&#146;s funds from
operations and the amounts available to pay distributions to shareholders.  The Company&#146;s $611 million secured credit
facility with Prudential Mortgage Capital, credit enhanced by Fannie Mae, is
predominately a floating rate facility, the interest rates on which have been
hedged by means of a number of interest rate swaps and caps.  Upon the termination of these swaps and
caps, the Company will be exposed to the risks of varying interest rates.
Increasing insurance costs may negatively impact financial
condition
Because the Company has
substantial real estate holdings, the cost of insuring its communities is a
significant component of expense. 
Premiums for property and casualty insurance have risen significantly in
recent years.  If the cost of property
and casualty insurance continues to rise, its cost of doing business 









would  likely
rise, which may in turn negatively impact the Company&#146;s financial  condition and
its ability to pay its dividend. 


CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
The following discussion
and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon
the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements, and the notes thereto, which
have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America.  The
preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the Company to
make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and
disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.  On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates and
assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and
circumstances.  The Company believes
that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable in the circumstances;
however, actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions under
different future conditions.  
The Company believes that
the estimates and assumptions that are most important to the portrayal of its
financial condition and results of operations, in that they require the most
subjective judgments, form the basis of accounting policies deemed to be most
critical.  These critical accounting
policies include capitalization of expenditures and depreciation of assets,
impairment of long-lived assets, including goodwill, and fair value of
derivative financial instruments.
Capitalization
of expenditures and depreciation of assets
The Company carries its
real estate assets at their depreciated cost. 
Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated
useful lives of the related assets, which range from 8 to 40 years for land
improvements and buildings, to 5 years for furniture, fixtures, and equipment,
and 3 years for computers, all of which are judgmental determinations.  Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed
as incurred while significant improvements, renovations, and replacements are
capitalized.  The cost to complete any
deferred repairs and maintenance at properties acquired by the Company in order
to elevate the condition of the property to the Company&#146;s standards are
capitalized as incurred.
Impairment
of long-lived assets, including goodwill

The Company accounts for
long-lived assets in accordance with the provisions of Statement No. 144,
Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets (Statement 144)
and evaluates its goodwill for impairment under Statement No. 142, Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets (Statement 142). The Company evaluates its goodwill for
impairment on an annual basis in the
Company&#146;s fiscal fourth quarter, or sooner if a goodwill impairment indicator
is identified. The Company periodically evaluates its long-lived assets,
including its investments in real estate and goodwill, for indicators that
would suggest that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable.
The judgments regarding the existence of such indicators are based on factors
such as operating performance, market conditions, and legal factors.  

To evaluate goodwill and
long-lived assets for impairment, the Company estimates future operating
cash flows and uses these cash flow estimates to determine the asset&#146;s fair
value. In the apartment industry, the primary method used for determining fair
values is to divide annual operating cash flows by an appropriate
capitalization rate. The Company determines the appropriate capitalization rate
by reviewing the prevailing rates in the Community&#146;s market or submarket.










Fair  value
of derivative financial instruments 


The Company utilizes
certain derivative financial instruments, primarily interest rate swaps, during
the normal course of business to manage, or hedge, the interest rate risk
associated with the Company&#146;s variable rate debt or as hedges in anticipation
of future debt transactions to manage well-defined interest rate risk
associated with the transaction.  The
valuation of the derivative financial instruments under SFAS No. 133 requires
the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the
instruments.
In order for a derivative
contract to be designated as a hedging instrument, the relationship between the
hedging instrument and the hedged item must be highly effective. The Company
performs effectiveness tests using the change in the variable cash flows method
at the inception of the hedge and for each reporting period thereafter, through
the term of the hedging instruments. Any amounts determined to be ineffective
are recorded in earnings.  The fair
value of the hedges are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income.
While the Company&#146;s
calculation of hedge effectiveness contains some subjective determinations, the
historical correlation of the cash flows of the hedging instruments and the
underlying hedged item are measured by the Company before entering into the
hedging relationship and have been highly related.      

OVERVIEW OF THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003
The
Company&#146;s operating results for 2003 were impacted by continued economic
weakness. The Company believes that the primary factor impacting demand for its
apartments is job formation, which was slightly negative or static in most of the
Company&#146;s markets during 2003. This reduced the occupancy of its apartments,
affected its ability to grow rents, and increased the amount of concessions
that it had to offer to attract residents. Advertising and marketing
expenditures also had to be increased to attract new residents. The Company
regards single family housing as the primary competition for its existing
residents, and low interest rates that existed throughout the year allowed
its residents to purchase homes and impacted the Company&#146;s occupancy rates. The
Company began to see some improvement in the fourth quarter and expects
operations to improve as the economy improves. 
Offsetting
the impact to operations, the Company was able to continue its debt refinancing strategy and take advantage of the low
interest rate environment by reducing the interest rates on its variable rate
debt. As a result, the Company was able to lower its average interest rate
and experienced interest expense savings. The Company was also able
to lower the dividend payments on its preferred stock by redeeming the
Preferred Series A, B &amp; C and issuing a new series of preferred stock,
Series H at a lower yield.
The
Company achieved external growth during 2003 by following its acquisition
strategy to invest in large and mid-sized growing markets in the southeastern
United States and in Texas. The Company made acquisitions both directly and
through a joint venture partnership with Crow Holdings. The Company also purchased
the 2/3 share of its joint venture owned by Blackstone Real Estate Advisors
that was formed in 1999. The Company funded part of these purchases through
some selective direct sales of shares of common stock. 
The
financings and acquisitions made during 2003 helped the Company continue its
strategy of improving the flexibility of its balance sheet and enhancing its
ability to strengthen its dividend coverage.








The
following is a discussion of the consolidated financial condition and results of
operations of the Company for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002, and
2001.  This discussion should be read in
conjunction with all of the consolidated financial statements included in this
Annual Report on Form 10-K.

As of December 31, 2003,
the total number of apartment units the Company owned or had an ownership
interest in, including the properties owned by the Company&#146;s joint ventures was
35,734 in 127 Communities, compared to the 33,923 apartment units in 123
Communities owned at December 31, 2002, and the 33,411 apartment units in 122
Communities owned at December 31, 2001. 
For properties owned 100% by the Company, the average monthly rental per
apartment unit, excluding units in lease-up, increased to $667 at December 31,
2003 from $661 at December 31, 2002 and $660 at December 31, 2001.  For these same units, overall occupancy at
December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 was 92.7%, 91.9%, and 92.7%,
respectively.  
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
COMPARISON OF THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003 TO THE YEAR
ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002
Comparisons of income
from property operations for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 were
impacted by four main factors. First, as a result of the buyout of the
partnership interest in Bre/Maac Associates, LLC, (the &#147;BRE/MAAC Buyout&#148;), the
Company&#146;s joint venture with Blackstone Real Estate Advisors (&#147;Blackstone&#148;),
the Company&#146;s consolidated financials for 2003 include the impact of
approximately four months of operations of the 10 properties which were
previously owned by the joint venture and accounted for using the equity
method. Second, the Company acquired four properties in 2003 (one of which was
subsequently transferred to Mid-America CH/Realty, LP, the Company&#146;s joint
venture with Crow Holdings). Third, during the years 2003 and 2002, the Company
still had three development communities which were in various stages of
lease-up. Finally, the Company&#146;s performance during 2003 and 2002 was impacted
by changes in performance of the communities that were held throughout both periods.
Property revenues for
2003 increased by approximately $7,713,000 due primarily to increases of (i)
$6,156,000 from the BRE/MAAC Buyout, (ii) $3,841,000 from the acquisitions of
Green Oaks, Los Rios Park, Legacy Pines and Lighthouse Court apartments in 2003
(the &#147;2003 Acquisitions&#148;), and (iii) $1,431,000 from the development
communities.  These increases were partially offset by a decrease in property revenues of $3,715,000 from the
communities owned throughout both periods.

Property operating expenses
include costs for property personnel, building repairs and maintenance, real
estate taxes and insurance, utilities, landscaping and other property related
costs.  As a percentage of total
property revenues, property operating expenses increased to 42.0% in 2003
compared to 40% in 2002.  Property
operating expenses for 2003 increased by approximately $7,996,000 due primarily
to increases of (i) $2,999,000 due to the BRE/MAAC Buyout, (ii) $2,796,000 from
the communities held throughout both periods, (iii) $1,908,000 due to the 2003
Acquisitions, and (iv) $293,000 due to the development communities.
Included in the above is
real estate taxes and insurance which increased approximately $2,994,000 from
2002 to 2003 due to increases of (i) $1,220,000 due to increased insurance
costs associated with the renewal of the Company&#146;s property and casualty
insurance and (ii) $1,774,000 due to increases in real estate taxes, $1,393,000
of which was related to the BRE/MAAC Buyout and 2003 Acquisitions.








Depreciation and
amortization expense increased by approximately $3,908,000 from the prior year
primarily due to increases of (i) $2,304,000 due to the BRE/MAAC Buyout, (ii)
$1,460,000 due to the 2003 Acquisitions, (iii) $120,000 due to the communities
owned throughout both periods and (iv) $24,000 from the development
communities.  

General and
administrative expense increased 8.6% or $570,000 as compared to the prior
year. This increase was mainly related to increased compensation incentives and
salaries, partially related to the addition of new personnel hired to address
recent regulatory requirements.  
Property management
expenses decreased 2.3% or $198,000 as compared to the prior year.  The decrease was mainly due to reductions in
bonuses.

Interest expense decreased
approximately $3,416,000 from 2002 due primarily to the Company&#146;s ability to
take advantage of the decline in interest rates in 2002 and 2003.  The Company&#146;s average borrowing cost at
December 31, 2003 was 5.4% as compared to 5.8% on December 31, 2002.  

For the years ended
December 31, 2003, and 2002, the Company recorded net gains on disposition of
assets and insurance settlement proceeds totaling $2,942,000, mainly related to insurance settlements from the fire
 at the Company headquarters in March 2002, and $397,000,
primarily related to insurance settlements, respectively. 

In 2003 and 2002, the
Company refinanced several of its communities primarily to take advantage of
the lower interest rate environment. 
This resulted in a gain of $111,000 related to the early extinguishment
of debt in 2003 and a loss of approximately $1,444,000 in 2002.  

In 2003, the Company
recorded a gain on discontinued operations of $1,919,000 related to the sale of
the Crossings apartments in 2003.  No
properties were sold in 2002.

As a result of the
foregoing, net income increased by $4,065,000 in 2003 over 2002.

COMPARISON OF THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 TO THE YEAR
ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001

Property revenues for
2002 increased by approximately $955,000 due primarily to increases of (i)
$2,707,000 from the development communities and (ii) $1,424,000 from the acquisition
of the Preston Hills apartments in 2002 (&#147;2002 Acquisitions&#148;).  These increases were partially offset by
decreases of (i) $2,104,000 due to the sales of the Advantages and Canyon Creek
apartments in 2001 (&#147;2001 Dispositions&#148;), and (ii) $1,072,000 from the
communities owned throughout both periods.
Property operating
expenses include costs for property personnel, building repairs and
maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance, utilities, landscaping and other
property related costs.  As a percentage
of total property revenues, property operating expenses increased to 40.0% in
2002 compared to 38.7% in 2001. 
Property operating expenses for 2002 increased by approximately
$3,306,000 due primarily to increases of (i) $589,000 due to the development
communities, (ii) $571,000 due to the 2002 Acquisitions, and (iii) $3,021,000
due to the communities owned throughout both periods.  These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $875,000
from the 2001 Dispositions.
Included in the above is
real estate taxes and insurance which increased approximately $2,354,000 from
2001 to 2002 due to increases of (i) $1,598,000 due to increased insurance
costs associated with the 









renewal  of the
Company&#146;s property and casualty insurance and (ii) $756,000 due to  increases in
real estate taxes.

Depreciation and
amortization expense increased by approximately $3,185,000 from the prior year
primarily due to increases of (i) $874,000 due to the development communities,
(ii) $374,000 due to the 2002 Acquisitions and (iii) $2,279,000 due to the
communities owned throughout both periods. 
These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $342,000 from the
2001 Dispositions.  
General and
administrative expense increased 2.2% or $143,000 as compared to the prior
year.  Increases in D&amp;O insurance
premiums, bank service charges due to the reduction of cash balances held by
the Company throughout the year, increased compensation incentives, increased
software maintenance expense, and increased legal and director fees due to new
regulatory and compliance requirements were partially offset by a decrease in
airplane repairs from the prior year and the absence of an airplane lease in
2002 following the purchase of a plane to reduce expenses.  
Property management expenses
decreased 9.7% or $928,000 as compared to the prior year.  The decrease was mainly due to reductions in
bonuses and salaries, reduced health insurance costs and reduced franchise and
excise taxes from 2001 which year included a one-time franchise and excise tax
settlement.
Interest expense
decreased approximately $3,150,000 from 2001 due primarily to the Company&#146;s
ability to take advantage of the decline in interest rates in the second half
of 2001 and throughout 2002.  The
Company&#146;s average borrowing cost at December 31, 2002 was 5.8% as compared to
6.3% on December 31, 2001.  The average
maturity on the Company&#146;s debt was 10.9 years at December 31, 2002.  Amortization of deferred financing costs was
$2,712,000 and $2,352,000 for 2002 and 2001, respectively.
For the year ended
December 31, 2002, the Company recorded a net gain on disposition of assets and
insurance settlement proceeds totaling $397,000 primarily related to insurance
settlements.  For the year ended December
31, 2001, the Company recorded a net gain on disposition of assets and
insurance settlement proceeds totaling $11,933,000 primarily related to the
disposition of two properties during the year. 


In 2002 and 2001, the
Company refinanced several of its communities primarily to take advantage of
the lower interest rate environment. 
This resulted in a loss of approximately $1,444,000 due to the early
extinguishment of debt in 2002 and approximately $1,189,000 in 2001.  
As a result of the
foregoing, net income decreased by $12,557,000 in 2002 over 2001.
FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS
Funds from operations
(&#147;FFO&#148;) represents net income (computed in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or &#147;GAAP&#148;)
excluding extraordinary items, minority interest in Operating Partnership
income, gain or loss on sale of discontinued operations and insurance
settlement proceeds, plus depreciation and amortization of real estate, and
adjustments for joint ventures to reflect FFO on the same basis.  This definition of FFO is in accordance with
the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trust&#146;s (&#147;NAREIT&#148;)
recommended definition.
The Company&#146;s policy is
to expense the cost of interior painting, vinyl flooring, and blinds as
incurred for stabilized properties.  During
the stabilization period for acquisition properties, these items are








capitalized  as
part of the total repositioning program of newly acquired properties, and,  thus are not
deducted in calculating FFO.

FFO should not be
considered as an alternative to net income or any other GAAP measurement of
performance, as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to
cash flow from operating, investing, and financing activities as a measure of
liquidity.  The Company believes that
FFO is helpful in understanding the Company&#146;s operating performance in that
such calculation excludes depreciation expense on real estate assets.  The Company believes that GAAP historical
cost depreciation of real estate assets is generally not correlated with
changes in the value of those assets, whose value does not diminish predictably
over time, as historical cost depreciation implies.  The Company&#146;s calculation of FFO may differ from the methodology
for calculating FFO utilized by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be
comparable to such other REITs.  
The following table is a
reconciliation of FFO to net income for the three years ended December 31,
2003, 2002 and 2001 (dollars and shares in thousands):

Net income increased
during 2003 by approximately $4,065,000 to $20,206,000 versus $16,141,000 in
2002, principally because of reduced interest expenses, a $1,919,000 gain on
the sale of the Crossings apartments which is classified as a discontinued
operation and $2,942,000 net gain on insurance settlement proceeds which were
only partially offset by the increase in depreciation and amortization from
acquisitions. Net income for 2001 was $28,698,000 which included a gain of
$11,933,000 from dispositions of assets and insurance settlement proceeds.










FFO  increased
during 2003 by approximately $2,014,000 to $55,367,000 versus  $53,353,000 in 2002
principally because of reduced interest expense.  FFO for 2001 was $56,023,000. FFO
for 2003  and 2002 included charges of $5,987,000 and $2,041,000, respectively, for
premiums and original issuance costs associated with the redemption of  preferred stock.

TRENDS 
Property performance over
the past two years has been pressured by an imbalance between supply and demand
for apartment units in many of the Company&#146;s markets.  The recent economic downturn and the related low interest rate
environment have combined to contribute to a temporary decline in demand for
apartment units, while allowing delivery levels of newly constructed apartment
units to remain consistent with historical averages.  
The recent economic
environment has impacted demand in two main ways: 1) producing lower job
growth, which reduced the number of potential renters in most of the Company&#146;s
markets, and 2) producing lower interest rates which has increased the
affordability of single family housing, prompting more renters to purchase
homes.  
On the supply side, the
declining interest rates have provided an incentive to developers to construct
new apartment units in many of the Company&#146;s markets, especially in the larger
metropolitan markets.  Delivery of these new
units during this period of weakened apartment demand has increased
competition, adding pressure to apartment occupancy levels and pricing in a
number of the Company&#146;s markets.  
As part of its strategy
to create continued stable and growing performance, the Company maintains a
portfolio of properties diversified across large metropolitan markets,
mid-sized markets, and smaller tier markets, as defined by population
levels.  During the recent economic
downturn, the Company&#146;s smaller tier and mid-sized markets produced more stable
performance, while it&#146;s larger metropolitan markets proved more susceptible to
declining job formation and apartment supply imbalances.  
The Company is beginning
to see indications of stronger job growth in many of its markets, which could
indicate an improvement in the general economic environment. As the economic
environment improves, the Company expects to see more household formations and
increasing interest rates, which should combine to increase the number of
apartment renters.  

The Company expects that
this increase in demand will generate stronger property performance across the
Company&#146;s portfolio. The Company&#146;s large-tier markets, which have been under
the most pressure during the economic downturn, should begin to absorb the
oversupply of new apartment units and return to historical occupancy and
pricing levels, while the Company&#146;s smaller-tier and mid-sized markets would
benefit from improving market fundamentals which support continued stable
growth.  
Over the long term,
general demographic trends are expected to favor apartment owners, as
immigration growth, combined with the increasing demand for rental housing from
the &#147;echo boomers&#148; (children of the &#147;baby boomers&#148;) is expected to produce more
apartment renters over the next ten years. 
The Company believes its portfolio location throughout the Southeast and
South central regions of the country position it well to take advantage of
these improving demographic trends. 
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Net cash flow provided by
operating activities remained relatively stable at $79,241,000 for 2003
compared to $81,076,000 for 2002.







Net cash used in
investing activities grew during 2003 to $139,934,000 from $34,182,000 in
2002.  This increase was primarily due
to (i) the purchase of Legacy Pines for $21,500,000, Green Oaks for $18,966,00,
the partnership interest in our joint venture with Blackstone for $21,853,000,
Los Rios Park for $32,500,000 and Lighthouse Court for $40,092,000 compared to
one acquisition of Preston Hills in 2002 for $33,900,000, and (ii) in 2003
dispositions totaled $24,906,000, including the transfer of a 2/3 interest in
Green Oaks to CH/Realty for $12,644,000, compared to dispositions of
$36,841,000 in 2002.
Capital improvements to
stabilized properties during the 2003 and 2002 totaled $23,211,000 and
$23,083,000, respectively.  Actual
capital expenditures are summarized below (dollars in thousands):

In 2002,
corporate/commercial capital improvements was mainly related to the fire at the
Company&#146;s corporate headquarters in March of 2002, for which the Company was
reimbursed with insurance proceeds of $5,235,000 in 2003.
Net cash provided by
financing activities was approximately $60,251,000 for 2003 compared to net
cash used in financing activities of $48,492,000 in 2002.  During 2003 the Company increased its
borrowings under its credit lines by $218,399,000 as compared to an increase of
$60,623,000 in 2002 to accommodate refinancing activities and property
acquisitions.

In 2003, the Company
negotiated an increase from $550 million to $611 million in the borrowing
capacity of its existing secured credit facility with Prudential Mortgage
Capital, credit enhanced by Fannie Mae (the &#147;FNMA Facility&#148;).  The expanded capacity may be utilized only
as additional collateral is pledged to secure the facility.  At December 31, 2003 the FNMA Facility had
an outstanding balance of $555.7 million with an available borrowing base
capacity of $596.1 million.  $303
million of the FNMA Facility expires in 2004, renewable for two successive
5-year terms, $249 million expires in 2007, and the remaining amount expires in
2008, both renewable for a 5-year term. 
The Company plans to utilize the additional facility capacity to
refinance debt maturities over the next 18 months.
The FNMA Facility
provides for both fixed and variable rate borrowings.  The interest rate on the variable portion renews every 90 days
and is based on the FNMA Discount Mortgage Backed Security (&#147;DMBS&#148;) rate on the
date of renewal, which has typically approximated three-month LIBOR less an
average spread of 0.07%, plus a credit enhancement fee of 0.60% to 0.72% based
on the outstanding borrowings.  The variable
interest rate at December 31, 2003 was 1.8% on variable rate borrowings of
$445.7 million.  Fixed rate borrowings
under the FNMA Facility totaled $110 million at December 31, 2003, at interest
rates (inclusive of credit-enhancement fees) from 5.77% to 7.71%, and
maturities from 2006 to 2009. 
Compass Bank provides an
unsecured credit facility to the Company. 
Outstanding borrowings under this facility at December 31, 2003 were $20
million at a rate of 1.66%.








The  Company
currently maintains a $40 million secured credit facility with two  banks led by AmSouth
Bank.  There was no  outstanding balance under this facility at December 31, 2003.  Available
borrowing base capacity under this  facility was $19.0 million at December 31, 2003.

Each of the Company&#146;s
credit facilities is subject to various covenants and conditions on usage
including the maintenance of certain financial ratios The total amount of
credit which is made available is governed by lender formulas defining asset
valuation. If the Company were to fail to satisfy a condition to borrowing, the
available credit under one or more of the facilities could not be drawn, which
could adversely affect the Company&#146;s liquidity.  Moreover, if the Company were to fail to make a payment or violate
a covenant under a credit facility, after applicable cure periods one or more
of its lenders could declare a default, accelerate the due date for repayment
of all amounts outstanding and/or foreclose on properties securing such
facilities which may cause the Company to be declared in default by its other
lenders.  Any such event could have a
material adverse effect on the Company.

At December 31, 2003, the
Company had a promissory note with Union Planters National Bank (&#147;Union
Planters&#148;) for $40 million at a variable rate of 2.2%.
The Company uses interest
rate swaps to manage its current and future interest rate risk.   The Company has nine interest rate swaps
with a total notional balance of $275 million which have variable legs based on
one or three-month LIBOR, and fixed legs with an average rate of 6.2%.  The swaps have expirations between 2005 and
2010, and have to date proven to be highly effective hedges of the Company&#146;s
designated variable rate borrowings of its FNMA Facility.  The Company has designed these interest rate
swaps as cash flow hedges on its FNMA Facility.  Through the use of these swaps the Company believes it has
effectively fixed the borrowing rate during these periods of $275 million of
variable rate borrowings issued through the FNMA Facility, leaving only $170.7
million of the FNMA Facility of which the interest rate has not been fixed or
hedged. The Company also has a $55.6 million Tax-Free Bond Facility with
FNMA.  The Company has five interest
rate swaps with a total notional amount of $42.7 million which have variable
legs based on the BMA Municipal Swap Index and fixed legs with an average rate
of 4.3%.  These swaps expire in 2007 and
2008, and have to date proven to be highly effective hedges of the designated
borrowings of the Tax-Free Bond Facility. The Company also entered into a cap agreement on a notional amount of
$6.8 million within the Tax-Free Bond Facility.  The 5-year cap agreement has a strike rate of 6% as indexed on
the BMA Municipal Swap Index. Additionally, the Company has one interest rate
swap with a notional amount of $25 million which has a variable leg
based on three-month LIBOR, and a fixed leg with an average rate of 4.6% which
expires in 2009 and has to date proven to be a highly effective hedge of the
designated borrowings of Union Planters. 
The Company has also
executed one forward interest rate swap with a notional balance of $40 million
which goes into effect in 2004.  The
variable leg of the forward interest rate swap is based on three-month LIBOR and
the fixed leg has an average rate of 4.9%. 
The swap expires in 2010 and is designated as a cash flow hedge on
future planned refinancings.

In March 2003, the
Company had approximating $151 million of debt maturing including the $142
million of bond indebtedness of Mid-America Capital Partners, L.P., which it
funded by debt issued under the FNMA Facility. The rate on the maturing debt
was 6.5% and the rate on the replacement debt which was partially pre-set
through interest rate swaps was 5.6%.  
The weighted average
interest rate and the weighted average maturity at December 31, 2003, for the
$951.9 million of debt outstanding were 5.4% and 10.6 years compared to 5.8%
and 10.9 years on $803.7 million of debt outstanding at December 31, 2002.









On  July 10,
2003, in an underwritten public offering, the Company sold 5,600,000  shares of its 8.30%
Series H Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (&#147;Series H&#148;)  at $25 per share
less an underwriting discount of $0.7875 per share.  The net proceeds of the sale
were applied to  the redemption of all the issued and outstanding shares of the Company&#146;s
9.5%  Series A Cumulative Preferred Stock and 9 3/8% Series C Cumulative Redeemable
Preferred Stock as well as 1,600,000 shares of the 1,938,830 issued and  outstanding
shares of the Company&#146;s 8 7/8% Series B Cumulative Preferred Stock  (&#147;Series B&#148;)
on August 12, 2003.

On July 16, 2003, the underwriters of the Company&#146;s
Series H offering exercised an option to purchase an additional 525,000 shares
of the Series H preferred stock for $25 per share less the underwriting
discount, and on August 4, 2003, the underwriters exercised an option to
purchase the remaining additional 75,000 shares of the Series H preferred stock
for $25 per share less the underwriting discount.  The net proceeds were used to redeem the remaining issued and
outstanding shares of the Series B preferred stock on August 18, 2003.
On August 22, 2003, the Company sold 700,000 shares
of its common stock to certain advisory clients of Cohen &amp; Steers Capital
Management, Inc. The stock was sold at a price of $28.40 per share. The
$19,870,000 in net proceeds from the sale were used to partially fund the
purchase of the BreMaac limited partnership interest held by Blackstone.

On September 19, 2003, the Company sold 665,000
shares of its common stock to certain advisory clients of Cohen &amp; Steers
Capital Management, Inc. and to Scudder RREEF Real Estate Fund II, Inc. The
stock was sold at a price of $29.36 per share. The $19,500,000 in net proceeds
from the sale were used to partially fund the purchase of the Los Rios
Park apartments.
On December 2, 2003, the Company sold 400,000
shares of its common stock to RREEF America, L.L.C. on behalf of itself and
Scudder RREEF Real Estate Fund II, Inc. The stock was sold at a price of $30.00
per share. The $11,996,000 in net proceeds from the sale were used to partially
fund the acquisition of the Lighthouse Court apartments.
On October 16, 2002, the
Company closed the sale of 470,000 shares of a new 9&#188;% Series F Cumulative
Redeemable Preferred Stock (&#147;Series F Preferred Stock&#148;).  An additional 4,500 shares were sold as part
of the underwriters option on November 8, 2002.  All of the shares were sold at $25 per share for an aggregate
principal amount of $11.86 million.  
On October 28, 2002, the
Company privately placed 400,000 shares of a new 8 5/8% Series G Cumulative
Redeemable Preferred Stock (&#147;Series G Preferred Stock&#148;) at $25 per share for an
aggregate principal amount of $10 million. On or after October 10, 2004, the
Company or the investor may give the required one year&#146;s notice to redeem or
put, respectively, all or part of the Series G Preferred Stock beginning on or
after October 10, 2005 in increments of $1 million. 
The net proceeds from the
issuances of the Series F Preferred Stock and Series G Preferred Stock along
with $5 million of debt were used to repurchase and retire all of the 1,000,000
shares of the Company&#146;s Series E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock at a 7%
premium (totaling $2.0 million including the write-off of previous issuance costs)
for an aggregate purchase price of $26.75 million.
The Company believes that
it has adequate resources to fund both its current operations, annual
refurbishment of its properties, and incremental investment in new apartment
properties.  The Company is relying on
the efficient operation of the financial markets to finance debt maturities,
and also is heavily reliant on the creditworthiness of FNMA, which provides
credit enhancement for nearly $611 million of









the  Company&#146;s
outstanding debt.  The market  for FNMA DMBS, which in the Company&#146;s experience
is highly effective with  three-month LIBOR interest rates, is also an important
component of the  Company&#146;s liquidity and swap effectiveness.  In the event
that the FNMA DMBS market becomes less efficient, or the  credit of FNMA becomes
impaired, the Company would seek alternative sources of  debt financing.

The Company believes that
cash provided by operations is adequate and anticipates that it will continue
to be adequate in both the short and long-term to meet operating requirements
(including recurring capital expenditures at the communities) and payment of
distributions by the Company in accordance with REIT requirements under the
Internal Revenue Code.  The Company has
loan covenants that limit the total amount of distributions, but believes that
it is unlikely that these will be a limiting factor on the Company&#146;s future
levels of distributions based on the Company&#146;s current range of forecast of
operating performance.  The Company
expects to meet its liquidity requirements, such as scheduled mortgage debt
maturities, property acquisitions, expansions, and non-recurring capital
expenditures, through collateralized borrowings, potential joint venture
transactions and the Company&#146;s credit facilities.
Currently, the Company&#146;s
operating cash flow is insufficient to fully fund the payment of distributions
to shareholders at the current rate. 
While the Company has sufficient liquidity to permit distributions at
current rates through additional borrowings, any significant deterioration in
operations could result in the Company&#146;s financial resources to be insufficient
to pay distributions to shareholders at the current rate, in which event the
Company would be required to cut the distribution rate.

reflects the Company&#146;s total contractual cash obligations which consists of its
long-term debt as of December 31, 2003 (dollars in 000&#146;s):

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
At December 31, 2003 and
2002, the Company did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities
or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as &#147;structured
finance&#148; or &#147;special purpose entities&#148;, established for the purpose of
facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or
limited purposes.  The Company&#146;s joint
venture with Blackstone (terminated in 2003) was established in order to raise
capital through asset sales to fund development while acquiring management fees
to help offset the reduction in FFO from the sale.  The Company&#146;s joint venture with Crow Holdings was established to
acquire approximately $150 million of multifamily properties.  In addition, the Company does not engage in
trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts.  As such, the Company is not materially exposed
to any financing, liquidity, market, or credit risk that could arise if it had
engaged in such relationships.  The
Company does not have any relationships or transactions with persons or
entities that derive benefits from their non-independent relationships with 









the  Company or
its related parties other than what is disclosed in Item 8.,  Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial  Statements, Note 11.

The Company&#146;s investments
in its real estate joint venture is unconsolidated and is recorded on the
equity method as the Company does not have a controlling interest.  The Company has a mezzanine loan in the
amount of $4.7 million at an average rate of 9% receivable from its joint
venture, CH/Realty.
INSURANCE
The
Company put in place a new property and casualty insurance program effective
July 1, 2003.  The program is
substantially the same as last year.  In
the opinion of management, property and casualty insurance is in place that
provides adequate coverage to provide financial protection against normal
insurable risks such that it believes that any loss experienced would not have
a significant impact on the Company&#146;s liquidity, financial position, or results
of operations.
INFLATION

Substantially all of the
resident leases at the Communities allow, at the time of renewal, for adjustments
in the rent payable there under, and thus may enable the Company to seek rent
increases.  Almost all leases are for
one year or less.  The short-term nature
of these leases generally serves to reduce the risk to the Company of the
adverse effects of inflation. 

IMPACT OF RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
In April 2002, the FASB
issued Statement No. 145, Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64,
Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections (Statement
145).  The rescission of Statement No.
4, Reporting Gains and Losses from Extinguishment of Debt and Statement No. 64,
Extinguishments of Debt made to Satisfy Sinking-Fund Requirements eliminates an
exception to general practice relating to the determination of whether certain items
should be classified as extraordinary and is effective in fiscal years
beginning after May 15, 2002, with earlier implementation encouraged.  The rescission of Statement No. 44 and all
other provisions of Statement 145 are effective for fiscal years beginning
after May 15, 2002.  As a result of the
adoption of Statement 145, the Company reclassified $1,444,000, representing
extraordinary gain (before minority interest adjustment) on early
extinguishment of debt for the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, to a
component of operating income.
In December 2003, The
FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003), Consolidation
of Variable Interest Entities (&#147;FIN46R&#148;). 
FIN46R replaces FASB Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities, which was issued in January 2003, and addresses how a business
enterprise should evaluate whether it has a controlling financial interest in
an entity through means other than voting rights and how, accordingly, it
should consolidate the entity.  The
Company will be required to apply FIN46R to variable interests in variable
interest entities (&#147;VIEs&#148;) created after December 31, 2003.  For variable interests in VIEs created
before January 1, 2004, FIN46R will be applied beginning on January 10,
2005.  For any VIEs that were created
before January 1, 2004 which must be consolidated under FIN46R, the assets,
liabilities and noncontrolling interest of the VIE would initially be measured
at their carrying values with any difference between the net amount added to
the balance sheet and any previously recognized interest being recognized as
the cumulative effect of an accounting change. 
If determining the carrying amounts is not practicable, fair value at
the date FIN46R first applies may be used to measure the assets, liabilities
and noncontrolling interest of the VIE. 
The 









adoption  of
FIN46R is not expected to have a material impact on the Company&#146;s  consolidated
financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole.

In April 2003, the FASB
issued Statement No. 149, Amendment of Statement No. 133, Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. 
Statement 149 amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting
for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded
in other contracts (collectively referred to as derivatives) and for hedging
activities under FASB Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities.  Statement 149
is effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003.  The adoption of Statement 149 did not have a
material effect on the Company&#146;s consolidated financial condition or results of
operations taken as a whole.  
In May 2003, the FASB
issued Statement No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with
Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity.  Statement 150 requires issuers to classify as liabilities (or
assets in some circumstances) financial instruments within the scope of the
statement that embody unconditional obligations for the issuer.  Statement 150 was effective for financial
instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise was
effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June 15,
2003.  The adoption of Statement 150 had
no effect on the Company&#146;s consolidated financial condition or results of
operations taken as a whole.
ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE
AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
The Company&#146;s primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest
rates obtainable on its secured and unsecured borrowings.  At December 31, 2003, 50% of the Company&#146;s
total capitalization consisted of borrowings. 
The Company&#146;s interest rate risk objective is to limit the impact of
interest rate fluctuations on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall
borrowing costs.  To achieve this
objective, the Company manages its exposure to fluctuations in market interest
rates for its borrowings through the use of fixed rate debt instruments to the
extent that reasonably favorable rates are obtainable with such arrangements
and may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate
swaps, caps and treasury locks to mitigate its interest rate risk on a related
financial instrument or to effectively fix the interest rate on a portion of
its variable debt or on future refinancings. 
The Company does not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions
for trading purposes.  Approximately 77%
of the Company&#146;s outstanding debt was subject to fixed rates with a weighted
average of 6.5% at December 31, 2003. 
The Company regularly reviews interest rate exposure on its outstanding
borrowings in an effort to minimize the risk of interest rate fluctuations.  







The
table below provides information about the Company&#146;s financial instruments that
are sensitive to changes in interest rates. 
For debt obligations, the table presents principal cash flows and
related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates.  For interest rate swaps and the Company&#146;s
interest rate cap, the table presents the notional amount of the swaps and cap
and the years in which they expire.  Weighted
average variable rates are based on rates in effect at the reporting date
(dollars in 000&#146;s).

ITEM 8.   FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND
SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

The Independent Auditors&#146;
Report, Consolidated Financial Statements and Selected Quarterly Financial
Information are set forth on pages F-1 to F-25 of this Annual Report on Form
10-K.

ITEM 9.   CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH
ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE
There have been no
disagreements with the Company&#146;s independent accountants on any matter of
accounting principles or practices or financial statement disclosure.
ITEM 9A.   CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
The Company maintains
disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in its Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC&#146;s rules
and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the
Company&#146;s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. Management necessarily applied its judgment in assessing the costs
and benefits of such controls and procedures which, by their nature, can
provide only reasonable assurance regarding management&#146;s control objectives.
The Company also has an investment in an unconsolidated entity which is not
under its control. Consequently, the Company&#146;s disclosure controls and
procedures with respect to this entity are necessarily more limited than those
it maintains with respect to its consolidated subsidiaries.









As  of the end
of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was carried out  under the
supervision and with the participation of the Company&#146;s management,  including the
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the  effectiveness of the design
and operation of the Company&#146;s disclosure controls  and procedures pursuant to Rule
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities  Exchange Act of 1934 (the &#147;Exchange Act&#148;).
Based upon that evaluation, the  Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
concluded that the  Company&#146;s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in
timely alerting  them to material information relating to the Company (including its
consolidated subsidiaries) that is required to be included in the Company&#146;s
Exchange Act filings.  

CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

During
the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, there were no significant changes in
the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting that materially
affected, or that are reasonably likely to affect, the registrant&#146;s internal
control over financial reporting. 

Special Note
Regarding Analyst Reports 
Investors
should also be aware that while the Company&#146;s management does, from time to
time, communicate with securities analysts, it is against the Company&#146;s policy
to disclose to them any material non-public information or other confidential
commercial information. Accordingly, shareholders should not assume that the
Company agrees with any statement or report issued by any analyst irrespective
of the content of the statement or report. Furthermore, the Company has a
policy against issuing or confirming financial forecasts or projections issued
by others. Thus, to the extent that reports issued by securities analysts
contain any projections, forecasts or opinions, such reports are not the
responsibility of Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS&#146; REPORT

The Board of Directors
and Shareholders
Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.

          We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Mid-America
Apartment Communities, Inc. and subsidiaries (the &#147;Company&#148;) as of December 31,
2003 and 2002 and the related consolidated statements of operations,
shareholders&#146; equity and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended December 31, 2003.  In
connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we have
also audited the accompanying financial statement Schedule III:  Real Estate and Accumulated Depreciation.  These financial statements and the financial
statement schedule are the responsibility of the management of the
Company.  Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and the financial
statement schedule based on our audits.
          We
conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America.  Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements.  An audit also
includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation.  We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.


          In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects the financial position of the Company as of
December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the results of the their operations and their
cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31,

Mid-America
Apartment Communities,  Inc.Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsYears ended
December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001

1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies
Organization and Formation of the
Company
Mid-America Apartment
Communities, Inc. (&#147;Mid-America&#148;) is a self-administrated and self-managed real
estate investment trust which owns, acquires and operates multifamily apartment
communities mainly in the southeastern United States, and in Texas.  The company owns and operates 124 apartment
communities principally through its majority owned subsidiary, Mid-America
Apartments, L.P. (the &#147;Operating Partnership&#148;). The Company also owns a 33.33%
interest in a real estate joint venture which owns 3 apartment communities, for
which the Company provides management services.    
Basis
of Presentation
The consolidated
financial statements presented herein include the accounts of Mid-America, the
Operating Partnership, and all other subsidiaries (&#147;the Company&#148;).  The Company owns 51% to 100% of all
consolidated subsidiaries.  The Company
uses the equity method of accounting for its investments in 20 to 50
percent-owned entities for which the Company does not have the ability to
exercise control.  All significant
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Minority Interest

Minority interest in the
accompanying consolidated financial statements relates to the ownership
interest in the Operating Partnership by the holders of Class A Common Units of
the Operating Partnership (&#147;Operating Partnership Units&#148;).  Mid-America is the sole general partner of
the Operating Partnership.  Net income
is allocated to the minority interest based on their respective ownership
percentage of the Operating Partnership. 
Issuance of additional common shares or Operating Partnership Units
changes the ownership of both the minority interest and Mid-America.  Such transactions and the proceeds there
from are treated as capital transactions and result in an allocation between
shareholders&#146; equity and minority interest to account for the change in the
respective percentage ownership of the underlying equity of the Operating Partnership.

The Company&#146;s Board of
Directors established economic rights in respect to each Operating Partnership
Unit that were equivalent to the economic rights in respect to each share of
common stock.  The holder of each unit
may redeem their units in exchange for one share of common stock or cash, at
the option of the Company.  The
Operating Partnership has followed the policy of paying the same per unit
distribution in respect to the units as the per share distribution in respect
to the common stock.  Operating
Partnership net income for 2003, 2002 and 2001 was allocated approximately
14.6%, 15.7%, and 16.2%, respectively, to holders of Operating Partnership
Units and 85.4%, 84.3%, and 83.8%, respectively, to Mid-America.
Use of Estimates
Management of the Company
has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of
assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities,
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses to prepare these financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America.  Actual
results could differ from those estimates.
F-6








Revenue
Recognition

The Company leases
multifamily residential apartments under operating leases primarily with terms
of one year or less.  Rental and other
revenues are recorded when earned which is not materially different than on a
straight-line basis.

The Company records all
gains and losses on real estate in accordance with SFAS No. 66.
Rental Costs
Costs associated with
rental activities are expensed as incurred. 
Certain costs associated with the lease-up of development projects,
including cost of model units, their furnishings, signs, and &#147;grand openings&#148;
are capitalized and amortized over their respective estimated useful
lives.  All other costs relating to
renting development projects are expensed as incurred.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers
cash, investments in money market accounts and certificates of deposit with
original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Restricted Cash
Restricted cash consists
of escrow deposits held by lenders for property taxes, insurance, debt service
and replacement reserves.
Real Estate Assets and
Depreciation
Real estate assets are
carried at depreciated cost.  Repairs
and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred while significant improvements,
renovations, and replacements are capitalized. 
The cost of interior painting, vinyl flooring and blinds are expensed as
incurred.
In conjunction with
acquisitions of properties, the Company&#146;s policy is to provide in its
acquisition budgets adequate funds to complete any deferred maintenance items
to bring the properties to the required standard, including the cost of
replacement appliances, carpet, interior painting, vinyl flooring and
blinds.  These costs are capitalized.
Depreciation is computed
on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets
which range from 8 to 40 years for land improvements and buildings and 5 years
for furniture, fixtures and equipment and 3 years for computers. 

For real estate
acquisitions subsequent to June 30, 2001, the effective date of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards 141, Business
Combinations, the fair value of the real estate acquired is
allocated to the acquired tangible assets, consisting of land, building,
furniture, fixtures and equipment, and identified intangible assets and
liabilities, consisting of above and below market leases, resident relationship
values and the value of in-place leases.
The fair value of the
tangible assets of an acquired property (land, building, furniture, fixtures
and equipment) is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant.   The &#147;as-if-vacant&#148; value is then allocated
to land, building, furniture, fixtures and equipment based on management&#146;s
determination of the relative fair values of these assets.  Management determines the as-if-vacant fair
value of a property using methods similar to those used by independent
appraisers.  Factors considered by
management in performing these analyses include an estimate of  carrying costs  during the period of time that would be required in the current
market conditions to lease-up the property. 
Management includes real estate taxes, insurance, operating expenses and
lost rentals as well as the costs required to execute similar leases in the
estimated carrying costs.    

In allocating the fair
value of identified intangible assets and liabilities of an acquired property,
the in-place leases are compared to current market conditions.  Based on these evaluations, management
believes that the leases acquired on each of its property acquisitions were at
market rates since the lease terms do not extend beyond one year. 
The fair value of the
in-place leases and resident relationships is measured by the excess of the
purchase price over the as-if-vacant value of the property as described
above.   The fair value of the in-place
leases and resident relationships is then amortized over the remaining term of
the resident leases.  The amount of
these resident lease intangibles included in real estate assets totaled $4.9
million and $0 as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively and the
amortization recorded as a reduction of property income was $1.4 million and $0
for the years ending December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.   

Goodwill
and Intangible Assets 

The Company accounts for
long-lived assets in accordance with the provisions of Statement No. 144,
Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets and evaluates
its goodwill for impairment under Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets.  The Company
evaluates its goodwill for impairment on an annual basis during the Company&#146;s fiscal
fourth quarter. The Company periodically evaluates its long-lived assets,
including its investments in real estate and goodwill, for indicators that
would suggest that the carrying amount of the assets may not be
recoverable.  The judgments regarding
the existence of such indicators are based on factors such as operating
performance, market conditions, and legal factors.  

To evaluate goodwill and
long-lived assets for impairment, the Company estimates future operating
cash flows and uses these cash flow estimates to determine the asset&#146;s fair
value.  In the apartment industry, the
primary method used for determining fair value is to divide annual operating
cash flows by 
F-7








an  appropriate
capitalization rate.  The  Company determines the appropriate capitalization rate by
reviewing the  prevailing rates in a property&#146;s market or submarket.

The
Company&#146;s 2003 annual evaluation indicated no impairment of goodwill for its
reporting units.  The Company will continue to test reporting
unit goodwill for potential impairment on an annual basis in the Company&#146;s
fiscal fourth quarter, or sooner if a goodwill impairment indicator is
identified.
As
of the date of adoption, the Company had unamortized goodwill in the amount of
$5.8 million, all of which was subject to the transition provisions of
Statement 142.  Statement 142 requires
disclosure of what net income would have been in all periods presented
exclusive of amortization expense recognized in those periods related to
goodwill.  Below is a reconciliation of
reported net income to adjusted net income and earnings per share (Dollars in
thousands, except earnings per share):

Land Held for Future Development
Real estate held for future development are sites
intended for future multifamily developments and are carried at the lower of cost or fair value. 


Investment
In and Advances to Real Estate Joint Ventures
The Company&#146;s investment
in its unconsolidated real estate joint venture is recorded on the equity
method as the Company is able to exert significant influence but does not have a controlling interest in the joint
venture.  
Deferred Costs and Other
Intangibles
Deferred financing costs
are amortized over the terms of the related debt using a method which
approximates the interest method.  
Derivative Financial Instruments
In the normal course of
business, the Company uses certain derivative financial instruments to manage,
or hedge, the interest rate risk associated with the Company&#146;s variable rate
debt or as hedges in anticipation of future debt transactions to manage
well-defined interest rate risk associated with the transaction. 

F-8








The  Company
does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or  trading purposes.  Further,
the Company  has a policy of entering into contracts with major financial institutions
based  upon their credit rating and other factors.  When viewed in conjunction with
the underlying and offsetting exposure  that the derivatives are designated to hedge, the
Company has not sustained any  material loss from those instruments nor does it
anticipate any material  adverse effect on its net income or financial position in the
future from the  use of derivatives. 

The Company requires that
derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges be effective in
reducing the interest rate risk exposure that they are designated to
hedge.  This effectiveness is essential
for qualifying for hedge accounting. 
Instruments that meet the hedging criteria are formally designated as
hedging instruments at the inception of the derivative contract.  The Company formally documents all
relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its
risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge
transaction.  This process includes
linking all derivatives that are designated as fair-value or cash flow hedges
to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific firm
commitments or forecasted transactions. 
The Company also formally assesses, both at the inception of the hedging
relationship and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives used are highly
effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged
items.  When it is determined that a
derivative has ceased to be a highly effective hedge, the Company discontinues
hedge accounting prospectively.  
All of the Company&#146;s
derivative financial instruments are reported at fair value and represented on
the balance sheet, and are characterized as cash flow hedges.  These transactions hedge the future cash
flows of debt transactions through interest rate swaps that convert variable
payments to fixed payments.  The
unrealized gains/losses in the fair value of these hedging instruments are
reported on the balance sheet with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated
other comprehensive income, with any ineffective portion of the hedging
transactions reclassified to earnings. 
During the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, the ineffective
portion of the hedging transactions was not significant.  Within the next twelve months, the Company
expects to reclassify to earnings an estimated $100,000 of the current balance
held in accumulated other comprehensive income due to the ineffectiveness
associated with the hedging transactions.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In April 2002, the FASB
issued Statement No. 145, Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64,
Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections (Statement
145).  The rescission of Statement No.
4, Reporting Gains and Losses from Extinguishment of Debt and Statement No. 64,
Extinguishments of Debt made to Satisfy Sinking-Fund Requirements eliminates an
exception to general practice relating to the determination of whether certain
items should be classified as extraordinary and is effective in fiscal years
beginning after May 15, 2002, with earlier implementation encouraged.  The rescission of Statement No. 44 and all
other provisions of Statement 145 are effective for fiscal years beginning
after May 15, 2002.  As a result of the
adoption of Statement 145, the Company reclassified $1,444,000 and $1,189,000, representing
extraordinary gain (before minority interest adjustment) on early
extinguishment of debt for the twelve months ended December 31, 2002, and 2001, respectively, to a
component of operating income.
In December 2003, the
FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003), Consolidation
of Variable Interest Entities (&#147;FIN46R&#148;). 
FIN46R replaces FASB Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities, which was issued in January 2003, and addresses how a business
enterprise should evaluate whether it has a controlling financial interest in
an entity through means other than voting rights and how, accordingly, it
should consolidate the entity.  The
Company will be required to apply FIN46R to variable interests in variable
interest entities (&#147;VIEs&#148;) created after December 31, 2003.  For variable interests in VIEs created
before January 1, 2004, FIN46R will be applied beginning on January 10, 2005.  For any VIEs that were created before
January 1, 2004 which must be consolidated under FIN46R, the assets,
liabilities and noncontrolling interest of the VIE would 

F-9









initially  be
measured at their carrying values with any difference between the net amount  added to
the balance sheet and any previously recognized interest being  recognized as the
cumulative effect of an accounting change.  If determining the carrying amounts is
not  practicable, fair value at the date FIN46R first applies may be used to measure  the
assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interest of the VIE.  The adoption of FIN46R
is not expected to  have a material impact on the Company&#146;s consolidated financial
condition or  results of operations taken as a whole.

In April 2003, the FASB
issued Statement No. 149, Amendment of Statement No. 133, Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. 
Statement 149 amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting
for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded
in other contracts (collectively referred to as derivatives) and for hedging
activities under FASB Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities.  Statement 149
is effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003.  The adoption of Statement 149 had no effect
on the Company&#146;s consolidated financial condition or results of operations
taken as a whole.  
In May 2003, the FASB
issued Statement No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with
Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity.  Statement 150 requires issuers to classify as liabilities (or
assets in some circumstances) financial instruments within the scope of the
statement that embody unconditional obligations for the issuer.  Statement 150 was effective for financial
instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise was
effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June 15,
2003.  The adoption of Statement 150 had
no effect on the Company&#146;s consolidated financial condition or results of
operations taken as a whole.

Stock-Based
Compensation

The
Company adopted the 1994 Restricted Stock and Stock Option Pan (the &#147;Plan&#148;) to
provide incentives to attract and retain independent directors, executive
officers and key employees.  See Note 8
for further details. 
The Company has adopted
SFAS No. 123, &#147;Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation&#148;, which requires either
the (i) fair value of employee stock-based compensation plans be recorded as a
component of compensation expense in the statement of operations as of the date
of grant of awards related to such plans, or (ii) impact of such fair value on
net income and earnings per share be disclosed on a pro forma basis in a
footnote to financial statements for awards granted after December 15, 1994, if
the accounting for such awards continues to be in accordance with Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25, &#147;Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,&#148;
(&#147;APB 25&#148;).  The Company will continue
such accounting under the provisions of APB 25. 

The following table
reflects the effect on net income (loss) if the fair value method of accounting
allowed under SFAS No. 123 had been used by the Company along with the
applicable assumptions utilized in the Black-Scholes option pricing model
calculation (dollars and shares in thousands, except per share data):

2.   Real Estate Joint
Ventures
Through August 25, 2003,
the Company owned a 33.33% interest in a joint venture (&#147;Bre/MAAC&#148;) with
Blackstone Real Estate Acquisitions, LLC (&#147;Blackstone&#148;) which was formed in
1999 when the Company sold 10 apartment communities containing 2,793 apartment
units to Bre/MAAC for $97.9 million. On 

F-11








August  25,
2003 the Company paid $ 21.9 million in cash and assumed $ 53.2 million in  debt to
purchase Blackstone&#146;s 66.67% interest in the joint venture.  This acquisition
was accounted for under the  purchase method of accounting in accordance with Statement
of Financial  Accounting Standards No. 141, Business  Combinations.  The
purchase  accounting adjustments include an adjustment to the carrying value of the real estate
asset resulting from the previously unrecognized deferred gain on the
Company&#146;s retained interest from the original sale of the properties to  Bre/MAAC in
1999 and the recording of certain intangible assets.   The operating results of
Bre/MAAC are  included in the accompanying statement of operations commencing August 25,
2003.

3.   Borrowings
The Company maintains a
$611 million secured credit facility with Prudential Mortgage Capital, credit-
enhanced by FNMA (the &#147;FNMA Facility&#148;). 
$303 million of the FNMA Facility expires in 2004, 
F-12








renewable  for
two successive 5-year terms, $249 million expires in 2007, and the  remaining amount
expires in 2008, both renewable for a 5-year term.  The FNMA Facility provides for
both fixed  and variable rate borrowings.  The  interest rate on the variable
portion renews every 90 days and is based on the  FNMA discount mortgage backed security
rate on the date of renewal, which, for  the Company, has historically approximated
three-month LIBOR less an average of  0.07%, plus a fee of 0.60% to 0.72%.  Borrowings
under the FNMA Facility totaled $555.7 million at December 31,  2003, consisting of $110
million under the fixed portion at a rate of 7.179%  and the remaining $445.7 million
under the variable rate portion of the  facility. The available borrowing base capacity
at December 31, 2003 was $596.1  million. The average variable interest rate of the
facility at December 31,  2003 was 1.85%.  The Company has nine  interest rate swap
agreements, totaling $275 million to effectively fix the  interest rate on a portion of
the variable rate borrowings outstanding under  the FNMA Facility at approximately 6.18%.  The
swaps are highly effective and are designed as cash flow  hedges.  The FNMA Facility
is subject to  certain borrowing base calculations that effectively reduce the amount
that may  be borrowed. 

Additionally, the Company
has a $55.6 million Tax-Free Bond Facility with FNMA.  $42.7 million of the facility is swapped on the BMA Municipal
Swap Index.  The swaps, which are highly
effective cash flow hedges, expire in 2007 and 2008 and effectively fix
interest rates at 4.3% through this period. 


The Company also maintains
a $40 million secured credit facility with a group of banks led by AmSouth Bank
(the &#147;AmSouth Credit Line&#148;).  The
AmSouth Credit Line bears an interest rate of LIBOR plus a spread ranging from
1.35% to 1.75% based on certain quarterly coverage calculations established by
the agreement.  The spread in 2003 was
1.35%. This credit line expires in May 2005 and is subject to certain borrowing
base calculations that effectively reduce the amount that may be borrowed.  At December 31, 2003, the Company had $19.0
million available to be borrowed under the AmSouth Credit Line agreement with
no outstanding balance under this facility. 
$10.9 million of the facility is used for letters of credit, including
$4.8 million used to credit-enhance a tax-free bond. 
The Company also had
outstanding at December 31, 2003 a $20 million unsecured short-term note
payable with Compass Bank at an interest rate of 1.66%, which matures in May
2004, and a $40 million promissory note with Union Planters at a variable
interest rate, (based on three month LIBOR), of 2.17% which matures in April 2009. The Company has entered
into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $25 million, a
variable leg based on three month LIBOR and a fixed leg of 4.58% which expires
in March 2009 and is designated against the Union Planters promissory
note.  
At December 31, 2003, the
Company had $205.7 million (after considering the impact of interest rate swap
agreements) variable rate debt outstanding at an average interest rate of 1.88%
and an additional $17.7 million (after considering the impact of interest rate
swap agreements) of tax-free variable rate debt outstanding at an average rate
of 1.95%; $6.8 million of which is capped under an interest rate cap agreement
at 6.00%.  The interest rate on all
other debt was hedged or fixed at an average interest rate of 6.45%.
The Company had
approximately $336.2 million (including $55.6 million in the Tax-Free Bond
Facility with FNMA) and $446.4 million (including $46.7 million in the Tax-Free
Bond Facility with FNMA) at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively,
outstanding under various mortgage notes and bonds payable secured by real
estate assets. 
The Company had
outstanding at December 31, 2002, $142 million aggregate principal amount of
6.376% bonds due in 2003 (the &#147;Bonds&#148;). 
The Bonds were secured by a first priority deed of trust, security
agreement and assignment of rents and leases in 26 mortgaged properties.  On March 3, 2003 these bonds were refinanced
through the FNMA Facility.

During 2002, the Company
refinanced multiple properties and moved them under the FNMA facility.  The Company also refinanced four tax-free
bonds representing $29.7 million and moved them into the 
F-13








Tax-Free  Bond
Facility with FNMA. The Company incurred a prepayment penalty of approximately  $1.4
million related to the early extinguishment of the debt. 

As of December 31, 2003,
the Company estimated that the weighted average interest rate on the Company&#146;s
debt was 5.4% with an average maturity of 10.6 years.

restrictive financial covenants.  The
Company believes that it was in compliance with these covenants as of December 31,
2003.
4.   Fair Value Disclosure of Financial
Instruments

Cash and cash
equivalents, restricted cash, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other
liabilities and security deposits are carried at amounts which reasonably
approximate their fair value due to their short term nature.  

Fixed rate notes payable
at December 31, 2003 and 2002 total $385.8 million and $504.9 million,
respectively, and have an estimated fair value of $368.1 million and $470.4
million (excluding prepayment penalties) based upon interest rates available
for the issuance of debt with similar terms and remaining maturities as of
December 31, 2003 and 2002.  The
carrying value of variable rate notes 
F-14








payable
(excluding the effect of interest rate swap agreements) at December 31, 2003  and 2002
total $566.1 million and $298.8 million, respectively, which  reasonably approximates
their fair value because the related variable interest  rates available for the issuance
of debt with similar terms and remaining  maturities reasonably approximate market rates.  The
notional amount of interest rate swap agreements at December  31, 2003 and 2002 total
$382.7 million and $159.8 million, respectively, and  have an estimated fair value of
($25.5) million and ($28.1) million based upon  interest rates available for interest
rate swaps with similar terms and  remaining maturities as of December 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.  The fair market value of the Company&#146;s  interest rate cap
agreement with a notional amount of $6.8 million was approximately  $7,000 and $16,000 at
December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

The fair value estimates
presented herein are based on information available to management as of
December 31, 2003 and 2002. These estimates are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company
could ultimately realize.
5.   Commitments and Contingencies

The Company is not
presently subject to any material litigation nor, to the Company&#146;s knowledge,
with advice of legal counsel, is any material litigation threatened against the
Company, other than routine litigation arising in the ordinary course of
business, some of which is expected to be covered by liability insurance and
none of which is expected to have a material adverse effect on the consolidated
financial statements of the Company.

The Company had no
expenses related to operating leases for the year ended December 31, 2003,  and $16,000, and $527,000, respectively, for
the years ended December 31, 2002, and 2001. The Company has no
commitments for the next five years under operating lease agreements outstanding
at December 31, 2003.
6.   Income Taxes
No provision for federal
income taxes has been made in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements.  The Company has made an
election to be taxed as a Real Estate Investment Trust (&#147;REIT&#148;) under Sections
856 through 860 of the Code.  As a REIT,
the Company generally is not subject to Federal income tax to the extent it
distributes 90% of its REIT taxable income to its shareholders and meets
certain other tests relating to the number of shareholders, types of assets and
allocable income.  If the Company fails
to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, the Company will be subject to the
Federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on its
taxable income at regular corporate rates. 
Even though the Company qualifies for taxation as a REIT, the Company
may be subject to certain Federal, state and local taxes on its income and
property and to Federal income and excise tax on its undistributed income. 
F-15








Earnings  and
profits, which determine the taxability of dividends to shareholders,  differ from net
income reported for financial reporting purposes primarily  because of differences in
depreciable lives, bases of certain assets and  liabilities and in the timing of
recognition of earnings upon disposition of  properties.  For federal income tax
purposes, the following summarizes the taxability of cash distributions paid on  the
common shares in 2002 and 2001 and the estimated taxability for 2003:

of 10% of the Company&#146;s common shares.

Direct Stock Purchase and
Distribution Reinvestment Plan
The Company has a Direct
Stock Purchase and Distribution Reinvestment Plan (&#147;DSPDRP&#148;) pursuant to which
the Company&#146;s shareholders have the ability to reinvest all or part of
distributions from the Company&#146;s common stock, preferred stock or limited
partnership interests in Mid-America Apartments, L.P. into the Company&#146;s common
stock.  Also, the plan provides the
opportunity for shareholders to buy additional common shares through an
optional cash investment.  The Company
has registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission the offer and sale
of up to 1,600,000 shares of common stock pursuant to the DSPDRP.  Additional shares will be purchased at the
market price on the &#147;Investment Date&#148; each month, which shall in no case be
later than ten business days following the distribution payment date.  Common stock shares totaling 31,484 in 2003,

under the plan.
F-17







Earnings
Per Share 
The computation of basic
earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding.  The computation of diluted
earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding plus the shares resulting from the assumed exercise of all dilutive
outstanding options using the treasury stock method.  For periods were the Company reports a net loss available for
common shareholders, the effect of dilutive shares is excluded from earnings
per share calculations because including such shares would be anti-dilutive.

A reconciliation of the
numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted earnings per share
computations for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 is presented
on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
8.   Employee Benefit Plans
401 (k) Savings Plan
The Mid-America Apartment
Communities, Inc. 401(k) Savings Plan is a defined contribution plan that
satisfies the requirements of Section 401(a) and 401(k) of the Code.  The Company may, but is not obligated to,
make a matching contribution of $.50 for each $1.00 contributed, up to 6% of
the participant&#146;s compensation.  The
Company&#146;s contribution to this plan was $251,000, $262,000, and $240,000 in
2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively.
Non-Qualified Deferred
Compensation Plan
The Company has adopted a
non-qualified deferred compensation plan for key employees who are not
qualified for participation in the Company&#146;s 401(k) Savings Plan.  Under the terms of the plan, employees may
elect to defer a percentage of their compensation and the Company matches a
portion of their salary deferral.  The
plan is designed so that the employees&#146; investment earnings under the
non-qualified plan should be the same as the earning assets in the Company&#146;s
401(k) Savings Plan.  The Company&#146;s
match to this plan in 2003, 2002, and 2001 was $23,700, $24,200, and $30,200,
respectively.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The Mid-America Apartment
Communities, Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the &#147;ESPP&#148;) provides a means
for employees to purchase common stock of the Company.  The Board has authorized the issuance of
150,000 shares for the plan.  The ESPP
is administered by the Compensation Committee who may annually grant options to
employees to purchase annually up to an aggregate of 15,000 shares of common
stock at a price equal to 85% of the market price of the common stock.  For 2003, 2002, and 2001, the ESPP purchased
5,162, 4,342, and 4,163 shares of common stock, respectively.
Employee Stock Ownership Plan

The Mid-America Apartment
Communities, Inc. Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the &#147;ESOP&#148;) is a
non-contributory stock bonus plan that satisfies the requirements of Section
401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. 
Each employee of the Company is eligible to participate in the ESOP
after attaining the age of 21 years and completing one year of service with the
Company. Participants&#146; ESOP accounts will be 100% vested after five years of
continuous service, with no vesting prior to that time.  The Company contributed 22,500 shares of
common stock to the ESOP upon conclusion of the Initial Offering.  During 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company
contributed approximately $568,000, $570,000, and $600,000, respectively, to
the ESOP which purchased an additional 20,489, 22,493, and 22,562 shares of
common stock, respectively.

F-18







Stock Option Plan
The Company adopted the
1994 Restricted Stock and Stock Option Plan (the &#147;Plan&#148;) to provide incentives
to attract and retain independent directors, executive officers and key
employees.  As of January 31, 2004, no
further awards may be granted under the Plan. 
The Plan provided for the grant of options to purchase a specified
number of shares of common stock (&#147;Options&#148;) or grants of restricted shares of
common stock (&#147;Restricted Stock&#148;).  The
Plan also allowed the Company to grant options to purchase Operating
Partnership Units at the price of the common stock on the New York Stock
Exchange on the day prior to issuance of the units (the &#147;LESOP Provision&#148;). The
Plan authorized the issuance of 2,400,000 common shares or options to acquire
shares which vest over five years. Under the terms of the Plan, the Company
could advance directors, executive officers, and key employees a portion of the
cost of the common stock or units.  The
employee advances mature five years from date of issuance and accrue interest,
payable in arrears, at a rate established at the date of issuance.  The Company has also entered into
supplemental bonus agreements with the employees which are intended to fund the
payment of a portion of the advances over a five year period.  Under the terms of the supplemental bonus
agreements, The Company will pay bonuses to these employees equal to 3% of the
original note balance on each anniversary date of the advance, limited to 15%
of the aggregate purchase price of the shares and units.  In March of 2002, the Company entered into
duplicate supplemental bonus agreements on the then existing options to
executive officers, effectively doubling their advances.  The advances become due and payable and the
bonus agreement will terminate if the employees voluntarily terminate their
employment with the Company.  The
Company also agreed to pay a bonus to certain executive officers in an amount
equal to the debt service on the advances for as long as they remain employed
by the Company.  
As of December 31, 2003,
the Company had advances outstanding relating to the Plan totaling $1,458,000,
which is presented as a reduction to shareholders&#146; equity in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets.  Advances
to current and one former executive officers totaled $1,450,000 at interest
rates ranging from 5.59%-6.49% and maturing at various dates from 2004 to 2010.  Advances to key employees totaled $8,000 at
interest rates ranging from 8.25%-9.0% maturing at various dates from 2004 to
2005.  

In 2003, 2002, and 2001,
the Company issued 7,879, 6,078, and 5,450 restricted shares of common stock,
respectively, to independent directors. 
The shares are issued into the Outside Director Deferred Compensation
Plan and are issued to the director in two annual installments beginning within
90 days following the year-end of the year in which the director ceases to
serve on the Board of Directors.
In 2003, the Company
issued 7,471 restricted shares of common stock to executive management. These shares vest in one year.
In 2002, the Company
issued 97,881 restricted shares of common stock to key managers.  These shares vest 20% a year
for five consecutive years beginning in 2007, with the ability for early
vesting if the Company meets certain pre-set performance goals. Through 2003,
no early vesting of these shares has occurred.
In 2000, the Company
issued 10,750 restricted shares of common stock to executive officers.  These shares will
vest 10% each over the next ten years. 
The executive officers have the option to accelerate the vesting in lieu
of bonuses.

10.   Derivative Financial
Instruments

In the normal course of
business, the Company uses certain derivative financial instruments to manage,
or hedge, the interest rate risk associated with the Company&#146;s variable rate
debt or as hedges in anticipation of future debt transactions to manage
well-defined interest rate risk associated with the transaction.  

The Company does not use
derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.  Further, the Company has a policy of
entering into contracts with major financial institutions based upon their
credit rating and other factors.  When
viewed in conjunction with the underlying and offsetting exposure that the
derivatives are designated to hedge, the Company has not sustained any material
loss from those instruments nor does it anticipate any material adverse effect
on its net income or financial position in the future from the use of
derivatives.  
The Company requires that
derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow or fair value hedges
are effective in reducing the interest rate risk exposure that they are
designated to hedge.  In order for a
derivative financial instrument to be designated as a hedging instrument, the
relationship between the derivative financial instrument and the hedged item
must be highly effective.  Instruments
that meet the hedging criteria are formally designated as hedging instruments
at the inception of the derivative contract. 
The Company formally documents all relationships between hedging
instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk-management objective and
strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction.  This process includes linking all derivatives that are designated
as fair-value or cash flow hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the
balance sheet or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions.  The Company also formally assesses, both at
the inception of the hedging instrument and on an ongoing basis, whether the
derivatives used are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or
cash flows 
F-20







of
hedged items.  When it is determined
that a derivative has ceased to be a highly effective hedge, the Company
discontinues hedge accounting prospectively. 

All of the Company&#146;s
derivative financial instruments are characterized as cash flow hedges and are
reported at fair value on the balance sheet. 
The derivative financial instruments hedge the future cash flows of
variable rate debt through interest rate swaps that convert variable payments
to fixed payments and an interest rate cap that hedges cash flows from interest
payments above a specific level.  The
unrealized gains/losses in the fair value of these cash flow hedges are
reported on the balance sheet with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated
other comprehensive income, with any ineffective portion of the hedging
transactions reclassified to earnings. 
During the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, the ineffective
portion of the hedging transactions was not significant.  Within the next twelve months, the Company
expects to reclassify to earnings an estimated $100,000 of the current balance
held in accumulated other comprehensive income due to the ineffectiveness
associated with the hedging transactions.

The Company has nine
interest rate swaps with a total notional balance of $275 million which have
variable legs based on one or three-month Libor, and fixed legs with an average
rate of 6.2%.  The swaps have
expirations between 2005 and 2010, and have to date proven to be highly
effective hedges of the Company&#146;s variable rate debt.  Through the use of these swaps the Company believes it has
effectively fixed the rate during these periods of $275 million of variable
rate borrowings issued through the FNMA Facility. The Company also has five
interest rate swaps with a total notional balance of $42.7 million based on the
BMA Municipal Swap Index, which expire in 2007 and 2008, effectively fixing the
interest rate of $42.7 million of the Tax-Free Bond Facility at 4.3% through
this period, which is a highly effective hedge.  The Company also entered
into a cap agreement on a notional amount of $6.8 million within the Tax-Free
Bond Facility.  The 5-year cap agreement
has a strike rate of 6% as indexed on the BMA Municipal Swap Index.
Additionally, the Company has one interest rate swap with a notional amount of
$25 million which has a variable leg based on three-month LIBOR, and a
fixed leg with an average rate of 4.6% which expires in 2009 and has to date
proven to be highly effective hedge of the designated borrowings of Union
Planters.
The Company has also
executed one forward interest rate swap with a notional balance of $40 million
which becomes operative in 2004.  The
variable leg of the forward interest rate swap is based on three-month Libor
and the fixed leg has an average rate of 4.9%. 
The swap expires in 2010 and is designated as a cash flow hedge on
future planned refinancings.

At December 31, 2003 all
of these interest rate swaps and the interest rate cap were designated as cash flow hedges in
accordance with SFAS No. 133 and have a net liability fair value of ($25.4)
million and $7,000, respectively, which are recorded in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.
11.   Related Party Transactions
Pursuant to management
contracts with the Company&#146;s joint ventures, the Company manages the operations
of the joint venture apartment communities for a fee of 4% of the revenues of
the joint ventures.  The Company received
approximately $822,000, $775,000, and $755,000 as management fees from the
joint ventures in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.  
12.   Segment Information
At December 31, 2003, the
Company owned or had an ownership interest in 127 multifamily apartment communities,
including the apartment communities owned by the Company&#146;s joint venture, in 12
different states from which it derives all significant sources of earnings and
operating cash flows.  The Company&#146;s
operational structure is organized on a decentralized basis, with individual
property managers having overall responsibility and authority regarding the
operations of their respective properties. 
Each property manager individually monitors local and area trends in rental
rates, occupancy percentages, and 
F-21




operating costs.  Property
managers are given the on-site responsibility and discretion to react to such
trends in the best interest of the Company. 
The Company&#146;s chief operating decision maker evaluates the performance
of each individual property based on its contribution to net operating income
in order to ensure that the individual property continues to meet the Company&#146;s
return criteria and long term investment goals.  The Company defines each of its multifamily communities as an
individual operating segment.  It has
also determined that all of its communities have similar economic
characteristics and also meet the other criteria which permit the communities
to be aggregated into one reportable segment, which is acquisition
and operation of the multifamily communities owned. 

The revenues, net operating income, assets and real estate investment
capital expenditures for the aggregated multifamily segment are summarized as
follows for the years ended as of December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 (Dollars in
000&#146;s):  For purposes of this
disclosure, multifamily revenues, net operating income and real estate assets
include amounts related to the properties owned by the unconsolidated joint
ventures.
