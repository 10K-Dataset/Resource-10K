ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

THE COMPANY

Mid-America  Apartment  Communities,  Inc.  (the  "Company")  is   a
Memphis, Tennessee-based self-administered and self-managed umbrella
partnership real estate investment trust, ("REIT") ("UPREIT")  which
owns  and  operates  115  apartment  communities  containing  30,912
apartment  units  in  13  states  (the  "Communities"),  has   2,660
apartment  units  under  construction in 7  new  communities  and  5
additions to existing communities, and a further 804 apartment units
in  various  stages of development.  The Company  has  entered  into
definitive   agreements  to  acquire  three   additional   apartment
communities  containing 624 apartment units, of  which  negotiations
are still in progress.

Founded  in 1977 by George E. Cates, the Company's Chairman  of  the
Board  of  Directors  and  Chief Executive  Officer,  the  Company's
predecessor  grew  from an operator of a single  252-unit  apartment
community  in Memphis, Tennessee into a fully-integrated  owner  and
operator  of  5,580 apartment units in 22 apartment  communities  in
four  southeastern states immediately prior to the Company's initial
public offering in February 1994 (the "Initial Offering"). Since the
Initial  Offering,  the  Company's portfolio  has  increased  by  93
apartment  communities containing 25,332 apartment units,  including
1)   12  apartment  communities  containing  3,212  apartment  units
acquired  in  the  Company's merger with America  First  REIT,  Inc.
("AFR")  in June 1995 (the "AFR Merger") for an aggregate  value  of
approximately $111 million (as measured by Common Stock  issued  and
AFR  debt assumed) and 2) 30 apartment communities containing  7,691
apartments   acquired   in  the  company's  merger   with   Flournoy
Development Company and related partnerships ("FDC") on November 25,
1997 (the "FDC Merger")  for an aggregate value of $423 million. The
FDC  Merger  resulted  in  the  establishment  of  Flournoy  Service
Corporation ("FSC"), the name of which was later changed to Flournoy
Development Corporation, of which the Company owns 100% of the  non-
voting common stock, specifically to own and operate the third-party
construction, brokerage and management activities formerly conducted
by  FDC.  At least 95% of the after tax cash flow after intercompany
interest  expense of this subsidiary is distributed  to  Mid-America
Apartments,  L.P., a Tennessee limited partnership  (the  "Operating
Partnership")  through its  ownership of the non-voting common stock
in  FSC,  with the 5% balance to the owners of  FSC's common  stock,
consisting  of Mr. Cates and John F. Flournoy, the Vice-Chairman  of
the  Company. FSC did not make a distribution to Messrs.  Cates  and
Flournoy in 1997 and does not currently anticipate a distribution in
1998.  The operations of FSC include the management of 43 properties
with  4,971 apartment units owned by third party investors, and  the
development  and construction of properties for third  parties.  The
Company believes that this structure is permitted under the terms of
the  Internal  Revenue  Code  and also provides  the  most  economic
benefit to its shareholders.

The   Company's  business  is  conducted  principally  through   the
Operating  Partnership.  The Company is the sole general partner  of
the Operating Partnership, holding, as of December 31, 1997, 181,844
Common  Units or a 1% general partnership interest in the  Operating
Partnership.  The Company's wholly-owned qualified REIT  subsidiary,
MAC  II  of  Delaware, Inc., a Delaware corporation,  is  a  limited
partner  in the Operating Partnership and, as of December 31,  1997,
held  15,736,248  Common Units, or 81.1% of all  outstanding  Common
Units.

In  connection  with the formation of the Operating Partnership  and
the  Initial  Offering, the Operating Partnership  issued  2,460,413
Common Units  to the former owners of Communities contributed to the
Operating Partnership.  The Common Units held by such former  owners
are redeemable by the holders, at their option, for shares of Common
Stock  on a one-for-one basis or, at the Company's option, for cash.
The Company has filed a shelf registration statement relating to the
offer  and sale of the Common Units  by the holders thereof.  As  of
December  31, 1997, such former owners held 2,384,097 Common  Units.
In subsequent transactions and acquisitions of properties, including
in  the  FDC  Merger, an additional 553,205 Common Units  have  been
issued,  resulting in a total of 2,937,302 Common Units being  owned
by outside investors.

Certain  Communities are owned by limited partnerships of which  the
Operating  Partnership and the Company or a wholly  owned  qualified
REIT  subsidiary  are  the only partners. The Company,  directly  or
through  seven  wholly  owned qualified REIT subsidiaries,  owns  19
Communities.  The  Company also has established Mid-America  Capital
Partners,  L.P., a single-purpose entity formed in 1997  to  own  26
apartment communities containing 5,947 apartment units, of which the
Operating  Partnership owns a 99% limited partnership  interest  and
the  Company,  through a subsidiary, owns a 1%  General  Partnership
interest

OPERATING PHILOSOPHY

MID-SIZE  MARKET  FOCUS.  The Company focuses on owning,  operating,
developing, constructing and acquiring apartment communities in mid-
size  southeastern and Texas cities. The Company believes that these
markets   generally   have  been  less  susceptible   to   apartment
overbuilding  during  past real estate investment  cycles,  and  the
Company  believes that apartment communities in these markets  offer
attractive  long-term  investment  returns.  The  Company  seeks  to
develop  and  acquire apartment communities in its existing  markets
and selected new markets where it believes there is less competition
for  acquisitions  or  new construction from other  well-capitalized
buyers.  The Company believes it can acquire apartment  units  at  a
significant discount to estimated replacement cost in these  markets
and  through  its experience construct and develop apartments  at  a
reasonable  investment cost to generate higher returns on investment
than is available in large metropolitan areas.

INTENSIVE MANAGEMENT FOCUS.  The Company strongly emphasizes on-site
property  management. Particular attention is paid to  opportunities
to increase rents, raise average occupancy rates, and control costs,
with property managers being given the responsibility for monitoring
market trends and the discretion to react to such trends.

DEDICATION  TO  CUSTOMER SERVICE.  Management's experience  is  that
maintaining a consistently high level of customer satisfaction leads
to   greater  demand  for  the  Company's  apartment  units,  higher
occupancy  and  rental rates, and increased long-term profitability.
The   Company,  as  part  of  its  intense  management  focus,   has
implemented  a  practice of having highly trained property  managers
and   service  technicians  on-site  at  each  of  the  Communities.
Management undertakes frequent resident surveys and focus groups, in
order to measure customer satisfaction.

DECENTRALIZED  OPERATIONAL  STRUCTURE.   The  Company's  operational
structure is organized on a geographic basis. The Company's property
managers  have  overall operating responsibility for their  specific
Communities. Property managers report to area managers  or  regional
managers  who, in turn, are accountable to the Company's  President.
Management  believes  that  its  decentralized  operating  structure
capitalizes   on  specific  market  knowledge,  increases   personal
accountability relative to a centralized structure and is beneficial
in the acquisition, redevelopment and development process.

GROWTH STRATEGIES

The  Company seeks to increase earnings per share and operating cash
flow  to  maximize shareholder value through a balanced strategy  of
internal and external growth.

INTERNAL  GROWTH  STRATEGY.  Management's goal is  to  maximize  its
return  on  investment in each Community by increasing rental  rates
and  reducing  operating expenses while maintaining  high  occupancy
levels.  The  Company  (i)  seeks  higher  net  rental  revenues  by
enhancing and maintaining the competitiveness of the Communities and
(ii)  manages  expenses  through its system of  detailed  management
reporting  and  accountability  in order  to  achieve  increases  in
operating  cash  flow.  The  steps taken to  meet  these  objectives
include:

*     empowering the Company's property managers to adjust rents  in
  response to local market conditions and to concentrate resident turnover
  in peak rental demand months;

*    implementing programs to control expenses through investment in cost-
  saving initiatives, such as the installation of individual  apartment
  unit water and utility meters in certain Communities;

*    ensuring that, through monthly inspections of all Communities by
  senior management and prompt attention to maintenance and recurring
  capital needs, the Communities are properly maintained;

*    improving the "curb appeal" of the Communities through extensive
  landscaping and exterior improvements and repositioning Communities from
  time to time to maintain market leadership positions;

*     investing  heavily in training programs for its property-level
  personnel;

*    compensating all employees through performance-based compensation
  programs and stock ownership programs; and

*    maintaining a hands-on management style and "flat" organizational
  structure that emphasizes senior management's continued close contact
  with the market and employees.

EXTERNAL GROWTH STRATEGY.  The Company's external growth strategy is
to   acquire  and  develop  additional  apartment  units  and,  when
apartment   communities  no  longer  meet  the  Company's  long-term
strategic objectives or investment return goals, to dispose of those
Communities.   Through  the  Company's  umbrella  partnership   REIT
("UPREIT")  structure,  the  Company  has  the  ability  to  acquire
apartment communities through the issuance of UPREIT Units  in  tax-
deferred exchanges with owners of such properties. Since the Initial
Offering,  the  Company  has  grown by 25,332  apartment  units,  an
increase  of  approximately 454% over the number of apartment  units
immediately  prior  to the Initial Offering. Typical  attributes  of
apartment communities which the Company seeks to acquire are:

*    well-constructed properties having attractive locations, potential
  for increases in rental rates and occupancy, potential for reductions in
  operating costs and acquisition prices below estimated replacement cost;

*    properties with opportunities for internal growth through (i) market
  repositioning by means of property upgrades which typically include
  landscaping, selective refurbishing and the addition of amenities and
  (ii) realizing economies of scale in management and purchasing;  and

*    properties located in the Company's existing markets and mid-size
  southeastern and Texas metropolitan areas having favorable  market
  characteristics.

The  Company develops new apartments when it believes it can achieve
an  attractive return on investment substantially above the rate  of
return  of  acquisitions. In November the Company acquired,  through
the   FDC  Merger,  Flournoy  Development  Company,  a  builder  and
developer  of  multifamily apartments with 30  years  of  experience
owning, managing, developing and building apartments. As a result of
this  merger, the Company has significantly expanded its  commitment
to  new  development.  The Company has established higher investment
return   criteria  for  new  development  than  it   maintains   for
acquisitions and generally expects that its new development  program
will  generate  higher  stabilized returns on investment  than  most
acquisition opportunities.  Since the Initial Offering, the  Company
has completed the following development projects:

*     122 apartment units constructed at the Woods of Post House  in
  Jackson, Tennessee in close proximity to three other Communities;

*    24 additional apartment units at the Reflection Pointe apartment
  community in Jackson, Mississippi; and

*     32  additional  apartment units at the Park Haywood  apartment
  community in Greenville, South Carolina.

In  1997, the Company substantially completed construction of a 234-
unit  expansion  of  the  384-unit Lincoln on  the  Green  apartment
community  at the Tournament Players' Club at Southwind in  Memphis,
Tennessee.   The development of expansion for Lincoln on  the  Green
was  managed successfully and began by Flournoy Development  Company
prior  to the merger with the Company.  The Company currently has  a
development pipeline of 3,466 apartments that are in various  stages
of  construction and development, of which 1,690 are anticipated  to
be  completed  in  1998. It is likely that additional  opportunities
will be identified for development in late 1998 and 1999.

COMPLETED  ACQUISITIONS.     During 1997, the Company acquired  the
following  apartment  communities  (the  "Completed  Acquisitions")
containing  an  aggregate  of  3,314 apartment  units  (dollars  in
millions):

All of the Company's Communities are located in developed areas that
include other apartment communities.  Occupancy and rental rates are
affected  by  the number of competitive apartment communities  in  a
particular  area.   The Company's properties compete  with  numerous
other  multifamily properties, the owners of which may have  greater
resources  than  the  Company and whose  management  may  have  more
experience  than the Company's management.  Moreover,  single-family
rental  housing, manufactured housing, condominiums and the new  and
existing  home  market  provide housing  alternatives  to  potential
residents of apartment communities.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

RECENT  ACQUISITIONS

Since  December  31,  1997, the Company has acquired  the  following
apartment  communities  (the  "Recent Acquisitions")  containing  an
aggregate of 392 apartment units (dollars in millions):

                             NUMBER   ACQUISITION CONTRACT
PROPERTY         MARKET     OF UNITS     DATE       PRICE
- ----------   -------------- --------  ----------- --------
Walden Run   McDonough, GA    240        2/5/98    $ 13.4
Van Mark     Huntsville, AL   152       2/26/98       5.1
                            --------              --------                
    Total                     392                  $ 18.5
                            ========              ========

The  Company  funded  the  cash required to  consummate  the  Recent
Acquisitions  with  borrowings under  the  Company's  bank  line  of
credit.

PROPOSED ACQUISITIONS

The  Company has entered into definitive agreements to purchase  the
200-unit  Eagle Ridge apartments in Birmingham, Alabama,   the  204-
unit  Village Apartments at Carrollwood in Tampa, Florida  and   the
220-unit  Georgetown  Grove  Apartments in  Savannah,  Georgia.  The
Company  plans to fund the cash required to consummate the  Proposed
Acquisitions with issuance of Umbrella Partnership units, borrowings
under  the  Credit Line and assumption of existing mortgages.  There
are  remaining issues to negotiate on these contracts and there  can
be no assurance that these acquisitions will close.

DEVELOPMENT

The  Company's  Board of Directors has approved the  development  of
three   apartment   communities  totaling  702  units   located   in
Montgomery,  Alabama,  Murfreesboro,  Tennessee,  and  Panama  City,
Florida;  the Board has also approved the development of a  124-unit
addition to the Company's St Augustine property in Jacksonville, Florida.
The  total estimated cost of these projects is $50.5 million  to  be
invested in 1998 and 1999.

The Company has a total of 1,762 apartments in pre-development or in-
depth feasibility review. If all these are developed, together  with
the 1,070 apartments under construction and the 634 apartments under
construction  and  lease-up, the total  planned  investment  in  new
development in 1998 is $118 million, with an additional  $70 million
to complete the projects in 1999. The Company has several additional
projects  in earlier stages of feasibility study, and it anticipates
that  the  additional  apartment communities will  be  approved  for
development later in 1998 which will require additional  funding  in
1999.


DISTRIBUTION INCREASE

In  January  1998, the Company raised its quarterly distribution  to
common  shareholders  from  $.535  per  share  to  $.55  per  share,
effective with its distribution paid on January 30, 1998.




ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES

The  Company  seeks  to  acquire and develop  apartment  communities
appealing to middle and upper income residents in mid-size cities in
the  southeastern United States and Texas. Approximately 71% of  the
Company's   apartment  units  are  located  in   Georgia,   Florida,
Tennessee,  and Texas markets. The Company's strategic focus  is  to
provide  its  residents high quality apartment units  in  attractive
community  settings,  characterized  by  extensive  landscaping  and
attention  to aesthetic detail. The Company utilizes its  experience
and  expertise in maintenance, landscaping, marketing and management
to  effectively  "reposition" many of the apartment  communities  it
acquires to raise occupancy levels and per unit average rentals. The
average age of the Communities at December 31, 1997 was 12.2  years.
The  following table sets forth certain operating data regarding the
Company  for the periods indicated excluding development communities.

ITEM 5.  MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED
STOCKHOLDER MATTERS

The  Common Stock has been listed and traded on the NYSE  under  the
symbol  "MAA" since the Initial Offering in February 1994. On  March
13, 1998, the reported last sale price of the Company's common stock
on  the NYSE was $28.13 per share and there were approximately 1,640
holders  of record of the Common Stock. The Company estimates  there
are  approximately 16,000 beneficial owners of the Common Stock. The
following  table sets forth the quarterly high and low sales  prices
of  the  Common  Stock as reported on the NYSE and the distributions
declared by the Company with respect to the periods indicated.

      Fourth Quarter       30.063       26.625            .55



The  Company's current annual distribution rate with respect to  the
Common  Stock is $2.20 per share. The actual distributions  made  by
the  Company will be affected by a number of factors, including  the
gross revenues received from the Communities, the operating expenses
of  the  Company,  the interest expense incurred on  borrowings  and
unanticipated capital expenditures.

The  Company pays a preferential regular monthly distribution on the
Series  A  Preferred Stock issued in October 1996 and the  Series  B
Preferred Stock issued in November 1997 at an annual rate of  $2.375
per  share and $2.21875 per share, respectively. No distribution may
be  made  on the Common Stock unless all accrued distributions  have
been made with respect to the Series A and Series B Preferred Stock.
No  assurance can be given that the Company will be able to maintain
its   distribution  rate  on  its  Common  Stock  or  make  required
distributions  with  respect to the Series A or Series  B  Preferred
Stock.

In  1997,  the Company implemented the DRSPP under which holders  of
Common  Stock (and Series A and Series B Preferred Stock) may  elect
automatically  to reinvest their distributions in additional  shares
of  Common  Stock and/or to make optional purchases of Common  Stock
free of brokerage commissions and charges. Shares purchased directly
from the Company will be purchased at up to a 3% discount from their
fair  market  value  at  the Company's discretion.  To  fulfill  its
obligations under the DRSPP, the Company may either issue additional
shares  of  Common  Stock or repurchase Common  Stock  in  the  open
market.

Future distributions by the Company will be at the discretion of the
Board  of  Directors  and will depend on the actual funds  available
for  distribution  of the Company, its financial condition,  capital
requirements,  the annual distribution requirements under  the  REIT
provisions  of  the  Code and such other factors  as  the  Board  of
Directors deems relevant.

ITEM 7.   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

OVERVIEW

The   following  is  a  discussion  of  the  consolidated  financial
condition  and  results of operations of the Company for  the  years
ended  December 31, 1997, 1996, and 1995. This discussion should  be
read in conjunction with all of the financial statements included in
this  Annual Report on Form 10-K. These financial statements include
all  adjustments which are, in the opinion of management,  necessary
to  reflect a fair statement of the results for the interim  periods
presented,  and  all  such adjustments are  of  a  normal  recurring
nature.

FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS

Funds  from  operations ("FFO") represents net income  (computed  in
accordance  with  GAAP)  excluding  extraordinary  items,   minority
interest   in  Operating  Partnership  income,  gain  or   loss   on
disposition  of  real  estate assets, and  certain  non-cash  items,
primarily  depreciation  and  amortization,  less  preferred   stock
dividends.  The  Company  computes FFO in accordance  with  NAREIT's
current   definition,  which  eliminates  amortization  of  deferred
financing costs and depreciation of non-real estate assets as  items
added  back  to  net income when computing FFO. The Company  adopted
this  method of calculating FFO effective as of the NAREIT-suggested
adoption date of January 1, 1996. FFO should not be considered as an
alternative  to  net  income  or  any  other  GAAP  measurement   of
performance,  as  an  indicator of operating performance  or  as  an
alternative  to cash flows from operating, investing, and  financing
activities as a measure of liquidity. The Company believes that  FFO
is  helpful in understanding the Company's results of operations  in
that  such  calculation reflects cash flow from operating activities
and  the  Company's ability to support interest payments and general
operating expenses before the impact of certain activities  such  as
changes  in  other  assets  and  accounts  payable.   The  Company's
calculation  of FFO may differ from the methodology for  calculating
FFO  utilized by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable
to such other REITs.

For   the   year    ended  December  31,  1997,  FFO  increased   by
approximately  $8,102,000 or 22%, when compared to  the  year  ended
December  31,  1996. The increase was primarily attributable  to  an
approximate  $27,233,000 increase in revenues, which  was  partially
offset  by increases in expenses mainly associated with the increase
in  the  number of apartment units owned by the Company.  On  a  per
share basis, FFO increased approximately 3% from $2.66 per share for
the  year  ended December 31, 1996 to $2.73 per share for  the  same
period in 1997.

For   the   year    ended  December  31,  1996,  FFO  increased   by
approximately $6,809,000 or 23.7%, when compared to the year earlier
(adjusted  only for the new NAREIT definition of FFO). The  increase
was primarily attributable to an approximate $16,919,000 increase in
revenues, which was partially offset by increases in expenses mainly
associated with the increase in the number of apartment units  owned
by  the Company. On a per share basis, FFO increased 8.6% from $2.44
per share (restated for the effect of adoption of the current NAREIT
FFO  definition and the change in accounting policy)  for  the  year
ended  December 31, 1995 to $2.65 per share for the same  period  in
1996.


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

COMPARISON OF YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1997 TO THE YEAR ENDED
DECEMBER 31, 1996

During   the  1997  period,  the  Company  acquired  12  communities
containing 3,314 apartment units.  In addition, through the November
25,  1997  merger  with Flournoy Development Company  ("FDC"),   the
Company  acquired  32 communities containing 8,641  apartment  units
including 950 apartment units under development. The total number of
apartment  units  owned  at December 31,  1997  was  30,468  in  115
apartment  communities,  compared to 19,280  in  73  communities  at
December  31,  1996.  Average  monthly  rental  per  apartment  unit
increased  to  $549 at December 31, 1997 from $529 at  December  31,
1996 for the Company's properties owned prior to the merger. For the
communities  owned  prior to the merger, average occupancy  for  the
years  ended   December  31,  1997 and 1996  was  94.5%  and  95.4%,
respectively.  For the properties acquired through the  FDC  Merger,
average  monthly  rental per apartment unit  was  $613  and  average
occupancy was 92.2% at December 31, 1997.

Total revenues for 1997 increased by approximately $27,234,000,  due
primarily  to (i) approximately $12,743,000 from the 12  Communities
acquired  in  1997,  (ii)  approximately  $5,342,000  from  the   30
completed  Communities  acquired  through  the  FDC  Merger,   (iii)
approximately  $6,759,000 from a full years  operation  of  the  six
Communities  acquired in 1996, (iii) approximately  $2,113,000  from
the   Communities   owned   throughout  both   periods,   and   (iv)
approximately  $277,000  from The Woods at Post  House  in  Jackson,
Tennessee  which  completed development in  the  Fall  of  1995  and
Lincoln  on the Green phase II in Memphis, Tennessee which completed
development early 1998.

Property  operating  expenses for 1997  increased  by  approximately
$9,834,000, due primarily to (i) approximately $4,929,000  from  the
12  Communities acquired in 1997, (ii) approximately $1,938,000 from
the  30 completed Communities acquired through the FDC Merger, (iii)
approximately  $2,298,000 from a full years  operation  of  the  six
Communities acquired in 1996, (iii) approximately $583,000 from  the
Communities  owned  throughout both periods, and (iv)  approximately
$86,000 from The Woods at Post House  which completed development in
the  Fall  of 1995 and Lincoln on the Green phase II. Utility  costs
decreased from 5.5% of revenue to 4.6% of revenue for the year ended
December  31,  1997 compared to the same period a year earlier,  due
primarily  to over 13,000 units now submetered for water  usage  and
continued  benefits  from  the  1996 completion  of  the  individual
apartment unit electricity metering at Sailwinds at Lake Magdalene.

General and  administrative expense increased $448,000 for the  year
ended  December 31, 1997 compared to December 31, 1996 and decreased
from  5.5% of revenue to 4.8% of revenue for the year ended December
31, 1997 compared to the same period a year earlier.  The reductions
result  from  $122,000  transfer of landscape overhead  to  property
costs,   $156,000  reduced  state  and  local  taxes  and  increased
operating efficiencies of a larger operation.

Depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily due to (i)
approximately $2,503,000 from the 12 Communities acquired  in  1997,
(ii)  approximately  $1,247,000 from the  30  completed  Communities
acquired  through  the  FDC Merger, (iii)  approximately  $1,493,000
from a full years operation of the six Communities acquired in 1996,
(iii)  approximately $1,224,000 from additional capital expenditures
on    Communities   owned   throughout  both   periods,   and   (iv)
approximately  $54,000 from The Woods at Post House and  Lincoln  on
the  Green  phase II.  Amortization of deferred financing costs  and
unamortized costs in excess of fair value of net assets acquired for
1997   were   approximately  $888,000  and  approximately  $309,000,
respectively.

Interest expense increased approximately $3,177,000 during 1997  due
primarily to apartment acquisitions. The Company reduced its average
borrowing cost to 7.41% at December 31, 1997 as compared to 7.92% on
December  31, 1996. The average maturity on the Company's  debt  was
10.2 and 9.9 years at December 31, 1997 and 1996, respectively.   In
1997,  the Company recorded an approximate $8,622,000 loss on  early
extinguishment of debt, net of minority interest, primarily from the
repayment of certain debt in connection with the FDC Merger.

Income before minority interest for the year ended December 31, 1997
increased  approximately $5,069,000 over  the  same  period  a  year
earlier.


COMPARISON OF YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1996 TO THE YEAR ENDED
DECEMBER 31, 1995

During   the  1996  period,  the  Company  acquired  six   apartment
communities  and sold three apartment communities. The total  number
of  apartment  units owned at December 31, 1996  was  19,280  in  73
apartment  communities,  compared to 18,219  in  70  communities  at
December  31,  1995.  Average  monthly  rental  per  apartment  unit
increased  to  $529 at December 31, 1996 from $508 at  December  30,
1995.  Average occupancy for the years ended  December 31, 1996  and
1995 was 95.4% and 95.2%, respectively.

Total revenues for 1996 increased by approximately $16,919,000,  due
primarily  to (i) approximately $4,833,000 from the six  Communities
acquired  in 1996, (ii)  approximately $7,156,000 from a full  years
operation  of  the  15 Communities acquired in 1995,  including  the
Communities   acquired  in  the  AFR  Merger,  (iii)   approximately
$4,363,000  from the Communities owned throughout both periods,  and
(iv)  approximately  $567,000 from   The  Woods  at  Post  House  in
Jackson, Tennessee  which completed development in the Fall of 1995.

Property  operating  expenses for 1996  increased  by  approximately
$4,616,000, due primarily to (i) approximately $1,686,000  from  the
six  Communities  acquired  in 1996, (ii)  approximately  $2,746,000
from  a  full  year's operations of the 15 Communities  acquired  in
1995,  including  the Communities acquired in the  AFR  Merger,  and
(iii)  approximately $234,000 from The Woods at  Post  House.  These
increases  were offset by a decrease of approximately  $51,000  from
the   Communities   owned  throughout  both  periods.   Repair   and
maintenance expense decreased primarily due to the Company's  change
in the capitalization policy to conform with policies currently used
by  the  majority  of  the largest apartment  REITs.  Utility  costs
decreased from 6.1% of revenue to 5.5% of revenue for the year ended
December  31,  1996 compared to the same period a year earlier,  due
primarily  to  the installation of 6,400 individual  apartment  unit
water  meters  and the completion of the individual  apartment  unit
electricity metering at Sailwinds at Lake Magdalene.

General  and  administrative expense increased in 1996 approximately
$1,303,000  primarily due to the opening of the new training  center
and other expenses due to the continued growth of the company.

Depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily due to (i)
approximately  $893,000 from the six apartment communities  acquired
in  1996,  (ii)   approximately $1,346,000  from  the  15  apartment
communities acquired in 1995, including the Communities acquired  in
the  AFR  Merger,  (iii)  approximately $2,187,000  from  additional
capital  expenditures on Communities owned throughout both  periods,
and  (iv)  approximately $443,000 from  The Woods at Post  House  in
Jackson, Tennessee  which completed development in the Fall of 1995.
Amortization  of deferred financing costs and unamortized  costs  in
excess  of  fair  value  of  net  assets  acquired  for  1996   were
approximately $661,000 and approximately $192,000, respectively.

Interest expense increased approximately $3,082,000 during 1996  due
primarily to apartment acquisitions. The Company reduced the average
borrowing cost to 7.92% at December 31, 1996 as compared to 8.15% on
December  31, 1995. The average maturity on the Company's  debt  was
9.9 years at both December 31, 1996 and 1995.

In 1996, the Company recorded an approximate $2,185,000 gain for the
disposition  of three apartment communities.  The dispositions  were
structured as tax-deferred exchanges for federal tax purposes.  As a
result  of  the foregoing, income before minority interest  for  the
year ended December 31, 1996 increased approximately $5,166,000 over
the same period a year earlier.


LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Net   cash    provided  by  operating  activities   increased   from
approximately $38,018,000 for the year ended December  31,  1996  to
approximately $44,797,000 for the year ended December 31, 1997.  The
increase  in  net  cash flow was primarily due  to  an  increase  in
depreciation  and amortization less an extraordinary  loss  recorded
due to the early extinguishment of certain debt.

Net  cash  used in investing activities increased from approximately
$70,436,000  for  the year ended December 31, 1996 to  approximately
$138,263,000 for the year ended December 31, 1997. The increase  was
primarily  due to the acquisition of 3,314 apartment units  in  1997
for  approximately  $76,287,000 as compared to  the  acquisition  of
1,760  apartment  units in 1996 for approximately $66,258,000.  This
increase in net cash flow used in investing activities was partially
offset  by  the  sale  of three apartment communities  in  1996  for
approximately   $17,096,000.  Capital   improvements   to   existing
properties  totaled  approximately $20,205,000 for  the  year  ended
December  31,  1997, compared to approximately $18,437,000  for  the
same  period  in  1996.  Of  the  $20,205,000  capital  improvements
approximately  $7,743,000  was for recurring  capital  expenditures,
including  carpet and appliances, approximately $6,112,000  was  for
revenue   enhancing  projects,  approximately  $5,557,000  was   for
acquisition   capital   with  the  remaining   balance   for   other
miscellaneous  expenditures, including corporate. Recurring  capital
expenditures  averaged  $0.47 per share  in  1997.  Construction  in
progress  for  new  apartment  units  increased  from  approximately
$2,837,000  for  the year ended December 31, 1996  to  approximately
$16,093,000 for the comparable period in 1997, due primarily to  the
completion  of the 234-unit development at Lincoln on the  Green  in
Memphis,  Tennessee  which  began leasing  during   1997  and  other
developments including $1,685,000 for the 254-unit Reserve at Dexter
Lake,  $1,273,000 for the 288-unit Mandarin, $879,000 for  the  154-
unit phase II addition for Whisperwood Spa and $789,000 for the 316-
unit Terraces at Fieldstone.

Net  cash  provided  by  financing activities  increased  from
approximately $33,425,000 during the year ended December 31, 1996 to
approximately  $104,218,000 for the year ended  December  31,  1997.
During  1997, approximately $202,320,000 was provided by  borrowings
under   the   Credit  Line  and  notes  payable  and   approximately
$46,635,000 was provided from the issuance of preferred shares.  The
principal  uses  of the cash included approximately $30,021,000  for
the  repayment  of notes payable and approximately  $39,771,000  for
dividends and distributions.

At  December  31,  1997,  the Company had approximately  $45,225,000
outstanding  on the Credit Line. At December 31, 1997,  the  Company
had  approximately  $63,200,000  (including  the  Credit  Line)   of
floating  rate debt at an average interest rate of 6.5%;  all  other
debt was fixed rate term debt at an average interest rate of 7.8%.

The weighted average interest rate and weighted average maturity  at
December  31,  1997  for  the approximately  $632,213,000  of  notes
payable were 7.4% and 10.2 years, respectively. The Company used the
approximately  $46,635,000 of net proceeds from the Preferred  Stock
Offering, which closed in November, for the acquisitions of the 192-
unit Sterling Ridge apartment community in Augusta, Georgia and  the
184-unit  Colony at South Park apartment community in  Aiken,  South
Carolina  and  used the balance to reduce the amount outstanding  on
the  Credit Line. In November 1997, the Company increased its credit
limit under the Credit Line from $90,000,000 to $110,000,000 and  in
March  1998 increased the credit limit to $200,000,000.  The Company
expects to use the Credit Line for future acquisitions, development,
and  to  provide letters of credit as credit enhancements  for  tax-
exempt bonds.  In March 1997 the Company issued 2,300,000 shares  of
Common  Stock in an underwritten public offering.  The net  proceeds
from  such offering were approximately $62.5 million, all  of  which
were  contributed to the Operating Partnership and utilized to repay
outstanding borrowings under the Credit Line.   The Credit  Line  is
secured   and  is  subject  to  borrowing  base  calculations   that
effectively reduce the maximum amount that may be borrowed under the
Credit  Line  to approximately $44,300,000 as of the  date  of  this
Annual Report on Form 10-K.

The  Company  believes that cash provided by operations is  adequate
and  anticipates that it will continue to be adequate  in  both  the
short  and  long-term  to  meet  operating  requirements  (including
recurring  capital expenditures at the Communities) and  payment  of
distributions  by  the Company in accordance with REIT  requirements
under the Code.

During  1997,  capital  expenditures were approximately  $20,205,000
for   property  improvements  and  $16,093,000   for   the
development  of  new  units. For 1998,  the  Company  plans
approximately  $27,000,000 for property  improvements  and
$120,000,000  for development of new units. The Company  expects  to
meet  its  long  term  liquidity  requirements,  such  as  scheduled
mortgage debt maturities, property acquisitions, expansions and non-
recurring   capital  expenditures,  through  long  and   medium-term
collateralized and uncollateralized fixed rate borrowings,  issuance
of  debt  or  additional equity securities in the  Company  and  the
Credit Line.

INSURANCE

In  the opinion of management, property and casualty insurance is in
place   which  provides  adequate  coverage  to  provide   financial
protection against normal insurable risks such that it believes that
any  loss  experienced would not have a significant  impact  on  the
Company's liquidity, financial position, or results of operations.

INFLATION

Substantially  all of the resident leases at the Communities  allow,
at  the  time  of  renewal,  for adjustments  in  the  rent  payable
thereunder, and thus may enable the Company to seek rent  increases.
The  substantial majority of these leases are for one year or  less.
The short-term nature of these leases generally serves to reduce the
risk to the Company of the adverse effects of inflation.

YEAR 2000

The  Company  is aware of the issues associated with the programming
code  in  existing  computer systems as the millennium  (Year  2000)
approaches.   The  "Year  2000" issue is pervasive  and  complex  as
virtually every computer operation will be affected in some  way  by
the  rollover  of  the two digit year value to  00.   The  issue  is
whether  computer  systems  will properly recognize  date  sensitive
information  when  the year changes to 2000.  Systems  that  do  not
properly recognize such information could generate erroneous data or
cause a system to fail.

The  Company  is utilizing both internal and external  resources  to
identify,  correct or reprogram, and test the systems for  the  Year
2000  compliance.  During 1997, the Company developed a plan to deal
with  the Year 2000 issue.  Management has conducted a comprehensive
review  of  the Company's computer systems to identify  the  systems
that  could be affected by the Year 2000 issue and has developed  an
implementation  plan to resolve potential issues.  The  Company  has
reviewed  our core mainframe systems and application subsystems  and
have  obtained  the Year 2000 compliant releases and are  developing
the  installation  and testing plan for each of these  applications.
The  Company has corresponded with our third party service providers
and  other  providers of software and hardware for certification  of
their compliance with Year 2000 issues.  It is anticipated that  all
reprogramming  efforts  will  be completed  by  December  31,  1998,
allowing  adequate time for testing.  Management  has  assessed  the
Year  2000 compliance expense and believe that the related potential
effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of
operations should be immaterial. The Company is expensing all  costs
associated with the Year 2000 as the costs are incurred.

RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

The  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results  of  Operations contains certain forward-looking  statements
within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933,  as
amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,  as
amended,  which  are  intended to be covered  by  the  safe  harbors
created  thereby. These statements include the plans and  objectives
of  management for future operations, including plans and objectives
relating  to  capital expenditures and rehabilitation costs  on  the
apartment  communities.  Although  the  Company  believes  that  the
assumptions   underlying   the   forward-looking   statements    are
reasonable,  any  of  the  assumptions  could  be  inaccurate   and,
therefore,  there  can  be  no assurance  that  the  forward-looking
statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K will prove to
be  accurate. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent  in
the  forward-looking statements included herein,  the  inclusion  of
such  information should not be regarded as a representation by  the
Company  or  any other person that the objectives and plans  of  the
Company will be achieved.

ITEM 13.  CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS

On  July  23,  1997, the Company acquired its corporate headquarters  for
$2,912,000.    In connection with the acquisition, the Company  formed  a
special  committee of its external directors to negotiate the transaction
on its behalf because certain executive officers of the Company were also
partners  in the partnership which owned the building.  The consideration
consisted  of  approximately $862,000 cash, 22,246 Operating  Partnership
Units  valued  at  $634,000 ($28.50 per unit) and the  assumption  of  an
existing  loan.  Certain executive officers of the Company were  partners
in  the  partnership who owned the building and received 5,831  units  of
common shares connected with the exchange.

All transactions involving related parties must be approved by a majority
of  the  disinterested members of the Company's Board of  Directors.  The
Company has, and expects to have, transactions in the ordinary course  of
its  business  with  directors and officers  of  the  Company  and  their
affiliates,   including  members  of  their  families  or   corporations,
partnerships  or other organizations in which such officers or  directors
have  a  controlling interest, on substantially the same terms (including
price, or interest rates and collateral) as those prevailing at the  time
for comparable transactions with unrelated parties.

(b)  Reports on Form 8-K

                      Independent Auditors' Report


The Board of Directors and Shareholders
Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.


     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Mid-
America Apartment Communities, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as
of December 31, 1997 and 1996 and the related consolidated statements of
operations, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the years in
the three-year period ended December 31, 1997.   These financial
statements are the responsibility of the management of the Company.  Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements
based on our audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made
by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion.

     In our opinion, the financials statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects the financial position of the Company at
December 31, 1997 and 1996, and the results of the Company's operations
and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
December 31, 1997, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

As discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the
Company changed its  accounting method to capitalize replacement
purchases for major appliances and carpet in 1996.

1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Organization and Formation of the Company

Mid-America  Apartment  Communities, Inc.  (the  "Company")  is  a  self-
administrated and self-managed real estate investment trust  which  owns,
develops, acquires and operates multifamily apartment communities in  the
southeastern United States and Texas.  The Company owns and operates  115
apartment  communities principally through its majority owned subsidiary,
Mid-America  Apartments,  L.P.  (the  "Operating  Partnership")  and  its
subsidiary,  Mid-America  Capital Partners, L.P.  ("MACP").   MACP  is  a
recently  formed  special  purpose  entity  established  to  issue  first
mortgage   bonds.    In  addition  to  owning  and  operating   apartment
communities,  the  Company conducts third party property  management  and
construction  and development activities through its service corporation,
Flournoy Development Corporation.


Basis of Presentation

The  accompanying  financial statements include  the  accounts   of   the
Company,  the  Operating   Partnership,  and  other  subsidiaries.    All
significant  intercompany accounts and transactions have been  eliminated
in consolidation.

Minority Interest

Minority  interest in the accompanying consolidated financial  statements
relates  to  the ownership interest in the Operating Partnership  by  the
holders  of  Class  A  Common  Units of the Operating  Partnership.   The
Company  is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership.    Net
income  is  allocated to the Minority Interests based on their respective
ownership  percentage of the Operating Partnership  as  described  below.
Issuance  of  additional  Common Shares or  Operating  Partnership  Units
changes  the  ownership of both the Minority Interests and  the  Company.
Such  transactions  and  the proceeds therefrom are  treated  as  capital
transactions and result in an allocation between shareholders' equity and
Minority Interests to account for the change in the respective percentage
ownership of the underlying equity of the Operating Partnership.

The  Company's Board established economic rights in respect of each  unit
of  limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership  that  were
equivalent  to  the economic rights in respect of each  share  of  common
stock.   Each unit is redeemable at the option of the holder  thereof  in
exchange  for one share of common stock.  The Operating  Partnership  has
followed  the policy of paying the same per unit distribution in  respect
of  the  units  as the per share distribution in respect  of  the  common
stock.   Prior to 1997, the Operating Partnership agreement provided  for
the  allocation of additional net income to the holders of Class A  units
that  would otherwise be the net income of the Company or another entity.
Effective January 1, 1997 the Operating Partnership agreement was amended
to  eliminate  the  additional allocation of income to  the  unitholders.
Operating  Partnership  net income for 1997 was  allocated  approximately
17.9% to holders of Class A Common Units and 82.1% to the Company.

Use of Estimates

Management  of the Company has made a number of estimates and assumptions
relating  to the reporting of assets and  liabilities and the  disclosure
of   contingent  assets  and  liabilities  to  prepare  these   financial
statements  in conformity with generally accepted accounting  principles.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Revenue Recognition

The  Company  leases residential apartments under operating  leases  with
terms  of one year or less.  Rental and other revenues are recorded  when
earned.

In  addition  to  leasing  the owned Communities,  the  Company  provides
property management services for affiliated Section 42 Housing Tax Credit
multifamily   properties  ("Section  42")  and  conventional  properties.
Property  management  revenue  is  recorded  on  the  accrual  method  of
accounting as earned.

The  Company  receives development and construction fees related  to  the
development  of  the affiliated Section 42 properties.   Development  and
construction income is recognized as earned as the property is  developed
and  certain  operating  and financing performance  conditions  are  met.
Development  income  is  not recognized to the extent  that  requirements
exist  to  invest  a portion of such development fees in the  partnership
entities from which the fees are earned.

Construction  contract revenues, which are presented net of  construction
contract  costs  in  the  accompanying  statements  of  operations,   are
recognized using the percentage-of-completion method.  Under this method,
the percentage of contract revenue to be recognized currently is computed
based upon that percentage of estimated total revenue that incurred costs
to  date  bear to total estimated costs, after giving effect to the  most
recent  estimates  of costs to complete.  Revisions in cost  and  revenue
estimates  are reflected in the period in which the facts, which  require
the  revision, become known.  When revised cost estimates indicate a loss
on  an  individual  contract, the total estimated loss  is  provided  for
currently in its entirety without regard to the percentage of completion.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The  Company  considers cash, investments in money  market  accounts  and
certificates of deposit  with original maturities of three months or less
to be cash equivalents.

Restricted Cash

Restricted cash consists of escrow deposits held by lenders for  property
taxes, insurance, debt service and replacement reserves.

Real Estate Assets and Depreciation

Real  estate assets are carried at the lower of depreciated cost  or  net
realizable  value. Interest, property taxes, and other development  costs
incurred during construction is capitalized until completion. Interest of
$388,000  and  $91,000  was capitalized in 1997 and  1996,  respectively.
Repairs  and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred while significant
improvements, renovations, and replacements are capitalized.  The cost of
interior painting, vinyl flooring, and blinds are expensed as incurred.

In  conjunction with acquisitions of properties, the Company's policy  is
to  provide  in  its acquisition budgets adequate funds to  complete  any
deferred  maintenance  items  to bring the  properties  to  the  required
standard, including the cost of replacement appliances, carpet,  interior
painting, vinyl flooring, and blinds.  These costs are capitalized.

Following  a  review of its capital expenditure and depreciation  policy,
effective January 1, 1996, the Company implemented a new policy of  which
the  primary  changes  were  (i) to increase minimum  dollar  amounts  to
capitalize   from  $500  to  $1,000;   (ii)  for  stabilized   properties
(generally, properties owned and operated by the Company for at least one
year),  to  capitalize  replacement purchases for  major  appliances  and
carpeting of an entire apartment unit which was previously expensed;  and
(iii) to reduce the depreciation life of certain assets from 20 years  to
10 to 15 years.

The  Company  believes  that  the  newly  adopted  accounting  policy  is
preferable because it is consistent with policies currently being used by
the  majority  of  the  largest apartment REITs  and  provides  a  better
matching  of  expenses with the estimated benefit period. The   Company's
1995  financial statements were not restated for the effect of the change
in  accounting  policy.   The  policy has been implemented  prospectively
effective January 1, 1996.  The effect of the change in depreciable lives
was not material to consolidated net income of the Company.

Depreciation  is  computed on a straight line basis  over  the  estimated
useful  lives  of the related assets which range from 8 to 40  years  for
land  improvements and buildings and 5 years for furniture, fixtures  and
equipment.  Depreciation expense includes $195,000, $155,000 and $104,000
in  1997,  1996  and  1995  which relates to  computer  software,  office
furniture  and  fixtures and other assets found in other  industries  and
which is required to be recognized, for purposes of funds from operations
computations, as expenses in the calculation of net income.

The  Company periodically evaluates its real estate assets for impairment
based upon undiscounted cash flows and measures impairment based on  fair
value.  This  determination  is  dependent  primarily  on  the  Company's
estimates  on  occupancy,  rent  and expense  increases,  which  involves
numerous  assumptions and judgments as to future events over a period  of
many  years.  At December 31, 1997 the Company does not hold  any  assets
which meet the impairment criteria.

Real Estate Held for Development or Sale

Real  estate  held for development or sale, which consists  primarily  of
sites  intended  for future multifamily developments, is  stated  at  the
lower  of  aggregate cost or fair value.  The cost includes the  purchase
price of the land, construction, and development costs and fees, as  well
as capitalized interest and loan fees.

Deferred Costs and Intangibles

Organization costs are amortized using the straight line method  over  60
months.   Deferred financing costs are amortized over the  terms  of  the
related  debt  using  a  method which approximates the  interest  method.
Unamortized  cost  in  excess of fair value of net  assets  acquired   is
amortized using the straight line method over a range of 8 to 30 years.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In June 1997, SFAS No. 130, "Reporting Comprehensive Income," was issued,
effective  for  years beginning after December 15, 1997.  This  statement
establishes  standards for reporting and display of comprehensive  income
and its components in a full set of general purpose financial statements.
This  new accounting statement is not expected to have a material  impact
on  the  Company's consolidated financial statements.  The  Company  will
adopt this accounting standard in 1998.

Also  in  June  1997,  SFAS No. 131, "Disclosure  about  Segments  of  an
Enterprise  and  Related Information," was issued,  effective  for  years
beginning after December 15, 1997.  This statement requires companies  to
identify  segments consistent with the manner in which  management  makes
decisions  about  allocating resources to segments  and  measuring  their
performance.  Disclosures for the newly identified segments  are  similar
to  those required under current standards, with the addition of  certain
quarterly  disclosure  requirements.  It also establishes  standards  for
related  disclosures  about products and services, geographic  areas  and
major  customers.   The  Company will adopt this accounting  standard  in
1998.

Reclassification

Certain  prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform  with  1997
presentation. The reclassifications had no effect on shareholders' equity
or net income available for common shareholders.

2.   Business Combinations

On  November  25,  1997, the Company completed the merger  with  Flournoy
Development  Company  and  related entities ("FDC")  (the  "FDC  Merger")
accounted   for   using  the  purchase  method  of   accounting.    Total
consideration  consisted of $88,271,000, including  1,550,311  shares  of
common  stock  and  412,110 Operating Partnership  units  in  Mid-America
Apartments,  L.P., valued at $56,213,000 ($28.6875 per share  and  unit),
$29,608,000  cash and transaction costs of approximately $2,450,000.  The
Company   may  also  issue  additional  shares  of  Common  Stock    (the
"Contingent Value Shares") having a value of up to $7,500,000 if  certain
agreed upon conditions are satisfied during calendar years 1998, 1999 and
2000.   When and if issued, the Contingent Value Shares will be  recorded
as  additional purchase consideration based upon the fair  value  of  the
Common  Stock at the date of issuance.  The operating results of FDC  are
included  in the accompanying statement of operations commencing November
25, 1997.

The assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with the merger
were recorded at their respective fair values as follows:

     Fair value of assets acquired, 
           primarily real estate assets        $  411,397,000
     Liabilities assumed                          335,326,000

3. Borrowings

During  1997, the Company entered into a new $110 million line of  credit
agreement (the "Credit Line") which expires in November 1999.  The Credit
Line  is  secured by certain of the properties, bears interest  at  LIBOR
plus  1.25%  (7.07%  at December 31, 1997), and has  various  restrictive
financial covenants.  At December 31, 1997, $45.2 million was outstanding
under  the  Credit  Line.   At  December  31,  1996,  $30.4  million  was
outstanding under a $90 million line of credit, which was replaced by the
Credit Line.

At  December  31,  1997 MACP had indebtedness of $140 million  to  Morgan
Stanley  Mortgage Capital Inc. pursuant to a short-term  promissory  note
(the  MSMC  Loan).  The 26 Communities, with a net book value  of  $213.6
million  at  December 31, 1997, owned by MACP are pledged to  secure  the
MSMC  Loan.   The MSMC Loan has a variable interest rate  of  LIBOR  plus
1.00%  (6.72% at December 31, 1997).  The MSMC Loan was repaid subsequent
to December 31, 1997.  See note 11.

The  Company  has  approximately $447.0 million  and  $284.8  million  at
December  31, 1997 and 1996 under various mortgage notes payable.   These
notes  are  secured  by  real estate assets and certain  restricted  cash
accounts.

As  of December 31, 1997, the Company estimated that the weighted average
interest rate on the Company's debt was 7.41% with an average maturity of
10.2  years.  These  estimates  consider the  effect  of  the  MSMC  Loan
repayment discussed in note 11.

During  1997,  the  Company extinguished a bond  note,  resulting  in  an
extraordinary loss of $771,000.  At consummation of the merger with  FDC,
the  Company repaid certain debt primarily attributable to FDC, resulting
in an extraordinary loss of $7,851,000, net of minority interest.

The following tables summarize the Company's indebtedness at December 31,
1997.   The  tables  are prepared as if the issuance  of  the  commercial
mortgage  pass-through certificates and repayment of the MSMC Loan  which
occurred in 1998 (see note 11) had occurred at December 31, 1997:

- -------------------------------------------------------------------


The   Company's  indebtedness  includes  various  restrictive   financial
covenants.   The  Company believes that it was in compliance  with  these
covenants as of December 31, 1997.


4.  Fair Value Disclosure of Financial Instruments

Cash  and  cash  equivalents,  rental receivable,  accounts  payable  and
accrued  expenses and other liabilities and security deposits are carried
at amounts which reasonably approximate their fair value.

Fixed  rate   notes  payable at December 31, 1997 and 1996  total  $569.0
million and $268.0 million, respectively, and reasonably approximates the
estimated fair value (excluding prepayment penalties) based upon interest
rates available for the issuance of debt with similar terms and remaining
maturities as of December 31, 1997 and 1996.  These notes were subject to
prepayment  penalties, in the event of repayment prior to maturity.   The
carrying  value of variable rate notes payable at December 31,  1997  and
1996  total $63.2 million and $47.2 million, respectively, and reasonably
approximates their fair value.  Included in these variable rate notes are
certain Multifamily Housing Renewal bonds with rates which are less  than
the  prime  lending  rates at December 31, 1997 and 1996.   Approximately
$16.6  million  in 1997 and $16.8 million in 1996 of these mortgages  are
non-taxable and have lower rates than would be expected for taxable notes
with similar terms.

The  fair  value  estimates  presented herein are  based  on  information
available  to  management  as of December 31, 1997  and  1996.   Although
management  is  not aware of any factors that would significantly  affect
the   estimated   fair  value  amounts,  such  amounts  have   not   been
comprehensively revalued for purposes of these financial statements since
that  date,  and current estimates of fair value may differ significantly
from the amounts presented herein.

5.  Commitments and Contingencies

The  Company is not presently subject to any material litigation nor,  to
the  Company's  knowledge, is any material litigation threatened  against
the Company, other than routine litigation arising in the ordinary course
of  business,  some  of  which is expected to  be  covered  by  liability
insurance and none of which is expected to have a material adverse effect
on the consolidated financial statements of the Company.

The Company incurred lease expense relating to a five year aircraft lease
agreement  for  the  years ended December 31, 1997,  1996,  and  1995  of
$187,000, $185,400, and $185,400, respectively.

6.  Income Taxes

No  provision  for federal income taxes has been made in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements.  The Company has made an  election  to
be  taxed  as a Real Estate Investment Trust ("REIT") under Sections  856
through 860 of the Code.  As a REIT, the Company generally is not subject
to  Federal  income  tax to the extent it distributes  95%  of  its  REIT
taxable income to its shareholders and meets certain other tests relating
to  the number of shareholders, types of assets and allocable income.  If
the  Company fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, the  Company
will  be  subject  to  the Federal income tax (including  any  applicable
alternative  minimum  tax)  on its taxable income  at  regular  corporate
rates.   Even though  the Company qualifies for taxation as a  REIT,  the
Company may be subject to certain Federal, state and local taxes  on  its
income  and  property  and  to  Federal income  and  excise  tax  on  its
undistributed income.

Earnings  and  profits, which determine the taxability  of  dividends  to
shareholders,  differ  from net income reported for  financial  reporting
purposes primarily because of differences in depreciable lives, bases  of
certain  assets  and  liabilities and in the  timing  of  recognition  of
earnings  upon  disposition  of  properties.   For  federal  income   tax
purposes,  the  following summarizes the taxability of cash distributions
paid  on  the common shares in 1996 and 1995 and the estimated taxability
for 1997:

                                  1997       1996       1995

$98.2 million.  The Company contributed the net proceeds of the offerings
to  the Operating Partnership in exchange for additional Common Units  in
the Operating Partnership.

Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan

In  January 1997, the Company adopted a Dividend Reinvestment  and  Stock
Purchase  Plan (the "DRSPP") pursuant to which the Company's shareholders
will  be  permitted  to  acquire  shares  of  Common  Stock  through  the
reinvestment of distributions on Common Stock, Series A Preferred  Stock,
Series  B  Preferred  Stock   and through  optional  cash  payments  from
shareholders. The Company has registered with the Securities and Exchange
Commission  the  offer and sale of up to 750,000 shares of  Common  Stock
pursuant  to the DRSPP. During 1997,  24,785 shares of Common Stock  were
acquired by shareholders pursuant to the DRSPP.

Earnings Per Share and Dividend Data

The  Company  adopted SFAS No. 128, "Earnings per Share",  effective  for
financial  statements for periods ending after December  15,  1997.   All
prior period EPS data has been restated to conform with the provisions of
this statement.

The  computation  of basic earnings per share is based  on  the  weighted
average  number of common shares outstanding.  The computation of diluted
earnings  per  share is based on the weighted average  number  of  common
shares outstanding plus the shares resulting from the assumed exercise of
all  outstanding options using the treasury stock method.  The  following
table provides a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the
basic  and  diluted earnings per share computations for the  years  ended
December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995.



                                                                        
[FN]
The  computation  of earnings per share does not include  the  Contingent
Value  Shares  which may be issued in 1998, 1999, and  2000  due  to  the
conditions for issuance of the shares have not been satisfied.


8.  Employee Benefit Plans

401 (k) Savings Plan

The  Mid-America  Apartment Communities, Inc. 401(k) Savings  Plan  is  a
defined  contribution  plan that satisfies the  requirements  of  Section
401(a) and 401(k) of the Code.  The Company may, but is not obligated to,
make a matching contribution of $.50 for each $1.00 contributed, up to 6%
of  the  participant's compensation. The Company's contribution  to  this
plan  was  $154,300,  $118,700  and  $81,600  in  1997,  1996  and  1995,
respectively.

Non-qualified Deferred Compensation Plan

The  Company has adopted a non-qualified deferred compensation  plan  for
key  employees  who are not qualified for participation in the  Company's
401  (k) Savings Plan.  Under the terms of the plan, employees may  elect
to  defer  a percentage of their compensation and the Company  matches  a
portion  of  their  salary deferral.  The plan is designed  so  that  the
employees' investment earnings under the non-qualified plan should be the
same  as  the earning assets in the Company's 401 (k) Savings Plan.   The
Company's match to this plan in 1997, 1996 and 1995 was $18,600,  $23,600
and $8,600, respectively.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

The  Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan
(the  "ESPP") provides a means for employees to purchase common stock  of
the Company.  The board has authorized the issuance of 150,000 shares for
the plan.  The ESPP is administered by the Compensation Committee who may
annually  grant  options  to  employees to purchase  annually  up  to  an
aggregate of 15,000 shares of common stock at a price equal to 85% of the
market  price of the common stock.  During 1997, 1996 and 1995, the  ESPP
purchased 2,758, 3,176 and 2,710 shares, respectively.

Employee Stock Ownership Plan

The Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. Employee Stock Ownership Plan
(the  "ESOP") which is a non-contributory stock bonus plan that satisfies
the  requirements of Section 401 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code.   Each
employee  of  the Company is eligible to participate in  the  ESOP  after
attaining the age of 21 years and completing one year of service with the
Company.   Participants'  ESOP accounts will be 100%  vested  after  five
years  of  continuous service, with no vesting prior to that  time.   The
Company  contributed  22,500 shares of Common  Stock  to  the  ESOP  upon
conclusion  of  the  IPO.   During  1997,  1996  and  1995,  the  Company
contributed  $344,000, $276,000 and $186,000, respectively, to  the  ESOP
which   purchased   an  additional  11,921,  8,208  and   5,148   shares,
respectively.

Stock Option Plan

The  Company has adopted the 1994 Restricted Stock and Stock Option  Plan
(the  "Plan")  to  provide incentives to attract and  retain  independent
directors,  executive officers and key employees.  The Plan provides  for
the  grant of options to purchase a specified number of shares of  common
stock  ("Options")  or  grants  of  restricted  shares  of  common  stock
("Restricted Stock").  The Plan also allows the Company to grant  options
to  purchase Operating Partnership units at the price of the Common Stock
on  the New York Stock Exchange on the day prior to issuance of the units
(the  "LESOP Provision").  The Plan authorizes Options to buy a total  of
500,000  shares of common stock. The Compensation Committee of the  Board
of Directors is responsible for granting Options and shares of Restricted
Stock  and  for establishing the exercise price of Options and terms  and
conditions  of Restricted Stock.  During the first quarter of  1997,  the
Company  amended the Plan to increase the shares authorized  an  increase
from 500,000 to 1,000,000 and to remove the restriction on the number  of
options that may be issued, subject to overall plan limits.

In  1997  the  Company  granted options to certain executives  and  other
officers  to purchase 96,000 shares of Common Stock and 110,000 Operating
Partnership  units pursuant to the LESOP Provision.  In 1997  options  to
purchase  75,000 shares of common stock and 110,000 Operating Partnership
units were exercised and the Company advanced a portion  of
the  purchase  price  of  these shares and  units.   The  employee  
advances mature five years from date of issuance and accrue  interest,
payable in arrears, at a rate of 7.0% per annum.  At December 31,  1997,
the  outstanding principal balance on the employee advances  was
approximately  $700,000  and is recorded in the  Company's  statement  of
shareholders' equity.  The Company entered into supplemental bonus agreements
with   the  employees which are intended to fund the payment of the advances
over a five year period.   Under  the  terms  of  the  supplemental   bonus
agreements, the Company will pay cash bonuses to these employees equal to
20%  of  the original note balance on each anniversary date of the notes.
The  bonuses  are limited to 15% of the aggregate purchase price  of  the
common shares and units.

A  summary  of changes in Options to acquire shares of Common  Stock  and
Operating Partnership Units for the three years ended December  31,  1997

Exercise  prices for options outstanding as of December 31,  1997  ranged
from  $19.75 to $29.50.  The weighted average remaining contractual  life
of those options is 8 years.

On  January  1,  1996, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123, "Accounting  for
Stock-Based Compensation",  which requires either the (i) fair  value  of
employee  stock-based compensation plans be recorded as  a  component  of
compensation  expense in the statement of operations as of  the  date  of
grant  of awards related to such plans, or (ii) impact of such fair value
on net income and earnings per share be disclosed on a pro forma basis in
a  footnote to financial statements for awards granted after December 15,
1994,  if  the  accounting for such awards continues to be in  accordance
with  Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting  for  Stock
Issued  to  Employees,"  ("APB  25").  The  Company  will  continue  such
accounting under the provisions of APB 25.  The pro forma effects in 1997
and 1996 to net income per common share were not considered material.


9.  Financial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk

The  Partnership  has only limited involvement with derivative  financial
instruments  and does not use them for trading purposes.  The Partnership
occasionally  utilizes  derivative financial  instruments  as  hedges  in
anticipation of future debt transactions to manage well-defined  interest
rate risk.

In  anticipation of the March 6, 1998 financing transaction discussed  in
Note  11  "Subsequent Events (Unaudited)", the Partnership  entered  into
four  separate  interest  rate contracts in 1997  with  notional  amounts
aggregating  $140  million.  As of December 31, 1997 the  fair  value  of
these  interest  rate  contracts,  based  on  broker  estimates,  was  an
unrealized loss of approximately $1.1 million ($1.4 million realized loss
as  of March 6, 1998). Unrealized changes in the market value of interest
rate  contracts are deferred until the hedged transaction  is  consumated
and  realized gains and losses resulting from changes in the market value
of  these contacts are deferred and amortized into interest expense  over
the life of the related debt issuance.

10. Related Party Transaction

During 1997 the Company acquired its corporate headquarters building  for
$2,912,000  from a partnership whose partners included certain  executive
officers  of  the Company.  The consideration paid consisted of  $862,000
cash,  22,246 Operating Partnership Units valued at $634,000 ($28.50  per
unit)  and the assumption of an existing loan.  Prior to acquisition  the
Company leased the building from the partnership.

11.  Subsequent Events  (Unaudited)

Declaration of Dividend

The  Company declared a fourth quarter common stock dividend of $.55  per
share  to  be  paid January 30, 1998 to holders of record on January  23,
1998.

Completed Acquisitions

Since December 31, 1997, the Company has acquired the following apartment
communities (the "Completed Acquisitions") containing an aggregate of 392

mortgage bonds (the "MACP Bonds") secured by liens on 26 properties owned
by  MACP.   The  MACP Bonds were issued to Mid-America Finance,  Inc.,  a
wholly  owned  qualified REIT subsidiary of the Company, which  deposited
MACP  Bonds  into  a  grantor  trust (the  "Trust").   The  Trust  issued
commercial  mortgage  pass-through certificates  representing  beneficial
ownership  of  the  MACP Bonds.  The five year fixed rate  non-amortizing
certificates  bear interest at 6.376%.  The net proceeds to  the  Company
were  approximately  $139.2 million after payment  of  initial  discount,
underwriters' fees, costs of rate lock and other expenses.   The  Company
used  the  net proceeds of  the MACP Bonds to repay the MSMC  Loan.  

On  March  13,  1998,  the  Company issued mortgages  of  $36.2  million,
refinancing  $29.04 million of existing loans.  These new  mortgages  are
fixed at 7.00% and will amortize over 25 years and will balloon in 2005.

On  March  16, 1998, the Company increased its line of credit  from  $110
million to $200 million with terms substantially the same as before.
