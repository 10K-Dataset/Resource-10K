ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

THE COMPANY

Mid-America  Apartment  Communities,  Inc.  (the  "Company")  is   a
Memphis, Tennessee-based self-administered and self-managed umbrella
partnership  REIT  ("UPREIT") which owns and operates  76  apartment
communities  containing 20,154 apartment units  in  12  states  (the
"Communities"),  and  has  definitive  agreements  to  acquire   two
additional apartment communities containing 616 apartment units.  As
measured by the number of apartment units owned, the Company is  the
sixth largest apartment REIT in the United States.

Founded  in 1977 by George E. Cates, the Company's Chairman  of  the
Board  of  Directors  and  Chief Executive  Officer,  the  Company's
predecessor  grew  from an operator of a single  252-unit  apartment
community  in Memphis, Tennessee into a fully-integrated  owner  and
operator  of  5,580 apartment units in 22 apartment  communities  in
four  southeastern states immediately prior to the Company's initial
public offering in February 1994 (the "Initial Offering"). Since the
Initial  Offering,  the  Company's portfolio  has  increased  by  54
apartment  communities containing 14,574 apartment units,  including
12  apartment communities containing 3,212 apartment units  acquired
in  the  Company's merger with America First REIT, Inc.  ("AFR")  in
June 1995 (the "AFR Merger") for an aggregate value of approximately
$111  million  (as  measured by Common Stock  issued  and  AFR  debt
assumed).

The  Company's business is conducted principally through Mid-America
Apartments,  L.P., a Tennessee limited partnership  (the  "Operating
Partnership").   The  Company is the sole  general  partner  of  the
Operating  Partnership,  holding, as of  December  31,  1996,  a  1%
general  partnership  interest  in the  Operating  Partnership.  The
Company  is also a limited partner in the Operating Partnership  and
as  of  December 31, 1996 held 4,253,448 common units of partnership
interests,  ("Common  Units"), or 38.45% of all  outstanding  Common
Units. The Company's wholly-owned qualified REIT subsidiary, MAC  of
Delaware, Inc., a Delaware corporation, is a limited partner in  the
Operating  Partnership and, as of December 31, 1996, held  4,253,448
Common Units, or 38.45% of all outstanding Common Units.

In  connection  with the formation of the Operating Partnership  and
the  Initial  Offering, the Operating Partnership  issued  2,460,413
Common Units  to the former owners of Communities contributed to the
Operating Partnership.  The Common Units held by such former  owners
are redeemable by the holders, at their option, for shares of Common
Stock  on a one-for-one basis or, at the Company's option, for cash.
The Company has filed a shelf registration statement relating to the
offer  and sale of the Common Units  by the holders thereof.  As  of
December  31, 1996, such former owners held 2,444,352 Common  Units,
or 22.1% of all outstanding Common Units.

Certain  Communities are owned by limited partnerships of which  the
Operating  Partnership and the Company or a wholly  owned  qualified
REIT  subsidiary are the only partners.  In addition,  the  Company,
directly  or  through six wholly owned qualified REIT  subsidiaries,
owns 15 Communities.


OPERATING PHILOSOPHY

MID-SIZE  MARKET  FOCUS.  The Company focuses on owning,  operating,
and  acquiring  apartment communities in mid-size  southeastern  and
Texas cities. The Company believes that these markets generally have
been  less  susceptible to apartment overbuilding during  past  real
estate  investment cycles, and the Company believes  that  apartment
communities  in these markets offer attractive long-term  investment
returns. The Company seeks to acquire apartment communities  in  its
existing markets and selected new markets where it believes there is
less   competition  for  acquisitions  from  other  well-capitalized
buyers.  The Company believes it can acquire apartment  units  at  a
significant discount to estimated replacement cost in these markets.
INTENSIVE MANAGEMENT FOCUS.  The Company strongly emphasizes on-site
property  management. Particular attention is paid to  opportunities
to increase rents, raise average occupancy rates, and control costs,
with property managers being given the responsibility for monitoring
market  trends  and  the discretion to react  to  such  trends.  The
Company has had demonstrable success in this regard as evidenced by:
(i)  monthly rental per apartment unit was $529 at December 31, 1996
versus $508 at December 31, 1995, which represented a 4.1% increase;
(ii)  average occupancy during 1996 was 95.4% versus 95.2% in  1995;
and  (iii)  during  1996 the Company was able to  decrease  property
operating  expenses  as a percentage of revenue principally  through
the  installation  of individual apartment unit  water  and  utility
meters.

DEDICATION  TO  CUSTOMER SERVICE.  Management's experience  is  that
maintaining a consistently high level of customer satisfaction leads
to   greater  demand  for  the  Company's  apartment  units,  higher
occupancy  and  rental rates, and increased long-term profitability.
The   Company,  as  part  of  its  intense  management  focus,   has
implemented  a  practice of having highly trained property  managers
and   service  technicians  on-site  at  each  of  the  Communities.
Management undertakes frequent resident surveys and focus groups, in
order to measure customer satisfaction.

DECENTRALIZED  OPERATIONAL  STRUCTURE.   The  Company's  operational
structure is organized on a geographic basis. The Company's property
managers  have  overall operating responsibility for their  specific
Communities. Property managers report to area managers  or  regional
managers  who, in turn, are accountable to the Company's  President.
Management  believes  that  its  decentralized  operating  structure
capitalizes   on  specific  market  knowledge,  increases   personal
accountability relative to a centralized structure and is beneficial
in the acquisition, redevelopment and development process.

GROWTH STRATEGIES

The  Company seeks to increase earnings per share and operating cash
flow  to  maximize shareholder value through a balanced strategy  of
internal and external growth.

INTERNAL  GROWTH  STRATEGY.  Management's goal is  to  maximize  its
return  on  investment in each Community by increasing rental  rates
and  reducing  operating expenses while maintaining  high  occupancy
levels.  The  Company  (i)  seeks  higher  net  rental  revenues  by
enhancing and maintaining the competitiveness of the Communities and
(ii)  manages  expenses  through its system of  detailed  management
reporting  and  accountability  in order  to  achieve  increases  in
operating  cash  flow.  The  steps taken to  meet  these  objectives
include:

          *   empowering the Company's property managers  to  adjust
rents  in  response  to local market conditions and  to  concentrate
resident turnover in peak rental demand months;

          *   implementing  programs  to  control  expenses  through
investment  in cost-saving initiatives, such as the installation  of
individual   apartment  unit  water and utility  meters  in  certain
Communities;

          *   ensuring  that,  through monthly  inspections  of  all
Communities by senior management and prompt attention to maintenance
and   recurring   capital  needs,  the  Communities   are   properly
maintained;

          *   improving the "curb appeal" of the Communities through
extensive  landscaping and exterior improvements  and  repositioning
Communities  from  time  to  time  to  maintain  market   leadership
positions;

         *  investing heavily in training programs for its property-
level personnel;

         *  compensating  all employees through  performance-based
compensation programs and stock ownership programs; and

         *  maintaining  a  hands-on management style  and  "flat"
organizational   structure  that  emphasizes   senior   management's
continued close contact with the market and employees.



EXTERNAL GROWTH STRATEGY.  The Company's external growth strategy is
to  acquire and selectively develop additional apartment units  and,
when  apartment  communities no longer meet the Company's  long-term
strategic objectives or investment return goals, to dispose of those
Communities.  Through  the UPREIT structure,  the  Company  has  the
ability  to  acquire apartment communities through the  issuance  of
UPREIT   Units  in  tax-deferred  exchanges  with  owners  of   such
properties.  Since the Initial Offering, the Company  has  grown  by
14,574  apartment units, an increase of approximately 261% over  the
number of apartment units immediately prior to the Initial Offering.
Typical attributes of apartment communities which the Company  seeks
to acquire are:

         *  well-constructed properties having attractive locations,
potential for increases in rental rates and occupancy, potential for
reductions in operating costs and acquisition prices below estimated
replacement cost;

         *   properties  with  opportunities  for  internal  growth
through (i) market repositioning by means of property upgrades which
typically  include  landscaping,  selective  refurbishing  and   the
addition  of  amenities  and (ii) realizing economies  of  scale  in
management and purchasing;  and

         *  properties located in the Company's existing markets and
mid-size  southeastern and Texas metropolitan areas having favorable
market characteristics.

In addition, the Company develops new apartments when it believes it
can  achieve  an attractive return on investment. Since the  Initial
Offering,  the  Company  has  completed  the  following  development
projects:

         *  122  apartment units constructed at the Woods of  Post
House  in  Jackson,  Tennessee in close  proximity  to  three  other
Communities;

         *   24 additional apartment units at the Reflection Pointe
apartment community in Jackson, Mississippi; and

         *   32  additional  apartment units at  the  Park  Haywood
apartment community in Greenville, South Carolina.

In  the  Fall of 1996, the Company commenced construction of a  234-
unit  expansion  of  the  384-unit Lincoln on  the  Green  apartment
community  at the Tournament Players' Club at Southwind in  Memphis,
Tennessee.  Construction  of  that  expansion  is  expected  to   be
completed  in  the  Fall of 1997. Several other  expansion  and  new
development opportunities are currently being explored.

COMPLETED  ACQUISITIONS.     During 1996, the Company has  acquired
the  following apartment communities (the "Completed Acquisitions")
containing  an  aggregate  of  1,760 apartment  units  (dollars  in
millions):


(1)  Excluding additional customary closing costs, including expenses and
  commissions.


COMPETITION

All of the Company's communities are located in developed areas that
include other apartment communities.  Occupancy and rental rates are
affected  by  the number of competitive apartment communities  in  a
particular  area.   The Company's properties compete  with  numerous
other  multifamily properties, the owners of which may have  greater
resources  than  the  Company and whose  management  may  have  more
experience  than the Company's management.  Moreover,  single-family
rental  housing, manufactured housing, condominiums and the new  and
existing  home  market  provide housing  alternatives  to  potential
residents of apartment communities.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

RECENT  ACQUISITIONS

Since  December  31,  1996, the Company has acquired  the  following
apartment  communities  (the  "Recent Acquisitions")  containing  an
aggregate of 874 apartment units (dollars in millions):



The  Company  funded  the  cash required to  consummate  the  Recent
Acquisitions with borrowings under the Company's unsecured bank line
of credit (the "Credit Line").

PROPOSED ACQUISITIONS

The  Company  has  entered into definitive  agreements  to  purchase
Woodhollow  apartments containing 450 apartment units  and  Westside
Creek Phase  II ("Westside II") containing 166 apartment units.  The
seller  of  Westside II has the option to delay the closing  of  the
sale  for  up  to six months, during which period the  Company  will
manage  the  property for a management fee equal to  4.5%  of  gross
revenue  from  the  property. The Company plans  to  fund  the  cash
required  to  consummate the Proposed  Acquisitions with  borrowings
under the Credit Line.

DISTRIBUTION INCREASE

In  January  1997, the Company raised its quarterly distribution  to
common  shareholders  from  $.51  per  share  to  $.535  per  share,
effective with its distribution paid on January 31, 1997.

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND STOCK PURCHASE PLAN

In  January  1997,  the Company adopted a Dividend Reinvestment  and
Stock  Purchase Plan (the "DRSPP") pursuant to which  the  Company's
shareholders  will be permitted to acquire shares  of  Common  Stock
through  the reinvestment of distributions on Common Stock  and  the
Company's  Series A Cumulative Preferred Stock ("Series A  Preferred
Stock")  and  through optional cash payments from shareholders.  The
Company  has registered with the Securities and Exchange  Commission
the  offer and sale of up to 750,000 shares of Common Stock pursuant
to  the  DRSPP. It is expected that shareholders of the Company  may
begin participating in the DRSPP commencing with the Company's April
1997  distribution to holders of Common Stock. See "Part II  Item  5
Market  for  Registrant's  Common  Equity  and  Related  Stockholder
Matters".


COMMON STOCK OFFERING

In  March 1997, the Company offered and sold to the public 2,300,000
shares  of common stock, (the "Offering").  The net proceeds to  the
Company from the Offering totaled approximately $62.4 million  after
payment  of all underwriting discounts and expenses of the Offering.
The  Company  contributed the net proceeds of the  Offering  to  the
Operating Partnership in exchange for additional Common Units in the
Operating   Partnership.   The  Operating   Partnership   will   use
substantially   all  of  the  net  proceeds  to  repay   outstanding
borrowings  under the Credit Line and any excess will  be  used  for
general  corporate purposes, including acquisitions. Amounts  repaid
under  the Credit Line may be re-borrowed (subject to the terms  and
limits  of  the  Credit Line) to finance acquisitions of  additional
apartment communities and for  other corporate purposes.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES

The  Company  seeks  to acquire apartment communities  appealing  to
middle  and  upper  income  residents  in  mid-size  cities  in  the
southeastern  United  States and Texas.  Approximately  64%  of  the
Company's  apartment  units are located in  Tennessee,  Florida  and
Texas  markets.  The Company's strategic focus  is  to  provide  its
residents  high  quality  apartment units  in  attractive  community
settings,  characterized by extensive landscaping and  attention  to
aesthetic  detail. The Company utilizes its experience and expertise
in maintenance, landscaping, marketing and management to effectively
"reposition" many of the apartment communities it acquires to  raise
occupancy  levels and per unit average rentals. The average  age  of
the  Communities at December 31, 1996 was 12.8 years. The  following
table  sets  forth certain operating data regarding the Company  for
the periods indicated.




The  following  table  sets forth selected financial  and  operating
information on an historical basis for the 73 Communities  owned  at

ITEM 5.  MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED
STOCKHOLDER MATTERS

The  Common Stock has been listed and traded on the NYSE  under  the
symbol  "MAA" since the Initial Offering in February 1994. On  March
21, 1997, the reported last sale price of the Company's common stock
on  the NYSE was $29.00 per share and there were approximately 1,477
holders  of record of the Common Stock. The Company estimates  there
are  approximately 11,000 beneficial owners of the Common Stock. The
following  table sets forth the quarterly high and low sales  prices
of  the  Common  Stock as reported on the NYSE and the distributions
declared by the Company with respect to the periods indicated.



The  Company's current annual distribution rate with respect to  the
Common  Stock is $2.14 per share. The actual distributions  made  by
the  Company will be affected by a number of factors, including  the
gross revenues received from the Communities, the operating expenses
of  the  Company,  the interest expense incurred on  borrowings  and
unanticipated capital expenditures.

The  Company pays a preferential regular monthly distribution on the
Series A Preferred Stock issued in October 1996 at an annual rate of
$2.375  per  share. No distribution may be made on the Common  Stock
unless all accrued distributions have been made with respect to  the
Series A Preferred Stock. No assurance can be given that the Company
will  be able to maintain its distribution rate on its Common  Stock
or  make  required  distributions  with  respect  to  the  Series  A
Preferred Stock.



In  January  1997,  the Company implemented the  DRSPP  under  which
holders  of  Common Stock (and Series A Preferred Stock)  may  elect
automatically  to reinvest their distributions in additional  shares
of  Common  Stock and/or to make optional purchases of Common  Stock
free of brokerage commissions and charges. Shares purchased directly
from the Company will be purchased at up to a 3% discount from their
fair  market  value  at  the Company's discretion.  To  fulfill  its
obligations under the DRSPP, the Company may either issue additional
shares  of  Common  Stock or repurchase Common  Stock  in  the  open
market.

Future distributions by the Company will be at the discretion of the
Board  of  Directors  and will depend on the actual funds  available
for  distribution  of the Company, its financial condition,  capital
requirements,  the annual distribution requirements under  the  REIT
provisions  of  the  Code and such other factors  as  the  Board  of
Directors deems relevant.

ITEM   7.     MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION  AND  ANALYSIS  OF  FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

OVERVIEW

The   following  is  a  discussion  of  the  consolidated  financial
condition  and  results of operations of the Company for  the  years
ended December 31, 1996, 1995,  and 1994. This discussion should  be
read   in   conjunction   with  all  of  the  financial   statements
incorporated  by  reference into this Annual Report  on  Form  10-K.
These financial statements include all adjustments which are, in the
opinion of management, necessary to reflect a fair statement of  the
results  for the interim periods presented, and all such adjustments
are of a normal recurring nature.

FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS

Funds  from  operations ("FFO") represents net income  (computed  in
accordance  with  GAAP)  excluding  extraordinary  items,   minority
interest   in  Operating  Partnership  income,  gain  or   loss   on
disposition  of  real  estate assets, and  certain  non-cash  items,
primarily  depreciation  and  amortization,  less  preferred   stock
dividends.  The  Company  computes FFO in accordance  with  NAREIT's
current   definition,  which  eliminates  amortization  of  deferred
financing costs and depreciation of non-real estate assets as  items
added  back  to  net income when computing FFO. The Company  adopted
this  method of calculating FFO effective as of the NAREIT-suggested
adoption date of January 1, 1996. FFO should not be considered as an
alternative  to  net  income  or  any  other  GAAP  measurement   of
performance,  as  an  indicator of operating performance  or  as  an
alternative  to cash flows from operating, investing, and  financing
activities as a measure of liquidity. The Company believes that  FFO
is  helpful in understanding the Company's results of operations  in
that  such  calculation reflects cash flow from operating activities
and  the  Company's ability to support interest payments and general
operating expenses before the impact of certain activities  such  as
changes in other assets and accounts payable.

For   the   year    ended  December  31,  1996,  FFO  increased   by
approximately $6,809,000 or 23.7%, when compared to the year earlier
(adjusted  only for the new NAREIT definition of FFO). The  increase
was primarily attributable to an approximate $16,919,000 increase in
revenues, which was partially offset by increases in expenses mainly
associated with the increase in the number of apartment units  owned
by  the Company. On a per share basis, FFO increased 8.6% from $2.44
per share (restated for the effect of adoption of the current NAREIT
FFO  definition and the change in accounting policy)  for  the  year
ended  December 31, 1995 to $2.65 per share for the same  period  in
1996.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES

Following  a  review  of  its capital expenditure  and  depreciation
policy,  effective  January 1, 1996, the Company implemented  a  new
policy of which the primary changes are as follows:

(a)  Increase minimum dollar amounts to capitalize from $500 to $1,000;

(b)   For  stabilized Communities (generally, Communities owned  and
operated   by  the  Company  for  at  least  one  year),  capitalize
replacement  purchases  for major appliances  and  carpeting  of  an
entire apartment unit which was previously expensed; and

(c)  Reduce depreciation life for certain assets from 20 years to 10
to 15 years.


The  Company  believes that the newly adopted accounting  policy  is
preferable  because it is consistent with policies  currently  being
used  by the majority of the largest apartment REITs and provides  a
better  matching of expenses with the estimated benefit period.  The
Company's  1995 and 1994 financial statements were not restated  for
the  effect of the change in accounting policy.  The policy has been
implemented prospectively effective January 1, 1996.



The  following table presents the impact on 1995 net income  of  the
Company's new capitalization policy and adoption of NAREIT's current
definition of FFO.




RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

COMPARISON OF YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1996 TO THE YEAR ENDED
DECEMBER 31, 1995

During   the  1996  period,  the  Company  acquired  six   apartment
communities  and sold three apartment communities. The total  number
of  apartment  units owned at December 31, 1996  was  19,280  in  73
apartment  communities,  compared to 18,219  in  70  communities  at
December  31,  1995.  Average  monthly  rental  per  apartment  unit
increased  to  $529 at December 31, 1996 from $508 at  December  30,
1995.  Average occupancy for the years ended  December 31, 1996  and
1995 was 95.4% and 95.2%, respectively.

Total revenues for 1996 increased by approximately $16,919,000,  due
primarily  to (i) approximately $4,833,000 from the six  Communities
acquired  in 1996, (ii)  approximately $7,156,000 from a full  years
operation  of  the  15 Communities acquired in 1995,  including  the
Communities   acquired  in  the  AFR  Merger,  (iii)   approximately
$4,363,000  from the Communities owned throughout both periods,  and
(iv)  approximately  $567,000 from   The  Woods  at  Post  House  in
Jackson, Tennessee  which completed development in the Fall of 1995.

Property  operating  expenses for 1996  increased  by  approximately
$4,616,000, due primarily to (i) approximately $1,686,000  from  the
six  Communities  acquired  in 1996, (ii)  approximately  $2,746,000
from a full years operations of the 15 Communities acquired in 1995,
including  the  Communities acquired in the AFR  Merger,  and  (iii)
approximately  $234,000  from The Woods at Post  House  in  Jackson,
Tennessee   which completed development in the Fall of  1995.  These
increases  were offset by a decrease of approximately  $51,000  from
the   Communities   owned  throughout  both  periods.   Repair   and
maintenance  expense decreased primarily due to the  change  in  the
capitalization policy described above. Utility costs decreased  from
6.1%  of revenue to 5.5% of revenue for the year ended December  31,
1996  compared to the same period a year earlier, due  primarily  to
the installation of 6,400 individual apartment unit water meters and
the completion of the individual apartment unit electricity metering
at Sailwinds at Lake Magdalene.



General  and  administrative expense increased in 1996 approximately
$1,303,000  primarily due to the opening of the new training  center
and other expenses due to the continued growth of the company.

Depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily due to (i)
approximately  $893,000 from the six apartment communities  acquired
in  1996,  (ii)   approximately $1,346,000  from  the  15  apartment
communities acquired in 1995, including the Communities acquired  in
the  AFR  Merger,  (iii)  approximately $2,187,000  from  additional
capital  expenditures on Communities owned throughout both  periods,
and  (iv)  approximately $443,000 from  The Woods at Post  House  in
Jackson, Tennessee  which completed development in the Fall of 1995.
Amortization  of deferred financing costs and unamortized  costs  in
excess  of  fair  value  of  net  assets  acquired  for  1996   were
approximately $661,000 and approximately $192,000, respectively.

Interest expense increased approximately $3,082,000 during 1996  due
primarily to apartment acquisitions. The Company reduced the average
borrowing cost to 7.92% at December 31, 1996 as compared to 8.15% on
December  31, 1995. The average maturity on the Company's  debt  was
9.9 years at both December 31, 1996 and 1995.

In 1996, the Company recorded an approximate $2,185,000 gain for the
disposition  of  three apartment communities.  As a  result  of  the
foregoing,  income  before  minority interest  for  the  year  ended
December  31, 1996 increased approximately $5,166,000 over the  same
period a year earlier.

COMPARISON  OF  YEAR  ENDED DECEMBER 31,  1995  TO  THE  YEAR  ENDED
DECEMBER 31, 1994   (THE COMPANY AND ITS PREDECESSOR)

The  total number of apartment units owned at December 31, 1995  was
18,219  in  70  apartment  communities, compared  to  14,333  in  54
communities  at  December  31,  1994.  Average  monthly  rental  per
apartment  unit  increased  to $508 for 1995  from  $482  for  1994.
Average   occupancy  for  1995  and  1994  was  95.2%   and   95.5%,
respectively.

For  the 10,268 apartment units owned on December 31, 1995 and 1994,
average   occupancy  increased  to  95.4%  as  compared  to   92.8%,
respectively,  and  the average monthly rental  per  apartment  unit
increased for this same period 6.2% to $499 from $470.

Total revenues for 1995 increased by approximately $43,756,000,  due
primarily  to  (i) approximately $13,966,000 from the  15  apartment
communities acquired, including the Communities acquired in the  AFR
Merger,  (ii) approximately $28,348,000 from a full year's operation
of   32  Communities  acquired  in  1994,  and  (iii)  approximately
$1,442,000  from the Communities owned throughout both  periods.  In
addition, the Company completed the development of The Woods at Post
House in Jackson, Tennessee in the Fall of 1995.

Property  operating expenses increased by approximately  $18,470,000
over  1994.  The  increase primarily resulted from (i) approximately
$5,514,000  of  operating expense from the 15 apartment  communities
acquired  in  1995, including the Communities acquired  in  the  AFR
Merger, (ii) approximately $12,243,000 for full year's operation  of
the  32  Communities  acquired  in  1994,  and  (iii)  approximately
$713,000  from  the  apartment  communities  owned  throughout  both
periods.  As  a  percentage of revenue, property operating  expenses
increased to 40.0% from 38.1% for the year ended December  31,  1995
and  1994,  respectively. The 5,176 apartment  units  owned  in  the
states  of  Florida and Texas acquired during 1994 and 1995  account
for  a  2.5%  increase in the expense ratio. As anticipated  in  the
acquisition  forecasts,  these  apartment  units  have   been   more
expensive  to  operate than the balance of the  Communities.  During
1995,  approximately  $1,374,000 was  expensed  for  replacement  of
appliances and carpets compared to approximately $888,000 for  1994.
General  and  administrative expenses decreased to 5.1% of  revenues
for  1995  from 7.1% for 1994 as a result of increased  efficiencies
from the economies of scale.



Depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily due to (i)
an  increase  of  approximately $2,017,000  from  the  15  apartment
communities   acquired  during  1995  and  (ii)   an   increase   of
approximately $5,390,000 for a full year's operation of 32 apartment
communities acquired during 1994. Amortization of deferred financing
costs  and  unamortized costs in excess of fair value of net  assets
acquired  for  1995  were approximately $593,000  and  approximately
$186,000, respectively.

Interest expense increased approximately $12,451,000 during 1995 due
to  apartment communities acquired during the year as well as a full
year  of  operation  for Communities acquired in 1994.  The  Company
reduced the average borrowing cost to 8.15% at December 31, 1995  as
compared to 8.45% on December 31, 1994. The average maturity on  the
Company's debt increased to 9.9 years from 8.7 years at December 31,
1995 and 1994, respectively.

As  a  result of the foregoing, income before minority interest  and
extraordinary  items  in 1995 increased by approximately  $3,529,000
over 1994.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Net  cash  flow  provided  by  operating activities  increased  from
approximately $34,289,000 for the year ended December  31,  1995  to
approximately $38,018,000 for the year ended December 31, 1996.  The
increase  in net cash flow was primarily due to an increase  in  net
income,  depreciation  and amortization, and  accrued  expenses  and
liabilities.  This increase in net cash flow provided  by  operating
activities was offset by an increase in restricted cash  due  to  an
increase  in  tax-exempt  bond financing requiring  additional  cash
reserves  and  increases in other mortgage escrows  and  replacement
reserves  and  the  gain  recorded  for  the  disposition  of  three
apartment communities.

Net   cash   flow  used  in  investing  activities  increased   from
approximately $39,167,000 for the year ended December  31,  1995  to
approximately $70,436,000 for the year ended December 31, 1996.  The
increase  was  primarily due to the acquisition of  1,760  apartment
units  in  1996  for approximately $66,258,000 as  compared  to  the
acquisition  of  520  apartment  units  in  1995  for  approximately
$15,561,000.  This  increase  in net cash  flow  used  in  investing
activities was offset by the sale of three apartment communities  in
1996 for approximately $17,096,000. Capital improvements to existing
properties  totaled  approximately $18,437,000 for  the  year  ended
December  31,  1996, compared to approximately $19,233,000  for  the
same  period  in  1995.  Of  the  $18,437,000  capital  improvements
approximately  $6,979,000  was for recurring  capital  expenditures,
including  carpet and appliances, approximately $5,896,000  was  for
revenue   enhancing  projects,  approximately  $4,774,000  was   for
acquisition   capital   with  the  remaining   balance   for   other
miscellaneous   spend,  including  corporate.  For  the   stabilized
apartment  units, recurring capital expenditures averaged  $413  per
apartment  unit.  Construction in progress for new  apartment  units
decreased from approximately $5,692,000 for the year ended  December
31,  1995  to approximately $2,837,000 for the comparable period  in
1996, due primarily to the completion of the 122-unit development in
Jackson,  Tennessee which began leasing during the third quarter  of
1995.

Net  cash  flow  provided  by  financing activities  increased  from
approximately $2,944,000 during the year ended December 31, 1995  to
approximately  $33,425,000 for the year  ended  December  31,  1996.
During  1996,  approximately $29,407,000 was provided by  borrowings
under   the   Credit  Line  and  notes  payable  and   approximately
$47,768,000 was provided from the issuance of preferred shares.  The
principal  uses  of the cash included approximately $14,427,000  for
the  repayment  of notes payable and approximately  $28,302,000  for
dividends and distributions.



At  December  31,  1996,  the Company had approximately  $30,405,000
outstanding  on the Credit Line. At December 31, 1996,  the  Company
had  approximately  $47,243,000  (including  the  Credit  Line)   of
floating  rate debt at an average interest rate of 6.9%;  all  other
debt was fixed rate term debt at an average interest rate of 8.1%.

The weighted average interest rate and weighted average maturity  at
December  31,  1996  for  the approximately  $315,239,000  of  notes
payable were 7.9% and 9.9 years, respectively. The Company used  the
approximately  $47,768,000 of net proceeds from the Preferred  Stock
Offering,  which  closed in October, for the  acquisitions  of  Napa
Valley  Apartments and Tiffany Oaks Apartments and used the  balance
to  reduce  the amount outstanding on the Credit Line.  In  December
1996,  the Company increased its credit limit under the Credit  Line
from  $65,000,000 to $90,000,000 and expects to use the Credit  Line
for  future  acquisitions, development, and to  provide  letters  of
credit as credit enhancements for tax-exempt bonds.  In addition, in
March 1997 the Company issued 2,300,000 shares of Common Stock in an
underwritten  public offering.  The net proceeds from such  offering
were  approximately $62.4 million, all of which were contributed  to
the   Operating  Partnership  and  utilized  to  repay   outstanding
borrowings under the Credit Line.   The Credit Line is unsecured and
is  subject  to borrowing base calculations that effectively  reduce
the  maximum  amount that may be borrowed under the Credit  Line  to
approximately  $87,000,000 as of the date of this Annual  Report  on
Form 10-K.

The  Company  believes that cash provided by operations is  adequate
and  anticipates that it will continue to be adequate  in  both  the
short  and  long-term  to  meet  operating  requirements  (including
recurring  capital expenditures at the Communities) and  payment  of
distributions  by  the Company in accordance with REIT  requirements
under the Code.

Capital expenditures on property improvements and expansion projects
for 1996 totaled approximately $21,274,000 with capital expenditures
of   approximately  $27,400,000  planned  for  1997   for   property
improvement and expansion projects. The Company expects to meet  its
long  term  liquidity requirements, such as scheduled mortgage  debt
maturities,  property  acquisitions,  expansions  and  non-recurring
capital  expenditures,  through long and medium-term  collateralized
and  uncollateralized fixed rate borrowings,  issuance  of  debt  or
additional equity securities in the Company and the Credit Line.

INSURANCE

In  the opinion of management, property and casualty insurance is in
place   which  provides  adequate  coverage  to  provide   financial
protection against normal insurable risks such that it believes that
any  loss  experienced would not have a significant  impact  on  the
Company's liquidity, financial position, or results of operations.

INFLATION

Substantially  all of the resident leases at the Communities  allow,
at  the  time  of  renewal,  for adjustments  in  the  rent  payable
thereunder, and thus may enable the Company to seek rent  increases.
The  substantial majority of these leases are for one year or  less.
The short-term nature of these leases generally serves to reduce the
risk to the Company of the adverse effects of inflation.

RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

The  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results  of  Operations contains certain forward-looking  statements
within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933,  as
amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,  as
amended,  which  are  intended to be covered  by  the  safe  harbors
created  thereby. These statements include the plans and  objectives
of  management for future operations, including plans and objectives
relating  to  capital expenditures and rehabilitation costs  on  the
apartment  communities.  Although  the  Company  believes  that  the
assumptions   underlying   the   forward-looking   statements    are
reasonable,  any  of  the  assumptions  could  be  inaccurate   and,
therefore,  there  can  be  no assurance  that  the  forward-looking
statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K will prove to
be  accurate. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent  in
the  forward-looking statements included herein,  the  inclusion  of
such  information should not be regarded as a representation by  the
Company  or  any other person that the objectives and plans  of  the
Company will be achieved.

ITEM 10.  DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE REGISTRANT

The  Company's Charter divides the Board of Directors into three  classes
as  nearly equal in number as possible, with each class serving a term of
three years. One class of Directors is elected by the shareholders of the
Company  at each annual meeting. The Board of Directors has set at  seven
the  number  of directors constituting the full Board of Directors.   The
current  terms of two directors expire in this year, two expire  in  1998
and three in 1999.

The Company's directors and executive officers are as follows:

ITEM 11.  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION



Option  Grants  during the year ending December 31, 1996.  The  following
table  provides  information  on option grants  during  the  year  ending
December 31, 1996 to the executive officers listed in the table above.





Aggregated  Option  Exercises through December 31, 1996.   The  following
table  provides  information on options held by  the  executive  officers
listed  above through December 31, 1996, and the value of each  of  their
unexercised  options at December 31, 1996.  There were no  stock  options
exercised in 1996.


__________

(1)  Based  upon the closing price of the Company's Common Stock  on  the
     NYSE on December 31, 1996 of $28.875 per share.

Compensation of Directors

Directors who are employees of the Company or one of its subsidiaries  do
not  receive additional remuneration as directors. In 1994, the Company's
three  initial  independent directors were each awarded 2,500  shares  of
Common Stock for their services as director. The directors' rights in the
Common  Stock vest at the rate of 500 shares per year beginning in  1994.
Each director is entitled to receive the distributions paid on his shares
of  Common  Stock prior to vesting. Directors who cease to  be  directors
will forfeit any shares not previously vested prior to the termination of
that  person's  service on the board of directors.  Mr. Yanney  currently
receives $15,000 per year as compensation for his service on the board of
directors.  Any independent directors elected to the board in the  future
will  be  paid annual compensation of $15,000.  In 1996, each independent
director  was  awarded  options to acquire  1,000  shares  of  stock  and
committee chairmen were awarded an additional 1,000 options.

General

The  Compensation  Committee of the Board of  Directors  is  composed  of
independent  Directors.  In 1996, it was composed of John J. Byrne,  III,
Robert  F.  Fogelman,  O.  Mason Hawkins,  and  Michael  B.  Yanney.  The
Compensation  Committee is responsible for developing  and  communicating
recommendations to the Board of Directors with respect to  the  Company's
executive  compensation policies, and determines, pursuant  to  authority
delegated  by  the Board of Directors, the compensation (including  stock
options) to be paid to the Chief Executive Officer and each of the  other
executive officers of the Company.

The   Company  is  at  a  relatively  early  stage  of  its  development.
Consequently, the Compensation Committee does not believe it  appropriate
to  base  its  compensation  decisions solely  on  traditional  financial
measures  of  performance,  including  return  on  equity.  Instead,  the
Compensation  Committee  has  evaluated performance  based  primarily  on
growth  in  funds  from  operations per share,  which  industry  analysts
consider to be the primary measure of performance for an equity REIT.

The Company's executive officer compensation program is comprised of base
salary,   cash   incentive   bonus  compensation,   long-term   incentive
compensation  in  the  form  of  stock  options,  and  various  benefits,
including  medical  plans generally available to  all  employees  of  the
Company.



Base Salary

Base  salary  levels for the Company's executive officers  together  with
option  grants and benefits are intended to be competitively set relative
to  other  REITs  of  comparable size and stage  of  development  in  the
Company's  geographic area. In determining base salaries the Compensation
Committee  also takes into account individual experience and  performance
as well as specific issues relating to the Company.

Incentive Bonus Compensation

The  Compensation Committee may periodically award bonuses to  executives
in  order to provide a direct financial incentive, in the form of a  cash
bonus,  to  executives to achieve individual and Company objectives.  The
amount of the bonus is determined based upon the Compensation Committee's
evaluation  of  each  executive's  performance  and  in  accordance  with
employment agreements with certain executives.

Amended and Restated 1994 Restricted Stock and Stock Option Plan

The  1994 Restricted Stock and Stock Option Plan (the "1994 Plan") is the
Company's  long-term  incentive plan for  executive  officers  and  other
selected  employees.  The  objective of the  program  is  to  retain  and
motivate   executives  to  improve  long-term  stock   performance.   The
Compensation Committee has the authority, within limitations set forth in
the 1994 Plan, (i) to establish rules and regulations concerning the 1994
Plan,  (ii) to determine the persons to whom Options and Restricted Stock
may  be granted (iii) to fix the number of shares of Common Stock  to  be
covered  by each Option and (iv) to set the terms and provisions of  each
Option to be granted and the vesting schedule for Restricted Stock. Stock
options  are  generally granted at the prevailing market value  and  will
only have value if the Company's stock increases.

Non-Qualified Executive Deferred Compensation Plan

In  August,  1995,  the  Compensation Committee adopted  a  non-qualified
deferred  compensation plan for key employees who are not  qualified  for
participation in the Company's 401 (k) Savings Plan.  Under the terms  of
the  plan,  key  employees  may  elect to defer  a  percentage  of  their
compensation  and the Company matches a portion of their salary  deferral
with  similar provisions as apply for the Company's 401 (k) Savings Plan.
The plan is designed so that the employees' investment earnings under the
non-qualified  plan  should  be the same as the  earning  assets  in  the
Company's 401 (k) Savings Plan.

Compensation of Chief Executive Officer

Mr. Cates' base salary was $255,000 for the year ended December 31, 1996.
On  February  4,  1994  the Company entered into a  five-year  employment
agreement  with  Mr. Cates for an annual base compensation  of  $225,000,
subject   to  any  increases  in  base  compensation  approved   by   the
Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee considered the initial
annual  base salary of Mr. Cates to be competitive with comparable  REITs
in  the  Company's geographic area. The employment contract provides  for
certain  severance payments in the event of death or disability  or  upon
termination  by the Company without cause or by the employee with  cause.
The  agreement  contains a non-competition provision which prohibits  Mr.
Cates,  except  as an officer or employee of the Company,  from  engaging
directly  or  indirectly  in  the  acquisition,  development,  operation,
management,  leasing  or landscaping of any multifamily  community.  This
prohibition  extends  to  all multifamily communities  wherever  located,
during  the  term of employment and to multifamily properties  within  30
miles of any multifamily community owned by the Company after termination
of such employment.

__________

(1)  Based on 13,404,398 shares of Common Stock outstanding on March 21, 1997.

__________

(1)  Based on 13,404,398 shares of Common Stock outstanding on March  21,
     1997,  plus,  with  respect to each listed  person  (or  all  listed
     persons,  as a group), the number of shares of Common Stock issuable
     by  the Company to such person or group in exchange for Common Units
     in  the  Operating Partnership plus the number of shares  of  Common
     Stock  issuable  to such person (or group) in respect  of  currently
     exercisable options.  The total number of shares used in calculating
     this percentage assumes that none of the Common Units or exercisable
     options  held  by  other persons are redeemed for shares  of  Common
     Stock.
(2)  Includes  82,500 shares owned directly by Mr. Fogelman  and  570,500
     shares  that  Mr.  Fogelman has the current right  to  acquire  upon
     redemption of Common Units.

     that  Mr. Cates has the current right to acquire upon redemption  of
     Common Units, 49,000 shares that Mr. Cates has the current right  to
     acquire  upon the exercise of options that are currently exercisable
     and  44,400 shares owned by the Company's ESOP over which Mr.  Cates
     shares voting power. Excludes 2,123 shares owned by Mr. Cates' wife,
     over  which  Mr. Cates exercises no voting or investment  power  and
     with respect to which Mr. Cates disclaims beneficial ownership.
(4)  Includes  194,799 shares owned directly by Mr. Hawkins  and  158,618
     shares  that  Mr.  Hawkins has the current  right  to  acquire  upon
     redemption of Common Units.
(5)  Includes  21,000 shares that Mr. Wadsworth has the current right  to
     acquire upon the exercise of options that are currently exercisable.

ITEM 13.  CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS

The  Company  leases  office  space from a  partnership  which  owns  the
building where the Company's principal office is located. Mr. Cates has a
6.9%  and Mr. Wadsworth a 4.2% interest in such partnership. The  Company
paid  approximately $107,400 in rent, or $14.20 per average  square  foot
(including concessions), for such office space during 1996, and has lease
obligations  of  $616,800  for  the remaining  lease  term.  The  Company
believes the rental rate is a competitive rate for buildings in the  area
of Memphis in which the Company's headquarters are located.

All transactions involving related parties must be approved by a majority
of  the  disinterested members of the Company's Board of  Directors.  The
Company has, and expects to have, transactions in the ordinary course  of
its  business  with  directors and officers  of  the  Company  and  their
affiliates,   including  members  of  their  families  or   corporations,
partnerships  or other organizations in which such officers or  directors
have  a  controlling interest, on substantially the same terms (including
price, or interest rates and collateral) as those prevailing at the  time
for comparable transactions with unrelated parties.

                      Independent Auditors' Report


The Board of Directors and Shareholders
Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.


     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Mid-
America Apartment Communities, Inc. (the "Company") as of December 31,
1996 and 1995 and the related consolidated statements of operations,
shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the years in the three-
year period ended December 31, 1996.   These financial statements are the
responsibility of the management of the Company.  Our responsibility is
to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
     We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made
by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion.
     In our opinion, the financials statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects the financial position of the Company at
December 31, 1996 and 1995, and the results of the Company's operations
and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
December 31, 1996, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

As discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the
Company changed its  accounting method to capitalize replacement
purchases for major appliances and carpet in 1996.

Mid-America  Apartment  Communities, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Years ended December 31, 1996, 1995 and 1994

1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Organization and Formation of the Company

Mid-America  Apartment Communities, Inc. (the "Company")  is  a  Memphis,
Tennessee    based   self-administered  and  self-managed   real   estate
investment  trust  which  at  December 31,  1996  owns  and  operates  73
apartments  with  19,280 units in 12 states.  The  Company  completed  an
initial  public offering (the "IPO") and private placement of  shares  on
February  4,  1994.   Net  proceeds  were  used  to  acquire  a   general
partnership  interest in Mid-America Apartments, L.P.  (  the  "Operating
Partnership")  which  was  formed to succeed  substantially  all  of  the
interests  in  MAC   Properties  Group,  (predecessor  to  the   Company,
"Predecessor").  The Company's business is conducted principally  through
the Operating Partnership. The Company completed a second public offering
on  August 26, 1994 and completed a merger with America First REIT,  Inc.
and America First REIT Advisory Company on June 30, 1995.

Basis of Presentation

The accompanying 1996 and 1995 financial statements include  the accounts
of   the   Company,  the Operating  Partnership, and other  subsidiaries.
The  1994  financial statements include the accounts of the  Company  and
Operating  Partnership  from February 4, 1994 (the  "IPO  date")  through
December  31,  1994 and the accounts of the Predecessor  for  the  period
January  1,  1994  through  the  IPO date. All  significant  intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

As  part of the formation transaction, purchase accounting was applied to
the  acquisition of all non-controlled interests and interests  in  which
cash consideration was paid.  This resulted in an increase of $41,147,000
in  the  historical  cost basis of the related real estate  assets.   The
acquisition  of all other interests was accounted for as a reorganization
of  entities  under  common control and, accordingly,  was  reflected  at
historical cost in a manner similar to that used in pooling of  interests
accounting.

Minority Interest

Minority  interest in the accompanying consolidated financial  statements
relates   to  the  unitholders'  ownership  interest  in  the   Operating
Partnership.   The Company is the sole general partner of  the  Operating
Partnership. The consolidated financial statements of the Company for the
periods ending after the IPO have been adjusted for the minority interest
in  the Operating Partnership based on the weighted average shares of the
Company plus partnership units outstanding during the period.

At  the  IPO  date,  the Company's Board established economic  rights  in
respect  of  each unit of limited partnership interest in  the  Operating
Partnership  that were equivalent to the economic rights  in  respect  of
each share of common stock.  Each unit is redeemable at the option of the
holder  thereof in exchange for one share of common stock.  The Operating
Partnership  has  followed  the  policy  of  paying  the  same  per  unit
distribution  in  respect of the units as the per share  distribution  in
respect  of  the common stock.  The Operating Partnership  agreement  has
been  amended to allocate additional net income to the holders  of  units
that  would otherwise be the net income of the Company or another entity.
Net income before minority interest of the Company for 1996 was allocated
approximately 18% to holders of units and 82% to the Company.

Use of Estimates

Management  of the Company has made a number of estimates and assumptions
relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of
contingent  assets and liabilities to prepare these financial  statements
in  conformity  with  generally accepted accounting  principles.   Actual
results could differ from those estimates.
Revenue Recognition

                                  F - 6


The  Company  leases residential apartments under operating  leases  with
terms  of one year or less.  Rental and other revenues are recorded  when
earned.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The  Company  considers cash, investments in money  market  accounts  and
certificates of deposit  with original maturities of three months or less
to be cash equivalents.

Restricted Cash

Restricted cash consists of escrow deposits held by lenders for  property
taxes, insurance, debt service and replacement reserves.

Real Estate Assets and Depreciation

Real  estate assets are carried at the lower of depreciated cost  or  net
realizable  value. Interest, property taxes, and other development  costs
incurred during construction is capitalized until completion. Repairs and
maintenance   costs   are   expensed  as   incurred   while   significant
improvements, renovations, and replacements are capitalized.  The cost of
interior painting, vinyl flooring, and blinds are expensed as incurred.

In  conjunction with acquisitions of properties, the Company's policy  is
to  provide  in  its acquisition budgets adequate funds to  complete  any
deferred  maintenance  items  to bring the  properties  to  the  required
standard, including the cost of replacement appliances, carpet,  interior
painting, vinyl flooring, and blinds.  These costs are capitalized.

Following  a  review of its capital expenditure and depreciation  policy,
effective January 1, 1996, the Company implemented a new policy of  which
the primary changes are as follows:

(a)  Increase minimum dollar amounts to capitalize from $500 to $1,000;
(b)  For stabilized properties (generally, properties owned and operated
by the Company for at least one year), capitalize replacement purchases
for major appliances and carpeting of an entire apartment unit which was
previously expensed; and
(c)  Reduce depreciation life for certain assets from 20 years to 10 to
15 years.

The  Company  believes  that  the  newly  adopted  accounting  policy  is
preferable because it is consistent with policies currently being used by
the  majority  of  the  largest apartment REITs  and  provides  a  better
matching  of  expenses with the estimated benefit period. The   Company's
1995  and  1994 financial statements were not restated for the effect  of
the  change  in  accounting  policy.  The  policy  has  been  implemented
prospectively effective January 1, 1996.

Depreciation  is  computed on a straight line basis  over  the  estimated
useful  lives  of the related assets which range from 8 to 40  years  for
land  improvements and buildings and 5 years for furniture, fixtures  and
equipment.

The  Company periodically evaluates its real estate assets for impairment
based upon undiscounted cash flows and measures impairment based on  fair
value.  This  determination  is  dependent  primarily  on  the  Company's
estimates  on  occupancy,  rent  and expense  increases,  which  involves
numerous  assumptions and judgments as to future events over a period  of
many  years.  At December 31, 1996 the Company does not hold  any  assets
which meet the impairment criteria.

                               F - 7


Deferred Costs and Intangibles

Organization costs are amortized using the straight line method  over  60
months.   Deferred financing costs are amortized over the  terms  of  the
related  debt  using  a  method which approximates the  interest  method.
Unamortized  cost  in  excess of fair value of  net  assets  acquired  is
amortized using the straight line method over 30 years.

Partners'  capital contributions, distributions and profit and loss  with
respect to entities included in the Predecessor

Prior  to  the  IPO,  partners' capital contributions, distributions  and
profit and loss were allocated in accordance with the terms of individual
partnership   agreements,  which  generally  prescribed   allocation   in
proportion  to  respective ownership interests.  Certain agreements  also
provided for a preference return to limited partners.

Per Share Data

Primary  earnings  per  share  is  computed  based  upon  10,986,316  and
9,818,804  weighted  average  shares outstanding  for  the  years  ending
December  31,  1996 and 1995, respectively.  For the period  February  4,
1994   through December 31, 1994, primary earnings per share is  computed
based  upon  net  income for that period and 6,534,327  weighted  average
shares outstanding.

At  December 31, 1996 10,949,216 common shares and 2,444,352  units  were
outstanding,  a  total  of 13,393,568.   Additionally,  the  Company  has
outstanding  options for 338,650 shares of common stock  which  increased
weighted  average shares outstanding during the years ended December  31,
1996   and 1995 by 43,792 and 40,987 shares, respectively and the  period
February 4, 1994 through December 31, 1994 by 42,956 shares.

Reclassification

Certain  prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform  with  1996
presentation. The reclasses had no effect on shareholders' equity or  net
income.

2.   Business Combination

On  June 29, 1995, the Company completed the acquisition of America First
REIT, Inc. and America First REIT Advisory Company ("AFR") accounted  for
using the purchase method of accounting.  The Company exchanged 2,331,000
shares   of  its  common stock, valued at $57,749,000,  for  all  of  the
capital stock of AFR.  The operating results of AFR are included  in  the
accompanying statement of operations commencing July 1, 1995.

The  fair  value  of  assets  acquired and liabilities  assumed  were  as
follows:


                                         
3. Notes Payable and Credit Line

The  Company  has  an unsecured bank line of credit (the  "Credit  Line")
which may be drawn to $90 million depending upon the borrowing base  made
available  by   the  Company.  As of December 31, 1996,  $30,405,000  was
outstanding  under  this line.  This two year line of credit  expires  in
October  1998.  Including the Credit Line, the Company has  approximately
$315.2  million and $307.9 million outstanding at December 31,  1996  and
1995  under notes payable.  These notes (excluding the Credit  Line)  are
secured  by real estate assets and certain restricted cash accounts.   As
of  December  31,  1996, the Company estimated that the weighted  average
interest  rate  on balances then outstanding was 7.9%,  with  an  average
maturity of 10 years.  At December 31, 1996, 85% of outstanding debt  was
at a fixed interest rate, and 15% was at variable rates.

                              F - 8 


A  portion  of  the  proceeds of the IPO was used to repay  certain  debt
attributable  to the Predecessor, resulting in an extraordinary  gain  of
$485,000, net of minority interest.

The  notes  payable  and Credit Line at December 31, 1996  and  1995  are
summarized as follows (dollars in millions):



Scheduled  principal repayments on the notes payable and Credit  Line  at
December 31, 1996 are as follows (dollars in thousands):


 
The   Company's  notes  payable  include  various  restrictive  financial
covenants.   The  Company was in compliance with these  covenants  as  of
December 31, 1996.

                                 F - 9

4.  Preferred Stock Offering

In  October  1996,  the Company offered and sold to the public  2,000,000
shares  of  Series A Preferred Stock at a price of $25.00 per share  (the
"Preferred  Stock  Offering").  The net proceeds of the  Preferred  Stock
Offering totaled approximately $47.9 million.  Preferential dividends are
payable  on  the Series A Preferred Stock in the fixed annual  amount  of
$2.375 per share, payable monthly.

5.  Fair Value Disclosure of Financial Instruments

Cash  and  cash  equivalents,  rental receivable,  accounts  payable  and
accrued  expenses and other liabilities and security deposits are carried
at amounts which reasonably approximate their fair value.

Fixed  rate   notes  payable at December 31, 1996 and 1995  total  $268.0
million  and  $272.8 million, respectively, and have  an  estimated  fair
value   of  $273.6  million  and  $281.6  million  (excluding  prepayment
penalties) based upon interest rates available for the issuance  of  debt
with  similar terms and remaining maturities as of December 31, 1996  and
1995.   These notes were subject to prepayment penalties which  would  be
required to retire these notes prior to maturity.  The carrying value  of
variable  rate  notes payable at December 31, 1996 and 1995  total  $47.2
million  and $35.1, respectively, and reasonably approximates their  fair
value.   Included  in  these variable rate notes are certain  Multifamily
Housing  Renewal bonds with rates which are less than the  prime  lending
rates at December 31, 1996 and 1995.  Approximately $16.8 million in 1996
and $17.1 in 1995 of these mortgages are non-taxable and have lower rates
than would be expected for taxable notes with similar terms.



The  fair  value  estimates  presented herein are  based  on  information
available  to  management  as of December 31, 1996  and  1995.   Although
management  is  not aware of any factors that would significantly  affect
the   estimated   fair  value  amounts,  such  amounts  have   not   been
comprehensively revalued for purposes of these financial statements since
that  date,  and current estimates of fair value may differ significantly
from the amounts presented herein.

6.  Commitments and Contingencies

Neither  the  Company  nor the Predecessor is presently  subject  to  any
material  litigation  nor, to the Company's knowledge,  is  any  material
litigation threatened against the Company or the Predecessor, other  than
routine  litigation arising in the ordinary course of business,  some  of
which  is expected to be covered by liability insurance and none of which
is  expected  to  have  a  material adverse effect  on  the  consolidated
financial statements of the Company.

The Company incurred lease expense relating to a five year aircraft lease
agreement  for  the  years ended December 31, 1996,  1995,  and  1994  of
$185,400, $185,400, and $61,800, respectively.  During the first  quarter
of  1997,  the  Company  began  a new five  year  lease  agreement  whose
scheduled annual lease payments are $194,400.

7.   Income Taxes

No  provision  for federal income taxes has been made in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements.  The Company has made an  election  to
be  taxed  as a Real Estate Investment Trust ("REIT") under Sections  856
through 860 of the Code.  As a REIT, the Company generally is not subject
to  Federal  income  tax to the extent it distributes  95%  of  its  REIT
taxable income to its shareholders and meets certain other tests relating
to  the number of shareholders, types of assets and allocable income.  If
the  Company fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, the  Company
will  be  subject  to  the Federal income tax (including  any  applicable
alternative  minimum  tax)  on its taxable income  at  regular  corporate
rates.   Even though  the Company qualifies for taxation as a  REIT,  the
Company may be subject to certain Federal, state and local taxes  on  its
income  and  property  and  to  Federal income  and  excise  tax  on  its
undistributed income.

                               F - 10  

8.  Employee Benefit Plans

401 (k) Savings Plan

The  Company has adopted the Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.  401
(k)  Savings  Plan,  a  defined  contribution  plan  that  satisfies  the
requirements  of  Section 401 (a) and 401 (k) of the Code.   The  Company
may,  but  is not obligated to, make a matching contribution of $.50  for
each  $1.00 contributed, up to 6% of the participant's compensation.  The
Company's contribution to this plan was $118,700 and $81,600 in 1996  and
1995, respectively, with no contribution in 1994.

Non-qualified Deferred Compensation Plan

The  Company has adopted a non-qualified deferred compensation  plan  for
key  employees  who are not qualified for participation in the  Company's
401  (k) Savings Plan.  Under the terms of the plan, employees may  elect
to  defer  a percentage of their compensation and the Company  matches  a
portion  of  their  salary deferral.  The plan is designed  so  that  the
employees' investment earnings under the non-qualified plan should be the
same  as  the earning assets in the Company's 401 (k) Savings Plan.   The
Company's  match  to this plan in 1996 and 1995 was $23,600  and  $8,600,
respectively, with no employer match in 1994.



Employee Stock Purchase Plan

The  Company  has  adopted  the Mid-America Apartment  Communities,  Inc.
Employee  Stock  Purchase Plan (the "ESPP") which provides  a  means  for
employees  to  purchase  common stock of  the  Company.   The  board  has
authorized  the  issuance of 150,000 shares for the plan.   The  ESPP  is
administered by the Compensation Committee who may annually grant options
to  employees to purchase annually up to an aggregate of 15,000 shares of
common  stock at a price equal to 85% of the market price of  the  common
stock.   During 1996 and 1995, the ESPP purchased 3,176 and 2,710 shares,
respectively, with no purchases made in 1994.

Employee Stock Ownership Plan

The  Company  has  adopted  the Mid-America Apartment  Communities,  Inc.
Employee  Stock  Ownership Plan (the "ESOP") which is a  non-contributory
stock  bonus plan that satisfies the requirements of Section 401  (a)  of
the  Internal Revenue Code.  Each employee of the Company is eligible  to
participate  in  the  ESOP  after attaining  the  age  of  21  years  and
completing  one  year  of service with the Company.   Participants'  ESOP
accounts will be 100% vested after five years of continuous service, with
no  vesting prior to that time.  The Company contributed 22,500 shares of
Common  Stock  to the ESOP upon conclusion of the IPO.  During  1996  and
1995, the Company contributed $276,000 and $186,000, respectively, to the
ESOP  which purchased an additional 8,208 and 5,148 shares, respectively,
with no contributions made in 1994.

Stock Option Plan

The  Company has adopted the 1994 Restricted Stock and Stock Option  Plan
(the  "Plan")  to  provide incentives to attract and  retain  independent
directors,  executive officers and key employees.  The Plan provides  for
the  grant of options to purchase a specified number of shares of  common
stock  ("Options")  or  grants  of  restricted  shares  of  common  stock
("Restricted  Stock").  The Plan authorizes Options to  buy  a  total  of
500,000  shares of common stock. The Compensation Committee of the  Board
of Directors is responsible for granting Options and shares of Restricted
Stock  and  for establishing the exercise price of Options and terms  and
conditions  of Restricted Stock.  During the first quarter of  1997,  the
Company  amended the Plan to increase the shares authorized  an  increase
from 500,000 to 1,000,000.

                             F - 11

A  summary  of changes in Options for the three years ended December  31,
1996 follows:





Exercise  prices for options outstanding as of December 31,  1996  ranged
from  $19.75 to $26.50.  The weighted average remaining contractual  life
of those options is 7.8 years.

On  January  1,  1996, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123, "Accounting  for
Stock-Based Compensation",  which requires either the (i) fair  value  of
employee  stock-based compensation plans be recorded as  a  component  of
compensation  expense in the statement of operations as of  the  date  of
grant  of awards related to such plans, or (ii) impact of such fair value
on net income and earnings per share be disclosed on a pro forma basis in
a  footnote to financial statements for awards granted after December 15,
1994,  if  the  accounting for such awards continues to be in  accordance
with  Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting  for  Stock
Issued  to  Employees,"  ("APB  25").  The  Company  will  continue  such
accounting under the provisions of APB 25.  The pro forma effect in  1996
to net income per common share was not considered material.

                              F - 12

9.  Subsequent Events  (Unaudited)

Declaration of Dividend

The  Company declared a fourth quarter common stock dividend of $.535 per
share  to  be  paid January 31, 1997 to holders of record on January  24,
1997.

Completed Acquisitions

Since December 31, 1996, the Company has acquired the following apartment
communities (the "Completed Acquisitions") containing an aggregate of 874
apartment units (dollars in millions):



The  financial statements of the completed acquisitions are not  included
in the audited consolidated financial statements included herein.

Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan

In  January 1997, the Company adopted a Dividend Reinvestment  and  Stock
Purchase  Plan (the "DRSPP") pursuant to which the Company's shareholders
will  be  permitted  to  acquire  shares  of  Common  Stock  through  the
reinvestment  of  distributions on Common Stock and  Series  A  Preferred
Stock  and through optional cash payments. The Company has 750,000 shares
of  Common Stock available to the DRSPP. It is expected that shareholders
of  the Company may begin participating in the DRSPP commencing with  the
Company's July 1997 dividends.

Common Stock Offering (the "Offering")

In  March  1997, the Company issued 2,300,000 of common stock.   The  net
cash  proceeds  to  the Company were approximately  $62.4  million  after
payment of all underwriting discounts and expenses of the offering.   The
Company  contributed the net proceeds of the offering  to  the  Operating
Partnership  in  exchange  for  additional  interests  in  the  Operating
Partnership. The Operating Partnership will use substantially all of  the
net  proceeds to repay outstanding borrowings under the Credit  Line  and
any  excess  will  be  used  for  general corporate  purposes,  including
acquisitions.  Amounts repaid under the Credit Line  may  be  re-borrowed
(subject  to  the  terms  and  limits of  the  Credit  Line)  to  finance
acquisitions of additional apartment communities and for  other corporate
purposes.
