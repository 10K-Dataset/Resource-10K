OVERVIEW OF THE COMPANY

Founded in 1994, Mid-America Apartment Communities,
Inc. (the “Company”) is a Memphis, Tennessee-based self-administered and self-managed umbrella partnership real estate investment trust
(“REIT”) that focuses on acquiring, owning and operating apartment communities. Between 1994 and December 31, 2004, the Company increased the
number of properties of which it is the sole owner from 22 to 129 properties with 36,618 apartment units, representing an increase of 31,038 apartment
units. The Company is also participating in two joint ventures with Crow Holdings, Mid-America CH/Realty LP and Mid-America CH/Realty II LP
(collectively the “Joint Ventures”). The Joint Ventures owned three properties with 1,286 apartment units at December 31, 2004. The Company
retains a 33.33% ownership interest in each of the Joint Ventures and is paid a management fee of 4% of revenues from the apartment communities owned
by the Joint Ventures.

The Company’s business is conducted principally
through Mid-America Apartments, L.P. (the “Operating Partnership”). The Company is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership,
holding 225,820 common units of partnership interest (“Common Units”) comprising a 1% general partnership interest in the Operating
Partnership as of December 31, 2004. The Company’s wholly-owned qualified REIT subsidiary, MAC II of Delaware, Inc., a Delaware corporation, is a
limited partner in the Operating Partnership and, as of December 31, 2004, held 19,622,605 Common Units, or 86.89% of all outstanding Common
Units.

The Company operated apartment communities in 12
states in 2004, employing 1,121 full time and 84 part time employees at December 31, 2004.

OPERATING PHILOSOPHY

The Company’s primary objective is to maintain
a stable cash flow that will fund its dividend through all parts of the real estate investment cycle. The Company focuses on growing through its
existing investments and, when accretive to cash flow and shareholder value, through external investments.

INVESTMENT FOCUS.

The
Company’s primary investment focus is on apartment communities in the Southeastern United States and Texas. Between 1994 and 1997, the Company
grew largely through the acquisition and redevelopment of existing communities. Between 1998 and 2000, its concentration was on development of new
communities. The Company’s present focus is on the acquisition of properties that it believes can be repositioned with appropriate use of capital
and its operating management skills. The Company is also interested in increasing its investment in properties in larger and faster growing markets
within its current market area to balance its portfolio between small, middle and large-tier markets, and intends to do this through acquiring
apartment communities with the potential for above average growth. The Company will continue its established process of selling mature assets, and will
adapt its investment focus to opportunities and markets.

HIGH QUALITY
ASSETS.

The Company maintains its assets in excellent condition, believing that continuous maintenance will lead to higher
long-run returns on investment. It believes that being recognized


by civic and industry trade organizations for
the high quality of its properties, landscaping, and property management will lead to higher rents and profitability and further supports the high
quality of its properties and operations. The Company periodically sells assets selectively in order to ensure that its portfolio consists primarily of
high quality, well-located assets within its market area.

DIVERSIFIED MARKET
FOCUS.

The Company believes the stability of its cash flow is enhanced and it will generate higher risk adjusted cash flow
returns, with lower volatility, through its diversified strategy of investments over large, middle and small-tier markets throughout the southeastern
United States and Texas.

INTENSIVE MANAGEMENT
FOCUS.

The Company strongly emphasizes on-site property management. Particular attention is paid to opportunities to
increase rents, raise average occupancy rates, and control costs. Property managers and regional managers are given the responsibility for monitoring
market trends and the discretion to react to such trends. The Company, as part of its intense management focus, has established a number of training
programs to produce highly competent property managers, leasing consultants and service technicians who work on-site at the Company’s apartment
communities (the “Communities”) to generate the highest possible income from the Company’s assets. At December 31, 2004, the Company
employed approximately 106 Certified Apartment Managers (“CAM”). The CAM designation is sponsored through the National Apartment Association
and provides training for on-site manager professionals.

DECENTRALIZED OPERATIONAL
STRUCTURE.

The Company operates in a decentralized manner. Management believes that its decentralized operating structure
capitalizes on specific market knowledge, provides greater personal accountability than a centralized structure and is beneficial in the acquisition
and redevelopment processes. To support this decentralized operational structure, senior and executive management, along with various asset management
functions, are proactively involved in supporting and reviewing property management through extensive reporting processes and frequent on-site
visitations. In 2004 the Company completed the installation of the property and general ledger modules of a new web-based property management system
that increases the amount of information shared between senior and executive management and the properties, and does so on a real time basis, improving
the support provided to the operating environment. The Company plans to install the purchase order module in 2005.

PROACTIVE BALANCE SHEET AND PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT

The Company focuses on maximizing the return on
assets and adding to the intrinsic underlying value of each share of the Company’s common stock, routinely reviewing each asset based on its
determined value and selling those which no longer fit its investment criteria. The Company constantly evaluates the effectiveness of its capital
allocations and makes adjustments to its strategy, including investing in existing and new apartment communities, debt retirement, and repurchases or
issuances of shares of the Company’s preferred and common stock.

STRATEGIES

The Company seeks to increase operating cash flow
and earnings per share to maximize shareholder value through a balanced strategy of internal and external growth.

OPERATING GROWTH
STRATEGY.

Management’s goal is to maximize the Company’s return on investment in each Community by increasing
rental rates and reducing operating expenses while maintaining high occupancy levels. The Company seeks higher net rental revenues by enhancing and
maintaining the competitiveness of the Communities and managing expenses through its system of detailed management reporting and accountability in
order to achieve increases in operating cash flow. The steps taken to meet these objectives include:

•

empowering the Company’s property managers to adjust rents
in response to local market conditions and to concentrate resident turnover during peak rental demand months;

•

offering new services to residents, including telephone, cable,
and internet access, on which the Company generates fee and commission income;

•

implementing programs to control expenses through investment in
cost-saving initiatives, such as the installation of individual apartment unit water and utility meters in certain Communities;


•

analyzing individual asset productivity performances to identify
best practices and improvement areas;

•

improving the “curb appeal” of the Communities through
extensive landscaping and exterior improvements and repositioning Communities from time to time to maintain market leadership positions;

•

compensating employees through performance-based compensation
and stock ownership programs;

•

maintaining a hands-on management style and “flat”
organizational structure that emphasizes senior management’s continued close contact with the market and employees;

•

selling or exchanging underperforming assets and repurchasing or
issuing shares of common and preferred stock when cost of capital and asset values permit;

•

allocating additional capital where the investment will generate
the highest returns for the Company; and

•

developing new ancillary income programs aimed at delivering new
consumer services and products to its residents while generating fee income for the Company.

JOINT VENTURE
STRATEGY.

One of the Company’s strategies is to co-invest with private capital partners in joint venture opportunities
from time to time which enable it to obtain a higher return on its investment through management fees, which leverages the Company’s recognized
skills in acquiring, repositioning, redeveloping and managing multifamily investments. In addition, the joint venture investment strategy can provide a
platform for creating more capital diversification and lower investment risk for the Company. The Company is currently involved in two joint ventures
with Crow Holdings, one established in 2002 and the second in early 2004.

DISPOSITION
STRATEGY.

The Company is committed to the selective disposition of mature assets, defined as those apartment communities
that no longer meet the Company’s investment criteria and long-term strategic objectives. Typically, the Company selects assets for disposition
that do not meet its present investment criteria including future return on investment, location, market, potential for growth, and capital needs. The
Company may from time to time also dispose of assets for which the Company receives an offer meeting or exceeding its return on investment criteria
even though those assets may not meet the disposition criteria disclosed above.

ACQUISITION
STRATEGY.

One of the Company’s growth strategies is to acquire and redevelop apartment communities that meet its
investment criteria and focus as discussed above. The Company has extensive experience and research-based skills in the acquisition and repositioning
of multifamily properties. In addition, the Company will acquire newly built and developed properties that can be purchased on a favorable pricing
basis. The Company will continue to evaluate opportunities that arise, and will utilize this strategy to increase the number of properties in strong
and growing markets in the Southeast and Texas.

DEVELOPMENT
STRATEGY.

In late 1997, the Company’s emphasis shifted from acquisitions to development because of its belief that
under then-current market conditions, such development would generate higher quality assets and higher long-term investment returns. In 2002, the
Company completed a $300 million construction program of high quality apartments in several markets. In 1999, management decided to exit the
construction and development business upon completion of the Company’s existing development pipeline after determining that market conditions were
changing, making it unlikely that future proposed projects would meet the Company’s profitability targets over the next few
years.

At December 31, 2004, the Company had no properties
in development. The Company periodically evaluates opportunities for profitable future development investments.

COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCK

The Company continuously reviews opportunities for
lowering its cost of capital, and increasing value per share. The Company evaluates opportunities to repurchase stock when it believes that its stock
price is below the value of its assets and accordingly repurchased common stock, funded by asset sales, between 1999 and 2001. The Company also looks
for opportunities where it can acquire or develop communities, selectively funded or partially funded by stock sales, when it will add to shareholder
value and the investment return is projected to substantially exceed its cost of capital. The Company will also opportunistically seek to lower its
cost of capital through refinancing preferred stock as it did in 2003.

SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM

In 1999, the Company’s Board of Directors
approved an increase in the number of shares of the Company’s common stock authorized to be repurchased to 4 million shares. As of December 31,
2004 the Company had repurchased a total of approximately 1.86 million shares (8% of the shares of common stock and Common Units outstanding as of the
beginning of the repurchase program). From time to time the Company intends to sell assets based on its disposition strategy outlined in this Annual
Report and use the proceeds to repurchase shares when it believes that shareholder value is enhanced. Factors affecting this determination include the
share price, asset dispositions and pricing, financing agreements and rates of return of alternative investments. No shares were repurchased from 2002
through 2004 under this plan.

COMPETITION

All of the Company’s Communities are located in
areas that include other apartment communities. Occupancy and rental rates are affected by the number of competitive apartment communities in a
particular area. The owners of competing apartment communities may have greater resources than the Company, and the managers of these communities may
have more experience than the Company’s management. Moreover, single-family rental housing, manufactured housing, condominiums and the new and
existing home markets provide housing alternatives to potential residents of apartment communities.


Apartment communities compete on the basis of
monthly rent, discounts, and facilities offered such as apartment size and amenities, and apartment community amenities, including recreational
facilities, resident services, and physical property condition. The Company makes capital improvements to both the Communities and individual
apartments on a regular basis in order to maintain a competitive position in each individual market.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

As part of the acquisition process, the Company
generally obtains environmental studies on all of its Communities from various outside environmental engineering firms. The purpose of these studies is
to identify potential sources of contamination at the Communities and to assess the status of environmental regulatory compliance. These studies
generally include historical reviews of the Communities, reviews of certain public records, preliminary investigations of the sites and surrounding
properties, visual inspection for the presence of asbestos, PCBs and underground storage tanks and the preparation and issuance of written reports.
Depending on the results of these studies, more invasive procedures, such as soil sampling or ground water analysis, will be performed to investigate
potential sources of contamination. These studies must be satisfactorily completed before the Company takes ownership of an acquisition property,
however, no assurance can be given that the studies identify all significant environmental problems.

Under various Federal, state and local laws and
regulations, an owner or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances on
properties. Such laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner caused or knew of the presence of hazardous or toxic substances
and whether or not the storage of such substances was in violation of a resident’s lease. Furthermore, the cost of remediation and removal of such
substances may be substantial, and the presence of such substances, or the failure to promptly remediate such substances, may adversely affect the
owner’s ability to sell such real estate or to borrow using such real estate as collateral.

The Company is aware of environmental concerns
specifically relating to potential issues resulting from mold in residential properties and has in place an active management and preventive
maintenance program that includes procedures specifically related to mold. The Company has established a policy requiring residents to sign a mold
addendum to lease. The Company has also purchased a $2 million insurance policy that covers remediation and exposure to mold. The current policy
expires in 2007, but is renewable at that time. The Company, therefore, believes that its exposure to this issue is limited and
controlled.

The environmental studies received by the Company
have not revealed any material environmental liabilities. The Company is not aware of any existing conditions that would currently be considered an
environmental liability. Nevertheless, it is possible that the studies do not reveal all environmental liabilities or that there are material
environmental liabilities of which the Company is unaware. Moreover, no assurance can be given concerning future laws, ordinances or regulations, or
the potential introduction of hazardous or toxic substances by neighboring properties or residents.

The Company believes that its Communities are in
compliance in all material respects with all applicable Federal, state and local ordinances and regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances and
other environmental matters.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

DISTRIBUTION.

In
January 2005, the Company announced a quarterly distribution to common shareholders of $0.585 per share, which was paid on January 31,
2005.

ACQUISITIONS.

On
February 18, 2005, the Company acquired two communities in the Atlanta-metro area situated on Lake Lanier with a total of 657 units. The Company plans
to operate the communities as one property.

ITEM 2.

PROPERTIES

The Company seeks to acquire apartment communities
located in the southeastern United States and Texas that are primarily appealing to middle income residents with the potential for above average growth
and return on investment. Approximately 75% of the Company’s apartment units are located in Georgia, Florida,


Tennessee and Texas markets. The Company’s strategic focus
is to provide its residents high quality apartment units in attractive community settings, characterized by extensive landscaping and attention to
aesthetic detail. The Company utilizes its experience and expertise in maintenance, landscaping, marketing and management to effectively
“reposition” many of the apartment communities it acquires to raise occupancy levels and per unit average rents.

The following table sets forth certain historical
information for the Communities the Company owned or maintained an ownership interest in, including the 3 properties containing 1,286 apartment units
owned by the Company’s Joint Ventures, at December 31, 2004:

The Company’s quarterly dividend rate is
currently $0.585 per common share. The Board of Directors reviews and declares the dividend rate quarterly. Actual dividends made by the Company will
be affected by a number of factors, including the gross revenues received from the Communities, the operating expenses of the Company, the interest
expense incurred on borrowings and unanticipated capital expenditures.

The Company currently pays a preferential regular
distribution on the Series F stock, Series G stock and Series H stock at annual rates of $2.3125, $2.15625 and $2.075 per share, respectively. No
distribution may be made on the Company’s common stock unless all accrued distributions have been made with respect to each series of the
Company’s preferred stock. No assurance can be given that the Company will be able to maintain its distribution rate on its common stock or make
required distributions with respect to the Series F, Series G and Series H preferred stock.

The Company expects to make future quarterly
distributions to shareholders; however, future distributions by the Company will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on the
actual funds from operations of the Company, its financial condition, capital requirements, the annual distribution requirements under the REIT
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and such other factors as the Board of Directors deems relevant.


The Company has established the Direct Stock
Purchase and Distribution Reinvestment Plan (the “DRSPP”) under which holders of common stock, preferred stock and limited partnership
interests in Mid-America Apartments, L.P. can elect automatically to reinvest their distributions in additional shares of common stock. The plan also
allows for the optional purchase of common stock of at least $250, but not more than $5,000 in any given month, free of brokerage commissions and
charges. The Company, in its absolute discretion, may grant waivers to allow for optional cash payments in excess of $5,000. To fulfill its obligations
under the DRSPP, the Company may either issue additional shares of common stock or repurchase common stock in the open market. The Company may elect to
sell shares under the DRSPP at up to a 5% discount.

In 2004, the Company issued a total of 413,598
shares through its DRSPP and offered a 2% discount for optional cash purchases in the months of August through December.

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This and other sections of this Annual Report
contain certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which are intended to be covered by the safe harbors created thereby. These statements include, but are
not limited to, statements about anticipated growth rate of revenues and expenses, planned asset dispositions, disposition pricing, planned acquisition
and developments, property financings, and expected interest rates. Although the Company believes that the assumptions underlying the forward-looking
statements are reasonable, any of the assumptions could be inaccurate and, therefore, there can be no assurance that the forward-looking statements
included in this report on Form 10-K will prove to be accurate. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements
included herein, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by the Company or any other person that the objectives
and plans of the Company will be achieved.

The following are risks that the Company believes
could cause results to differ from projected or forecasted results or could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
business.

The Company’s ability to make distributions may be adversely affected by
factors beyond its control

The Company’s ability to generate sufficient
cash flow in order to pay common dividends to its shareholders depends on its ability to generate funds from operations in excess of capital
expenditure requirements and common dividends, and/or to have access to the markets for debt and equity financing. Funds from operations and the value
of the Company’s properties may be less because of factors which are beyond the Company’s control. Such events or conditions could
include:

•

competition from other apartment communities;

•

overbuilding of new apartment units or oversupply of available
apartment units in the Company’s markets, which might adversely affect apartment occupancy or rental rates and/or require rent concessions in
order to lease apartment units;

•

increases in operating costs (including real estate taxes and
insurance premiums) due to inflation and other factors, which may not be offset by increased rents;

•

the Company’s inability to rent apartments on favorable
economic terms;

•

changes in governmental regulations and the related costs of
compliance;

•

changes in tax laws and housing laws including the enactment of
rent control laws or other laws regulating multifamily housing;

•

changes in interest rate levels and the availability of
financing, which could lead renters to purchase homes (if interest rates decrease and home loans are more readily available) or increase the
Company’s acquisition and operating costs (if interest rates increase and financing is less readily available);

•

weakness in the overall economy which lowers job growth and the
associated demand for apartment housing;

•

decisions relating to the dispositions of assets by the
Company’s Joint Ventures; and

•

the relative illiquidity of real estate investments.

Currently, the Company relies on external funding
sources to fully fund the payment of distributions to shareholders at the current rate. While the Company has sufficient liquidity to permit
distributions at current rates through additional borrowings, any significant and sustained deterioration in operations could result in the
Company’s financial resources being insufficient to pay distributions to shareholders at the current rate, in which event the Company would be
required to reduce the distribution rate. Any decline in the Company’s


funds from operations could adversely affect the Company’s
ability to make distributions to its shareholders or to met its loan covenants and could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s stock
price.

Debt level and refinancing risk may adversely affect financial condition and
operating results

At December 31, 2004, the Company had total debt
outstanding of $1.083 billion. Payments of principal and interest on borrowings may leave the Company with insufficient cash resources to operate the
Communities or pay distributions required to be paid in order for the Company to maintain its qualification as a REIT. The Company currently intends to
limit its total debt to approximately 60% of the undepreciated book value of its assets, although the Company’s charter and bylaws do not limit
its debt levels. Circumstances may cause the Company to exceed that target from time to time. As of December 31, 2004, the Company’s ratio of debt
to undepreciated book value was approximately 56%. The Company’s Board of Directors can modify this policy at any time which could allow the
Company to become more highly leveraged and decrease its ability to make distributions to its shareholders. In addition, the Company must repay its
debt upon maturity, and the inability to access debt or equity capital at attractive rates could adversely affect the Company’s financial
condition and/or its funds from operations.

Variable interest rates may adversely affect funds from
operations

At December 31, 2004, effectively $201.6 million of
the Company’s debt bore interest at a variable rate and was not hedged by interest rate swaps or caps. An additional $50 million also bore
interest at a variable rate at December 31, 2004, but was hedged by an interest rate swap that becomes operative in May 2005. In addition, the Company
may incur additional debt in the future that also bears interest at variable rates. Variable-rate debt creates higher debt service requirements if
market interest rates increase, which would adversely affect the Company’s funds from operations and the amounts available to pay distributions to
shareholders.

The Company’s $950 million secured credit
facilities with Prudential Mortgage Capital, credit enhanced by Fannie Mae, are predominately floating rate facilities. The Company also has a $100
million credit facility with Freddie Mac which is a variable rate facility. These facilities represent the majority of the variable interest rates the
Company was exposed to at December 31, 2004. Large portions of the interest rates on these facilities have been hedged by means of a number of interest
rate swaps and caps. Upon the termination of these swaps and caps, the Company will be exposed to the risks of varying interest rates.

Increasing real estate taxes and insurance costs may negatively impact financial
condition

Because the Company has substantial real estate
holdings, the cost of real estate taxes and insuring its Communities is a significant component of expense. Real estate taxes and insurance premiums
are subject to significant increases and fluctuations which can be widely outside of the control of the Company. If the costs associated with real
estate taxes and insurance should rise, the Company’s financial condition could be negatively impacted and the Company’s ability to pay its
dividend could be affected.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

The following discussion and analysis of financial
condition and results of operations are based upon the Company’s consolidated financial statements, and the notes thereto, which have been
prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the
Company to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. On an
ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances. The
Company believes that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable in the circumstances; however, actual results may differ from these estimates and
assumptions.

The Company believes that the estimates and
assumptions that are most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations, in that they require the most subjective
judgments, form the basis


of accounting policies deemed to be most
critical. These critical accounting policies include capitalization of expenditures and depreciation of assets, impairment of long-lived assets,
including goodwill, and fair value of derivative financial instruments.

Capitalization of expenditures and depreciation of assets

The Company carries its real estate assets at their
depreciated cost. Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which range from 8 to 40
years for land improvements and buildings, 5 years for furniture, fixtures, and equipment, and 3 to 5 years for computers and software, all of which
are judgmental determinations. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred while significant improvements, renovations, and replacements are
capitalized. The cost to complete any deferred repairs and maintenance at properties acquired by the Company in order to elevate the condition of the
property to the Company’s standards are capitalized as incurred.

Impairment of long-lived assets, including goodwill

The Company accounts for long-lived assets in
accordance with the provisions of Statement No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets (“Statement 144”) and
evaluates its goodwill for impairment under Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (“Statement 142”). The Company evaluates
its goodwill for impairment on an annual basis in the Company’s fiscal fourth quarter, or sooner if a goodwill impairment indicator is identified.
The Company periodically evaluates its long-lived assets, including its investments in real estate and goodwill, for indicators that would suggest that
the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. The judgments regarding the existence of such indicators are based on factors such as
operating performance, market conditions, and legal factors.

In accordance with Statement 144, long-lived assets,
such as real estate assets, and equipment, and purchased intangibles subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a
comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount
of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds
the fair value of the asset. Assets to be disposed of are separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or
fair value less costs to sell, and are no longer depreciated. The assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale are presented
separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet.

Goodwill is tested annually for impairment, and is
tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. An impairment loss is recognized to the
extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset’s fair value. This determination is made at the reporting unit level and consists of two steps.
First, the Company determines the fair value of a reporting unit and compares it to its carrying amount. In the apartment industry, the primary method
used for determining fair value is to divide annual operating cash flows by an appropriate capitalization rate. The Company determines the appropriate
capitalization rate by reviewing the prevailing rates in a property’s market or submarket. Second, if the carrying amount of a reporting unit
exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill over the implied
fair value of that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to
a purchase price allocation, in accordance with Statement No. 141,

Business Combinations

. The residual fair value after this allocation is the
implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill.

Fair value of derivative financial instruments

The Company utilizes certain derivative financial
instruments, primarily interest rate swaps and caps, during the normal course of business to manage, or hedge, the interest rate risk associated with
the Company’s variable rate debt or as hedges in anticipation of future debt transactions to manage well-defined interest rate


risk associated with the transaction. The
valuation of the derivative financial instruments under Statement No. 133 as amended requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect
the fair value of the instruments.

In order for a derivative contract to be designated
as a hedging instrument, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item must be highly effective. While the Company’s
calculation of hedge effectiveness contains some subjective determinations, the historical correlation of the cash flows of the hedging instruments and
the underlying hedged item are measured by the Company before entering into the hedging relationship and have been found to be highly
correlated.

The Company performs ineffectiveness tests using the
change in the variable cash flows method at the inception of the hedge and for each reporting period thereafter, through the term of the hedging
instruments. Any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded in earnings. The change in fair value of the interest rate swaps and caps designated
as cash flow hedges are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income in the statement of shareholders’ equity.

OVERVIEW OF THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004

The Company’s results for 2004 were positively
impacted by both internal and external growth.

The Company achieved internal growth in 2004 as same
store operating results were helped by early signs of economic recovery in the Company’s geographic areas of operation. Occupancy performance
improved from the prior year, but was somewhat offset by a continued use of a higher than historical level of rental concessions.

The Company grew externally during 2004 by following
its acquisition strategy to invest in large and mid-sized growing markets in the southeastern United States and in Texas. The Company acquired six
properties in 2004.

The financings and acquisitions made during 2004
helped the Company continue its strategy of improving the flexibility of its balance sheet and enhancing its ability to strengthen its dividend
coverage.

The following is a discussion of the consolidated
financial condition and results of operations of the Company for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002. This discussion should be read in
conjunction with all of the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

As of December 31, 2004, the total number of
apartment units the Company owned or had an ownership interest in, including the properties owned by the Company’s Joint Ventures was 37,904 in
132 Communities compared to the 35,734 apartment units in 127 Communities owned at December 31, 2003, and the 33,923 apartment units in 123 Communities
owned at December 31, 2002. For properties owned 100% by the Company, the average monthly rental per apartment unit, excluding units in lease-up,
increased to $680 at December 31, 2004 from $667 at December 31, 2003 and $661 at December 31, 2002. For these same units, overall occupancy at
December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 was 93.6%, 92.7%, and 91.9%, respectively.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

COMPARISON OF THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004 TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,

Comparisons of income from property operations for
the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 were impacted by various factors. As a result of the buyout in August of 2003 of the partnership interest in
Bre/Maac Associates, LLC, (the “BreMaac Buyout”), the Company’s joint venture with Blackstone Real Estate Advisors
(“Blackstone”), the Company’s consolidated financial statements for 2003 include the impact of approximately only four months of
operations of the 10 properties which were previously owned by the joint venture and accounted for using the equity method. The Company’s
consolidated financial statements for 2004 include a full twelve months of operations for these 10 properties. The Company’s consolidated
financial statements for 2003 also included only partial year results for the four properties acquired during 2003 (one of which was subsequently
transferred to Mid-America CH/Realty, LP, the Company’s joint venture with Crow Holdings (the “Green Oaks Transfer”)). The Company also
acquired an additional six properties during the


course of 2004. During 2003, the Company had two
development communities which completed lease-up. Finally, the Company’s performance during 2004 and 2003 was impacted by changes in performance
of the communities that were held throughout both periods.

Property revenues for the year ended December 31,
2004, increased by approximately $31,262,000 from the year ended December 31, 2003 due to (i) a $12,481,000 increase in property revenues from the
BreMaac Buyout, (ii) a $7,759,000 increase in property revenues from the six communities acquired in 2004 (the “2004 Acquisitions”), (iii) a
$7,372,000 increase in property revenues from the acquisitions of the Los Rios Park, Lighthouse Court and Legacy Pines communities in 2003 (the
“2003 Acquisitions”), (iv) a $4,062,000 increase in property revenues from the communities held throughout both periods, and (v) a $189,000
increase in property revenues from the communities in lease-up in 2003 (the “Communities in Lease-up”). These increases were partially offset
by a decrease in property revenues of $601,000 due to the Green Oaks Transfer.

Property operating expenses include costs for
property personnel, building repairs and maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance, utilities, landscaping and other property related costs.
Property operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2004, increased by approximately $14,056,000 from the year ended December 31, 2003, due
primarily to increases of property operating expenses of (i) $6,008,000 from the BreMaac Buyout, (ii) $3,966,000 from the 2003 Acquisitions, (iii)
$3,307,000 from the 2004 Acquisitions, (iv) $593,000 from the communities held throughout both periods, (v) $514,000 from expenses related to the
extraordinary hurricane season in 2004, and (vi) $27,000 from the Communities in Lease-up. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in
property operating expenses of $359,000 from the Green Oaks Transfer.

Depreciation expense increased by approximately
$10,579,000 primarily due to the increases of depreciation expense of (i) $3,659,000 from the 2003 Acquisitions, (ii) $3,362,000 from the 2004
Acquisitions, (iii) $2,781,000 from the BreMaac Buyout, and (iv) $802,000 from the communities held throughout both periods. These increases were
partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense of $25,000 from the Communities in Lease-up.

Property management expenses increased by
approximately $1,922,000 from the year ended December 31, 2003 to the year ended December 31, 2004 partially due to increased personnel expenses and
incentive compensation related to property acquisitions. General and administrative expenses increased by approximately $2,005,000 over this same
period partially related to expenses associated with the implementation of new property management software and expenses resulting from new regulatory
requirements.

Interest expense increased approximately $5,867,000
from 2003 due primarily to the increase in the amount of debt outstanding from 2003. The Company’s average borrowing cost at December 31, 2004 and
2003 was 5.4%.

For the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company
recorded a total of approximately $9,074,000 in gains from two property sales, of which approximately $3,249,000 represented the Company’s share
of the gain from the sale of a property which was owned by one of the Company’s joint ventures. In 2003, the Company sold one property and
recorded a gain of approximately $1,919,000.

In 2004 and 2003, the Company refinanced the debt on
several of its communities primarily to take advantage of the lower interest rate environment. This resulted in gains of approximately $1,095,000 and
$111,000 related to the early extinguishment of debt in 2004 and 2003, respectively.

For the years ended December 31, 2004, and 2003, the
Company recorded net gains on insurance and other settlement proceeds totaling approximately $2,683,000, mainly related to insurance settlements from
fires at some of the Company’s Communities, and approximately $2,860,000, mainly related to insurance settlements from the fire at the
Company’s headquarters in March 2002, respectively.

Primarily as a result of the foregoing, net income
increased by $4,992,000 in 2004 over 2003.

COMPARISON OF THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003 TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,

Comparisons of income from property operations for
the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 were impacted by four main factors. First, as a result of the BreMaac Buyout the Company’s consolidated
financial statements for 2003 include the impact of only four months of operations of the 10 properties which were


previously owned by the joint venture and
accounted for using the equity method. Second, the Company acquired four properties in 2003 (one of which was subsequently transferred to Mid-America
CH/Realty, LP, the Company’s joint venture with Crow Holdings). Third, during the years 2003 and 2002, the Company still had three development
communities which were in various stages of lease-up (the “Development Communities”). Finally, the Company’s performance during 2003 and
2002 was impacted by changes in performance of the communities that were held throughout both periods.

Property revenues for 2003 increased by
approximately $7,864,000 due primarily to increases of (i) $6,156,000 from the BreMaac Buyout, (ii) $3,841,000 from the 2003 Acquisitions and the
purchase of the Green Oaks apartments, and (iii) $1,431,000 from the Development Communities. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in
property revenues of $3,564,000 from the communities owned throughout both periods.

Property operating expenses include costs for
property personnel, building repairs and maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance, utilities, landscaping and other property related costs.
Property operating expenses for 2003 increased by approximately $7,823,000 due primarily to increases of (i) $2,999,000 due to the BreMaac Buyout, (ii)
$2,623,000 from the communities held throughout both periods, (iii) $1,908,000 due to the 2003 Acquisitions and the purchase of the Green Oaks
apartments, and (iv) $293,000 due to the Development Communities.

Depreciation and amortization expense increased by
approximately $3,789,000 from the prior year primarily due to increases of (i) $2,304,000 due to the BreMaac Buyout, (ii) $1,460,000 due to the 2003
Acquisitions, (iii) $1,000 due to the communities owned throughout both periods and (iv) $24,000 from the Development Communities.

Property management expenses decreased approximately
$198,000 as compared to the prior year. The decrease was mainly due to reductions in bonuses. General and administrative expense increased
approximately $570,000 as compared to the prior year. This increase was mainly related to increased compensation incentives and salaries, partially
related to the addition of new personnel hired to address recent regulatory requirements.

Interest expense decreased approximately $3,390,000
from 2002 due primarily to the Company’s ability to take advantage of the decline in interest rates in 2002 and 2003. The Company’s average
borrowing cost at December 31, 2003 was 5.4% as compared to 5.8% on December 31, 2002.

For the years ended December 31, 2003, and 2002, the
Company recorded net gains on insurance and other settlement proceeds totaling approximately $2,860,000, mainly related to insurance settlements from
the fire at the Company’s headquarters in March 2002, and approximately $397,000, primarily related to insurance settlements,
respectively.

In 2003 and 2002, the Company refinanced several of
its communities primarily to take advantage of the lower interest rate environment. This resulted in a gain of approximately $111,000 related to the
early extinguishment of debt in 2003 and a loss of approximately $1,441,000 in 2002.

In 2003, the Company recorded a gain on discontinued
operations of approximately $1,919,000 related to the sale of the Crossings apartments in 2003. No properties were sold in 2002.

Primarily as a result of the foregoing, net income
increased by approximately $4,065,000 in 2003 over 2002.

FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS

Funds from operations (“FFO”) represents
net income (computed in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or “GAAP”) excluding extraordinary items, minority
interest in Operating Partnership income, gain on disposition of real estate assets, plus depreciation of real estate, and adjustments for joint
ventures to reflect FFO on the same basis. This definition of FFO is in accordance with the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trust’s
(“NAREIT”) definition. Disposition of real estate assets includes sales of discontinued operations as well as proceeds received from
insurance and other settlements from property damage.


In response to the Securities and Exchange
Commission’s Staff Policy Statement relating to EITF Topic D-42 concerning the calculation of earnings per share for the redemption of preferred
stock, the Company has included the amount charged to retire preferred stock in excess of carrying values in its FFO calculation.

The Company’s policy is to expense the cost of
interior painting, vinyl flooring, and blinds as incurred for stabilized properties. During the stabilization period for acquisition properties, these
items are capitalized as part of the total repositioning program of newly acquired properties, and, thus are not deducted in calculating
FFO.

FFO should not be considered as an alternative to
net income or any other GAAP measurement of performance, as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating,
investing, and financing activities as a measure of liquidity. The Company believes that FFO is helpful to investors in understanding the
Company’s operating performance in that such calculation excludes depreciation expense on real estate assets. The Company believes that GAAP
historical cost depreciation of real estate assets is generally not correlated with changes in the value of those assets, whose value does not diminish
predictably over time, as historical cost depreciation implies. The Company’s calculation of FFO may differ from the methodology for calculating
FFO utilized by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs.

The following table is a reconciliation of FFO to
net income for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 (dollars and shares in thousands):

FFO increased during 2004 by

charges of $5,987,000 and $2,041,000, respectively, for premiums and original issuance costs associated with the redemption of preferred
stock.

TRENDS

Property performance over the past two years has
been pressured by an imbalance between supply and demand for apartment units in many of the Company’s markets. The economic downturn and the
related low interest rate environment have combined to contribute to a temporary decline in demand for apartment units, while allowing delivery levels
of newly constructed apartment units to remain consistent with and in some cases above historical averages.


The recent economic environment has impacted demand
in two main ways: 1) producing lower job growth, which reduced the number of potential renters in most of the Company’s markets, and 2) producing
lower interest rates which has increased the affordability of single family housing, prompting more renters to purchase homes.

On the supply side, the declining interest rates
have provided an incentive to developers to construct new apartment units in many of the Company’s markets, especially in the larger metropolitan
markets. Delivery of these new units during this period of weakened apartment demand has increased competition, adding pressure to apartment occupancy
levels and pricing in a number of the Company’s markets.

As part of its strategy to create continued stable
and growing performance, the Company maintains a portfolio of properties diversified across large metropolitan markets, mid-sized markets, and smaller
tier markets, as defined by population levels. During the economic downturn, the Company’s smaller-tier and mid-sized markets produced more stable
performance, while its larger metropolitan markets proved more susceptible to declining job formation and apartment supply imbalances.

The Company is beginning to see indications of
stronger job growth in many of its markets, which could indicate an improvement in the general economic environment. As (and if) the economic
environment improves, the Company expects to see more household formations and increasing interest rates, which the Company believes will combine to
increase the number of apartment renters and decrease the construction of new apartment units.

While increasing interest rates will increase the
Company’s cost of borrowing, the Company expects that this increase in demand will also generate stronger property performance across the
Company’s portfolio. The Company’s large-tier markets, which have been under the most pressure during the economic downturn, should begin to
absorb the oversupply of new apartment units and return to historical occupancy and pricing levels, while the Company’s smaller-tier and mid-sized
markets will also benefit from improving market fundamentals which support continued stable growth.

Over the long term, general demographic trends are
expected to favor apartment owners, as immigration growth, combined with the increasing demand for rental housing from the “echo boomers”
(children of the “baby boomers”) is expected to produce more apartment renters over the next ten years. The Company believes its portfolio
location throughout the Southeast and South central regions of the country position it well to take advantage of these improving demographic
trends.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Net cash flow provided by operating activities
increased by approximately $11,709,000 to $88,229,000 for 2004 compared to $76,520,000 for 2003 mainly related to the growth of the Company through the
BreMaac Buyout and the 2003 Acquisitions and 2004 Acquisitions.

Net cash used in investing activities remained
relatively stable, increasing from approximately $139,555,000 in 2003 to $168,383,000 in 2004. A total of approximately $138,688,000 was invested in
2003 to acquire properties (including the BreMaac Buyout), this compares to approximately $155,088,000 in 2004. These amounts were only slightly offset
by proceeds from dispositions of assets of approximately $26,247,000 in 2003 and $15,679,000 in 2004.

Capital improvements to existing real estate assets
during 2004 and 2003 totaled approximately $30,413,000 and $22,832,000, respectively. Recurring capital expenditures were approximately $13,012,000 and
$12,846,000, respectively during 2004 and 2003.

Net cash provided by financing activities increased
approximately $18,812,000 to $80,492,000 in 2004 from $61,680,000 in 2003. Cash provided from financing activities from credit lines and notes payable
increased approximately $58,839,000 from 2003 to 2004 as the Company took advantage of refinancing opportunities to manage interest expense and help
accommodate property acquisitions. Proceeds from issuances of common shares and units decreased approximately $34,628,000 from 2003 to 2004 as the
Company sold 1,765,000 shares of common stock to certain advisory clients of Cohen & Steers Capital Management, Inc. and to Scudder RREEF Real
Estate Fund II, Inc. in 2003 to partially


fund the BreMaac Buyout and acquisitions in
2003. In 2004 the Company issued approximately 414,000 shares of common stock through its Direct Stock Purchase and Distribution Reinvestment Plan as
compared to 31,484 shares in 2003, as the Company granted a total of $15 million in waivers for purchases from August 2004 to December
2004.

In the first three months of 2004, the Company
refinanced $2.3 million of bonds using its secured credit facility with a group of banks led by AmSouth Bank (the “AmSouth Facility”). The
Company refinanced an additional $14.3 million of bonds using its tax-free bond facility, credit enhanced by the Federal National Mortgage Association
(“FNMA”) (the “Tax-Free Bond Facility”). The Company also refinanced a total of $52.8 million representing the debt on six of the
properties it acquired through its partnership buyout of Bre/Maac Associates, LLC in 2003 using a renegotiated secured credit facility with Prudential
Mortgage Capital, credit enhanced by FNMA (the “FNMA Facility”).

During the three month period ended June 30, 2004,
the Company refinanced an $11.2 million mortgage using its existing FNMA Facility. The Company amended the AmSouth Facility to extend the maturity by
one year and increased the loan to value from 57% to 65%, effectively increasing the borrowing base from $31.7 million to $37.9 million. The Company
also paid off the mortgages of five properties. The five properties were then used to collateralize a loan under a new credit agreement with Financial
Federal Savings Bank, which was subsequently purchased and credit enhanced by Freddie Mac (the “Freddie Mac Facility”). The Freddie Mac
Facility has a commitment amount of $100 million and a maturity date of July 1, 2011.

During the three month period ended September 30,
2004, the Company refinanced the debt on the remaining four properties it acquired through its partnership buyout of Bre/Maac Associates, LLC in 2003
using the FNMA Facility. The Company also borrowed a total of $31 million from its Freddie Mac Facility in the third quarter of 2004 which is
collateralized by the Watermark and Prescott apartments purchased in 2004.

During the three month period ended December 31,
2004, the Company paid off the individual mortgages of five properties using its FNMA Facility. The Company also used the FNMA Facility to pay off
loans maturing on three properties with Prudential totaling $47.5 million.

At December 31, 2004, the Tax-Free Bond Facility and
the FNMA Facility (together the “FNMA Facilities”) had a combined credit line limit of $950 million, $839 million of which was available to
borrow. The FNMA Facilities have multiple maturity traunches that range from 2010 through 2014. The FNMA Facilities provide for both fixed and variable
rate borrowings. The interest rate on the majority of the variable portion renews every 90 days and is based on the FNMA Discount Mortgage Backed
Security (“DMBS”) rate on the date of renewal, which has typically approximated three-month LIBOR less an average spread of 0.04% over the
life of the FNMA Facilities, plus a credit enhancement fee of 0.62%.

Each of the Company’s credit facilities is
subject to various covenants and conditions on usage. If the Company were to fail to satisfy a condition to borrowing, the available credit under one
or more of the facilities could not be drawn, which could adversely affect the Company’s liquidity. Moreover, if the Company were to fail to make
a payment or violate a covenant under a credit facility, after applicable cure periods one or more of its lenders could declare a default, accelerate
the due date for repayment of all amounts outstanding and/or foreclose on properties securing such facilities. Any such event could have a material
adverse effect on the Company.

The Company uses interest rate swaps to manage its
current and future interest rate risk. As of December 31, 2004, the Company had 23 interest rate swaps in effect with a total notional amount of $519
million. These swaps have to date proven to be highly effective hedges. The Company has also entered into a future interest rate swap which will go
into effect in the second quarter of 2005. The Company had three interest rate cap agreements in effect as of December 31, 2004, representing a total
notional amount of $22.6 million.


The weighted average interest rate at December 31,
2004, for the $1.083 billion of debt outstanding was 5.4% compared to 5.4% on $952 million of debt outstanding at December 31, 2003. Summary details of
the debt outstanding at December 31, 2004 follows in the table below:

On July 10, 2003, in an underwritten public
offering, the Company sold 5,600,000 shares of its 8.30% Series H Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (“Series H”) at $25 per share less an
underwriting discount of $0.7875 per share. The net proceeds of the sale were applied to the redemption of all the issued and outstanding shares of the
Company’s 9.5% Series A Cumulative Preferred Stock and 9-3/8% Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock as well as 1,600,000 shares of the
1,938,830 issued and outstanding shares of the Company’s 8-7/8% Series B Cumulative Preferred Stock (“Series B”) on August 12,
2003.

On July 16, 2003, the underwriters of the
Company’s Series H offering exercised an option to purchase an additional 525,000 shares of the Series H preferred stock for $25 per share less
the underwriting discount, and on August 4, 2003, the underwriters exercised an option to purchase the remaining additional 75,000 shares of the Series
H preferred stock for $25 per share less the underwriting discount. The net proceeds were used to redeem the remaining issued and outstanding shares of
the Series B preferred stock on August 18, 2003.

On August 22, 2003, the Company sold 700,000 shares
of its common stock to certain advisory clients of Cohen & Steers Capital Management, Inc. The stock was sold at a price of $28.40 per share. The
$19,870,000 in net proceeds from the sale were used to partially fund the BreMaac Buyout.

On September 19, 2003, the Company sold 665,000
shares of its common stock to certain advisory clients of Cohen & Steers Capital Management, Inc. and to Scudder RREEF Real Estate Fund II, Inc.
The stock was sold at a price of $29.36 per share. The $19,500,000 in net proceeds from the sale were used to partially fund the purchase of the Los
Rios Park apartments.

On December 2, 2003, the Company sold 400,000 shares
of its common stock to RREEF America, L.L.C. on behalf of itself and Scudder RREEF Real Estate Fund II, Inc. The stock was sold at a price of $30.00
per share. The $11,996,000 in net proceeds from the sale were used to partially fund the acquisition of the Lighthouse Court
apartments.

The Company believes that it has adequate resources
to fund its current operations, annual refurbishment of its properties, and incremental investment in new apartment properties. The Company is relying
on the efficient operation of the financial markets to finance debt maturities, and also is heavily reliant on the creditworthiness of FNMA, which
provides credit enhancement for approximately $785 million of the Company’s debt. The interest rate market for FNMA DMBS, which in the
Company’s experience is highly correlated with threemonth LIBOR interest rates, is also an important component of the Company’s liquidity and
interest rate swap effectiveness. In the event that the FNMA DMBS market becomes less efficient, or the credit of FNMA becomes impaired, the Company
would seek alternative sources of debt financing.

For the year ended December 31, 2004, the
Company’s net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $10.7 million short of funding improvements to existing real estate assets,
distributions to unitholders, and dividends paid on common and preferred shares. This compared to a shortfall of approximately $9.5 million for the
same period in 2003. While the Company has sufficient liquidity to permit distributions at current rates through additional borrowings, if necessary,
any significant deterioration in operations could result in the Company’s financial resources to be insufficient to pay distributions to
shareholders at the current rate, in which event the Company would be required to reduce the distribution rate.


The following table reflects the Company’s
total contractual cash obligations which consists of its long-term debt as of December 31, 2004 (dollars in 000’s):

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company did not
have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as “structured finance” or
“special purpose entities,” established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or
limited purposes. The Company’s joint venture with Blackstone (terminated in 2003) was established in order to raise capital through asset sales
to fund development (while acquiring management fees to help offset the reduction in FFO from the sale), share repurchases, and other capital
requirements. The Company’s joint ventures with Crow Holdings were established to acquire approximately $200 million of multifamily properties. In
addition, the Company does not engage in trading activities involving non-exchange traded contracts. As such, the Company is not materially exposed to
any financing, liquidity, market, or credit risk that could arise if it had engaged in such relationships. The Company does not have any relationships
or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non-independent relationships with the Company or its related parties other
than what is disclosed in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note
11.

The Company’s investments in its real estate
joint ventures are unconsolidated and are recorded on the equity method as the Company does not have a controlling interest. The Company has a
mezzanine loan in the amount of $4.5 million at an average rate of 9% receivable from its joint venture, Mid-America CH/Realty, LP.

INSURANCE

The Company put in place a new property and casualty
insurance policy effective July 1, 2004. The policy is substantially the same as last year. In the opinion of management, property and casualty
insurance is in place that provides adequate coverage to provide financial protection against normal insurable risks such that it believes that any
loss experienced would not have a significant impact on the Company’s liquidity, financial position, or results of operations.

INFLATION

Substantially all of the resident leases at the
Communities allow, at the time of renewal, for adjustments in the rent payable there under, and thus may enable the Company to seek rent increases.
Almost all leases are for one year or less. The short-term nature of these leases generally serves to reduce the risk to the Company of the adverse
effects of inflation.

IMPACT OF RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement No. 123
(revised December 2004), Share-Based Payment (“Statement 123(R)”). Statement 123(R) replaces FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation, and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. Statement


123(R) will require compensation costs related
to share-based payment transactions to be recognized in the financial statements. With limited exceptions, the amount of compensation cost will be
measured based on the grant-date fair value of the equity or the liability instruments issued. In addition, liability awards will be remeasured each
reporting period. Compensation cost will be recognized over the period that an employee provides service in exchange for the award. Statement 123(R) is
effective as of the beginning of the first interim reporting period that begins after June 15, 2005. The Company does not believe the adoption of
Statement 123(R) will have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial condition or results of operations taken as a
whole.

In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement No. 152,
Accounting for Real Estate Time-Sharing Transactions, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 66 and 67 (“Statement 152”). Statement 152 amends
FASB Statement No. 66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate, to reference the financial accounting and reporting guidance for real estate time-sharing
transactions that is provided in AICPA Statement of Position (SOP) 04-2, Accounting for Real Estate Time-Sharing Transactions. Statement 152 also
amends FASB Statement No. 67, Accounting for Costs and Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate Projects, to state that the guidance for (a) incidental
operations and (b) costs incurred to sell real estate projects does not apply to real estate time-sharing transactions. The accounting for those
operations and costs is subject to the guidance in SOP 04-2. Statement 152 is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after June
15, 2005. The Company does not believe the adoption of Statement 152 will have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial condition
or results of operations taken as a whole.

In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement No. 153,
Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29 (“Statement 153”). Statement 153 was a result of a joint effort by the
FASB and the IASB to improve financial reporting by eliminating certain narrow differences between their existing accounting standards. Statement 153
amends APB Opinion No. 29 to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception
for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance. A nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of
the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange. Statement 153 shall be applied prospectively and is effective for
nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company does not believe the adoption of Statement 153 will
have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET
RISK

The Company’s primary market risk exposure is
to changes in interest rates obtainable on its secured and unsecured borrowings. At December 31, 2004, 48.6% of the Company’s total capitalization
consisted of borrowings. The Company’s interest rate risk objective is to limit the impact of interest rate fluctuations on earnings and cash
flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs. To achieve this objective, the Company manages its exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates
for its borrowings through the use of fixed rate debt instruments to the extent that reasonably favorable rates are obtainable with such arrangements
and may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps, and caps to mitigate its interest rate risk on a related financial
instrument or to effectively fix the interest rate on a portion of its variable debt or on future refinancings. The Company does not enter into
derivative instruments for trading purposes. Approximately 75% of the Company’s outstanding debt was subject to fixed rates after considering
related derivative instruments with a weighted average of 6.2% at December 31, 2004. After considering the $50 million forward interest rate swap which
becomes operative in May 2005, approximately 79% of the Company’s debt was fixed or hedged by interest rate swaps or caps at December 31, 2004.
The Company regularly reviews interest rate exposure on its outstanding borrowings in an effort to minimize the risk of interest rate
fluctuations.


The table below provides information about the
Company’s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For debt obligations, the table presents principal cash flows and
related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates. For the Company’s interest rate swaps and caps, the table presents the
notional amount of the swaps and caps and the years in which they expire. Weighted average variable rates are based on rates in effect at the reporting
date (dollars in 000’s).

ITEM 9A.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

The Company maintains disclosure controls and
procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in its Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the
Company’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. Management necessarily applied its judgment in assessing the costs and benefits of such controls and procedures which, by their
nature, can provide only reasonable assurance regarding management’s control objectives. The Company also has an investment in two unconsolidated
entities which are not under its control. Consequently, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures with respect to these entities are
necessarily more limited than those it maintains with respect to its consolidated subsidiaries.

As of the end of the period covered by this report,
an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”). Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the


Company’s disclosure controls and
procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to the Company (including its consolidated subsidiaries) that is
required to be included in the Company’s Exchange Act filings.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL
REPORTING

The Company is responsible for establishing and
maintaining effective internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. As of December 31, 2004, the
Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
controls over financial reporting. Management used the framework in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission to assess the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Based on the
Company’s assessment of internal control over financial reporting, management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2004, the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting was effective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Company’s assessment
has been attested to by KPMG LLP the independent registered public accounting firm who audits the Company’s consolidated financial
statements.

MANAGEMENT’S EVALUATION OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL
REPORTING

During the Company’s evaluation of internal
controls over financial reporting, management identified items which would have been classified as deficiencies or significant deficiencies within the
framework utilized by management to assess the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Management communicated these items to the
Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company and all of the significant deficiencies were either remediated or the Company had a
remediation plan in place as of the end of the period covered by this report. No material weaknesses were identified by management during its
assessment.

Special Note Regarding Analyst Reports

Investors should also be aware that while the
Company’s management does, from time to time, communicate with securities analysts, it is against the Company’s policy to disclose to them
any material non-public information or other confidential commercial information. Accordingly, shareholders should not assume that the Company agrees
with any statement or report issued by any analyst irrespective of the content of the statement or report. Furthermore, the Company has a policy
against issuing or confirming financial forecasts or projections issued by others. Thus, to the extent that reports issued by securities analysts
contain any projections, forecasts or opinions, such reports are not the responsibility of Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of
Directors and Shareholders

Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2004. In
connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also have audited the accompanying financial statement Schedule III: Real
Estate and Accumulated Depreciation. These consolidated financial statements and the financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the
Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and the financial statement schedule
based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period
ended December 31, 2004, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement
schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the
information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.’s
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated March 8, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on
management’s assessment of, and the effective operation of, internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of
Directors and Shareholders

Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.

We have audited management’s
assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s Report On Internal Control Over Financial Report that Mid-America Apartment Communities,
Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal
Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Mid-America Apartment
Communities, Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our
audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating
the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control
over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and
fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures
of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material
effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to
future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s
assessment that Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, is
fairly stated, in all material respects, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Also, in our opinion, Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal
Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

We also have audited, in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Mid-America
Apartment Communities, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2004, and the related financial statement
schedule and our report dated March 8, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements and the related financial
statement schedule.

Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements

Years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002

1.

Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies

Organization and Formation of the Company

Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.
(“Mid-America“) is a self-administrated and self-managed real estate investment trust which owns, acquires and operates multifamily apartment
communities mainly in the southeastern United States, and in Texas. Mid-America owns and operates 129 apartment communities principally through its
majority owned subsidiary, Mid-America Apartments, L.P. (the “Operating Partnership”). Mid-America also owns a 33.33% interest in each of two
real estate joint ventures which collectively owned 3 apartment communities at December 31, 2004, for which the Company provides management
services.

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements presented
herein include the accounts of Mid-America, the Operating Partnership, and all other subsidiaries (“the Company”). The Company owns 51% to
100% of all consolidated subsidiaries. The Company uses the equity method of accounting for its investments in 20 to 50 percent-owned entities for
which the Company does not have the ability to exercise control. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation.

Minority Interest

Minority interest in the accompanying consolidated
financial statements relates to the ownership interest in the Operating Partnership by the holders of Class A Common Units of the Operating Partnership
(“Operating Partnership Units”). Mid-America is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership. Net income is allocated to the
minority interest based on their respective ownership percentage of the Operating Partnership. Issuance of additional common shares or Operating
Partnership Units changes the ownership of both the minority interest and Mid-America. Such transactions and the proceeds there from are treated as
capital transactions and result in an allocation between shareholders’ equity and minority interest to account for the change in the respective
percentage ownership of the underlying equity of the Operating Partnership.

The Company’s Board of Directors established
economic rights in respect to each Operating Partnership Unit that were equivalent to the economic rights in respect to each share of common stock. The
holder of each unit may redeem their units in exchange for one share of common stock or cash, at the option of the Company. The Operating Partnership
has followed the policy of paying the same per unit distribution in respect to the units as the per share distribution in respect to the common stock.
Operating Partnership net income for 2004, 2003 and 2002 was allocated approximately 12.1%, 14.6%, and 15.7%, respectively, to holders of Operating
Partnership Units and 87.9%, 85.4%, and 84.3%, respectively, to Mid-America.

Use of Estimates

Management of the Company has made a number of
estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses to prepare these financial statements and notes in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Revenue Recognition

The Company leases multifamily residential
apartments under operating leases primarily with terms of one year or less. Rental revenues are recognized using a method that represents a
straight-line basis over the term of the lease and other revenues are recorded when earned.

F-8

The Company records all gains and losses on real
estate in accordance with Statement No. 66 “Accounting for Sales of Real Estate.”

Rental Costs

Costs associated with rental activities are expensed
as incurred. Certain costs associated with the lease-up of development projects, including cost of model units, their furnishings, signs, and
“grand openings” are capitalized and amortized over their respective estimated useful lives. All other costs relating to renting development
projects are expensed as incurred.

Earnings Per Share

The computation of basic earnings per share is based
on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. The computation of diluted earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding plus the shares resulting from the assumed exercise of all dilutive outstanding options using the treasury stock method. For
periods where the Company reports a net loss available for common shareholders, the effect of dilutive shares is excluded from earnings per share
calculations because including such shares would be anti-dilutive.

A reconciliation of the numerators and denominators
of the basic and diluted earnings per share computations for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 is presented on the Consolidated
Statements of Operations.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company considers cash, investments in money
market accounts and certificates of deposit with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

Restricted Cash

Restricted cash consists of escrow deposits held by
lenders for property taxes, insurance, debt service and replacement reserves.

Real Estate Assets and Depreciation

Real estate assets are carried at depreciated cost.
Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred while significant improvements, renovations, and recurring capital replacements are capitalized.
Recurring capital replacements typically include whole unit carpet replacement, new roofs, HVAC units, plumbing, concrete, masonry and other paving,
pools and various exterior building improvements. These expenditures extend the useful life of the property and increase the property’s fair
market value. The cost of interior painting, vinyl flooring and blinds are expensed as incurred.

In conjunction with acquisitions of properties, the
Company’s policy is to provide in its acquisition budgets adequate funds to complete any deferred maintenance items to bring the properties to the
required standard, including the cost of replacement appliances, carpet, interior painting, vinyl flooring and blinds. These costs are
capitalized.

Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis
over the estimated useful lives of the related assets which range from 8 to 40 years for land improvements and buildings and 5 years for furniture,
fixtures and equipment and 3 to 5 years for computers and software.

For real estate acquisitions subsequent to June 30,
2001, the effective date of Statement 141,

Business Combinations

, the fair value of the real estate acquired is allocated to the acquired
tangible assets, consisting of land, building, furniture, fixtures and equipment, and identified intangible assets and liabilities, consisting of above
and below market leases, resident relationship values and the value of in-place leases.

F-9

The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired
property (land, building, furniture, fixtures and equipment) is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant. The “as-if-vacant”
value is then allocated to land, building, furniture, fixtures and equipment based on management’s determination of the relative fair values of
these assets. Management determines the as-if-vacant fair value of a property using methods similar to those used by independent appraisers. Factors
considered by management in performing these analyses include an estimate of carrying costs during the period of time that would be required in the
current market conditions to lease-up the property. Management includes real estate taxes, insurance, operating expenses and lost rentals as well as
the costs required to execute similar leases in the estimated carrying costs.

In allocating the fair value of identified
intangible assets and liabilities of an acquired property, the in-place leases are compared to current market conditions. Based on these evaluations,
management believes that the leases acquired on each of its property acquisitions were at market rates since the lease terms generally do not extend
beyond one year.

The fair value of the in-place leases and resident
relationships is measured by the excess of the purchase price over the as-if-vacant value of the property as described above. The fair value of the
in-place leases and resident relationships is then amortized over the remaining term of the resident leases. The amount of these resident lease
intangibles included in real estate assets totaled $9.1 million and $4.9 million as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively and the amortization
recorded as depreciation expense was $4.9 million and $1.4 million for the years ending December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

The Company accounts for long-lived assets in
accordance with the provisions of Statement No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets (“Statement 144”) and
evaluates its goodwill for impairment under Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (“Statement 142”). The Company evaluates
its goodwill for impairment on an annual basis in the Company’s fiscal fourth quarter, or sooner if a goodwill impairment indicator is identified.
The Company periodically evaluates its long-lived assets, including its investments in real estate and goodwill, for indicators that would suggest that
the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. The judgments regarding the existence of such indicators are based on factors such as
operating performance, market conditions, and legal factors.

In accordance with Statement 144, long-lived assets,
such as real estate assets, and equipment, and purchased intangibles subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a
comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount
of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds
the fair value of the asset. Assets to be disposed of are separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or
fair value less costs to sell, and are no longer depreciated. The assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale are presented
separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet.

Goodwill is tested annually for impairment, and is
tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. An impairment loss is recognized to the
extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset’s fair value. This determination is made at the reporting unit level and consists of two steps.
First, the Company determines the fair value of a reporting unit and compares it to its carrying amount. In the apartment industry, the primary method
used for determining fair value is to divide annual operating cash flows by an appropriate capitalization rate. The Company determines the appropriate
capitalization rate by reviewing the prevailing rates in a property’s market or submarket. Second, if the carrying amount of a reporting unit
exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill over the implied
fair value of that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to
a purchase price allocation, in accordance with Statement No. 141,

Business Combinations

. The residual fair value after this allocation is the
implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill.

F-10

The Company’s 2004 annual evaluation indicated
an impairment of goodwill related to the Eastview apartments, which is classified in the consolidated financial statements as held for sale. Asset
impairment of discontinued operations reflects a $200,000 charge related to this evaluation. The Company will continue to test reporting unit goodwill
for potential impairment on an annual basis in the Company’s fiscal fourth quarter, or sooner if a goodwill impairment indicator is
identified.

Land Held for Future Development

Real estate held for future development are sites
intended for future multifamily developments and are carried at the lower of cost or fair value.

Investment In and Advances to Real Estate Joint Ventures

The Company’s investments in its unconsolidated
real estate joint ventures are recorded on the equity method as the Company is able to exert significant influence, but does not have a controlling
interest in the joint ventures.

Deferred Financing Costs

Deferred financing costs are amortized over the
terms of the related debt using a method which approximates the interest method.

Derivative Financial Instruments

In the normal course of business, the Company uses
certain derivative financial instruments to manage, or hedge, the interest rate risk associated with the Company’s variable rate debt or as hedges
in anticipation of future debt transactions to manage well-defined interest rate risk associated with the transaction.

The Company does not use derivative financial
instruments for speculative or trading purposes. Further, the Company has a policy of entering into contracts with major financial institutions based
upon their credit rating and other factors. When viewed in conjunction with the underlying and offsetting exposure that the derivatives are designated
to hedge, the Company has not sustained any material loss from those instruments nor does it anticipate any material adverse effect on its net income
or financial position in the future from the use of derivatives.

The Company requires that derivative financial
instruments designated as cash flow hedges be effective in reducing the interest rate risk exposure that they are designated to hedge. This
effectiveness is essential for qualifying for hedge accounting. Instruments that meet the hedging criteria are formally designated as hedging
instruments at the inception of the derivative contract. The Company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items,
as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction. This process includes linking all derivatives that are
designated as fair-value or cash flow hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific firm commitments or forecasted
transactions. The Company also formally assesses, both at the inception of the hedging relationship and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives
used are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. When it is determined that a derivative has ceased to be
a highly effective hedge, the Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively.

All of the Company’s derivative financial
instruments are recorded at fair value and reported on the balance sheet, and are characterized as cash flow hedges. These transactions hedge the
future cash flows of debt transactions through interest rate swaps that convert variable payments to fixed payments and interest rate caps that limit
the exposure to rising interest rates. The unrealized gains/losses in the fair value of these hedging instruments are reported on the balance sheet
with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income, with any ineffective portion of the hedging transactions reclassified to
earnings. During the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, the ineffective portion of the hedging transactions was not
significant.

F-11

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement No. 123
(revised December 2004), Share-Based Payment (“Statement 123(R)”). Statement 123(R) replaces FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation, and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. Statement 123(R) will require compensation costs
related to share-based payment transactions to be recognized in the financial statements. With limited exceptions, the amount of compensation cost will
be measured based on the grant-date fair value of the equity or the liability instruments issued. In addition, liability awards will be remeasured each
reporting period. Compensation cost will be recognized over the period that an employee provides service in exchange for the award. Statement 123(R) is
effective as of the beginning of the first interim reporting period that begins after June 15, 2005. The Company does not believe the adoption of
Statement 123(R) will have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial condition or results of operations taken as a
whole.

In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement No. 152,
Accounting for Real Estate Time-Sharing Transactions, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 66 and 67 (“Statement 152”). Statement 152 amends
FASB Statement No. 66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate, to reference the financial accounting and reporting guidance for real estate time-sharing
transactions that is provided in AICPA Statement of Position (SOP) 04-2, Accounting for Real Estate Time-Sharing Transactions. Statement 152 also
amends FASB Statement No. 67, Accounting for Costs and Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate Projects, to state that the guidance for (a) incidental
operations and (b) costs incurred to sell real estate projects does not apply to real estate time-sharing transactions. The accounting for those
operations and costs is subject to the guidance in SOP 04-2. Statement 152 is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after June
15, 2005. The Company does not believe the adoption of Statement 152 will have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial condition
or results of operations taken as a whole.

In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement No. 153,
Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, an amendment of APB Opinion No. 29 (“Statement 153”). Statement 153 was a result of a joint effort by the
FASB and the IASB to improve financial reporting by eliminating certain narrow differences between their existing accounting standards. Statement 153
amends APB Opinion No. 29 to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception
for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance. A nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of
the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange. Statement 153 shall be applied prospectively and is effective for
nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company does not believe the adoption of Statement 153 will
have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole.

Stock-Based Compensation

Upon shareholder approval at the May 24, 2004 Annual
Meeting of Shareholders, the Company adopted the 2004 Stock Plan to provide incentives to attract and retain independent directors, executive officers
and key employees. This plan replaced the 1994 Restricted Stock and Stock Option Plan under which no further awards may be granted as of January 31,
2004. See Note 8 for further details.

The Company has adopted Statement No. 123,
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation”, which requires either the (i) fair value of employee stock-based compensation plans be recorded as
a component of compensation expense in the statement of operations as of the date of grant of awards related to such plans, or (ii) impact of such fair
value on net income and earnings per share be disclosed on a pro forma basis in a footnote to financial statements for awards granted after December
15, 1994, if the accounting for such awards continues to be in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees,” (“APB 25”). The Company will continue such accounting under the provisions of APB 25.

F-12

The following table reflects the effect on net
income (loss) if the fair value method of accounting allowed under Statement No. 123 had been used by the Company along with the applicable assumptions

Through August 25, 2003, the Company owned a 33.33%
interest in a joint venture (“Bre/MAAC”) with Blackstone Real Estate Acquisitions, LLC (“Blackstone”) which was formed in 1999 when
the Company sold 10 apartment communities containing 2,793 apartment units to Bre/MAAC for $97.9 million. On August 25, 2003 the Company paid $21.9
million in cash and assumed $53.2 million in debt to purchase Blackstone’s 66.67% interest in the joint venture. This acquisition was accounted
for under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141,

Business Combinations

. The
purchase accounting adjustments include an adjustment to the carrying value of the real estate asset resulting from the previously unrecognized
deferred gain on the Company’s retained interest from the original sale of the properties to Bre/MAAC in 1999 and the recording of certain
intangible assets. The operating results of Bre/MAAC are included in the accompanying statement of operations commencing August 25,
2003.

Borrowings

The Company maintains a total of $950 million of
secured credit facilities with Prudential Mortgage Capital, credit-enhanced by FNMA (the “FNMA Facilities”). The FNMA Facilities provide for
both fixed and variable rate borrowings and have traunches with maturities from 2010 through 2014. The interest rate on the majority of the variable
portion renews every 90 days and is based on the FNMA discount mortgage backed security rate on the date of renewal, which, for the Company, has
historically approximated three-month LIBOR less an average of 0.04% over the life of the FNMA Facilities, plus a fee of 0.62%. Borrowings under the
FNMA Facilities totaled $785 million at December 31, 2004, consisting of $110 million under a fixed portion at a rate of 7.2%, and the remaining $675
million under the variable rate portion of the facility at an average rate of 3.0%. The available borrowing base capacity at December 31, 2004 was
$839.5 million.

F-14

The Company has nineteen interest rate swap
agreements, totaling a notional amount of $443 million designed to fix the interest rate on a portion of the variable rate borrowings outstanding under
the FNMA Facilities at approximately 5.7%. The interest rate swaps have maturities between 2005 and 2012. The Company also has a forward interest rate
swap for an additional notional amount of $50 million at an interest rate of 5.2% which goes into effect in the second quarter of 2005 and matures in
2012. The swaps are highly effective and are designed as cash flow hedges. The Company has also entered into three interest rate caps totaling a
notional amount of $22.6 million which are designated against the FNMA Facilities. These interest rate caps mature in 2007 and 2009 and are set at
6.0%. The FNMA Facilities are subject to certain borrowing base calculations that effectively reduce the amount that may be borrowed.

The Company has a $100 million credit facility with
Freddie MAC (the “Freddie Mac Facility”). At December 31, 2004, the Company had $65.4 million borrowed against the Freddie Mac Facility at an
interest rate of 3.1%. The Company has three interest rate swap agreements, totaling a notional amount of $51 million designed to fix the interest rate
on a portion of the variable rate borrowings outstanding under the Freddie Mac Facility at approximately 5.3%. The interest rate swaps expire in
2011.

The Company also maintains a $40 million secured
credit facility with two banks led by AmSouth Bank (the “AmSouth Credit Line”). The AmSouth Credit Line bears an interest rate of LIBOR plus
a spread ranging from 1.35% to 1.75% based on certain quarterly coverage calculations established by the agreement. This credit line expires in May
2006 and is subject to certain borrowing base calculations that effectively reduce the amount that may be borrowed. At December 31, 2004, the Company
had $32.1 million available to be borrowed under the AmSouth Credit Line agreement with $12.3 million borrowed under this facility at an interest rate
of 4.5%. $6.7 million of the facility is used for letters of credit.

Each of the Company’s credit facilities is
subject to various covenants and conditions on usage. If the Company were to fail to satisfy a condition to borrowing, the available credit under one
or more of the facilities could not be drawn, which could adversely affect the Company’s liquidity. Moreover, if the Company were to fail to make
a payment or violate a covenant under a credit facility, after applicable cure periods one or more of its lenders could declare a default, accelerate
the due date for repayment of all amounts outstanding and/or foreclose on properties securing such facilities. Any such event could have a material
adverse effect on the Company. The Company believes it was in compliance with these covenants and conditions on usage at December 31,
2004.

The Company had outstanding at December 31, 2004 a
$20 million unsecured short-term note payable with Compass Bank at an interest rate of 2.8%, which matures in 2005, and a $40 million promissory note
with Union Planters at a variable interest rate, (index based on three month LIBOR), of 3.4% which matures in April 2009. The Company has entered into
an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $25 million and an interest rate of 4.0% which expires in March 2009 and is designated
against the Union Planters promissory note.

At December 31, 2004, the Company had $121.1 million
of fixed rate conventional individual property mortgages with an average interest rate of 6.6% and an average maturity of 2014, $35 million of fixed
rate tax exempt individual property mortgages with an average interest rate of 5.7% and an average maturity of 2026, and a $4.7 million variable rate
tax exempt individual property mortgage at an interest rate of 2.7% with a maturity in 2028.

At December 31, 2004, the Company had $240.8 million
(after considering the impact of interest rate swap agreements) conventional variable rate debt outstanding at an average interest rate of 3.1%, $10.8
million (after considering the impact of interest rate swap agreements) of tax-free variable rate debt outstanding at an average rate of 2.6%, and an
additional $22.6 million of capped tax-free variable rate debt at an average rate of 2.8%. The interest rate on all other debt, totaling $809.3
million, was hedged or fixed at an average interest rate of 6.2%.

During 2004, the Company refinanced $198.8 million
of debt, $67.8 of which was refinanced during the three month period ended December 31, 2004. The refinancings during the three month period ended
December 31, 2004 resulted in a gain of $1.3 million. Gain on debt extinguishment for the full year of 2004 was $1.1 million, as the fourth quarter
gains were somewhat offset by a net loss on debt extinguishment in the second quarter of 2004.

F-15

As of December 31, 2004, the Company estimated that
the weighted average interest rate on the Company’s debt was 5.4%.

Fair Value Disclosure of Financial
Instruments

Cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts
payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities and security deposits are carried at amounts which reasonably approximate their fair value due to their
short term nature.

Fixed rate notes payable at December 31, 2004 and
2003 total $290.3 million and $385.8 million, respectively, and have an estimated fair value of $240.5 million and $368.1 million (excluding prepayment
penalties), respectively, based upon interest rates available for the issuance of debt with similar terms and remaining maturities as of December 31,
2004 and 2003. The carrying value of variable rate notes payable (excluding the effect of interest rate swap agreements) at December 31, 2004 and 2003
total $793.2 million and $566.1 million, respectively, which reasonably approximates their fair value because the related variable interest rates
available for the issuance of debt with similar terms and remaining maturities reasonably approximate market rates. The notional amount of interest
rate and forward interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2004 and 2003 total $569.0 million and $382.7 million, respectively, and have an
estimated fair value of ($14.6) million and ($25.5) million, respectively, based upon interest rates available for interest rate swaps with similar
terms and remaining maturities as of December 31, 2004 and 2003. The notional amount of interest rate cap agreements at December 31, 2004 and 2003
total $22.6 million and $6.8 million,

F-16

respectively, and have an estimated fair value
of $66 thousand and $7 thousand, respectively, based upon interest rates available for interest rate caps with similar terms and remaining maturities
as of December 31, 2004 and 2003.

The fair value estimates presented herein are based
on information available to management as of December 31, 2004 and 2003. These estimates are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company
could ultimately realize.

5.

Commitments and Contingencies

The Company is not presently subject to any material
litigation nor, to the Company’s knowledge, with advice of legal counsel, is any material litigation threatened against the Company. The Company
is subject to routine litigation arising in the ordinary course of business, some of which is expected to be covered by liability insurance and none of
which is expected to have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements of the Company.

The Company had no expenses related to operating
leases for the years ended December 31, 2004, and 2003 and $16,000, for the year ended December 31, 2002. The Company has no commitments for the next
five years under operating lease agreements outstanding at December 31, 2004.

6.

Income Taxes

No provision for Federal income taxes has been made
in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The Company has made an election to be taxed as a Real Estate Investment Trust
(“REIT”) under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code. As a REIT, the Company is generally not subject to Federal income tax
on that portion of its income that qualifies as REIT taxable income to the extent that it distributes at least 90% of its taxable income to the
Company’s shareholders and complies with certain requirements. If the Company fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, the Company will be
subject to the Federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on its taxable income at regular corporate rates. Even though the
Company qualifies for taxation as a REIT, the Company may be subject to certain Federal, state and local taxes on its income and property and to
Federal income and excise tax on its undistributed income.

Earnings and profits, which determine the taxability
of dividends to shareholders, differ from net income reported for financial reporting purposes primarily because of differences in depreciable lives,
bases of certain assets and liabilities and in the timing of recognition of earnings upon disposition of properties. For Federal income tax purposes,
the following summarizes the taxability of cash distributions paid on the common shares in 2003 and 2002 and the estimated taxability for
2004:

beneficial owner of 10% or more of the common shares or announces a tender or exchange offer that would result in ownership of 10% of the
Company’s common shares. The rights will trade with the Company’s common stock until exercisable. Each holder of a right, other than the
Acquiring Person, is in that event entitled to purchase one common share of the Company for each right at one half of the then current
price.

proceeds of $150.1 million. On and after August 11, 2008, the Series H Preferred Stock shares will be redeemable for cash at the option of the Company,
in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to the liquidation preference plus dividends owed and unpaid to the redemption date.

Direct Stock Purchase and Distribution Reinvestment Plan

The Company has a Direct Stock Purchase and
Distribution Reinvestment Plan (“DRSPP”) pursuant to which the Company’s shareholders have the ability to reinvest all or part of their
distributions from the Company’s common stock, preferred stock or limited partnership interests in Mid-America Apartments, L.P. into the
Company’s common stock. The plan also provides the opportunity to make optional cash investments

F-18

in common shares of at least $250, but not more
than $5,000 in any given month, free of brokerage commissions and charges. The Company, in its absolute discretion, may grant waivers to allow for
optional cash payments in excess of $5,000. To fulfill its obligations under the DRSPP, the Company may either issue additional shares of common stock
or repurchase common stock in the open market. The Company has registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission the offer and sale of up to
1,600,000 shares of common stock pursuant to the DRSPP. Additional shares will be purchased at the market price on the “Investment Date” each
month, which shall in no case be later than ten business days following the distribution payment date. The Company may elect to sell shares under the
DRSPP at up to a 5% discount.

Common stock shares totaling 413,598, in 2004,
31,484 in 2003, and 28,715, in 2002 were acquired by shareholders under the DSPDRP. The Company offered a 2% discount for optional cash purchases in
the months of August through December in 2004. No discounts were offered in 2003 or 2002.

approved a stock repurchase plan to acquire up to a total of 4.0 million shares of the Company’s common shares. Through December 31, 2004, the
Company has repurchased and retired approximately 1.9 million shares of common stock for a cost of approximately $42 million at an average price per

Employee Benefit Plans

401 (k) Savings Plan

The Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. 401(k)
Savings Plan is a defined contribution plan that satisfies the requirements of Section 401(a) and 401(k) of the Code. The Company may, but is not
obligated to, make a matching contribution of $0.50 for each $1.00 contributed, up to 6% of the participant’s compensation. The Company’s
contribution to this plan was $330,000, $251,000, and $262,000 in 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively.

Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Retirement Plan

The Company has adopted a non-qualified deferred
compensation retirement plan for key employees who are not qualified for participation in the Company’s 401(k) Savings Plan. Under the terms of
the plan, employees may elect to defer a percentage of their compensation and the Company matches a portion of their salary deferral. The plan is
designed so that the employees’ investment earnings under the non-qualified plan should be the same as the earning assets in the Company’s
401(k) Savings Plan. The Company’s match to this plan in 2004, 2003, and 2002 was $30,400, $23,700, and $24,200, respectively.

Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan for Outside Company
Directors

The Company has adopted a non-qualified deferred
compensation plan for the outside directors who serve on the Board of Directors of the Company (the “Directors Deferred Compensation Plan”).
The Directors Deferred Compensation Plan allows directors to receive shares of phantom stock in place of cash fees in increments of 25%. The phantom
stock is then issued either in shares of common stock of the Company or in a comparable cash value in two annual installments following the
director’s retirement from the Board of Directors. In 2004, 2003, and 2002, the Company issued 5,931, 7,879, and 6,078 shares of phantom stock,
respectively, to outside directors.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

The Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. Employee
Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”) provides a means for employees to purchase common stock of the Company. The Board of Directors has
authorized the issuance of 150,000 shares for the plan. The ESPP is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors who may
annually grant options to employees to purchase annually up to an aggregate of

F-19

15,000 shares of common stock at a price equal
to 85% of the market price of the common stock. For 2004, 2003, and 2002, the ESPP purchased 4,801, 5,162, and 4,368 shares of common stock,
respectively.

Employee Stock Ownership Plan

The Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. Employee
Stock Ownership Plan (the “ESOP”) is a non-contributory stock bonus plan that satisfies the requirements of Section 401(a) of the Internal
Revenue Code. Each employee of the Company is eligible to participate in the ESOP after attaining the age of 21 years and completing one year of
service with the Company. Participants’ ESOP accounts will be 100% vested after five years of continuous service, with no vesting prior to that
time. The Company contributed 22,500 shares of common stock to the ESOP upon conclusion of the initial offering. During 2004, 2003 and 2002, the
Company contributed approximately $554,000, $568,000, and $570,000, respectively, to the ESOP which purchased an additional 15,104, 20,489, and 22,493
shares of common stock, respectively.

Stock Option Plan

The Company adopted the 1994 Restricted Stock and
Stock Option Plan (the “1994 Plan”) to provide incentives to attract and retain independent directors, executive officers and key employees.
As of January 31, 2004, no further awards may be granted under this plan. The 1994 Restricted Stock and Stock Option Plan was replaced by the 2004
Stock Plan (collectively the “Plans”) by shareholder approval at the May 24, 2004 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The Plans provide(d) for
the granting of options to purchase a specified number of shares of common stock (“Options”) or grants of restricted shares of common stock
(“Restricted Stock”). The Plan also allow(ed) the Company to grant options to purchase Operating Partnership Units at the price of the common
stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the day prior to issuance of the units (the “LESOP Provision”). The 1994 Plan authorized the issuance
of 2,400,000 common shares or options to acquire shares. The 2004 Stock Plan authorizes the issuance of 500,000 common shares or options to acquire
shares. Under the terms of the 1994 Plan, the Company could advance directors, executive officers, and key employees a portion of the cost of the
common stock or units. The employee advances mature five years from the date of issuance and accrue interest, payable in arrears, at a rate established
at the date of issuance. The Company has also entered into supplemental bonus agreements with the employees which are intended to fund the payment of a
portion of the advances over a five year period. Under the terms of the supplemental bonus agreements, the Company will pay bonuses to these employees
equal to 3% of the original note balance on each anniversary date of the advance, limited to 15% of the aggregate purchase price of the shares and
units. In March of 2002, the Company entered into duplicate supplemental bonus agreements on the then existing options to executive officers,
effectively doubling their advances. The advances become due and payable and the bonus agreement will terminate if the employees voluntarily terminate
their employment with the Company. The Company also agreed to pay a bonus to certain executive officers in an amount equal to the debt service on the
advances for as long as they remain employed by the Company.

As of December 31, 2004, the Company had advances
outstanding relating to the Plan totaling approximately $1,147,000, which is presented as a reduction to shareholders’ equity in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets. Advances to current and one former executive officers totaled approximately $1,145,000 at interest rates ranging from
5.59%–6.49% and maturing at various dates from 2005 to 2010. Amounts for key employees consisted of one advance for approximately $2,000 at an
interest rate of 8.0% maturing in November 2005.

In 2003, the Company issued 7,471 restricted shares
of common stock to executive management. These shares vested in 2004. Recipients received dividend payments on the shares of restricted stock prior to
vesting.

In 2002, the Company issued 97,881 restricted shares
of common stock to key managers. As a result of two managers leaving the employment of the Company, as of December 31, 2004, only 86,477 shares remain
issued. These shares will vest 20% a year for five consecutive years beginning in 2007. Recipients receive dividend payments on the shares of
restricted stock prior to vesting.

In 2000, the Company issued 10,750 restricted shares
of common stock to executive officers. These shares vest 10% each over ten years through 2010. The executive officers have the option to accelerate the
vesting in lieu of bonuses. As of December 31, 2004, no shares have been vested early. Recipients receive dividend payments on the shares of restricted
stock prior to vesting.

Long-Term Performance Based Incentive Plan for Executive Officers

The Compensation Committee by authorization of the
Board of Directors of the Company submitted the Long-Term Performance Based Incentive Plan for Executive Officers (the “Long-Term Plan”)
which was approved by shareholders on June 2, 2003. The Long-Term Plan allows executive management to earn performance units that convert into shares
of restricted stock based on achieving defined total shareholder investment performance levels. The potential award of performance units which convert
into shares of restricted stock is based on the Company’s performance from January 1, 2003 through December 31, 2005. Any performance units earned
will be granted on December 31, 2005 and are immediately convertible into shares of restricted stock. While these shares of restricted stock will be
entitled to dividend payments, they will not be transferable or have voting privileges until they vest. Dependent upon the executive officer’s
continued employment with the Company, any shares of restricted stock awarded will vest 20% annually from 2006 through 2010.

Derivative Financial Instruments

In the normal course of business, the Company uses
certain derivative financial instruments to manage, or hedge, the interest rate risk associated with the Company’s variable rate debt or as hedges
in anticipation of future debt transactions to manage well-defined interest rate risk associated with the transaction.

The Company does not use derivative financial
instruments for speculative or trading purposes. Further, the Company has a policy of entering into contracts with major financial institutions based
upon their credit rating and other factors. When viewed in conjunction with the underlying and offsetting exposure that the derivatives are designated
to hedge, the Company has not sustained any material loss from those instruments nor does it anticipate any material adverse effect on its net income
or financial position in the future from the use of derivatives.

The Company requires that derivative financial
instruments designated as cash flow hedges be effective in reducing the interest rate risk exposure that they are designated to hedge. This
effectiveness is essential for qualifying for hedge accounting. Instruments that meet the hedging criteria are formally designated as hedging
instruments at the inception of the derivative contract. The Company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items,
as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction. This process includes linking all derivatives that are
designated as fair-value or cash flow hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific firm commitments or forecasted
transactions. The Company also formally assesses, both at the inception of the hedging relationship and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives
used are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. When it is determined that a derivative has ceased to be
a highly effective hedge, the Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively.

All of the Company’s derivative financial
instruments are recorded at fair value and reported on the balance sheet, and are characterized as cash flow hedges. These transactions hedge the
future cash flows of debt transactions through interest rate swaps that convert variable payments to fixed payments and interest rate caps that limit
the exposure to rising interest rates. The unrealized gains/losses in the fair value of these hedging instruments are reported on the balance sheet
with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income, with any ineffective portion of the hedging transactions reclassified to
earnings. During the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, the ineffective portion of the hedging transactions was not significant.

F-22

The Company has twelve interest rate swaps
designated against the FNMA Facility with a total notional balance of $390 million which have variable legs based on one or three-month Libor, and
fixed legs with an average rate of 5.9%. The swaps have expirations between 2005 and 2012, and have to date proven to be highly effective hedges of the
Company’s variable rate debt. Through the use of these swaps the Company believes it has effectively fixed the rate during these periods of $390
million of variable rate borrowings issued through the FNMA Facility. The Company also has seven interest rate swaps with a total notional balance of
$53 million based on the BMA Municipal Swap Index, which expire in 2007 through 2009, effectively fixing the interest rate of $53 million of the
Tax-Free Bond Facility at 4.1% through this period. The Company also entered into three cap agreements with a total notional amount of $22.6 million
within the Tax-Free Bond Facility. The cap agreements with expirations in 2007 and 2009, have strike rates of 6% as indexed on the BMA Municipal Swap
Index. Additionally, the Company has one interest rate swap with a notional amount of $25 million which has a variable leg based on three-month LIBOR,
and a fixed leg with an interest rate of 4.0% which expires in 2009 and three interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $51 million which
have variable legs based on three-month LIBOR, and fixed legs with an average rate of 5.3% which expire in 2011.

The Company has also executed one forward interest
rate swap with a notional balance of $50 million which becomes operative in 2005. The variable leg of the forward interest rate swap is based on
three-month Libor and the fixed leg has an average rate of 5.2%. The swap expires in 2012 and is designated as a cash flow hedge on the FNMA
Facility.

At December 31, 2004 all of these interest rate
swaps and interest rate caps were designated as cash flow hedges in accordance with Statement No. 133 as amended and have a net liability fair value of
$14.6 million recorded in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet and an asset fair value of $66,000 recorded in other
assets in the consolidated balance sheet, respectively.

Related Party Transactions

Pursuant to management contracts with the
Company’s joint ventures, the Company manages the operations of the joint ventures apartment communities for a fee of 4% of the revenues of the
joint ventures. The Company received approximately $582,000, $822,000, and $775,000 as management fees from the joint ventures in 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.

The Company earns interest on a $4.5 million loan to
CH/Realty at an average interest rate of 9%.

The Company has certain advances to current and one
former executive officer and to one key employee through the 1994 Plan as discussed in Note 8.

12.

Segment Information

At December 31, 2004, the Company owned or had an
ownership interest in 132 multifamily apartment communities, including the apartment communities owned by the Company’s joint ventures, in 12
different states from which it derives all significant sources of earnings and operating cash flows. The Company’s operational structure is
organized on a decentralized basis, with individual property managers having overall responsibility and authority regarding the operations of their
respective properties. Each property manager individually monitors local and area trends in rental rates, occupancy percentages, and operating costs.
Property managers are given the on-site responsibility and discretion to react to such trends in the best interest of the Company. The Company’s
chief operating decision maker evaluates the performance of each individual property based on its contribution to net operating income in order to
ensure that the individual property continues to meet the Company’s return criteria and long term investment goals. The Company defines each of
its multifamily communities as an individual operating segment. It has also determined that all of its communities have similar economic
characteristics and also meet the other criteria which permit the communities to be aggregated into one reportable segment, which is acquisition and
operation of the multifamily communities owned.

The revenues, net operating income, assets and real
estate investment capital expenditures for the aggregated multifamily segment are summarized as follows for the years ended as of December 31,
2004,

F-23

2003 and 2002 (Dollars in 000’s): For
purposes of this disclosure, multifamily revenues, net operating income and real estate assets include amounts related to the properties owned by the
unconsolidated joint ventures and properties classified as held for sale.
