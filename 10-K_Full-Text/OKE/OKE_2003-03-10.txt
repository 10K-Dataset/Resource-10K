2002 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K

As used in this Annual
Report on Form 10-K, the terms “we”, “our” or “us” mean ONEOK, Inc., an Oklahoma corporation, and its predecessors and subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise.



PART I.

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

General

ONEOK, Inc., an Oklahoma corporation, was organized on May
16, 1997. On November 26, 1997, we acquired the natural gas business of Westar Energy Corp. (formerly Western Resources, Inc.) and merged with ONEOK Inc., a Delaware corporation organized in 1933. We are the successor to a company founded in 1906 as
Oklahoma Natural Gas Company.

ONEOK is a diversified energy
company. We purchase, gather, process, transport, store, and distribute natural gas. We drill for and produce oil and natural gas, extract, sell and market natural gas liquids, and are engaged in the natural gas, crude oil and natural gas liquids
marketing and trading business. We also own and operate an electric generating plant and engage in wholesale marketing of electricity. Our energy marketing and trading operations provide service to customers throughout most of the United States. We
are the largest natural gas distributor in Kansas and Oklahoma and, following the acquisition of the Texas properties of Southern Union Company discussed below, the third largest gas distributor in Texas.

On January 28, 2003, we issued 12 million shares of common stock at the public
offering price of $17.19 per share, resulting in net proceeds to us, after underwriting discounts and commissions, of $16.524 per share, or $198.3 million in the aggregate. We granted the underwriters a 30-day over-allotment option to purchase up to
an additional 1.8 million shares of our common stock at the same price, which was exercised on February 7, 2003, at the same price per share, resulting in additional net proceeds to us of $29.7 million.

Also, on January 28, 2003, we issued 14 million equity units at a public
offering price of $25 per unit, resulting in net proceeds to us, after underwriting discounts and commissions, of $24.25 per share, or $339.5 million in the aggregate. An over-allotment option allowing the purchase of an additional 2.1 million
equity units was exercised on January 31, 2003, increasing the net proceeds to $390.4 million. Each equity unit consists of a stock purchase contract for the purchase of shares of our common stock and, initially, a senior note due February 16, 2008,
issued pursuant to our existing Indenture with SunTrust Bank, as trustee. The equity units carry a total annual coupon rate of 8.5% (4.0% annual face amount of the senior notes plus 4.5% annual contract adjustment payments). Each stock purchase
contract issued as a part of the equity units carries a maximum conversion premium of up to 20 percent over the $17.19 closing price of our common stock on January 22, 2003, and a floor of $17.19 per share.

The net proceeds from the sale of the equity units will be allocated between
the stock purchase contracts and the senior notes in proportion to their respective fair market values at the time of issuance. The present value of the equity units contract adjustment payments will be initially charged to shareholders’
equity, with an offsetting credit to liabilities. This liability is accreted over three years by interest charges to the income statement based on a constant rate calculation. Subsequent contract adjustment payments reduce this liability. The
purchase contracts are forward contracts in our common stock. Upon settlement of each purchase contract, we will receive $25 on the purchase contract and will issue the requisite number of shares of our common stock. The $25 that we receive will be
credited to shareholders’ equity.

In February 2003, $300
million of the proceeds from these offerings was used to repurchase approximately 9 million shares (approximately 18.1 million shares of common stock equivalents) of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock from Westar. The remaining 10.9 million
shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock owned by Westar were exchanged for approximately 21.8 million shares of ONEOK’s $0.925 Series D Convertible Preferred Stock. The Series A Convertible Preferred Stock was convertible into two shares
of common stock, reflecting the two-for-one stock split in 2001, and the Series D Convertible Preferred stock is convertible into one share of common stock.

Definitions

Following are definitions of abbreviations used in this Form 10-K:



Acquisitions and
Sales

Our business strategy is focused on the maximization
of shareholder value by vertically integrating our natural gas business operations from the wellhead to the burner tip. We expect to continue evaluating and assessing acquisition opportunities to further complement our existing asset base. We also,
from time to time, sell assets when deemed less strategic or as other conditions warrant.

Sale of Production Assets

– On January 31, 2003, we closed the sale of approximately 70 percent of the natural gas and oil producing properties of our production segment to Chesapeake Energy Corporation for a
cash sales price of approximately $300 million, subject to adjustment. The effective date of the sale was November 30, 2002. The sale included approximately 1,900 wells, 482 of which we operated. We recorded a pretax gain of approximately $74.4
million in the first quarter of 2003 related to this sale. The statistical and financial information related to the properties sold are reflected as a discontinued component in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. All periods presented have been
restated to reflect the discontinued component.

Acquisition
of Texas Properties of Southern Union Company

– On January 3, 2003, we closed the purchase of all of the Texas assets of Southern Union Company (Southern Union) for a cash purchase price of approximately $420 million, subject to a working
capital adjustment to be determined within 90 days of the closing of the transaction. The acquisition makes us the fifth largest gas distributor in the U.S. with almost two million customers in Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas. The assets acquired consist
of the third largest gas distribution business in Texas, with operations that serve approximately 535,000 customers, over 90 percent of which are residential. Approximately 735 employees were added to our workforce as part of the acquisition.

Sale of Midstream Natural Gas Assets

– On December
13, 2002, we closed the sale of some of our midstream natural gas assets for a cash sales price of approximately $92 million to an affiliate of Mustang Fuel Corporation, a private, independent oil and gas company. The assets that were sold are
located in north central Oklahoma and include three natural gas processing plants and related gathering systems and our interest in a fourth natural gas processing plant. The sale of these assets is part of our strategy to dispose of assets that are
not considered core assets for our future.

Sale of Investment
in Magnum Hunter Resources

– In the second quarter of 2002, we sold our remaining shares of common stock of Magnum Hunter Resources (MHR) for a pre-tax gain of approximately $7.6 million, which is included in other income for the year ended
December 31, 2002. We retained approximately 1.5 million common stock purchase warrants.

Sale of Investment in K. Stewart Petroleum Corporation

– In June 2001, we sold our forty percent interest in K. Stewart Petroleum Corporation (K. Stewart), a privately held exploration company, for a sales price
of $7.7 million.

Acquisition of Kinder Morgan, Inc.
Assets

– In April 2000, we acquired certain natural gas gathering and processing assets located in Oklahoma, Kansas and western Texas from Kinder Morgan, Inc. (KMI) and certain of its affiliates. We also acquired KMI’s marketing and
trading operations, as well as some storage and transmission pipelines in the mid-continent region. We paid approximately $123.5 million for these assets. We also assumed certain liabilities including an uneconomic lease obligation related to an
operating lease for a processing plant and some firm capacity lease obligations to unaffiliated parties with out-of-market terms. This acquisition included more than 12,000 miles of gathering and transportation pipeline,



natural gas processing plants
with capacity of 1.26 Bcf/d and storage facilities with a combined capacity of approximately 10 Bcf. Approximately 350 employees were added to our workforce as part of the acquisition.

Acquisition of Dynegy, Inc. Assets

– In March 2000, we acquired natural gas processing plants with an approximate
capacity of 375 MMcf/d and approximately 7,000 miles of gas gathering and transmission pipeline systems in Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas from Dynegy, Inc. (Dynegy). We paid approximately $305 million for these assets. Approximately 75 employees were
added to our workforce as part of the acquisition. The majority of these employees are in field operations in western Oklahoma, the Texas panhandle and southern Kansas.

Sale of Indian Basin Gas Processing Plant

– In 2000, we sold our 42.4 percent partnership interest in the Indian
Basin Gas Processing Plant and gathering system for a sales price of $55 million to El Paso Field Services Company, a business unit of El Paso Energy Corporation, resulting in a gain of approximately $26.7 million.

Business Segments

We report operations in the following reportable segments:

•

Marketing and Trading

•

Gathering and Processing

•

Transportation and Storage

•

Distribution

•

Production

•

Other

Marketing and Trading

– Our Marketing and Trading segment conducts its business through ONEOK Energy Marketing and Trading Company (OEMT) and its subsidiaries. OEMT is actively engaged in
value creation through marketing and trading of natural gas to both wholesale and retail customers throughout the United States using leased gas storage and firm transportation capacity from related parties and others. We have executed an integrated
wholesale energy business strategy based on expanding our existing marketing, trading and arbitrage opportunities in the natural gas and power markets. The combination of owning or controlling strategic assets and having a trusted, reliable
marketing franchise allows us to capture volatility in the energy markets.

We primarily conduct our operations in the mid-continent region of the U.S. However, acquisitions during 2000 allowed us to expand our marketing and trading presence from border to border and coast to coast.

OEMT was the successful bidder to supply gas to Oklahoma Natural Gas Company
(ONG), an affiliated company, for its gas sales requirements for five years beginning in November 2000. In response, we entered into firm supply arrangements with major producers and large independents that average in length from two to five years.

In the first quarter of 2002, our Power segment was combined
into our Marketing and Trading segment, eliminating the Power segment. This reflects our strategy of trading around the capacity of the electric generating plant. All segment data has been restated to reflect this change.

Gathering and Processing

– Our Gathering and Processing segment
gathers and processes natural gas and fractionates, stores and markets NGLs primarily through its subsidiaries, ONEOK Field Services Company (OFS) and ONEOK NGL Marketing L.P. (NGL Marketing). These activities are conducted primarily in Oklahoma,
Kansas and Texas.

Transportation and Storage

– Our
Transportation and Storage segment provides natural gas transportation, storage, and nonprocessable gas gathering services. These operations are primarily conducted through Mid Continent Market Center, Inc. (MCMC), ONEOK Gas Transportation, L.L.C.
(OGT), ONEOK WesTex Transmission, L.P. (WesTex), ONEOK Gas Storage, L.L.C. (OGS), ONEOK Sayre Storage Company (Sayre), ONEOK Texas Gas Storage L.P. (OTGS) and ONEOK Gas Gathering, L.L.C. (OGG). Acquisitions in 2000 expanded our transmission and
storage operations into Texas with the acquisition of OTGS and WesTex. The Texas Railroad Commission (TRC) regulates both OTGS and WesTex. OGS and Sayre operate under market-based rate authority granted by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
(FERC). In a May 2000 Oklahoma Corporation Commission (OCC) Order, OGT became a separate regulated utility from the Distribution segment and its operations are regulated by the OCC. MCMC’s operations continue to be regulated by the Kansas
Corporation Commission (KCC). In October 2001, OGG was created by merging the gathering assets of OGT with ONEOK Producer Services, L.L.C. In July 2002, we completed a transaction to transfer certain transmission assets in Kansas to our affiliated
distribution company in Kansas. All historical financial and statistical information has been adjusted to reflect this



transfer. In December 2002, we
sold Sayre’s property rights and entered into a long-term agreement with the purchaser whereby we retain working storage capacity consistent with our historical usage.

Distribution

– Our Distribution segment provides natural gas distribution in Oklahoma and Kansas and interstate
transportation across the Oklahoma/Texas border. Our distribution operations in Oklahoma and Kansas are conducted through ONG and Kansas Gas Service (KGS), respectively, both divisions of ONEOK, Inc., which serve residential, commercial, and
industrial customers. ONG is regulated by the OCC and KGS is regulated by the KCC. The Distribution segment serves approximately 80 percent of Oklahoma’s population and 75 percent of Kansas’ population.

Production

– Our Production segment produces natural gas and oil
primarily in Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas through ONEOK Resources Company. The Production segment’s strategy is to acquire and develop properties and maximize value by producing the properties or divesting the properties at attractive prices. In
November 2002, we entered into an agreement to sell approximately 70 percent of our proved properties for $300 million before adjustments. The properties sold are reflected as discontinued operations at December 31, 2002. The sale was completed on
January 31, 2003. The financial and statistical information for all periods presented has been restated to reflect the discontinued operations presentation. During 2002, we participated in drilling 117 wells of which 92 were gas, 15 were oil and 10
were dry holes. We retained 38 of the wells we participated in drilling in 2002, of which 25 were gas, 7 were oil and 6 were dry holes. We sold 79 of the wells we participated in drilling, of which 67 were gas, 8 were oil and 4 were dry holes.

Other

– The primary companies in our Other segment
include ONEOK Leasing Company and ONEOK Parking Company. ONEOK Leasing Company leases, from an unaffiliated partnership, and operates our headquarters office building. ONEOK Parking Company owns and operates a parking garage adjacent to our
corporate headquarters.

Segment Financial Information

– For financial and statistical information regarding our business units by segment, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note O of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Environmental Matters

We have 12 manufactured gas sites located in Kansas, which may contain
potentially harmful materials that are classified as hazardous material. Hazardous materials are subject to control or remediation under various environmental laws and regulations. A consent agreement with the Kansas Department of Health and
Environment (KDHE) presently governs all future work at these sites. The terms of the consent agreement allow us to investigate these sites and set remediation priorities based upon the results of the investigations and risk analysis. Remedial
investigation has commenced on four sites. However, a comprehensive study is not complete and the results to date do not provide a sufficient basis for a reasonable estimation of the total liability. The liability accrued is reflective of an
estimate of the total cost of remedial investigation and feasibility study. Through December 31, 2002, the costs of the investigations and risk analysis related to these manufactured gas sites have been immaterial. The site situations are not common
and we have no previous experience with similar remediation efforts. The information currently available estimates the cost of remediation from $100,000 to $10 million per site based on a limited comparison of costs incurred by others to remediate
comparable sites. As such, the information provides an insufficient basis to reasonably estimate a minimum range of our liability. These estimates do not give effect to potential insurance recoveries, recoveries through rates or from unaffiliated
parties. At this time, we are not recovering any environmental amounts in rates. The KCC has permitted others to recover remediation costs through rates. It should be noted that additional information and testing could result in costs significantly
below or in excess of the amounts estimated above. To the extent that such remediation costs are not recovered, the costs could be material to our results of operations and cash flows depending on the remediation done and number of years over which
the remediation is completed.

Our expenditures for environmental
evaluation and remediation have not been significant in relation to the results of operations. There have been no material effects upon earnings or our competitive position during 2002 related to compliance with environmental regulations.

Employees

We employed 3,593 persons at December 31, 2002. The acquisition of the Texas
assets of Southern Union added approximately 735 employees to our workforce in 2003. We did not experience any strikes or work stoppages during 2002. KGS employed 844 people who were subject to collective bargaining contracts as of December 31,
2002. The following table sets forth our contracts with unions at December 31, 2002:

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS SEGMENTS

Marketing and Trading

General

– We are engaged in the marketing and trading of natural gas to retail and wholesale customers throughout most of the United States. Due to expanded supply, storage capabilities, and recent acquisitions, we market gas from border to border and
coast to coast. We have also diversified our marketing and trading portfolio to include power, crude oil and natural gas liquids.

Operating income from the Marketing and Trading segment, including a $37.4 million charge related to Enron in 2001 as discussed in the Liquidity section,
is 48.9 percent, 29.3 percent, and 15.8 percent of the consolidated operating income from continuing operations for fiscal years 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. The Marketing and Trading segment has no single external customer from which it
receives ten percent or more of consolidated revenues.

We engage
in price risk management activities for both energy trading and non-trading purposes. We account for price risk management activities for our energy trading contracts in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 98-10, “Accounting
for Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities” (EITF 98-10). EITF 98-10 requires entities involved in energy trading activities to account for energy trading contracts using mark-to-market accounting. Forwards, swaps, options, and energy
transportation and storage contracts utilized for trading activities are reflected at fair value as assets and liabilities from price risk management activities in the consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of these assets and liabilities is
affected by the actual timing of settlements related to these contracts and current period changes resulting primarily from newly originated transactions and the impact of price movements. Changes in fair value are recognized in energy trading
revenues, net, in the consolidated statements of income. Market prices used to determine fair value of these assets and liabilities reflect management’s best estimate considering various factors including closing exchange and over-the-counter
quotations, time value and volatility underlying the commitments. Market prices are adjusted for the potential impact of liquidating our position in an orderly manner over a reasonable period of time under present market conditions.

During the third quarter of 2002, we adopted the applicable provisions of
Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 02-3, “Issues Involved in Accounting for Derivative Contracts Held for Trading Purposes and Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities” (EITF 02-3). EITF 02-3 provides that all
mark-to-market gains and losses on energy trading



contracts should be presented on a net basis (energy contract sales less energy contract costs) in the
income statement without regard to the settlement provisions of the contract. Prior to the third quarter of 2002, energy trading revenues and costs were presented on a gross basis. The financial results of all energy trading contracts have been
restated to reflect the adoption of this provision of EITF 02-3. Energy trading revenues include natural gas, reservation fees, crude oil, natural gas liquids, and basis. Basis is the natural gas price differential that exists between two trading
locations relative to the Henry Hub price.

In October 2002, the
Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) rescinded EITF 98-10. As a result, energy-related contracts that are not accounted for pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133,
“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (Statement 133), will no longer be carried at fair value but rather will be accounted for on an accrual basis as executory contracts. As a result of the rescission of this
statement, the Task Force also agreed that energy trading inventories carried under storage agreements should no longer be carried at fair value but should be carried at the lower of cost or market.

The rescission is effective for all fiscal periods beginning after December
31, 2002 and for all existing energy trading contracts and inventory as of October 25, 2002. Additionally, the rescission applies immediately to contracts entered into on or after October 25, 2002. Changes to the accounting for existing contracts as
a result of the rescission of EITF 98-10 will be reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle on January 1, 2003. At this time, we estimate this will result in a cumulative effect loss, net of tax, of approximately $141.0
million. Any impact from this change will be non-cash. All recoveries of the estimated value associated with this change in accounting will be recognized in operating income in future periods. The impact of adopting the rescission of EITF 98-10 will
be included in our March 31, 2003 financial statements.

The
Marketing and Trading segment’s gas in storage inventory is recorded at fair value and is included in current price risk management assets.

Market Conditions and Business Seasonality

– In response to a very competitive marketing and trading environment resulting from continued
deregulation of the retail natural gas markets and the restructuring of the U.S. retail and wholesale electricity markets, our strategy is to concentrate our efforts on capitalizing on short-term pricing volatility through marketing, trading and
arbitrage opportunities provided by leasing or ownership of storage, generation and transportation assets. We focus on building and strengthening supplier and customer relationships to execute our strategy. Our strategy has also benefited from
overall market conditions generated from large energy merchant and trading operations becoming under capitalized and having lower credit quality.

The Marketing and Trading segment’s net revenues are subject to fluctuations during the year primarily due to the impact certain seasonal factors
have on sales volumes and the price of natural gas, electricity, crude oil and natural gas liquids. Natural gas sales volumes are typically higher in the winter heating months than in the summer months, reflecting increased demand due to greater
heating requirements and, typically, higher natural gas prices that occur during the winter heating months.

Price Risk Management

– In order to mitigate the risks associated with energy trading activities, we manage our portfolio of contracts and its assets in order to maximize value, minimize
the associated risks and provide overall liquidity. In doing so, we use price risk management instruments, including swaps, options, futures and physical commodity-based contracts to manage exposures to market price movements. See Item 7A.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk and Note D of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

Gathering and Processing

General

– Our Gathering and Processing segment is engaged in the gathering and processing of natural gas and the fractionation, storage and
marketing of NGLs. We have a processing capacity of approximately 1.993 Bcf/d, of which approximately 0.107 Bcf/d is currently idle. The remaining capacity associated with plants owned or leased is approximately 1.776 Bcf/d, while the amount of the
plant capacity that we own an interest in but do not operate is approximately 0.110 Bcf/d. We own approximately 13,962 miles of gathering pipelines that supply our gas processing plants.

Operating income from the Gathering and Processing segment is 8.9 percent, 17.0 percent, and 34.2 percent of the consolidated
operating income from continuing operations in 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. The Gathering and Processing segment has no single external customer from which it receives ten percent or more of consolidated revenues.

The gas processing operation includes the extraction of NGLs from natural gas
and the fractionation (separation) of mixed NGLs into component products (ethane, propane, iso butane, normal butane and natural gasoline). We also extract helium,



from time to time, at two of our plants located in Kansas. The NGL component products are used by and sold
to a diverse customer base of end users for petrochemical feedstock, residential uses, and blending into motor fuels. The gathering operation, which connects unaffiliated and affiliated producing wells to the processing plants, consists of the
gathering of natural gas through pipeline systems, including compression and dehydration services.

We generally process gas under three types of contracts. Under our “percent of proceeds” (POP) contracts, the producer is paid a percentage of the market value of the natural gas and NGLs
that are processed. Our “keep whole” contracts allow us to replace the Btu’s extracted as NGLs with equivalent Btu’s of natural gas, which keeps the producer whole on Btu’s and allows us to retain and sell the NGLs. Under
“fee” contracts, we are paid a cash fee for gas processing.

During 2002, we processed an average of 1,411 MMMBtu/d of natural gas and produced an average of 72.8 MBbls/d of NGLs. We market our NGL production through ONEOK NGL Marketing and also purchase NGLs from third parties for resale.
During 2002, we sold approximately 95.4 MBbls/d of NGLs to a diverse base of customers.

Market Conditions and Business Seasonality

– During the year, both crude oil and natural gas prices were volatile with NYMEX crude prices ranging from $18.34 to $30.11 per barrel and NYMEX natural gas prices
ranging from $2.01 to $4.14 per MMBtu. The continued weak economy reduced the demand for many NGL products, particularly ethane and propane, which are major components of plastic products.

Despite significant consolidation in the recent past, the U.S. midstream industry remains relatively fragmented and faces
competition from a variety of companies including major integrated oil companies, major pipeline companies and their affiliated marketing companies, and national and local gas gatherers, processors and marketers. Competition exists for obtaining gas
supplies for gathering and processing operations, obtaining supplies of raw product for fractionation and the transportation of natural gas and NGLs. The factors that affect competition typically arise as a result of the efficiency and reliability
of the operations, price and delivery capabilities.

We have
responded to these industry conditions by acquiring assets, most of which are strategically located near our existing assets, reducing costs, rationalizing assets in non-core operating areas and renegotiating unprofitable contracts. The principal
goal of these efforts is to mitigate the variability of earnings and cash flow caused by fluctuations in commodity prices.

The Gathering and Processing segment is subject to seasonality. Products are used for heating and are normally more in demand during the months of
November through March. Accordingly, the prices of these products are typically higher in the winter.

Acquisitions and Divestitures

– In December 2002, we completed the sale of three processing plants and related gathering assets, along with our interest in a fourth processing plant, all
located in Oklahoma, to an affiliate of Mustang Fuel Corporation. These plants had a processing capacity of 0.136 Bcf/d. The sale also included approximately 2,800 miles of gathering pipelines that supply our gas processing plants.

In April 2000, we acquired certain natural gas gathering and processing assets
from KMI. This acquisition included natural gas processing plants with a capacity of approximately 1.26 Bcf/d and 6,400 miles of gathering lines. In March 2000, we acquired natural gas processing plants with a capacity of approximately 375 MMcf/d
and approximately 7,000 miles of gas gathering and transmission pipeline systems from Dynegy.

Government Regulation

– The FERC has traditionally maintained that a processing plant is not a facility for transportation or sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce and
therefore is not subject to jurisdiction under the Natural Gas Act (NGA). Although the FERC has made no specific declaration as to the jurisdictional status of our gas processing operations or facilities, our gas processing plants are primarily
involved in removing natural gas liquids and therefore, we believe, are exempt from FERC jurisdiction. The NGA also exempts natural gas gathering facilities from the jurisdiction of the FERC. Interstate transmission facilities, on the other hand,
remain subject to FERC jurisdiction. The FERC has historically distinguished between these two types of facilities on a fact-specific basis. We believe our gathering facilities and operations meet the criteria used by the FERC to determine a
non-jurisdictional gathering facility status. We can transport residue gas from our plants to interstate pipelines in accordance with Section 311(a) of the Natural Gas Policy Act (NGPA).

The states of Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas also have statutes regulating, in various degrees, the gathering of gas in those
states. In each state, regulation is applied on a case-by-case basis if a complaint is filed against the gatherer with the appropriate state regulatory agency.



Risk Management

–
Derivative instruments are used to minimize volatility in NGL and natural gas prices. Accordingly, we, at times, use derivative instruments to hedge the purchase and sale of natural gas used for or produced by our operations. We also, from time to
time, use derivative instruments to secure a certain price for NGL products. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk and Note D of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Transportation and Storage

General

– Our Transportation and Storage segment provides
intrastate natural gas pipeline transportation, Section 311(a) of the NGPA interstate transportation, nonprocessable gas gathering and storage services in Oklahoma, Kansas, and Texas. We conduct this business primarily through wholly-owned
intrastate pipeline companies with approximately 7,700 miles of pipe and wholly-owned storage companies with a working storage capacity of approximately 59.6 Bcf.

In Oklahoma, we operate OGT and OGS. These companies have approximately 2,858 miles of pipeline and five storage facilities
with a combined working storage capacity of 44.6 Bcf. One of these storage facilities is leased through a long-term agreement through which we retained 3 Bcf of working storage capacity for our own use. Our Distribution segment is this
segment’s major customer for intrastate natural gas pipeline transportation in Oklahoma. Capacity in the storage facilities is leased to both OEMT and third parties under terms determined by contract or market. In December 2002, we sold
properties and as part of the transaction retained 3 Bcf of working storage capacity. A $3.4 million expansion to increase deliverability from the OGS Depew storage field was completed in the spring of 2000.

The Oklahoma transmission system transported 257.2 Bcf in 2002, 253.9 Bcf in
2001, and 299.1 Bcf in 2000. OGT provides access to the major natural gas producing areas in Oklahoma. The system intersects 11 intrastate and interstate pipelines at 27 interconnect points and connects 21 processing plants and approximately 130
producing fields, allowing gas to be moved throughout the state.

In Kansas, we operate MCMC. In July 2002, we completed a transaction to transfer certain transmission assets in Kansas from MCMC to our affiliated distribution company in Kansas. All historical financial and statistical information
has been adjusted to reflect this transfer. MCMC currently operates 204 miles of pipeline and three gas storage facilities with approximately 5.6 Bcf of working storage capacity. In January 2001, the Yaggy storage facility’s operating
parameters were changed as mandated by the KDHE following natural gas explosions and eruptions of natural gas geysers in or near Hutchinson, Kansas. This removed injection capabilities related to 3 Bcf of our Kansas working storage capacity. We are
considering the steps necessary to return the field to full service, but final steps will not be determined until the final KDHE regulations are issued, which is expected in 2003. MCMC has access to the major natural gas producing area in south
central Kansas. The system intersects four different intrastate and interstate pipelines at six interconnect points and is connected to two processing plants and associated producing fields.

In Texas, we operate WesTex and OTGS. These companies have approximately 4,701
miles of pipeline and three storage facilities. Total working storage capacity is approximately 9.4 Bcf. Both WesTex and OTGS were acquired from KMI in April 2000. The Texas transmission system transported 227.3 Bcf in 2002, 206.4 Bcf in 2001 and
170.8 Bcf in 2000. WesTex is connected to the major natural gas producing areas in the Texas Panhandle and the Permian Basin. The system intersects with a total of 11 different interstate and intrastate pipelines at 32 interconnect points and 11
natural gas processing plants and two producing fields. This system provides for gas to be moved to the Waha Hub for transportation to the east to the Houston Ship Channel market and west to the California market. This pipeline allows us to provide
service to the city of El Paso, Texas. The Loop storage facility remains operational with both injection and withdrawal capabilities. However, due to certain unresolved contractual issues, this facility is being used minimally. As a result of the
reduced utilization, we have approximately 5 Bcf less of Texas’ working storage capacity in use.

OGG operates our gathering pipelines that are connected to our transmission pipelines, including gathering systems previously owned by OGT and ONEOK Producer Services, L.L.C.

The majority of the Transportation and Storage segment’s revenues are
derived from services provided to affiliates. Operating income from the Transportation and Storage segment is 14.4 percent, 20.8 percent, and 17.6 percent of consolidated operating income from continuing operations in 2002, 2001, and 2000,
respectively. The Transportation and Storage segment has no single external customer from which it receives ten percent or more of consolidated revenues.

Market Conditions and Seasonality

– The Transportation and Storage segment primarily serves local distribution companies (LDCs), large
industrial companies and marketing companies that serve both LDCs and large industrial customers. We compete directly with other intrastate and interstate pipelines and storage facilities within each of their



respective states. Competition for transportation services continues to increase as the FERC and state
regulatory bodies introduce more competition in the natural gas markets. Factors that affect competition are location, price and quality of services provided. This industry is significantly affected by the strength of the economy and price
volatility. We believe that the working capacity of our transportation and storage assets enables us to compete effectively.

The Transportation and Storage segment is impacted by various weather conditions. Transportation quantities fluctuate due to rainfall, which impacts
irrigation demand, hot temperatures, which affect power generation demand, and cold temperatures that affect heating demand. Historically, customers have purchased and stored gas in the summer months when prices were lower and withdrew gas during
the heating season; however, increased price volatility in the natural gas market can mitigate the seasonality effect by influencing decisions relating to injection and withdrawal of natural gas in storage.

Government Regulations

– Our transportation assets in Oklahoma are
regulated by the OCC and in Kansas are regulated by the KCC. We have flexibility in establishing transportation rates with customers; however, there is a maximum rate that we can charge our customers in both states.

Our transportation and storage assets located in Texas are regulated by the
TRC. We have flexibility in establishing transportation rates with customers; however, if a rate cannot be agreed upon, the rate is established by the TRC.

In January 2001, the Yaggy storage facility’s operating parameters were changed as mandated by the KDHE following natural gas explosions and
eruptions of natural gas geysers in or near Hutchinson, Kansas. This removed injection capabilities related to 3 Bcf of our Kansas storage capacity. We are considering the steps necessary to return the field to full service, but final steps will not
be determined until the final KDHE regulations are issued, which are expected in 2003.

Customers

– The Transportation and Storage segment serves the affiliated companies of the Distribution segment and Marketing and Trading segment, as well as a number of transporters in the utilization of the
transportation and storage facilities. Each of the companies provides flexible service alternatives to serve consumers. In June 2001, we announced the execution of long-term agreements between OGT and InterGen North America (InterGen) for firm
transportation service to InterGen’s gas fueled Redbud Energy Facility near Luther, Oklahoma, in the amount of 200 MMcf/d. In June 2001, commercial operation for gas transportation began to the NRG McClain Generating Facility, which is
connected to the OGT system, for transportation volumes up to 85 MMcf/d.

Acquisitions and Divestitures

– We acquired transportation and storage assets located in Texas from KMI in April 2000. These assets are strategic assets to us, in part since they give us access to an expanded area in the
Texas and California markets. In December 2002, we sold Sayre’s property rights and entered into a long-term agreement with the purchaser whereby we retain storage capacity consistent with our original ownership position.

Distribution

General

– ONG distributes natural gas to wholesale and retail
customers located in the state of Oklahoma. At December 31, 2002, ONG delivered natural gas to approximately 809,000 customers in 327 communities in Oklahoma. ONG’s largest markets are the Oklahoma City and Tulsa metropolitan areas. ONG also
sells natural gas to other local gas distributors serving 39 Oklahoma communities. During 2000, the Oklahoma customers of KGS were removed from the KGS customer base and became ONG customers.

At December 31, 2002, KGS supplied natural gas to approximately 641,000
customers in 340 communities in Kansas. It also makes wholesale delivery to 10 customers. KGS’s largest markets served include Kansas City, Wichita, Topeka, and Johnson County, which includes Overland Park, Kansas.

Operating income from the Distribution segment is 25.6 percent, 24.0 percent,
and 32.8 percent of the consolidated operating income from continuing operations for fiscal years 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. The Distribution segment has no single external customer from which it receives ten percent or more of consolidated
revenues.

Gas Supply

– Gas supplies available to ONG
for purchase and resale include supplies of gas under both short and long-term contracts with gas marketers, independent producers and other suppliers. Oklahoma is the third largest gas producing state in the nation, and ONG has direct access
through the Transportation and Storage segment’s transmission system and transmission systems belonging to unaffiliated companies to all of the major gas producing areas in Oklahoma. Our gas storage, transportation and gathering assets were
unbundled from the utility and operate as separate entities. Gas supply and transportation contracts were awarded for service beginning in the 2000/2001 heating season for two- and five-year terms.



The two-year term contracts terminated in 2002 and were rebid to new terms of one year for gas supply and
five years for transportation. As a result of the process, the majority of ONG’s gas supply and gas transportation needs will continue to be met by two affiliates, OEMT for supply, and OGT for upstream transportation service.

ONG reserved storage capacity of 0.9 Bcf with Southern Star Central Gas
Pipeline, Inc. (Central) during 2002. Effective April 1, 2003, ONG will have two additional storage contracts with its affiliate, OGS. The first OGS contract is for 4.1 Bcf of reserved storage capacity and is the result of the settlement with the
OCC in May 2002. The second OGS contract is for 1.4 Bcf of reserved storage capacity and is the result of OGS being the successful bidder in a competitive bid process. The three contracts combined will give ONG a reserved capacity of approximately
6.4 Bcf.

KGS had 12.4 Bcf of reserved storage capacity with
Central, 0.4 Bcf of reserved storage capacity with Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Company (Panhandle) and 1.7 Bcf of reserved storage capacity with MCMC throughout 2002. Effective August 1, 2002, KGS added an additional storage contract with MCMC for
0.7 Bcf of reserved storage capacity. The four contracts combined give KGS a reserved storage capacity of approximately 15 Bcf.

KGS has a long-term gas purchase contract with Amoco Production Company (Amoco) for the purpose of meeting the requirements of the customers served over
the Central system. We anticipate that this contract will supply between 45 percent and 55 percent of KGS’s demand served by the Central pipeline system. Amoco is one of various suppliers over the Central pipeline system and if this contract
were cancelled, management believes gas supplied by Amoco could be replaced with gas from other suppliers. Gas available under the contract that exceeds the needs of our residential and commercial customer base is also available for sale to other
parties, known as “as available” gas sales.

For the
remainder of KGS’s supply, the gas is purchased from a combination of direct wellhead production, natural gas processing plants, and natural gas marketers and production companies.

KGS has transportation agreements for delivery of gas that have remaining terms varying up to 14 years with the following
non-affiliated pipeline transmission companies: Central, Enbridge Pipelines – KPC, Inc. (KPC), Kinder Morgan Interstate Gas Transmission, L.L.C., Wyoming Interstate Gas Company, Panhandle, Northern Natural Gas Company and Natural Gas Pipeline
Company of America. Additionally, approximately three percent of KGS’s transportation service is provided by MCMC and OFS, which are affiliated companies.

In 2002, KGS signed an agreement with Colorado Interstate Gas Company (CIG) for capacity on the proposed Cheyenne Plains pipeline. This pipeline will
provide KGS access to the Rocky Mountain gas supply basin, which currently has excess supply. This will facilitate KGS’s ability to maintain a reliable gas source for our current customers through a proposed interconnection with Central and the
KGS transmission system. The proposed Cheyenne Plains pipeline will originate at the Cheyenne Hub in northeast Colorado and terminate with deliveries to several pipelines in Kansas. The completion date of this pipeline is proposed for 2005. CIG must
obtain several regulatory approvals before the pipeline can be completed.

In May 2002, the KCC approved an order allowing the transfer of certain MCMC transmission pipeline assets from our Transportation and Storage segment to KGS. The operation of these assets is regulated by the KCC. The transportation
system provides access to the major natural gas producing areas in Kansas intersecting with eight intrastate and interstate pipelines at 13 interconnect points, three processing plants, and approximately three producing fields effectively allowing
gas to be moved throughout the state. With the transfer of these assets, KGS is able to provide itself with firm transportation service. The order was effective July 1, 2002. All historical financial and statistical information has been adjusted to
reflect this transfer.

KGS uses these transmission pipeline
assets to serve its customers and provide transportation service on and off-system. KGS has agreements for 2.4 Bcf of storage with MCMC, and approximately 13 Bcf of storage with non-affiliated pipeline transmission companies.

There is an adequate supply of natural gas available to our utility systems
and we do not anticipate problems with securing additional gas supply as needed for our customers. In order to ensure adequate deliveries of natural gas, KGS continues to develop new supply and transportation alternatives for meeting its existing
and future needs. However, if supply shortages occur, ONG’s rate schedule “Order of Curtailment” and the KGS rate order “Priority of Service” provide for first reducing or totally discontinuing gas service to large
industrial users and graduating down to requesting residential and commercial customers to reduce their gas requirements to an amount essential for public health and safety.



Customers

–
Residential and Commercial – ONG and KGS distribute natural gas as public utilities to approximately 80 percent of Oklahoma’s population and 75 percent of Kansas’ population. Natural gas sold to residential and commercial customers,
which is used primarily for heating and cooking, accounts for approximately 72 and 28 percent of gas sales, respectively, in Oklahoma and 76 and 24 percent of gas sales, respectively, in Kansas.

A franchise, although non-exclusive, is a right to use the municipal streets,
alleys, and other public ways for utility facilities for a defined period of time for a fee. ONG has franchises in 41 municipalities including Tulsa and Oklahoma City, while KGS holds franchises in 279 municipalities. In management’s opinion,
our franchises contain no unduly burdensome restrictions and are sufficient for the transaction of business in the manner in which it is now conducted.

Industrial

– Under ONG’s pipeline capacity lease (PCL) program, certain customers, for a fee or a tariff, can have their gas, whether
purchased from ONG or another supplier, transported to their facilities utilizing lines owned by ONG or its affiliates. KGS transports gas for large industrial customers through its End-Use Customer Transportation (ECT) program. The programs allow
qualifying industrial and commercial customers to purchase gas on the spot market and have it transported by ONG and KGS, respectively.

Because of increased competition for the transportation of gas to PCL and ECT customers, some of these customers may be lost to affiliated or unaffiliated
transporters. If the Transportation and Storage segment gained some of this business, it would result in a shift of some revenues from the Distribution segment to the Transportation and Storage segment.

Market Conditions and Business Seasonality

– The natural gas
industry is expected to remain highly competitive resulting from initiatives being pursued by the industry and regulatory agencies that allow industrial and commercial customers increased options for energy supplies. We believe that we must maintain
a competitive advantage in order to retain our customers and, accordingly, continue to focus on reducing costs.

The Distribution segment is subject to competition from electric utilities offering electricity as a rival energy source and competing for the space heating, water heating, and industrial process
markets. Alternative fuels such as propane and fuel oil also present competition. The principal means to compete against alternative fuels is lower prices, and natural gas continues to maintain its price advantage in the residential, commercial, and
both small and large industrial markets. In residential markets, the average cost of gas is less for ONG and KGS customers than the cost of an equivalent amount of electricity. We provide education to customers on safety and the benefits of natural
gas, which include product performance, price and environmental impact.

The Distribution segment is subject to competition from other pipelines for its existing industrial load. Both ONG and KGS compete for service to the large industrial and commercial customers; however, competition continues to lower
rates. A portion of ONG’s PCL services and KGS’s ECT services are at negotiated rates that are generally below the approved PCL and transportation tariff rates, and increased competition potentially could lower these rates. Industrial and
transportation sales volumes tend to remain relatively constant throughout the year.

Gas sales to residential and commercial customers are seasonal, as a substantial portion of gas is used principally for heating. Accordingly, the volume of gas sales is consistently higher during the heating season (November
through March) than in other months of the year. ONG’s tariff rates include a temperature normalization adjustment clause during the heating season, which mitigates the effect of fluctuations in weather. KGS also implemented a weather
normalization clause in December 2000, which mitigates the effect of fluctuations in weather on revenues. KGS’s WeatherProof Bill program, implemented in September 1999, is designed to mitigate the effect of weather fluctuations in Kansas for
customers electing to use this program. Additionally, with prior KCC approval, KGS has a gas hedging program in place to reduce volatility in the gas price paid by consumers. The costs of this program are borne by the KGS customers.

Government Regulation

– Rates charged for gas services are
established by the OCC for ONG and by the KCC for KGS. Gas purchase costs are included in the Purchased Gas Adjustment (PGA) clause rate that is billed to customers. We do not make a profit on the cost of gas. Other changes in costs must be
recovered through periodic rate adjustments approved by the OCC and KCC.

There were several regulatory initiatives in 2002. The highlights of these initiatives are as follows:

•

A Joint Stipulation approved by the OCC on May 16, 2002, settled a number of outstanding cases pending before the OCC. The major cases settled were the
Commission’s inquiry into our gas cost procurement practices during the



winter of 2000/2001; an application seeking relief from improper and excessive purchased gas costs; and an enforcement action against us, our subsidiaries and
affiliated companies of ONG. In addition, all of the open inquiries related to the annual audits of ONG’s fuel adjustment clause for 1996 to 2000 were closed as a result of this Stipulation.

The Joint Stipulation has a $33.7 million value to ONG customers that will be realized over a three-year period. In July 2002, immediate cash savings were provided
to all ONG customers in the form of billing credits totaling approximately $9.1 million with an additional $1.0 million available for former customers returning to our system. If the additional $1.0 million is not fully refunded to customers
returning to the ONG system by December 2005, the remainder will be included in the final billing credit. ONG has replaced certain gas contracts, which is expected to reduce gas costs by approximately $13.8 million due to avoided reservation fees
between April 2003 and October 2005. Additional savings of approximately $8.0 million from the use of storage service in lieu of those contracts are expected to occur between November 2003 and March 2005. Any expected savings from the use of storage
that are not achieved, any remaining billing credits not issued to returning customers and an additional $1.8 million credit will be added to the final billing credit scheduled to be provided to customers in December 2005. ONG operating income
increased by $14.2 million for fiscal year ended December 31, 2002 compared to the same period in 2001 as a result of this settlement and the revision of the estimated loss recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001.

•

During 2001, two regulatory causes brought before the OCC related to ONG also involved an affiliate. Both matters were settled in 2002. The first cause related to
ONG’s right to collect unrecovered purchased gas costs from the 2000/2001 winter. Under this cause, the OCC investigated whether ONG was treated fairly in its contract with OEMT and it was determined that ONG was treated fairly and, in fact,
paid less for gas than other OEMT customers. In a second cause, Enogex, Inc. requested a rebid of gas supply and transportation service awarded to OEMT in November 2001 and the OCC declined to order a rebid.

•

In Oklahoma, we initiated a Voluntary Fixed-Price Program where customers could lock in their gas price at a fixed rate from November 1, 2002 through October 31,
2003. Over 20,000 customers enrolled in the program for the 2002/2003 pilot year.

•

In January 2003, KGS filed a rate case with the KCC to increase rates approximately $76 million. The KCC has 240 days to issue a final order on the rate case. If
approved, the new rate will take effect for the 2003/2004 heating season. Until a final order is received, KGS will operate under the current rate schedule.

We have settled all known claims arising out of long-term gas supply contracts containing “take-or-pay” provisions
that purport to require us to pay for volumes of natural gas contracted for but not taken. The OCC has authorized recovery of the accumulated settlement costs over a 20-year period, expiring in 2014, or approximately $6.7 million annually through a
combination of a surcharge from customers and revenue from transportation under Section 311(a) of the NGPA and other intrastate transportation revenues. There are no significant potential claims or cases pending against us under
“take-or-pay” contracts.

OkTex transports gas in
interstate commerce under Section 311(a) of the NGPA and is treated as a separate entity by the FERC. Accordingly, OkTex is subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the FERC under the NGA with respect to rates, accounts and records, the addition of
facilities, the extension of services in some cases, the abandonment of services and facilities, the curtailment of gas deliveries and other matters. OkTex has the capacity to move up to 800 MMcf/d.

In the first quarter of 2000, the FERC issued Order No. 637, which, among
other things, imposed additional reporting requirements, required changes to make pipeline and secondary market services more comparable, removed the price caps on secondary market capacity for a period of two years, allowed rates to be based on
seasonal or term differentiated factors and narrowed the applicability of the regulatory right of first refusal to apply only to the maximum rate contracts. Our interstate pipeline implemented the new regulations in May 2000. The FERC Order did not
have a material effect on our operations.

Production

General

– Our strategy has been to concentrate
ownership of natural gas and oil reserves in the mid-continent region in order to add value not only to our existing production operations but also to integrate it into our gathering and processing, marketing and trading, and transportation and
storage businesses. We continue to focus on growing through acquisitions, developing existing properties, and divesting properties when the market offers premium value.



Operating income from the
Production segment is 2.8 percent, 7.2 percent, and 1.8 percent of the consolidated operating income from continuing operations for fiscal years 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. The Production segment has no single external customer from which it
receives ten percent or more of consolidated revenues.

Property Acquisitions and Divestitures

–We acquired $3.7 million of properties located in the mid-continent region of the U.S. during 2002 of which $2.9 million are included in continuing operations and $0.8 million are
included in the discontinued component. In November 2002, we agreed to sell approximately 70 percent of our proved properties for $300 million before adjustments. The sale was completed on January 31, 2003. The financial and statistical information
related to the sale are presented as discontinued operations. All periods presented have been restated to reflect the discontinued component.

Producing Reserves

– The Production segment primarily focuses its production activities on natural gas. We are retaining interests in 511 gas
wells and 63 oil wells, all located in Oklahoma. A number of these wells produce from multiple zones. Production from the retained oil wells increased in 2002 as compared to 2001, primarily as a result of production from new wells drilled and from
recompletions of existing wells. Production from the retained gas wells decreased in 2002 compared to 2001 as a result of the natural decline in production on existing wells. Our discontinued component has interests in 1,741 gas wells and 172 oil
wells located primarily in Oklahoma, Kansas, and Texas.

Market Conditions and Business Seasonality

– Natural gas prices during the first quarter of 2002 were at their lowest levels of the previous two years, after which gas prices increased for the remainder of the year, with
the last quarter of 2002 reaching the highest gas prices of the year. Despite the steadily increasing prices during 2002, industry-wide drilling activity was subdued and we were able to pursue our scheduled developmental drilling projects during the
first part of the year due to an adequate supply of drilling rigs. Due to our agreement to sell approximately 70 percent of our production segment properties in the latter part of the year, we limited our capital projects to only those required to
maintain our leasehold position. We continue to actively pursue acquisition opportunities as a low-risk method of adding reserves.

Our goal is to build on our existing reserve base through acquisition and development. We operate or have large interests in our retained wells. We are in
a good competitive position within our operating region due to low finding costs and high quality production at locations near transportation points and markets. During 2002, the segment’s production was sold to a number of affiliated and
unaffiliated markets, all at market prices.

Similar to our other
business segments, the Production segment is subject to seasonal factors. The Production segment’s revenues are impacted by prices, which, historically, are higher in the winter heating months when demand is higher than in the summer and
shoulder months of spring and fall. Oil prices in the U.S. are also impacted by international production and export policies.

Risk Management

– We utilized derivative instruments in 2002 in order to hedge anticipated sales of natural gas and oil production. During the
third quarter of 2002, we lifted our natural gas production hedges through December 2004 and fixed the gains for all derivative instruments used for hedges previously in place related to our natural gas production. We recognize the benefit from the
fixed gain as each contract month expires. In 2002, we recognized $3.9 million in natural gas sales revenues related to these hedges. The gains associated with these natural gas production hedges have been deferred in other comprehensive income and
will be realized in the month that the natural gas production occurs.

At December 31, 2002, the Production segment had hedged 72 percent of its anticipated gas production and 62 percent of its anticipated oil production for fiscal year 2003 at a weighted average wellhead price of $4.60 per Mcf for gas
and $27.25 per Bbl for oil. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk and Note D of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Other

Through two subsidiaries, we own a parking garage and lease an office building (ONEOK Plaza) in downtown Tulsa, Oklahoma, where our headquarters is located. The parking garage is owned and operated by
ONEOK Parking Company. ONEOK Leasing Company leases excess office space to others. The Other segment has no single external customer from which it receives ten percent or more of consolidated revenues.

On March 15, 2002, Magnum Hunter Resources (MHR) merged with Prize Energy
Corp., reducing our direct ownership to approximately 11 percent and reducing the number of positions held by us on the MHR board of directors from two to one.



We began accounting for our investment in MHR as an available-for-sale security and, accordingly, marked
the investment to fair value through other comprehensive income. During the second quarter of 2002, we sold our remaining shares of MHR common stock for a pre-tax gain of approximately $7.6 million, which is included in other income in 2002. We
retained approximately 1.5 million stock purchase warrants. We also relinquished our remaining seat on MHR’s board of directors. The MHR investment and related equity income and loss are reported in the Other segment.

Executive Officers

All executive officers are elected at the annual meeting of directors and
serve for a period of one year or until successors are duly elected.



(1)

The Energy group includes the Gathering and Processing and Transportation and Storage segments.

No family relationships exist between any of the executive officers nor is
there any arrangement or understanding between any executive officer and any other person pursuant to which the officer was selected.



ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

DESCRIPTION OF
PROPERTY

Production

We own varying economic interests, including working, royalty and overriding
royalty interests in 511 gas wells and 63 oil wells that are related to ongoing operations and 1,741 gas wells and 172 oil wells related to the discontinued component, some of which are completed in multiple producing zones. The interests in wells
retained after the sale, which closed in January 2003, are in wells located primarily in Oklahoma. We own 66,262 net onshore developed leasehold acres and 10,432 net onshore undeveloped acres, after the sale, all located in Oklahoma. The
discontinued component includes 131,068 net onshore developed acres and 31,772 net onshore undeveloped leasehold acres. We do not own any offshore acreage.

Gathering and Processing

We own and operate, lease and operate, or own an interest in natural gas processing plants in Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas with a processing capacity of
approximately 1.993 Bcf/d, of which approximately 0.107 Bcf/d is currently idle. The capacity associated with plants owned or leased is approximately 1.776 Bcf/d, while the amount of the plant capacity that we own an interest in but do not operate
is approximately 0.110 Bcf/d. We own a total of approximately 13,962 miles of gathering pipelines that supply our gas processing plants.

Our natural gas processing operations utilize two types of gas processing plants, field and straddle plants. Field plants aggregate volumes from multiple
producing wells into quantities that can be economically processed to extract natural gas liquids and to remove water vapor and other contaminants. Straddle plants are situated on mainline natural gas pipelines and allow operators to extract natural
gas liquids under contract from a natural gas stream when the market value of natural gas liquids separated from the natural gas stream is higher than the market value of the same unprocessed natural gas stream.

We own and operate or lease and operate two NGL storage facilities in Kansas.
The total capacity of the facilities is approximately 18 MMBbls. We own and operate or lease and operate two fractionation facilities in Oklahoma and Kansas. The total fractionation capacity of the two facilities is approximately 95 MBbls/d.

Transportation and Storage

We own a combined total of approximately 2,858 miles of transmission pipeline
in Oklahoma, approximately 204 miles in Kansas, and approximately 4,701 miles in Texas. Compression and dehydration facilities are located at various points throughout the pipeline system. In addition, we own four and lease one underground storage
facilities located throughout Oklahoma, own three storage facilities in Kansas and own three storage facilities in Texas. The storage facilities primarily consist of land and mineral leasehold agreements, wells and equipment, rights of way, and
cushion gas. The total working storage capacity of these facilities is approximately 59.6 Bcf, of which 9.5 Bcf is currently idle. Four of the Oklahoma storage facilities are located in close proximity to large market areas; the other storage
facility is located in western Oklahoma and is leased through a long-term agreement. We have 3 Bcf of working storage capacity in that facility for our use. The storage facilities in Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas are connected to our pipelines and are
located near unaffiliated intrastate and interstate pipelines, providing our storage customers with access to multiple markets.

Distribution

We own approximately 17,123 miles of pipeline and other distribution facilities in Oklahoma and approximately 12,223 miles of pipeline and other
distribution facilities in Kansas. We own a number of warehouses, garages, meter and regulator houses, service buildings, and other buildings throughout Oklahoma and Kansas. We also own a fleet of trucks and maintain an inventory of spare parts,
equipment, and supplies.

Lease acreage in producing units is
held by production. Leases not held by production are generally for a term of three years and may require payment of annual rentals.



Marketing and Trading

We constructed a 300-megawatt gas-fired merchant power
plant located in Logan County, Oklahoma adjacent to an affiliate’s gas storage facility. This plant is configured to supply electric power during peak periods with four gas-powered turbine generators.

Other

We own a parking garage and land, subject to a long-term ground lease. Located on this land is a seventeen-story office
building with approximately 517,000 square feet of net rentable space. We also lease our office building under a lease term that expires in 2009 with six five-year renewal options. After the primary term or any renewal period, we can purchase the
property at its fair market value. We occupy approximately 203,000 square feet for our own use and lease the remaining space to others.

OIL AND GAS RESERVES

As defined by the SEC, oil and gas production includes natural gas liquids in their natural state. Our gathering and processing operation produces natural
gas liquids. The SEC excludes the production of natural gas liquids resulting from the operations of gas processing plants as an oil and gas activity. Accordingly, the following tables exclude information concerning the production of natural gas
liquids by our processing operations.

All of the oil and gas
reserves for our Production segment are located in the United States.

For quantities of our oil and gas reserves and the present value of estimated future net revenues from our oil and gas reserves see Notes U and V of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

We report our proved reserves on our operated oil and gas properties to the
Energy Information Agency. These reported reserves are the same as the proved reserve amounts for these same properties used in our disclosures to the SEC, prior to applying the net ownership to the properties. We do not file our reserve estimates
with any other governmental agency.

Quantities of Oil and Gas
Produced

The following table sets forth the net quantities
of oil and natural gas produced and sold, including intercompany transactions for the Production segment, for the periods indicated.

Average Sales Price
and Production (Lifting) Costs

The following table sets
forth the average sales prices and production costs for our Production segment for the periods indicated.



(a)

In determining the average sales price of oil and gas, sales to affiliates were recorded on the same basis as sales to unaffiliated customers. The effect of natural
gas hedges on the average sales price is as follows: Year ended December 31, 2002, increase by $0.25 per Mcf; Year ended December 31, 2001, decrease by $0.45 per Mcf; Year ended December 31, 2000, decrease by $1.15 per Mcf and $7.90 per Bbl.

(b)

For the purpose of calculating the average production costs per Mcf equivalent, barrels of oil were converted to Mcf using six Mcfs of natural gas to one barrel of
oil. Production costs, which include production taxes, are based on the combined wellhead market price of both continuing operations and the discontinued component, which averaged $24.65 per Bbl of oil and $3.02 per Mcf of gas in 2002 and $24.89 per
Bbl of oil, $4.33 per Mcf of gas in 2001, and $29.33 per Bbl of oil and $3.43 per Mcf of gas in 2000, instead of the weighted average hedged price. Since oil is such a low percentage of our product mix, production costs are presented on an Mcfe
basis rather than an Mcf and Bbl basis. The production tax component of the historical production cost per equivalent unit is as follows: Year ended December 31, 2002, $0.21 per Mcfe; Year ended December 31, 2001, $0.28 per Mcfe; Year ended December
31, 2000, $0.23 per Mcfe.

Wells and Developed
Acreage

The following table sets forth the gross and net
wells in which the Production segment had an interest at December 31, 2002.

Gross developed acres
and net developed acres by well classification are not available. Gross developed acres for both oil and gas are 115,475 acres for our continuing operations and 456,441 acres for the discontinued component. Net developed acres for both oil and gas
is 66,262 acres for our continuing operations and 131,068 acres for the discontinued component.



Undeveloped Acreage

The following table sets forth the gross and net
undeveloped leasehold acreage for our Production segment at December 31, 2002.

Of the net undeveloped
acres, all of the retained acreage related to ongoing operations is in the Anadarko Basin area in the state of Oklahoma.

Net Development Wells Drilled

The following table sets forth the net interest in total development wells drilled, by well classification, for our Production segment for the periods
indicated.

We did not drill any
exploratory wells in 2002, 2001, or 2000.

Present Drilling
Activities

At December 31, 2002, the Production segment was
participating in the drilling of nine wells. Our net interest in these wells amounts to 1.7 wells.

Future Obligations to Provide Oil and Gas

We do not have any future obligations to provide oil and gas related to our Production segment.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

United States ex rel. Jack J. Grynberg v. ONEOK, Inc., ONEOK Resources Company, and Oklahoma Natural Gas Company, (CTN-8)

, No. CIV-97-1006-R, United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma, transferred,

In re Natural Gas Royalties Qui Tam Litigation

, MDL Docket No. 1293, United States District Court for the District of Wyoming

. We are a defendant in an action initiated by Jack J. Grynberg, on behalf of the United States under the False
Claims Act (31 U.S.C. § 729,

et seq.

). Similar complaints have been filed against approximately 75 other companies associated with the natural gas industry. The main allegation of the complaints is that, since at least 1985, the
defendants have systematically undermeasured the volumes and/or the heating content of gas purchased from federal and



Indian lands, resulting in underpayment of royalties due the federal government and the various Indian
tribes. Grynberg seeks to recover $5,000 to $10,000 for each violation of the False Claims Act as well as treble damages for any underpayment. The actions brought by Grynberg, together with certain other actions alleging underpayment of gas
royalties to federal and Indian lessors, have been assigned to a multidistrict litigation proceeding in the United States District Court for the District of Wyoming for coordination of pretrial proceedings. The Court overruled the defendants’
initial motion to dismiss, but granted the motion of the United States to dismiss certain portions of the complaint. The order granting the motion of the United States is now on appeal. Meanwhile, the defendants are conducting discovery regarding
whether Grynberg has met the unique jurisdictional prerequisites for maintaining an action under the False Claims Act. We will continue to vigorously defend all aspects of claims made against us in this litigation.

Southwest Gas Corporation v. ONEOK, Inc.

, No.
CIV-00-0119-PHX-ROS, United States District Court for the District of Arizona

. In May of 1999 a series of lawsuits were filed in connection with failed attempts by us and Southern Union Company (“SUG”) to merge with Southwest Gas
Corporation (“SWX”). We, SWX and SUG all sued each other and SUG made claims against a member of the Arizona Corporation Commission and other individuals, including our officers and directors. On August 6, 2002, SWX and SUG settled their
claims against each other for the payment of $17.5 million by SWX to SUG. Shortly thereafter, on August 9, 2002, we and SWX settled our claims against each other for a payment of $3 million by us to SWX. On October 11, 2002, we and SUG announced to
the Court an agreement in principle to settle the remaining claims between us, our current/former officers and directors and SUG. On January 3, 2003, we completed that settlement. In exchange for a payment of $5 million by us to SUG, SUG dismissed
with prejudice its claims against us and our current/former officers and directors and we likewise dismissed with prejudice our claims against SUG. There are no further outstanding claims involving us in these cases.

In re ONEOK, Inc. Derivative Litigation

, No. CJ-2000-00593, District
Court of Tulsa County, Oklahoma (formerly Gaetan Lavalla, derivatively on behalf of nominal defendant ONEOK, Inc. v. Larry W. Brummett, et al., No. CJ-2000-598 and Hayward Lane, derivatively on behalf of nominal defendant ONEOK, Inc. v. Larry W.
Brummett, et al.)

. On February 3, 2000, two substantially identical derivative actions were filed in the District Court in Tulsa, Oklahoma, by shareholders against the members of our Board of Directors for violation of their fiduciary duties by
allegedly causing or allowing us to engage in fraudulent and improper schemes designed to “sabotage” Southern Union Company’s (“SUG”) competitive bid to acquire Southwest Gas Corporation (“SWX”) and secure
regulatory approval for our own planned merger with SWX. Such conduct allegedly caused us to be sued by both SWX and SUG, which exposed us to millions of dollars in liabilities. The allegations are used as a basis for causes of action for
intentional breach of fiduciary duty, derivative claim for negligent breach of fiduciary duty, class and derivative claims for constructive fraud, and derivative claims for gross mismanagement. Each plaintiff seeks a declaration that the lawsuit is
properly maintained as a derivative action, the defendants, and each of them, have breached their fiduciary duties to us, an injunction permanently enjoining defendants from further abuse of control and committing of gross mismanagement and
constructive fraud, and asks for an award of compensatory and punitive damages and costs, disbursements and reasonable attorney fees. A joint motion for consolidation of both derivative actions was filed on June 6, 2000, and a pretrial order was
entered on that date consolidating the actions and establishing a schedule for a response to a consolidated petition. On July 21, 2000, the plaintiffs filed their consolidated petition. Stephen J. Jatras and J. M. Graves have been eliminated as
defendants in the consolidated petition, but Eugene Dubay was added as a new defendant. The plaintiffs also dropped their class and derivative claim for constructive fraud, but added a new derivative claim for waste of corporate assets. On September
19, 2000, we, our independent directors (Anderson, Bell, Cummings, Ford, Fricke, Lake, Mackie, Newsom, Parker, Scott and Young), David Kyle, and Gene Dubay filed motions to dismiss the action for failure of the plaintiffs to make a pre-suit demand
on our Board of Directors. In addition, our independent directors, David Kyle, and Gene Dubay filed motions to dismiss the Plaintiffs’ Consolidated Petition for failure to state a claim. On January 3, 2001, the Court dismissed the action
without prejudice as to its claims against Larry Brummett. On February 26, 2001, the action was stayed until one of the parties notifies the court that a dissolution of the stay is requested.

Will Price, et al. v. Gas Pipelines, et al. (f/k/a Quinque Operating
Company, et al. v. Gas Pipelines, et al.)

,

26th Judicial District, District Court of Stevens County, Kansas, Civil Department, Case No. 99C30

. On June 8, 2001, a second amended petition was filed in this case as a purported class
action against approximately 225 defendants, including us, one of our divisions and five of our subsidiaries. Plaintiffs later dismissed a number of defendants, including ONEOK



Resources Company, one of our
subsidiaries. On February 21, 2002, plaintiffs filed a third amended petition, in order to add certain plaintiffs, dismiss Quinque Operating Company as a plaintiff, and amended certain of their substantive allegations. The third amended petition was
purportedly filed on behalf of all producers and royalty owners who have lost money as a result of alleged mismeasurement of gas since 1974 by any of the now approximately 135 defendants. The third amended petition alleges that each of the
defendants engaged in one or more specific “mismeasurement techniques” and conspired with one another to undermeasure the gas sold by the alleged class members. The third amended petition alleges that the aggregate alleged underpayment to
all purported class members since 1974 is estimated to be tens of billions of dollars. One of our named subsidiaries, ONEOK WesTex Transmission, Inc., formerly Westar Transmission Co., is a former subsidiary of Kinder Morgan, and Kinder Morgan has
agreed to assume the defense of ONEOK WesTex while reserving its rights and denying that it has any obligation to indemnify us against any loss suffered by ONEOK WesTex as a result of this litigation. Discovery in the case, except as to class
certification and personal jurisdiction issues, has been stayed. Plaintiffs and defendants have served and responded to various discovery requests on the personal jurisdiction and class certification issues. One of our subsidiaries, ONEOK Gas
Transportation, LLC, is contesting personal jurisdiction. On August 19, 2002, the court entered an order denying the defendants’ motion to dismiss the case. Oral argument on the personal jurisdiction motion of defendants contesting personal
jurisdiction was held on August 29, 2002, but no decision has been rendered on that motion yet. Oral argument also was held on plaintiffs’ class certification motion on January 13, 2003; however, no decision has been rendered on that motion
either. ONEOK intends to vigorously defend all aspects of the claims asserted in this case.

In the Matter of the Natural Gas Explosion at Hutchinson, Kansas during January, 2001

,

Case No. 02-E-0155, before the Secretary of the Department of Health and Environment.

On July
23, 2002 the Division of Environment of the Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) issued an administrative order, which assesses a $180,000 civil penalty against our Kansas Gas Service division. The penalty is based upon allegations of
violations of various KDHE regulations relating to our operation of hydrocarbon storage wells, monitoring requirements applicable to stored hydrocarbon products, and spill reporting in connection with the gas explosion at our Yaggy gas storage
facility in Hutchinson, Kansas in January 2001. In addition, the order requires us to monitor existing unplugged vent wells, drill additional observation, monitoring and vent wells as directed by the KDHE, perform cleanup activities relating to
certain brine wells, and prepare a geoengineering plan with respect to the Yaggy gas field. We timely filed an appeal of the administrative order. A status conference was held on February 12, 2003, and another one has been scheduled for April 10,
2003, regarding progress toward reaching an agreed consent order.

Transportation L.L.C. and Mid-Continent Market Center, Inc.,

Case No. 01-C-0057, in the District Court of Reno County, Kansas.

Two separate class action lawsuits were filed against us and several of our subsidiaries in early 2001 relating to
certain gas explosions in Hutchinson, Kansas. The court certified two separate classes of claimants, which include all owners of real estate in Reno County, Kansas whose property had allegedly declined in value, and owners of businesses in Reno
County whose income had allegedly suffered. The petitions seek recovery on behalf of the class claimants for an amount, which will fully and fairly compensate all members of the class.

Loyd Smith, et al v. Kansas Gas Service Company, Inc., ONEOK, Inc., Western Resources, Inc., Mid Continent Market
Center, Inc., ONEOK Gas Storage, L.L.C., ONEOK Gas Storage Holdings, Inc., and ONEOK Gas Transportation, L.L.C.,

Case No. 03-C-0029, in the District Court of Reno County, Kansas.

This class action lawsuit was filed against us, several of our
subsidiaries, and others on January 17, 2003 relating to the gas explosions occurring in Hutchinson, Kansas in January 2001. The petition seeks recovery on behalf of residents of Reno County, Kansas, who have suffered or will suffer damage and/or
economic losses relating to personal property and displacement costs. We have not been served in this matter, and intend to vigorously defend all aspects of the claims against us in this litigation once properly served.

The following table sets forth our selected financial data for each of the periods indicated.



ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors

Some of the statements contained and incorporated in this Form 10-K are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995. The forward-looking statements relate to the anticipated financial performance, management’s plans and objectives for future operations, business prospects, outcome of regulatory proceedings, market conditions and other
matters. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements in various circumstances. The following discussion is intended to identify important factors that could cause future outcomes to
differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.

Forward-looking statements include the items identified in the preceding paragraph, the information concerning possible or assumed future results of operations and other statements contained or incorporated in this Form 10-K
identified by words such as “anticipate,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “believe,” “projection” or “goal.”

You should not place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements. Known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other
factors may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Those factors may affect our operations,
markets, products, services and prices. In addition to any assumptions and other factors referred to specifically in connection with the forward-looking statements, factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those

•

the risk of a significant slowdown in growth or decline in the U.S. economy, the risk of delay in growth or recovery in the U.S. economy or the risk of increased
costs for insurance premiums, security or other items as a consequence of the September 11, 2001, or possible future terrorists attacks or war; and

•

the other factors listed in the reports we have filed and may file from time to time with the SEC.

Other factors and assumptions not identified above were also involved in the
making of the forward-looking statements. The failure of those assumptions to be realized, as well as other factors, may also cause actual results to differ materially from those projected.

Operating Environment and Outlook

The energy industry has undergone tremendous changes throughout the past
decade and energy trading in the past 12 to 18 months. Our strategy has been and continues to be one of growth through acquiring assets that complement and strengthen each other, maximizing the earnings potential of existing assets through asset
rationalization and consolidation and introducing regulatory initiatives that benefit us and our customers. We believe that the energy markets will continue to see deregulation, although it may be different than how certain markets have been
deregulated to date. We will continue to focus on enhancing the earnings potential of our existing assets through acquiring assets that grow our operations into new market areas and complement our existing asset base.

Operating Highlights

Acquisitions and Capital Expenditures

– On January 31, 2003, we
closed the sale of some of the natural gas and oil producing properties of our production segment to Chesapeake Energy Corporation for a cash sales price of approximately $300 million. Pursuant to the sale, we sold natural gas and oil reserves in
Oklahoma and Texas. The sale included approximately 1,900 wells, 482 of which were operated by us. We recorded a gain of approximately $74.4 million in the first quarter of 2003 related to this sale.

On January 3, 2003, we closed the purchase of all of the Texas assets of
Southern Union for a cash purchase price of approximately $420 million, subject to a working capital adjustment to be determined within 90 days of the closing of the transaction. The acquisition makes us the fifth largest gas distributor in the
U.S., with almost two million customers in Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas. The assets acquired consist of the third largest gas distribution business in Texas, with operations that serve approximately 535,000 customers, over 90 percent of which are
residential.

On December 13, 2002, we closed the sale of some of
our midstream natural gas assets for a sales price of approximately $92 million to an affiliate of Mustang Fuel Corporation, a private, independent oil and gas company. The assets that were sold are located in north central Oklahoma and include
three processing plants and related gathering systems and our interest in a fourth processing plant. The sale of these assets is part of our strategy to dispose of assets that are not considered core assets for our future.

In early 2001, we increased our common ownership interest in MHR from
approximately nine percent to over 21 percent through conversion of shares and redemption of MHR preferred stock to shares of MHR common stock, as well as exercising warrants. As a result, we began accounting for the MHR investment using the equity
method of accounting. In March 2002, MHR merged with Prize Energy Corp., which reduced our direct ownership to approximately 11 percent and reduced the number of MHR board of director positions held by us from two to one. At that time, we began
accounting for our investment in MHR as an available-for-sale security and, accordingly, marked the investment to fair value through other



comprehensive income. In the
second quarter of 2002, we sold our shares of MHR common stock for a pre-tax gain of approximately $7.6 million, which is included in other income in 2002. We retained approximately 1.5 million stock purchase warrants. We also relinquished our
remaining seat on MHR’s board of directors. The MHR investment and related equity income and loss are reported in the Other segment.

During 2001, we completed construction of the Spring Creek Power Plant, located in Logan County, Oklahoma, and began operations in mid-2001. Four
gas-powered turbines provide electricity during peak demand periods. We spent approximately $42.3 million in 2001 and $58.7 million in 2000 constructing the 300-megawatt plant.

In 2000, we made two significant asset acquisitions that greatly enhanced our Gathering and Processing, Transportation and
Storage, and Marketing and Trading segments. The combined acquisitions included natural gas processing plants with a combined capacity of 1.6 Bcf/d, approximately 14,000 miles of gathering and transmission lines, and natural gas storage facilities
with a combined capacity of approximately 10 Bcf and contributed to a significant increase in trading. The acquisition of these assets demonstrates execution of our strategy of growing through acquisition of assets that complement and strengthen
each other.

Regulatory

– In 2000, KGS was successful
in obtaining temporary approval of weather normalization. KGS also obtained permanent approval of the WeatherProof Bill Program that had been a temporary program. As this is a permanent program, it will remain in effect until KGS requests the
program cease. We believe that the successful implementation of these initiatives and programs will reduce the impact of weather on earnings and customer bills. In January 2003, KGS filed a rate case with the KCC to increase rates approximately $76
million. The KCC has 240 days to issue a final order on the rate case. If approved, the new rates will be effective for the 2003/2004 heating season. Until a final order is received, KGS will operate under the current rate schedules. The weather
normalization rider was included in the rate case filing with the KCC in January 2003.

In 2001, the OCC issued an order denying ONG the right to collect $34.6 million in unrecovered gas costs incurred while serving customers during the 2000/2001 winter season. We appealed this Order to the Oklahoma Supreme
Court and asked the OCC to stay the provisions of this Order, pending the outcome of our appeal. The OCC subsequently approved our request to stay this Order, which allowed ONG to collect the $34.6 million, subject to a refund had we ultimately lost
the case. A Joint Stipulation approved by the OCC on May 16, 2002, settled a number of outstanding cases pending before the OCC, including the Commission’s inquiry into our gas cost procurement practices during the winter of 2000/2001. It also
settled cases relating to an application seeking relief from improper and excessive purchased gas costs and an enforcement action against us, our subsidiaries and affiliated companies of ONG. In addition, all of the open inquiries related to the
annual audits of ONG’s fuel adjustment clause for 1996 to 2000 were closed as a result of this Stipulation.

The Joint Stipulation has a $33.7 million value to ONG customers that will be realized over a three-year period. In July 2002, immediate cash savings were provided to all ONG customers in the form of
billing credits totaling approximately $9.1 million, with an additional $1.0 million available for former customers returning to our system. If the additional $1.0 million is not fully refunded to customers returning to the ONG system by December
2005, the remainder will be included in the final billing credit. ONG has replaced certain gas contracts, which is expected to reduce gas costs by approximately $13.8 million due to avoided reservation fees between April 2003 and October 2005.
Additional savings of approximately $8.0 million from the use of storage service in lieu of those contracts are expected to occur between November 2003 and March 2005. Any expected savings from the use of storage that are not achieved, any remaining
billing credits not issued to returning customers and an additional $1.8 million credit will be added to the final billing credit scheduled to be provided to customers in December 2005. ONG operating income increased by $14.2 million for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2002, compared to 2001 as a result of this settlement and the revision of the estimated loss recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001.

Other

– On January 1, 2003, we adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation” (Statement 123) and will expense the fair value of all stock options beginning with options granted on or after January 1, 2003. See Note A of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosure of our pro forma net
income and earnings per share information had we applied the provisions of Statement 123 for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and included in this



report on Form 10-K. Certain
amounts included in or affecting our financial statements and related disclosure must be estimated, requiring us to make certain assumptions with respect to values or conditions which cannot be known with certainty at the time the financial
statements are prepared. Therefore, the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and associated disclosures with respect to contingent assets and obligations are necessarily affected by these estimates. We evaluate these
estimates on an ongoing basis, utilizing historical experience, consultation with experts and other methods we consider reasonable in the particular circumstances. Nevertheless, actual results may differ significantly from our estimates. We believe
that certain accounting policies are of more significance in our financial statement preparation process than others, as discussed below.

Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities

– We engage in price risk management activities for both energy trading and non-trading
purposes. Through 2002, we accounted for price risk management activities for our energy trading contracts in accordance with EITF 98-10. EITF 98-10 requires entities involved in energy trading activities to account for energy trading contracts
using mark-to-market accounting. Forwards, swaps, options, and energy transportation and storage contracts utilized for trading activities are reflected at fair value as assets and liabilities from price risk management activities in the
consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of these assets and liabilities is affected by the actual timing of settlements related to these contracts and current period changes resulting primarily from newly originated transactions and the impact
of price movements. Changes in fair value are recognized in net revenues, on a net basis, in the consolidated statements of income. Market prices used to determine fair value of these assets and liabilities reflect management’s best estimate
considering various factors, including closing exchange and over-the-counter quotations, time value and volatility underlying the commitments. Market prices are adjusted for the potential impact of liquidating our position in an orderly manner over
a reasonable period of time under present market conditions.

During the third quarter of 2002, we adopted the applicable provisions of EITF 02-3. EITF 02-3 provides that all mark-to-market gains and losses on energy trading contracts should be presented on a net basis (energy contract sales
less energy contract costs) in the income statement without regard to the settlement provisions of the contract. Prior to the third quarter of 2002, energy trading revenues and costs were presented on a gross basis. The historical financial results
of all energy trading contracts have been restated to reflect the adoption of EITF 02-3. Energy trading revenues include natural gas, reservation fees, crude oil, natural gas liquids, and basis. Basis is the natural gas price differential that
exists between two trading locations relative to the Henry Hub price.

In October 2002, the EITF of the FASB rescinded EITF 98-10. As a result, energy-related contracts that are not accounted for pursuant to Statement 133, will no longer be carried at fair value, but rather will be accounted for as
executory contracts and accounted for on an accrual basis. As a result of the rescission of this statement, the EITF also agreed that energy trading inventories carried under storage agreements should no longer be carried at fair value but should be
carried at the lower of cost or market.

The rescission is
effective for all fiscal periods beginning after December 31, 2002 and for all existing energy trading contracts and inventory as of October 25, 2002. Additionally, the rescission applies immediately to contracts entered into on or after October 25,
2002. Changes to the accounting for existing contracts as a result of the rescission of EITF 98-10 will be reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle on January 1, 2003. At this time, we estimate this will result in a
cumulative effect loss, net of tax, of approximately $141.0 million. Any impact from this change will be non-cash. All recoveries of the estimated value associated with this change in accounting will be recognized in operating income in future
periods. The impact of adopting the rescission of EITF 98-10 will be included in the March 31, 2003 financial statements.

Regulation

– Our intrastate transmission pipelines and distribution operations are subject to the rate regulation and accounting requirements
of the OCC, KCC and TRC. Certain of our other transportation activities are subject to regulation by the FERC. Allocation of costs and revenues to accounting periods for ratemaking and regulatory purposes may differ from bases generally applied by
non-regulated operations. Such allocations to meet regulatory accounting requirements are considered to be generally accepted accounting principles for regulated utilities, provided that there is a demonstrable ability to recover any deferred costs
in future rates.

During the rate-making process, regulatory
commissions may require a utility to defer recognition of certain costs to be recovered through rates over time as opposed to expensing such costs as incurred. This allows the utility to stabilize rates over time rather than passing such costs on to
the customer for immediate recovery. This causes certain expenses to be deferred as a regulatory asset and amortized to expense as they are recovered through rates. Continued recovery of all regulatory assets is expected. Should recovery cease due
to regulatory actions, a write-off of regulatory assets and stranded costs may be required.



Impairments

– We
assess for impairment of long-lived assets when indicators of impairment are present. An impairment is recognized if the undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the asset’s carrying amount. Impairment loss is measured by comparing
the fair value of the asset to its carrying amount. Fair values are based on discounted future cash flows or information provided by sales and purchases of similar assets.

See further discussion of our significant accounting policies in Note A of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Consolidated Operations

The following table sets forth certain selected financial information for the
periods indicated.

Operating Results

– Increased energy trading revenues, net in 2002 compared to 2001 were achieved by diversifying our portfolio to include crude oil and natural gas liquids. The increased use of storage and transport capacity also contributed to our ability
to capture price volatility in energy trading. Mark-to-market earnings were $42.6 million in 2002 compared to $35.3 million in 2001 and contributed to the increase in energy trading revenues, net. Net revenues in 2002 include the $14.0 million
recovery of a portion of the costs related to Enron sales contracts that were written off in the fourth quarter of 2001 and the $14.2 million adjustment due to the OCC settlement. Write-off of these costs totaled $72.0 million in 2001. We also
benefited in the Marketing and Trading segment from the renegotiation of certain long-term transportation contracts in 2002.

Operating costs increased in 2002 compared to 2001 due primarily to higher employee costs.

Other income in 2002 includes a $7.6 million gain related to the sale of our investment in MHR, a $1.5 million gain related
to the sale of certain Oklahoma property rights in the Transportation and Storage segment, and a $1.9 million gain related to the sale of certain Texas transmission assets in the Transportation and Storage segment. Other expense in 2002 includes
$2.1 million of ongoing litigation costs associated with our terminated acquisition of Southwest and $8.0 million for the settlement of litigation with Southwest and Southern Union.

Interest expense decreased in 2002 compared to 2001 primarily due to the interest rate swaps we have in place that reduced
interest expense by $20.6 million in 2002, compared to a $5.3 million reduction in 2001, from what the expense would have been with fixed rates. Interest expense also decreased due to the reduced balance in commercial paper and lower interest rates
relating to commercial paper. See Note D of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of interest rate swaps.

A full year of operations of the assets acquired in March and April of 2000 contributed to increased net revenues in 2001 compared to 2000, despite lower
energy prices in the latter part of 2001, and increased operating costs and depreciation, depletion and amortization. Our ability to successfully execute our transportation and storage arbitrage strategy also continued to favorably impact operating
results. The impact of the OCC ruling related to the recovery of gas costs from the 2000/2001 winter reduced operating income by $34.6 million and the impact of the Enron bankruptcy reduced operating



income by $37.4 million in 2001. Included in Other income for 2001 is $8.1 million in income from equity
investments including MHR. Other expense in 2001 includes $3.7 million of ongoing litigation costs associated with the terminated acquisition of Southwest and a $1.5 million insurance deductible payment related to the Yaggy storage facility. The
reduction in the effective tax rate for 2001 is the result of changes in estimates of prior year tax liabilities recorded in the third quarter.

Interest expense increased in 2001 compared to 2000 as a result of increased debt, primarily due to financing of acquisitions and increased working
capital including unrecovered purchased gas costs. We had interest rate swaps in place that reduced interest expense by $5.3 million in 2001 from what the expense would have been with fixed interest rates. See Note K to the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for further discussion of interest rate swaps.

Marketing and Trading

Operational
Highlights

– Our Company’s marketing and trading operation purchases, stores, markets, and trades natural gas to both the wholesale and retail sectors throughout most of the United States. We have strong mid-continent region storage
positions and transport capacity of 1 Bcf/d that allow us to trade natural gas from border to border and coast to coast. With total storage capacity of 80 Bcf, withdrawal capability of 2.4 Bcf/d and injection capability of 1.3 Bcf/d, we have direct
access to most regions of the country and flexibility to capture volatility in the energy markets. We continue to enhance our strategy of focusing on higher margin business which includes providing reliable service during peak demand periods through
the use of storage and transportation capacity.

We constructed a
peak electric power generating plant in mid-2001. The 300-megawatt plant is located in Oklahoma adjacent to one of our natural gas storage facilities and is configured to supply electric power during peak demand periods. This plant allows us to
capture the “spark spread premium,” which is the value added by converting natural gas to electricity, during peak demand periods.

During the first quarter of 2002, our Power segment was combined with our Marketing and Trading segment, eliminating the Power segment. This reflects our
strategy of trading around the capacity of our electric generating plant. All segment data has been restated to reflect this change.

During the third quarter of 2002, we adopted certain provisions of EITF 02-3, which provides that all mark-to-market gains and losses on energy trading
contracts should be presented on a net basis (energy contract sales less energy contract costs) in the income statement without regard to the settlement provisions of the contract. Prior to the third quarter of 2002, our energy trading revenues and
costs were presented on a gross basis. The financial results of all energy trading contracts have been restated to reflect the adoption of EITF 02-3 for all periods presented. EITF 02-3 does not affect power-related revenues, which will continue to
be reported on a gross basis.

In October 2002, the EITF
rescinded EITF 98-10. As a result, energy-related contracts that are not accounted for pursuant to Statement 133, will no longer be carried at fair value, but rather will be accounted for as executory contracts and accounted for on an accrual basis.
As a result of the rescission of this statement, the Task Force also agreed that energy-trading inventories carried under storage agreements should no longer be carried at fair value, but should be carried at the lower of cost or market.

The rescission is effective for fiscal periods beginning after
December 31, 2002 and for all existing energy trading contracts and inventory as of October 25, 2002. Additionally, the rescission applies immediately to contracts entered into on or after October 25, 2002. Changes to the accounting for existing
contracts as a result of the rescission of EITF 98-10 will be reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle on January 1, 2003. At this time, we estimate this will result in a cumulative effect loss, net of tax, of
approximately $141.0 million. Any impact from this change will be non-cash. All recoveries of the estimated value associated with this change in accounting will be recognized in operating income in future periods. The impact of adopting the
rescission of EITF 98-10 will be included in our March 31, 2003 financial statements.

The following tables set forth certain selected financial and operating information for the Marketing and Trading segment for the periods indicated.



(a)

This represents the absolute value of gross transaction volumes for both buy and sell energy trading contracts that were physically settled.

Operating Results

– Energy trading
revenues include revenues related to trading natural gas, reservation fees, crude oil, natural gas liquids, and basis. Basis is the natural gas price differential that exists between trading locations relative to the Henry Hub natural gas price. We
began actively trading crude oil and natural gas liquids in this segment in the first quarter of 2002.

Net revenues significantly increased in 2002 over 2001 while sales volumes increased only slightly. The increase in net revenues is attributable to our use of storage and transport capacity to capture
the significant intra-month and regional price volatility from border to border and coast to coast. Our storage and transport capacity also enabled us to secure positive option value and favorable winter/summer spreads on stored gas volumes. In
2002, we also diversified our marketing and trading portfolio to include crude oil and natural gas liquids, which positively impacted our net revenues. We also benefited from the renegotiation of certain long-term transportation contracts.
Power-related margins decreased in 2002 compared to 2001, despite higher sales volume, due to comparatively smaller spark spreads and reduced volatility in the Southwest Power Pool. In the first quarter of 2002, we sold our Enron bankruptcy claim,
which added $10.4 million to our net revenues. Our net revenues for the years ended 2002, 2001 and 2000 include income recognized from mark-to-market accounting of approximately $42.6 million, $35.3 million and $24.3 million, respectively. As a
percentage of energy trading revenues, net, mark-to-market earnings have declined each year, indicative of our strategy of focusing on our physical leased transportation and storage assets and enabling us to capture the embedded optionality we
possess with the price volatility due to the physical changes in supply and demand.

Operating costs were lower in 2002 compared to 2001 as the prior year included a reserve for Enron-related bad debts of $14.5 million. Excluding the Enron-related reserve, operating costs were higher in 2002 due to increased
employee costs and the addition of trading, risk management, and support personnel.



Other income, net decreased in 2002 compared to 2001 primarily due to an increase in fees paid to
affiliated parties for use of corporate capital related to performance guarantees issued to OEMT.

Our natural gas sales volumes averaged 2.8 Bcf/d in 2002 and 2.7 Bcf/d in 2001 and 2000, while our margin per Mcf increased in 2002 over the prior year due to the price volatility in the market.

Capital expenditures in 2001 and 2000 consist primarily of costs
related to the construction of the electric generating plant, which was completed in mid-2001.

The increase in our net revenues in 2001 compared to 2000 is attributable to our ability to capture higher margins by arbitraging regional price volatility through the use of our storage and
transportation capacity. We were also able to capture wider winter/summer spreads on stored volumes and benefited from falling prices that positively impacted fuel costs associated with our long-term transportation contracts, while sales volumes
decreased slightly. Increased operating costs were due primarily to increased personnel costs required to operate the expanded base of marketing and trading activities acquired in 2000. Also, the Enron bankruptcy resulted in a $22.9 million increase
in cost of gas and a $14.5 million increase in operating costs, totaling a $37.4 million negative impact on operating results for 2001.

Gross margin per Mcf improved in 2001 compared to 2000, as we had fully integrated our mid-continent marketing and trading base following the acquisition
in 2000 and were successfully executing our strategies for transportation and use of storage that focus on capturing higher margin sales.

Gathering and Processing

Operational Highlights

– The Gathering and Processing segment is engaged in the gathering and processing of natural gas and the fractionation,
storage and marketing of NGLs. Our Gathering and Processing segment currently has a processing capacity of approximately 1.993 Bcf/d, of which approximately 0.107 Bcf/d is currently idle. The capacity associated with plants owned or leased is
approximately 1.776 Bcf/d, while the amount of the plant capacity that we own an interest in but do not operate is approximately 0.110 Bcf/d. Our Gathering and Processing segment owns approximately 13,962 miles of gathering pipelines that supply our
gas processing plants.

In December 2002, we completed the sale
of three processing plants and related gathering assets, along with interest in a fourth processing plant, all located in Oklahoma, to an affiliate of Mustang Fuel Corporation. The sale reduced our processing capacity by 0.136 Bcf/d. The capacity
associated with plants owned or leased was reduced by 0.122 Bcf/d, while the amount of the plant capacity that we own an interest in but do not operate was reduced by 0.014 Bcf/d. The sale also reduced our gathering pipelines that supply our gas
processing plant by approximately 2,800 miles.

The following
tables set forth certain selected financial and operating information for the Gathering and Processing segment for the periods indicated.



Operating Results

– The increase in NGL and condensate sales revenues in 2002 compared to 2001 is primarily due to the additional sales volumes generated from the NGL pipeline facilities leased at the end of 2001. This increase was partially offset by a
decrease in composite NGL prices and crude oil prices. The Conway OPIS composite NGL price based on our NGL product mix for 2002 decreased from $0.48 per gallon in 2001 to $0.40 per gallon in 2002. The average NYMEX crude oil price decreased from
$26.60 per barrel in 2001 to $25.41 per barrel in 2002. Gas sales and cost of sales decreased in 2002 compared to 2001, due to lower volumes sold and decreases in natural gas prices. Average natural gas price for the mid-continent region decreased
from $4.16 per MMBtu for 2001 to $3.00 per MMBtu in 2002. Lower sales volumes in 2002 compared to 2001 were primarily the result of the change in plant operations to decrease the NGL recovery in the first quarter of 2001 due to the high value of
natural gas relative to NGL prices, which increased natural gas sales in 2001.

The increase in net revenues in 2002 compared to 2001 is primarily due to contractual changes, customer elections regarding processing, and the relative value of NGLs compared to natural gas. These increases were partially offset by
the effects of an ice storm in the first quarter of 2002 that caused plant outages across much of Oklahoma, and the sale of certain gathering and processing assets in December 2002.

The increase in operating costs in 2002 compared to 2001 is primarily due to additional costs associated with the NGL
pipeline facilities leased at the end of 2001. Operating costs also increased for customer charge offs, increased bad debt reserves and higher employee costs.

The increase in depreciation, depletion and amortization in 2002 compared to 2001 is primarily due to the $2.4 million loss taken in the third quarter
associated with the gas processing plants that were sold in the fourth quarter of 2002. An additional loss of $1.3 million on the assets sold was taken in the fourth quarter and is included in other income, net. Depreciation expense also increased
as a result of increased property, plant and equipment.

A full
year of operation of assets acquired in early 2000 contributed to increased revenues and cost of sales for 2001 compared to 2000. However, decreased processing spreads and lower natural gas prices resulted in lower net revenues for 2001. In the
first quarter of 2001, there were negative processing spreads for the first time in more than 10 years and intermonth volatility during the year was the greatest it had been at any time during that same 10-year period. The overall processing spread
for 2001 was approximately 75 percent of the previous 10-year average of $1.29 per MMBtu. During the year, crude oil and natural gas prices ranged from $32.19 per barrel and $9.98 per MMBtu to $17.72 per barrel and $1.83 per MMBtu,
respectively. The downturn of the economy reduced the demand for many NGL products, particularly ethane, which is a major component of plastic products. Additionally, record high inventories in natural gas and other petroleum products, such as
propane, along with significantly warmer than normal temperatures across North America during the heating season lowered demand for natural gas, home heating oil and propane, causing weaker than expected prices in 2001.

Increased operating costs and depreciation, depletion, and amortization in
2001 were the result of a full year of operation for the assets acquired in 2000.

Volumes of natural gas gathered and processed, NGL sales, NGLs produced and gas sales increased for 2001 compared to 2000 primarily due to a full year of operation of the assets acquired in 2000, which provided increased
processing and fractionation capacity. Average NGL prices for 2001 decreased compared to 2000, which offset the impact of the increased volumes. The Conway OPIS composite NGL price based on our NGL product mix for 2001 decreased 11 percent from
$0.53 per gallon to $0.47 per gallon. Average natural gas prices increased for the same period despite decreases during the last half of 2001. The gas price for the mid-continent region increased 11 percent in 2001 from an average of $3.74 MMBtu to
an average of $4.16 MMBtu.



Risk Management

–
At December 31, 2002 and 2001, the Gathering and Processing segment had a portion of its natural gas costs and NGL production hedged. We also used derivative instruments during 2002 and 2001 to minimize risk associated with price volatility. See
Item 7A – Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk and Note D of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Transportation and Storage

Operating Highlights

– Our Transportation and Storage segment represents our intrastate natural gas transmission pipelines, natural gas
storage and nonprocessable gas gathering facilities. We own or lease five storage facilities in Oklahoma, three in Kansas and three in Texas, with a combined working capacity of approximately 59.6 Bcf, of which 9.5 Bcf is temporarily idle. Our
intrastate transmission pipelines operate in Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas and are regulated by the OCC, KCC, and TRC, respectively. In July 2002, we completed a transaction to transfer certain transmission assets in Kansas to our affiliated
distribution company in Kansas. All historical financial and statistical information has been adjusted to reflect this transfer. In December 2002, certain Oklahoma storage property rights were sold and a long-term agreement was entered into with the
purchaser, whereby we retain storage capacity consistent with our historical usage.

The following tables set forth certain selected financial and operating information for the Transportation and Storage segment for the periods indicated.

Operating results

– Transportation and gathering revenues decreased in 2002 compared to 2001 primarily due to a decrease in the price of natural gas and its impact on the valuation of retained fuel. This was partially offset by an increase in the volumes
transported. The average price of natural gas for the mid-continent region decreased 28 percent to $3.00 per MMBtu in 2002 compared to $4.16 per MMBtu in 2001. Gas sales and other revenues increased in 2002 compared to 2001 primarily due to
increased gas inventory sales, partially offset by lower gas sales volumes associated with wellhead purchases on certain gathering facilities in Oklahoma.

Cost of fuel and gas decreased in 2002 compared to 2001 due to decreased natural gas prices for fuel and decreases in gas sales volumes and fuel volumes
primarily associated with our wellhead purchases. These decreases were partially offset by adjustments resulting from the reconciliation of third party contractual storage and pipeline imbalance positions and costs related to gas inventory sales.

Increased gas inventory sales were the primary reason net
revenues increased in 2002 compared to 2001. This increase was partially offset by costs resulting from the reconciliation of third party contractual storage and pipeline imbalance positions.



The increase in operating
costs in 2002 compared to 2001 is due primarily to the settlement of certain legal proceedings, increased bad debt expense, and increased employee costs. Other income, net increased in 2002 compared to 2001 primarily due to a gain on the sale of
certain storage assets in Oklahoma and transmission assets in Texas.

Transportation revenues increased for 2001 compared to 2000 due to higher retained fuel from a full year of operation of assets acquired in early 2000. The expiration of gas sales contracts acquired in early 2000 resulted in a
decrease of $4.6 million in gas sales revenue in 2001. While revenues from unaffiliated companies decreased as gas sales contracts expired, revenues from transportation contracts replaced the margin generated by those expired gas sales contracts.
The increase in cost of fuel in 2001 compared to 2000 is due to a full year of operation of the assets acquired in 2000 and increased gas prices.

Operating costs increased due to higher ad valorem taxes, labor and other operating costs associated with a full year of operation of the assets acquired
in 2000. Depreciation, depletion and amortization also increased in 2001 due to the 2000 acquisitions.

Regulatory Initiatives

– In a May 2000 OCC Order, our transportation assets in Oklahoma included in the Transportation and Storage segment became a separate regulated utility from the
Distribution segment. We have flexibility in establishing transportation rates with customers; however, there is a maximum rate that we can charge our customers. We are competing for gathering and storage business at market-based rates.

Distribution

Operational Highlights

– The Distribution segment provides
natural gas distribution services in Oklahoma and Kansas. Our operations in Oklahoma are conducted through ONG, which serves residential, commercial, and industrial customers and leases pipeline capacity. Our operations in Kansas are conducted
through KGS, which serves residential, commercial, and industrial customers. The Distribution segment serves about 80 percent of the population of Oklahoma and about 75 percent of the population of Kansas. ONG and KGS are subject to regulatory
oversight by the OCC and KCC, respectively.

The following table
set forth certain selected financial and operating information for the Distribution segment for the periods indicated.

Operating Results

– The decrease in gas sales and cost of gas in 2002 compared to 2001 is primarily attributable to lower natural gas prices in 2002, as well as the recognition of unusually high natural gas prices in 2001 from the 2000/2001 winter. The OCC Joint
Stipulation resulted in $14.2 million being recorded as a reduction in the cost of gas in 2002.

Gas sales and cost of gas increased in 2001 compared to 2000 due to a higher weighted average cost of gas. Although prices of natural gas decreased in the latter part of 2001 from their historically
high levels during the winter of 2000/2001, the higher priced gas incurred during late 2000 and early 2001 were not immediately recovered from customers. Action taken by the OCC, combined with the functioning of our purchased gas cost recovery
mechanisms, delayed the recovery and recognition of a portion of these high gas costs.

In the fourth quarter of 2001, we recorded a $34.6 million charge to cost of gas as a result of the OCC’s order limiting ONG’s recovery of gas purchase expense related to the 2000/2001 winter. This resulted in a
decrease in gross margin on gas sales in



2001 compared to 2000. KGS gross margin increased $3.0 million in 2001 over 2000 due to impact of the
Weather Normalization Program offsetting the warmer weather. ECT revenues decreased $3.4 million in 2001 from 2000 due largely to lower volumes delivered to electric generation customers due to milder summer weather.

Operating costs increased in 2002 compared to 2001 due primarily to increased
employee costs.

Operating costs for 2001 increased over 2000 due
to additional bad debt expense of $19.2 million incurred as a result of the increased natural gas prices during the winter of 2000/2001. This was partially offset by a reduction in operating costs due to the continuation of a successful cost
containment program.

The following tables set forth certain
selected financial and operating information for the Distribution segment for the periods indicated.

Gross margin per Mcf for
Oklahoma residential customers remained essentially the same for 2002 compared to 2001 due to volumes sold remaining flat for the two periods. The number of residential customers increased slightly due to fewer customers being disconnected.

Gross margin per Mcf increased for Oklahoma commercial and
industrial customers in 2002 compared to 2001 due to lower volumes being sold. When volumes are lower, the tiered rate structure results in a greater percent of gas to be delivered at a higher delivery fee. The fixed customer fee per customer also
results in a higher margin when sales are lower. The lower volumes are a result of economic factors causing commercial and industrial customers to reduce their overall consumption.

Gross margin per Mcf for Oklahoma PCL customers decreased for 2002 compared to 2001 due to the increase in volumes
transported by high volume users and the rate per Mcf being less for high volume users. PCL volumes returned to a more normal level in 2002 after industrial customers curtailed production in 2001 due to high gas costs. Volume increases in 2002 were
also due to customers moving from commercial and industrial rates to the new transport rates, and a marketing effort to add small usage PCL customers.



The decrease in Kansas’
residential and commercial gross margins per Mcf for 2002 from 2001 results from a decrease in weather normalization revenues. The Weather Normalization Program provides for additional revenues when heating degree days are less than normal and
reduces revenue when heating degree days are greater than normal. The changes in revenue from the program do not impact the volumes sold and result in a per unit deviation.

Kansas industrial customers are billed on rates that decrease with increased volumes, or step rates, during the months of
April through October. During these months, industrial customers are billed at base rates for the first block of volumes and they are billed at approximately half the base rate for a second block of volumes. A greater number of volumes were sold at
the lower rate second block for 2002 compared to 2001, resulting in a lower unit margin for 2002.

End-use customer transportation (ECT) margins per Mcf decreased for 2002 compared to 2001 due to greater volumes sold to lower margin interruptible transport service customers. The increase in ECT
volumes in 2002 from 2001 is largely due to the assumption of large volume customers by Kansas with the transfer of the MCMC transmission pipeline assets. Additionally, warmer and dryer weather increased volumes to irrigation and gas-fired electric
generation customers.

The decrease in residential volumes sold
in 2001 was due to warmer weather in 2001 compared to 2000. Industrial sales for Oklahoma and wholesale sales for Kansas decreased during the same period due to the movement of some customers to the PCL program in Oklahoma and the ECT program in
Kansas.

Oklahoma’s gross margin per Mcf for industrial
customers increased in 2001 compared to 2000 due to decreased volumes resulting in a greater percent of gas delivered at a higher cost under the tiered rate schedule. A full year of tariff rate reductions in 2001 resulted in a decrease to gross
margin per Mcf for residential and commercial.

The decrease in
PCL and ECT volumes in 2001 compared to 2000 was primarily due to the fact that some customers that use significant quantities of gas in their manufacturing process suspended manufacturing operations in late 2000 and early 2001 due to unusually high
natural gas prices. These decreases were partially offset by reducing our minimum capacity requirements for customers to become eligible for PCL and ECT services pursuant to a regulatory order. The reduction of the minimum requirements allowed more
low volume customers to be added to the customer base.

The
following table sets forth certain selected financial and operating information for the Distribution segment for the periods indicated.

Our capital expenditure
program includes expenditures for extending service to new areas, modifying customer service lines, increasing system capabilities, and general replacements and betterments. It is our practice to maintain and periodically upgrade facilities to
assure safe, reliable, and efficient operations. The capital expenditure program included $18.3 million, $22.4 million, and $21.4 million for new business development in 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively.

Regulatory Initiatives

– KGS filed a rate case on January 31, 2003
to increase rates by $76 million. The KCC has up to 240 days to review the application and issue a final order. If approved, the new rates would become effective for the 2003/2004 winter heating season. Until regulatory approval is received, KGS
will operate under the current rate schedules.

In January 2003,
we closed on the purchase of all the Texas assets of Southern Union for $420 million, subject to adjustment. The gas distribution operations serve approximately 535,000 customers in cities located throughout the state of Texas, including the major
cities of El Paso and Austin, as well as the cities of Port Arthur, Galveston, Brownsville, and others. Over 90 percent of the customers are residential. The acquisition will be reflected in our March 31, 2003 financial statements. Operating income
for the Texas properties for the twelve months ending June 30, 2002, was $41.2 million, of which approximately 95 percent was related to the Texas distribution operations.

In July 2002, we completed a transaction to transfer certain transmission assets in Kansas from our Transportation and
Storage segment to KGS. All historical financial and statistical information has been adjusted to reflect this transfer.



ONG continues to take an
active role in response to the OCC’s Notice of Inquiry regarding the use of physical and financial instruments to hedge against fuel procurement volatility. ONG exercised provisions contained in a number of its gas supply contracts that allow
us to fix the price of a portion of its gas supply. ONG fixed the price of approximately 37% of its anticipated 2002/2003 winter gas supply deliveries.

ONG received approval from the OCC to create a Voluntary Fixed Price pilot program that will enable its general sales customers to fix the gas cost
portion of their bill for a specified winter period. The program was initiated to provide customers with a means of controlling their 2002/2003 gas bills. Over 20,000 customers signed up for this program for the first heating season.

A Joint Stipulation approved by the OCC on May 16, 2002, settled a number of
outstanding cases pending before the OCC. The major cases settled were the Commission’s inquiry into our gas cost procurement practices during the winter of 2000/2001; an application seeking relief from improper and excessive purchased gas
costs; and an enforcement action against us, our subsidiaries and affiliated companies of ONG. In addition, all of the open inquiries related to the annual audits of ONG’s fuel adjustment clause for 1996 to 2000 were closed as a result of this
Stipulation.

The Joint Stipulation has a $33.7 million value to
ONG customers that will be realized over a three-year period. In July 2002, immediate cash savings were provided to all ONG customers in the form of billing credits totaling approximately $9.1 million, with an additional $1.0 million available for
former customers returning to our system. If the additional $1.0 million is not fully refunded to customers returning to the ONG system by December 2005, the remainder will be included in the final billing credit. ONG is replacing certain gas
contracts, which is expected to reduce gas costs by approximately $13.8 million due to avoided reservation fees between April 2003 and October 2005. Additional savings of approximately $8.0 million from the use of storage service in lieu of those
contracts are expected to occur between November 2003 and March 2005. Any expected savings from the use of storage that are not achieved, any remaining billing credits not issued to returning customers and an additional $1.8 million credit will be
added to the final billing credit scheduled to be provided to customers in December 2005. ONG operating income increased by $14.2 million in 2002 compared to 2001 as a result of this settlement and the revision of the estimated loss recorded in the
fourth quarter of 2001.

During 2001, the KCC issued an Order
extending the time period for which gas service disconnection during inclement weather conditions cannot be made. Due to the extension of the time period restricting disconnections, delinquent KGS customers were allowed to continue gas service, thus
increasing uncollectible amounts. Higher gas costs in the 2000/2001 heating season also contributed to the increased uncollectible amounts. KGS and other distribution companies in Kansas filed a joint application with the KCC seeking approval to
recover the additional uncollectible amounts incurred during the 2000/2001 heating season until reviewed in the next rate case. The KCC approved the deferral allowing the companies to seek recovery of the extraordinary uncollectible account levels
experienced in the 2000/2001 winter.

During 2000, the KCC issued
an Order allowing KGS to recover additional costs of its gas purchase hedging program established to protect the price paid by customers for gas purchases. The KCC approved KGS’s WeatherProof Bill Program that had been a temporary program. This
plan allows customers, at their discretion, to fix their monthly payment. The KCC also granted KGS weather normalization in December 2000 that minimizes weather-related revenue fluctuations.

Certain costs to be recovered through the ratemaking process have been
recorded as regulatory assets in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, “Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation.” Although no further unbundling of services is anticipated, should this occur,
certain of these assets may no longer meet the criteria of a regulatory asset and, accordingly, a write-off of regulatory assets and stranded costs may be required. We do not anticipate that such a write-off of costs, if any, will be material.

Production

Operational Highlights

– Our strategy is to concentrate ownership
of natural gas and oil reserves in the mid-continent region in order to add value not only to our existing production operations but also to the related gathering, processing, marketing, transportation, and storage businesses. Accordingly, we focus
on exploitation activities rather than exploratory drilling. As a result of our growth strategy through acquisitions and developmental drilling, the number of wells we operate increased in 2002 prior to the agreement to sell, discussed below, and
are expected to increase again as we re-establish reserves. In our role as operator, we control operating decisions that impact production volumes and lifting costs. We continually focus on reducing finding costs and minimizing production costs.



We continually evaluate opportunities to sell properties at premium values when the market allows. In
November 2002, we entered into an agreement to sell 1,913 of our wells for approximately $300 million. The assets sold and the results of their operations are reflected as a discontinued operation in the December 31, 2002 financial statements. All
financial and statistical information for all periods presented has been restated to reflect the discontinued operation. After the sale, we will continue to own interests in 574 wells, and expect to continue to pursue our oil and gas strategy for
growth.

During 2002, we acquired approximately $3.7 million in
gas and oil properties. Through our developmental drilling program, we drilled 117 wells in 2002, of which 38 of the completed wells were retained, compared to 155 wells completed in 2001, of which 44 were retained.

The following tables set forth certain selected financial and operating
information for the Production segment for the periods indicated.



(a)

The average realized price, above, reflects the impact of hedging activities.

All proved undeveloped reserves are attributed to
locations directly offsetting (adjacent to) productive units.

Operating Results

– Net revenues from continuing operations decreased in 2002 compared to 2001 due to lower realized gas prices. Hedging gains of $1.2 million are included in 2002 continuing operations, which partially
offset the decline in gas prices. The net revenues for 2001 included hedging losses of $3.6 million. The 2002 revenues from continuing operations also include a recovery of $0.8 million related to the sale of our Enron claim on hedging contracts and
income from the discontinued component includes $1.9 million related to the Enron claim. We also experienced lower gas production in 2002 compared to 2001. Operating costs from continuing operations remained flat in 2002 compared to 2001, reflecting
lower maintenance costs that were offset by higher administrative costs. Depreciation, depletion and amortization for continuing operations increased in 2002 compared to 2001 due primarily to a higher depletion rate on the fields we retained.

Net revenues for continuing operations increased in 2001
compared to 2000, due to higher natural gas and oil prices and the $7.9 million negative impact of hedging activities in 2000.

Operating costs increased in 2001 as compared with 2000 as a result of higher production taxes. Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased in 2001
compared to 2000 due to increased production and a slightly higher average depletion rate.

Other income, net in 2001 primarily represents the gain from the sale of the Company’s 40 percent interest in K. Stewart.

Income from the discontinued component is significantly lower in 2002 compared to 2001 primarily due to the lower gas prices
received in 2002 compared to 2001. Income from the discontinued component is higher in 2001 compared to 2000 due to the higher gas prices received in 2001 compared to 2000 and due to higher losses from gas hedges in 2000 compared to 2001.

The Production segment added 15.2 Bcfe of net reserves in 2002
related to the retained properties, including 9.3 Bcfe of proved developed, comprised of 6.1 Bcfe of proved developed producing and 3.2 Bcfe of proved non-producing. Other



adjustments, primarily
revision of prior estimates, reduced the year-end reserves of retained wells by 11.6 Bcfe. Production for the year ended December 31, 2002, on retained wells was 9.0 Bcfe.

Reserve additions for the discontinued component totaled 11.8 Bcfe of net reserves in 2002, of which 9.9 Bcfe were proved
developed, made up of 8.3 Bcfe of proved developed producing and 1.6 Bcfe of proved non-producing. Other adjustments, primarily revisions of prior estimates, reduced the year-end reserves for the discontinued component by an additional 24.1 Bcfe.
Production for the year ended December 31, 2002, for the discontinued component was 19.5 Bcfe.

Capital expenditures primarily relate to the drilling program, which consisted of drilling costs. Capital expenditures related to the drilling program for continuing operations were approximately $15.3
million, $19.2 million, and $16.7 million in 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. Capital expenditures related to the drilling program for discontinued component were $19.8 million, $34.0 million, and $16.1 million in 2002, 2001, and 2000,
respectively.

Risk Management

– The volatility of
energy prices has a significant impact on the profitability of this segment. We utilized derivative instruments in 2002 in order to hedge anticipated sales of natural gas and oil production. During the third quarter of 2002, we lifted our natural
gas production hedges through December 2004 and fixed the gain on the derivative instruments previously in place related to our natural gas production. We recognize the benefit from the fixed gain as each contract month expires. In 2002, we
recognized $3.9 million in natural gas sales revenues related to these hedges. The fixed gains associated with these natural gas production hedges have been deferred in other comprehensive income and will be realized in the month that the natural
gas production occurs.

At December 31, 2002, the Production
segment had hedged 72 percent of its anticipated gas production and 62 percent of its anticipated oil production for fiscal year 2003 at a weighted average wellhead price of $4.60 per Mcf for gas and $27.25 per Bbl for oil. See Item 7A. Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk and Note D of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

General

– A part of our strategy is to grow through acquisitions that strengthen and complement our existing assets. We have relied primarily on operating cash flow and borrowings from a combination of commercial
paper, bank lines of credit, and capital markets for our liquidity and capital resource requirements. We expect to continue to use these sources, together with possible equity financings, such as our recent public common stock and equity unit
offerings, for liquidity and capital resource needs on both a short and long-term basis. During 2001 and 2002, our capital expenditures were financed through operating cash flows and short and long-term debt.

Financing is provided through our commercial paper program, long-term debt
and, as needed, through a revolving credit facility. Other options to obtain financing include, but are not limited to, issuance of equity, issuance of mandatory convertible debt securities, asset securitization and sale/leaseback of facilities.

In August 2002, the Company announced that it had completed its
tender offer to purchase all of the outstanding 8.44% Senior Notes due 2004 and the 8.32% Senior Notes due 2007 for a total purchase price of approximately $65 million. The total purchase price included a premium of approximately $2.9 million and
consent fees of approximately $1.8 million to purchase the notes, which are reflected in interest expense in the income statement.

In April 2002, the Company paid off $240 million of long-term floating rate notes that were issued in 2000.

Our credit rating is currently an “A” (stable outlook) by Standard
and Poors and a “Baa1” with a watch for possible downgrade by Moody’s Investor Service. Our credit rating may be affected by a material change in our financial ratios or a material adverse event affecting our business. The most common
criteria for assessment of our credit rating are the debt to capital ratio, pre-tax and after-tax interest debt coverage and liquidity. If our credit ratings were to be downgraded, the interest rates on our commercial paper would increase, resulting
in an increase in our cost to borrow funds. In the event that we are unable to borrow funds under our commercial paper program and there has not been a material adverse change in our business, we have access to an $850 million revolving credit
facility, which expires September 22, 2003.

Our energy marketing
and trading business relies upon the investment grade rating of our senior unsecured long-term debt to satisfy credit support requirements with several counterparties. If our credit ratings were to decline below investment grade, our ability to
participate in energy marketing and trading activity could be significantly limited. Without an investment grade rating, we would be required to fund margin requirements with the few counterparties with which we have Credit Support



Annex within our International
Swaps and Derivatives Association Agreements with cash, letters of credit or other negotiable instruments. At December 31, 2002, the total notional amount that could require such funding in the event of a credit rating decline to below investment
grade is approximately $44.2 million.

We have reviewed our
commercial paper agreement, trust indentures, building leases, Bushton equipment leases, and marketing, trading and risk contracts and no rating triggers were identified. Rating triggers are defined as provisions that would create an automatic
default or acceleration of indebtedness based on a change in our credit rating. The revolving credit agreement does contain a provision that would cause the cost to borrow funds to increase based on the amount borrowed under this agreement if our
credit rating is negatively adjusted. This credit agreement also contains a default provision based on a material adverse change, but an adverse rating change is not defined as a default or material adverse change. We currently do not have any funds
borrowed under this agreement. We also have no material guarantees of debt or other commitments to unaffiliated parties.

We are subject to commodity price volatility. Significant fluctuations in commodity price in either physical or financial energy contracts may impact our
overall liquidity due to the impact the commodity price change has on items such as the cost of gas held in storage, recoverability and timing of recovery of regulated natural gas costs, increased margin requirements, collectibility of certain
energy-related receivables and working capital. We believe that our current commercial paper program and debt capacity are adequate to meet our liquidity requirements associated with commodity price volatility.

Our pension plan is currently overfunded resulting in an asset reported on the
balance sheet. Due to the poor performance of the equity market and lower interest rates, the market value of our pension fund assets has decreased and, accordingly, our pension benefit for our pension and supplemental retirement plans will decrease
in 2003 from $20.8 million to $7.0 million. Should the value of our pension fund assets fall below our Accumulated Benefit Obligation, we would eliminate the asset and record a minimum pension liability on the balance sheet with the difference
flowing through other comprehensive income, net of tax. We believe we have adequate resources to fund our obligations under our pension plan as deemed necessary.

During 2001, we put in place a stock buyback plan for up to 10 percent of our capital stock. The program authorized us to
make purchases of our common stock on the open market with the timing and terms of purchases and the number of shares purchased to be determined by management based on market conditions and other factors. The purchased shares were held in treasury
and available for general corporate purposes, funding of stock-based compensation plans, and resale at a future date or retirement. This plan expired in 2002. At that time, we had not purchased any stock under the plan.

Westar

– On January 9, 2003, we entered into an agreement with
Westar Energy, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary, Westar Industries, Inc., to repurchase a portion of the shares of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (Series A) held by Westar and to exchange Westar’s remaining 10.9 million shares of
Series A for 21.8 million newly-created shares of ONEOK’s $0.925 Series D Non-Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock (Series D). The Series A shares were convertible into two shares of common stock, reflecting the two-for-one stock split in
2001, and the Series D shares are convertible into one share of common stock. The Series D has substantially the same terms as the Series A, except that (a) the Series D has a fixed annual cash dividend of 92.5 cents per share, (b) the Series D is
redeemable by us at any time after August 1, 2006, at a redemption price of $20, in the event that the closing price of our common stock exceeds $25 for 30 consecutive trading days, (c) each share of Series D is convertible into one share of our
common stock, and (d) Westar may not convert any shares of Series D held by it unless the annual per share dividend for our common stock for the previous year is greater than 92.5 cents per share and such conversion would not subject us to the
Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. Our new shareholder agreement also restricts Westar from selling more than five percent to any one person or to a group that already owns five percent or more of our common stock. The KCC approved our
agreement with Westar on January 17, 2003. On February 5, 2003, we consummated the agreement by purchasing $300 million, or approximately 9 million shares (or approximately 18.1 million shares of common stock after the effects of the previous
two-for-one stock split) of our Series A from Westar. We exchanged Westar’s remaining 10.9 million Series A shares for approximately 21.8 million shares of our newly-created Series D. Also, in connection with that transaction, a new rights
agreement, a new shareholder agreement and a new registration rights agreement became effective. In addition, we agreed to register for resale, within 60 days after the February 5, 2003 closing, all of the shares of our common stock held by Westar,
as well as all the shares of our Series D issued to Westar and all of the shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series D. As a result of this transaction and our recently completed common stock offering, Westar’s ownership
interest in our company has been reduced from approximately 44.4 percent to approximately 27.4 percent on a fully diluted basis.

Oklahoma Corporation Commission

– The OCC staff filed an application on February 1, 2001 to review the gas procurement practices of ONG in
acquiring its gas supply for the 2000/2001 heating season to determine if these procurement practices were consistent with least cost procurement practices and whether ONG’s decisions resulted in fair, just and



reasonable costs to its customers. On November 20, 2001, the OCC entered an order stating that ONG not be
allowed to recover the balance in ONG’s unrecovered purchased gas cost (UPGC) account related to the unrecovered gas costs from the 2000/2001 winter effective with the first billing cycle for the month following the issuance of a final order.
This order halted ONG’s recovery process effective December 1, 2001. On December 12, 2001, the OCC approved a request to stay the order and allowed ONG to begin collecting unrecovered gas costs, subject to refund had ONG ultimately lost the
case. In the fourth quarter of 2001, we recorded a charge of $34.6 million as a result of this OCC order. In April 2002, we, along with the staff of the Public Utility Division and the Consumer Services Division of the OCC, the Oklahoma Attorney
General, and other stipulating parties filed a joint stipulation agreement proposing settlement of this and other issues. A hearing with the OCC was held in May 2002 and an order approving the settlement was issued at that time. As a result, we
recorded a $14.2 million recovery in the second quarter of 2002 and have the potential of an additional $8.0 million recovery before December 2005 depending upon the potential value that could be generated by gas storage savings.

Enron

– Enron North America was the counterparty in certain of the
financial instruments discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year-ended December 31, 2001. Enron Corporation and various subsidiaries, including Enron North America, filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the United
States Bankruptcy Code on December 3, 2001. In 2001, we recorded a charge of $37.4 million to provide an allowance for forward financial positions and to establish an allowance for uncollectible accounts related to previously settled financial and
physical positions with Enron. In the first quarter of 2002, we recorded a recovery of approximately $14.0 million as a result of an agreement to sell our Enron claim to a third party, which is subject to normal representations as to the validity,
but not the collectibility, of the claims and the guarantees from Enron.

The filing of the voluntary bankruptcy proceeding by Enron created a possible technical default related to various financing leases tied to our Bushton gas processing plant in south central Kansas. We acquired the Bushton gas
processing plant and related leases from Kinder Morgan in April 2000. Kinder Morgan had previously acquired the plant and leases from Enron. Enron is one of three guarantors of these Bushton plant leases; however, we are the primary guarantor. In
January 2002, we were granted a waiver on the possible technical default related to these leases. We will continue to make all payments due under these leases.

Cash Flow Analysis

Operating Cash Flows

– We had a significant increase in earnings in 2002 compared to 2001. In addition, the changes in accounts receivable and
accounts payable are primarily due to an increase in energy trading revenues, net. Energy trading revenues, net increased due to our use of storage and transport capacity to capture the significant intra-month and regional price volatility. In 2002,
we also diversified our marketing and trading portfolio to include crude oil and natural gas liquids. These increases were partially offset by decreases in accounts receivable and accounts payable due to lower natural gas prices in 2002. In
addition, we had a full year of operations of the electric generating plant in 2002 compared to 2001. The increase in deferred income taxes is primarily due to increased mark-to-market income in 2002 compared to 2001 and additional tax depreciation
taken in 2002.

In 2001, the changes in cash flows provided by
operating activities primarily reflect changes in working capital accounts, deferred income taxes and price risk management assets and liabilities. The increase in deferred income taxes is primarily due to accelerated depreciation in 2001. The
increase in price risk management assets and liabilities is primarily due to the Marketing and Trading segment’s gas in storage, which is included in price risk management assets on the consolidated balance sheet. The level of gas held in
storage is higher at December 31, 2001, compared to December 31, 2000, due to warmer weather in 2001. Cash flow from operating activities was positively impacted in 2001 due to the reduction of accounts receivable, which was partially offset by
increased cash used for payment of accounts payable and gas in storage and reduced recovery of unrecovered purchased gas costs. Receivables and payables were higher than normal at December 31, 2000, due to higher gas prices and the integration of
the businesses acquired in 2000.

In 2000, the changes in cash
flow provided by operating activities primarily reflect changes in working capital accounts and an increase in price risk management assets and liabilities. The significant changes in working capital accounts, including accounts receivable, gas in
storage, accounts payable and deferred credits and other liabilities is primarily a result of the acquisitions and the increase in operations resulting from those acquisitions in 2000 and historically higher gas prices. The increase in price risk
management activities is due to the adoption of mark-to-market accounting in 2000.

Investing Cash Flows

– Proceeds from the sale of property include approximately $92 million related to the sale of some of our midstream natural gas assets to an affiliate of Mustang Fuel Corporation, a private,
independent oil and gas company. Proceeds from the sale of equity investments represent the sale of our interest in MHR in 2002.



Capital expenditures in 2001
and 2000 include approximately $42.3 million and $58.7 million, respectively, for the construction of the electric generating plant. In 2001, we were reimbursed by an unaffiliated company for approximately $14 million of the costs incurred to
construct a pipeline in the Transportation and Storage segment. Due to regulatory treatment, this amount is recorded as a deferred credit in the balance sheet and amortized to income. We also received approximately $7.9 million related to the sale
of assets in the Production segment in 2001. Acquisitions in 2001 include $14.5 million of purchase price adjustments, which resulted in an increase to goodwill, relating to the Kinder Morgan acquisitions.

Financing Cash Flows

– Our capitalization structure is 47 percent
equity and 53 percent long-term debt at December 31, 2002, compared to 42 percent equity and 58 percent long-term debt at December 31, 2001. Our capitalization structure including notes payable is 43 percent equity and 57 percent total debt at
December 31, 2002, compared to 35 percent equity and 65 percent total debt at December 31, 2001. The change in our capital structure is primarily due to the retirement of approximately $300 million of long-term debt and $335 million of notes payable
and earnings in excess of dividends in 2002. At December 31, 2002, $1.5 billion of long-term debt, including current maturities, was outstanding. As of that date, we could have issued $1.1 billion of additional long-term debt under the most
restrictive provisions contained in our various borrowing agreements.

The Board of Directors has authorized up to $1.2 billion of short term financing to be procured as necessary for our operations. We have an $850 million Revolving Credit Facility with Bank of America, N.A. and other financial
institutions with a maturity date of September 22, 2003. This credit facility is primarily used to support the commercial paper program. At December 31, 2002, $265.5 million of commercial paper was outstanding.

In April 2001, we issued a $400 million, ten year, fixed rate note to
refinance short-term debt. In July 2001, we entered into interest rate swaps on debt with a term equal to the term of the notes. The interest rate under these swaps resets periodically based on the three-month London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR)
or the six-month LIBOR at the reset date. In October 2001, we entered into an agreement to lock in the interest rates for each reset period under the swap agreements through the first quarter of 2003. In January 2003, the rates were locked through
the first quarter of 2004. In December 2001, we entered into interest rate swaps on a total of $200 million in fixed rate long-term debt through the term of the note. The interest rate under these swaps resets periodically based on the six-month
LIBOR at the reset date. The average interest rate of the $600 million in notes is 6.971 percent. Under the current swap agreements, the average interest rate of the notes is an all-in LIBOR rate of approximately 3.516 percent. The all-in LIBOR rate
refers to the average LIBOR rate plus or minus the ONEOK basis spread for all swaps. The swaps resulted in approximately $20.6 million of interest savings in 2002 and are expected to generate an estimated $23.0 million in interest savings in 2003.

On July 18, 2001, we filed a shelf registration statement on
Form S-3 for the issuance and sale of shares of our common stock and debt securities in one or more offerings with an aggregate offering price of up to $500 million. On December 20, 2002, we amended the shelf registration statement on Form S-3 to
increase the aggregate offering price of securities to be issued under the shelf registration statement to $1.0 billion and to add some additional securities, including preferred stock, stock purchase contracts and stock purchase units.

On January 12, 2003, we announced plans for concurrent offerings
of our common stock and equity units under our $1.0 billion shelf registration statement. On January 28, 2003, we issued 12 million shares of common stock at the public offering price of $17.19 per share, resulting in net proceeds to us, after
underwriting discounts and commissions, of $16.524 per share, or $198.3 million in the aggregate. We granted the underwriters a 30-day over-allotment option to purchase up to an additional 1.8 million shares of our common stock at the same price,
which was exercised on February 7, 2003, at the same price per share, resulting in additional net proceeds to us of $29.7 million.

Also, on January 28, 2003, we issued 14 million equity units at a public offering price of $25 per unit, resulting in net proceeds to us, after
underwriting discounts and commissions, of $24.25 per share, or $339.5 million in the aggregate. An over-allotment option allowing the purchase of an additional 2.1 million equity units was exercised on January 31, 2003, increasing the net proceeds
to $390.4 million. Each equity unit consists of a stock purchase contract for the purchase of shares of our common stock and, initially, a senior note due February 16, 2008, issued pursuant to our existing Indenture with SunTrust Bank, as trustee.
The equity units carry a total annual coupon rate of 8.5% (4.0% annual face amount of the senior notes plus 4.5% annual contract adjustment payments). Each stock purchase contract issued as a part of the equity units carries a maximum conversion
premium of up to 20 percent over the $17.19 closing price of our common stock on January 22, 2003, and a floor of $17.19 per share.



In February 2003, $300 million
of the proceeds from these offerings was used to repurchase approximately 9 million shares, or 18.1 million shares of common stock after the effects of the previous two-for-one stock split of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock from Westar. The
remaining 10.9 million shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock owned by Westar were exchanged for approximately 21.8 million shares of ONEOK’s $0.925 Series D Convertible Preferred Stock. The Series A shares were convertible into two
shares of common stock, reflecting the two-for-one stock split in 2001, and the Series D shares are convertible into one share of common stock. The Series D Convertible Preferred Stock has an annual dividend rate of $0.925 per share. Because the
Series D Convertible Preferred Stock does not participate in earnings above the amount of the stated dividend rate, we will not be required to apply the provisions of EITF Topic D-95 beginning in February 2003. Under Topic D-95, we were required to
reduce EPS by the dilutive effect of the two-class method of EPS computation.

Both Standard and Poors and Moody’s Investment Services consider the equity units to be part equity and part debt. For purposes of computing capitalization ratios, these rating agencies adjust the capitalization structure.
Standard and Poors considers the equity units to be equal amounts of debt and equity for the first three years, with the effect being to increase shareholders’ equity by the same amount as debt. Moody’s Investment Services considers 25
percent of the equity units to be debt and 75 percent to be shareholders’ equity.

The following table sets forth the actual capitalization structure at December 31, 2002, the capitalization structure had the common stock and equity units issued under the concurrent offerings been issued on December 31,
2002, and the capitalization structure as it would be adjusted by Standard and Poors (S&P). The proceeds from the common stock and equity issuances were used to repurchase $300 million of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock from Westar and
to pay off commercial paper as reflected in the table below.

At the end of year
three, S&P presumes the cash received from the issuance of the equity units is used to pay off debt. The following table sets forth our pro forma capitalization structure at year three as it would be adjusted by S&P.

The following table sets
forth the actual capitalization structure at December 31, 2002, the pro forma capitalization structure had the common stock and equity units issued under the concurrent offerings been issued on December 31, 2002, and the pro forma capitalization
structure as it would be adjusted by Moody’s Investment Services.



Contractual
Obligations and Commercial Commitments

The following table
sets forth our contractual obligations to make future payments under our current debt agreements, operating lease agreements and fixed price contracts. For further discussion of the debt and operating lease agreements, see Notes K and M,
respectively, of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Long-term debt as
reported in the consolidated balance sheets includes unamortized debt discount and the mark-to-market effect of interest rate swaps. The table set forth above does not include $402.5 million of long-term debt incurred in connection with our public
offering of equity units in January 2003. Operating leases and purchase commitments, rights-of-way and other include approximately $0.5 million and $2.2 million for 2008, respectively, of annual commitments, but are not included in the above table
beyond 2008 due to the impracticality of calculating the future commitment. Purchase commitments exclude commodity purchase contracts. The Distribution segment is party to fixed price transportation contracts. However, the costs associated with
these contracts are recovered through rates as allowed by the applicable regulatory agency and are excluded from the above table.

Trading Activities

Forwards, swaps, options, and energy transportation and storage contracts utilized for trading activities are reflected at fair value as assets and
liabilities from price risk management activities in the consolidated balance sheets. The amounts include the cost of gas in storage, option premiums and the mark-to-market component (fair value). We utilize third party references for pricing points
from NYMEX and third party over-the-counter brokers to establish the commodity pricing and volatility curves used in our valuation method to establish fair value. We believe the reported transactions from these sources are the most reflective of
current market prices. Fair values are subject to change based on valuation factors.

The following table sets forth the fair value component of the price risk management assets and liabilities, which result from the Marketing and Trading segment’s energy trading portfolio.



The net fair value of
contracts outstanding at December 31, 2002 includes energy trading contracts accounted for under mark-to-market accounting. The net fair value of contracts outstanding includes the effect of settled energy contracts and current period charges
resulting primarily from newly originated transactions and the impact of price movements on the fair value of price risk management assets and liabilities attributable to the Marketing and Trading segment’s activities.

The following table sets forth the Marketing and Trading segment’s
maturity of energy trading contracts based on heating injection and withdrawal periods from April through March. This maturity schedule is consistent with the Marketing and Trading segment’s business strategy. The Marketing and Trading segment
has contracted over 39 Bcf of storage with an affiliate, which is excluded from outstanding fair value at December 31, 2002, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

(1)

Fair value is the mark-to-market component of forwards, swaps, option, and energy transportation and storage contracts, net of applicable reserves utilized for
trading activities. These fair values are reflected as a component of assets and liabilities from price risk management activities in the consolidated balance sheets.

(2)

Values are derived from energy market price quotes from national commodity trading exchanges that primarily trade future and option commodity contracts.

(3)

Values are obtained through energy commodity brokers or electronic trading platforms, whose primary service is to match willing buyers and sellers of energy
commodities. Because of the large energy broker network, energy price information by location is readily available.

(4)

Values primarily include natural gas storage and transportation capacity. Values derived in this category utilize market price information from the two other
categories as well as other modeling assumptions that include, among others, assumptions for liquidity, credit, time value, volatility and other external attributes. Values attributable to storage models are determined on a heating
injection/withdrawal model.

The following table
sets forth the Marketing and Trading segment’s financial and commodity risk from fixed-price transactions at December 31, 2002.



(1)

Investment grade is primarily determined using publicly available creditratings along with consideration of cash prepayments, cash managing, standby letters of
credit and parent company guarantees. Included in Investment Grade are counterparties with a minimum Standard and Poors’ or Moody’s rating of BBB- or Baa3, respectively.

Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In July 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations” (Statement 143). Statement 143 requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred and a corresponding
increase in the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. Statement 143 is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002. We are currently assessing the impact of adopting Statement 143 and our preliminary assessment indicates that
it will not have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.

In April 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 145, “Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13 and Technical Corrections” (Statement 145).
Statement 145 rescinds FASB Statement No. 4, “Reporting Gains and Losses from Extinguishment of Debt” (Statement 4), and an amendment to that Statement, FASB Statement No. 64 “Extinguishment of Debt Made to Satisfy Sinking-Fund
Requirements” (Statement 64). Statement 145 also rescinds FASB Statement No. 13, “Accounting for Leases” (Statement 13) to eliminate the inconsistency between the required accounting for sale-leaseback transactions and the required
accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects that are similar to sale-leaseback transactions. Statement 145 also amends other existing authoritative pronouncements to make various technical corrections, clarify meanings or
describe their applicability under changed conditions. The provisions of Statement 145 related to the rescission of Statement 4 are effective for fiscal years beginning after May 15, 2002. The provisions of Statement 145 related to Statement 13 are
effective prospectively for transactions occurring after May 15, 2002. All other provisions of Statement 145 are effective prospectively for financial statements issued on or after May 15, 2002.

In July 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
146, “Accounting for Restructuring Costs” (Statement 146). Under Statement 146, a company will record a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity when that liability is incurred and can be measured at fair value.
Statement 146 also provides guidance on accounting for specified employee and contract terminations that are part of restructuring activities. Statement 146 is effective prospectively for exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31,
2002.

In July 2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force issued EITF
Issues No. 02-3, “Issues Involved in Accounting for Derivative Contracts Held for Trading Purposes and Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities” (EITF 02-3). EITF 02-3 provides that all mark-to-market gains and
losses on energy trading contracts be presented on a net basis (energy contract sales less energy contract costs) in the income statement without regard to the settlement provisions of the contract. An entity should disclose the gross transaction
volumes for those energy trading contracts that are physically settled. We adopted these provisions of EITF 02-3 in the third quarter of 2002.

In October 2002, the EITF rescinded EITF 98-10. As a result, energy related contracts that are not accounted for pursuant to Statement 133 will no longer
be carried at fair value, but rather will be accounted for as executory contracts and accounted for on an accrual basis. As a result of the rescission of this statement, the Task Force also agreed that energy trading



inventories carried under
storage agreements should no longer be carried at fair value but should be carried at the lower of cost or market.

The rescission is effective for the fiscal periods beginning after December 31, 2002 and for all existing energy trading contracts and inventory as of
October 25, 2002. Additionally, the rescission applies immediately to contracts entered into on or after October 25, 2002. Changes to the accounting for existing contracts as a result of the rescission of EITF 98-10 will be reported as a cumulative
effect of a change in accounting principle on January 1, 2003. At this time, we estimate this will result in a cumulative effect loss, net of tax, of approximately $141.0 million. Any impact from this change will be non-cash. All recoveries of the
estimated value associated with this change in accounting will be recognized in operating income in future periods. The impact of adopting the rescission of EITF 98-10 will be included in the March 31, 2003 financial statements. The following table
details the estimated recovery of these values from the rescission in future periods. The estimates are based on prices at January 31, 2003 and are subject to change.

Estimated Future Impact of EITF 98-10 Rescission on Earnings

In November of 2002, the
FASB issued Interpretation No. 45, “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others” (FIN 45). FIN 45 elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor
in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued. It also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the
obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. The initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of FIN 45 are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The disclosure requirements in FIN
45 are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after December 15, 2002. We do not expect FIN 45 to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. Refer to the general portion of our
liquidity and capital resources section for further discussion of our guarantees.

In December 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation – Transition and Disclosure” (Statement 148). Statement 148 provides for
alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In addition, Statement 148 amends the disclosure requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” (Statement 123), to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the
method used on reported results. The provisions of Statement 148 relating to the alternative methods of transition in the adoption of Statement 123 are effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2002. The provisions of Statement 148
relating to amended disclosure requirements are effective for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2002. We adopted the provisions related to the amended disclosure requirements in the 2002 consolidated financial statements. We adopted the
provisions of Statements 123 effective January 1, 2003, and will apply these provisions to all employee stock options granted on or after January 1, 2003 in accordance with the transition alternative provided in Statement 148. The pro forma effect
of applying the provisions to prior years is presented in Note A in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Other

Related Party Transactions

– KGS has a shared service agreement with Westar, which is the holder of our preferred stock. The shared services include call center backup, meter readings,
customer billing operations and customer service. In 2002, KGS made a net payment of approximately $5.0 million to Westar related to this shared service agreement.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

– We have no off-balance sheet special purpose entities or asset securitization.



Uncollectible Amount

s
– During 2001, the KCC issued an Order extending the time period for which gas service disconnection during inclement weather conditions cannot be made. Due to the extension of the time period restricting disconnections, delinquent KGS
customers were allowed to continue gas service, thus increasing uncollectible amounts. Higher gas costs in the 2000/2001 heating season also contributed to the increased uncollectible amounts. KGS and other distribution companies in Kansas filed a
joint application with the KCC seeking approval to recover the additional uncollectible amounts incurred during the 2000/2001 heating season until reviewed in the next rate case. The KCC approved the deferral allowing the companies to seek recovery
of the extraordinary uncollectible account levels experienced in the 2000/2001 winter. KGS filed a rate case in January 2003. No accounting treatment has yet been determined.

Southwest Gas Corporation

– Information related to litigation arising out of the termination of our effort to
acquire Southwest Gas Corporation is presented in Note M in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and in Item 3 of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Hutchinson Litigation

– Two separate class action lawsuits have been filed against us in connection with the
natural gas explosions and eruptions of natural gas geysers that occurred in or near Hutchinson, Kansas in January 2001. Although no assurances can be given, management believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material
adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. Our insurance carrier in these cases is representing us. We are vigorously defending ourselves against all claims. For more information, see Legal Proceedings.

Environmental

– We have 12 manufactured gas sites located in
Kansas, which may contain potentially harmful materials that are classified as hazardous material. Hazardous materials are subject to control or remediation under various environmental laws and regulations. A consent agreement with the KDHE
presently governs all future work at these sites. The terms of the consent agreement allow us to investigate these sites and set remediation priorities based upon the results of the investigations and risk analysis. Remedial investigation has
commenced on four sites. However, a comprehensive study is not complete and the results to date do not provide a sufficient basis for a reasonable estimation of the total liability. The liability accrued is reflective of an estimate of the total
cost of remedial investigation and feasibility study. Through December 31, 2002, the costs of the investigations and risk analysis related to these manufactured gas sites have been immaterial. The site situations are not common and we have no
previous experience with similar remediation efforts. The information currently available estimates the cost of remediation to range from $100,000 to $10 million per site based on a limited comparison of costs incurred by others to remediate
comparable sites. As such, the information provides an insufficient basis to reasonably estimate a minimum range of our liability. These estimates do not give effect to potential insurance recoveries, recoveries through rates or from unaffiliated
parties. At this time, we are not recovering any environmental amounts in rates. The KCC has permitted others to recover remediation costs through rates. It should be noted that additional information and testing could result in costs significantly
below or in excess of the amounts estimated above. To the extent that such remediation costs are not recovered, the costs could be material to our results of operations and cash flows depending on the remediation done and number of years over which
the remediation is completed.

In January 2001, the Yaggy storage
facility’s operating parameters were changed as mandated by the KDHE following natural gas explosions and eruptions of natural gas geysers in or near Hutchison, Kansas. There are no known long-term environmental effects from the Yaggy storage
facility; however, we continue to perform tests in cooperation with the KDHE.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Risk Management

– We are, substantially through our non-utility business segments, exposed to market risk in the normal course of our business operations and to the impact of market
fluctuations in the price of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and power prices. Market risk refers to the risk of loss in cash flows and future earnings arising from adverse changes in commodity energy prices. Our primary exposure arises from fixed
price purchase or sale agreements that extend for periods of up to 48 months, gas in storage utilized by the marketing and trading operation, and anticipated sales of natural gas and oil production. To a lesser extent, we are exposed to risk of
changing prices or the cost of intervening transportation resulting from purchasing gas at one location and selling it at another (referred to as basis risk). To minimize the risk from market fluctuations in the price of natural gas, NGLs and crude
oil, we use commodity derivative instruments such as futures contracts, swaps and options to manage market risk of existing or anticipated purchase and sale agreements, existing physical gas in storage, and basis risk. We adhere to policies and
procedures that limit our exposure to market risk from open positions and that monitor market risk exposure.

KGS uses derivative instruments to hedge the cost of anticipated gas purchases during the winter heating months to protect KGS customers from upward volatility in the market price of natural gas. At
December 31, 2002, KGS had derivative



instruments in place to hedge
the cost of purchases for 46.5 Bcf of gas. This represents all of KGS gas purchase requirements for the winter 2002/2003 heating months based on normal weather conditions. Gains or losses associated with the KGS hedges are included in the purchased
gas adjustment.

For a detail of the Marketing and Trading
segment’s maturity of energy trading contracts based on heating injection and withdrawal periods from April through March and the related models and assumptions, refer to the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of Item 7. Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Form 10-K.

For further discussion of trading activities and models and assumptions used in the trading activities see the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates section of Item 7. Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Also, see Note D of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Interest Rate Risk

– We are subject to the risk of fluctuation in interest rates in the normal course of business. We manage interest rate
risk through the use of fixed rate debt, floating rate debt and, at times, interest rate swaps. Fixed rate swaps are used to reduce our risk of increased interest costs during periods of rising interest rates. Floating rate swaps are used to convert
the fixed rates of long-term borrowings into short-term variable rates.

At December 31, 2002, the interest rate on 58.1 percent of our debt was fixed, after considering the effect of interest rate swaps. In July 2001, we entered into interest rate swaps on a total of $400 million in fixed rate long-term
debt. The interest rate under these swaps resets periodically based on the three-month LIBOR or the six-month LIBOR at the reset date. In October 2001, we entered into an agreement to lock in the interest rates for each reset period under the swap
agreements through the first quarter of 2003. In December 2001, we entered into additional interest rate swaps on a total of $200 million in fixed rate long-term debt. In January 2003, the rates were locked through the first quarter of 2004. The
swaps resulted in approximately $20.6 million of interest rate savings in 2002 and will result in an estimated $23.0 million in savings during 2003. In December 2002, we recorded a $79.0 million net increase in price risk management assets to
recognize at fair value our derivatives that are designated as fair value hedging instruments. Long-term debt was increased by approximately $78.3 million to recognize the change in fair value of the related hedged liability.

At December 31, 2002 a hypothetical 100 basis point move in the annual
interest rate would change our annual interest expense by $4.7 million before taxes. This amount is limited based on the LIBOR locks that we have in place through the first quarter of 2004. If these locks were not in place, a 100 basis point change
in the interest rates would affect our annual interest expense by $8.7 million before taxes. This 100 basis point change assumes a parallel shift in the yield curve. If interest rates changed significantly, we would take actions to manage our
exposure to the change. Since a specific action and the possible effects are uncertain, no change has been assumed.

Value-at-Risk Disclosure of Market Risk

– We measure entity-wide market risk in our trading, price risk management, and our non-trading
portfolios using value-at-risk (VAR). Our VAR calculations are based on the Risk Works Monte Carlo approach, assuming a one-day holding period. We began using the Monte Carlo approach in the second quarter of 2002. Prior to that time, we used the
variance-co-variance approach. The quantification of market risk using VAR provides a consistent measure of risk across diverse energy markets and products with different risk factors in order to set overall risk tolerance, to determine risk targets
and set position limits. The use of this methodology requires a number of key assumptions, including the selection of a confidence level and the holding period to liquidation. Inputs to the calculation include prices, positions, instrument
valuations and the variance-co-variance matrix. Historical data is used to estimate our VAR with more weight given to recent data, which is considered a more relevant predictor of immediate future commodity market movements. We rely on VAR to
determine the potential reduction in the trading and price risk management portfolio values arising from changes in market conditions over a defined period. While management believes that the referenced assumptions and approximations are reasonable,
no uniform industry methodology exists for estimating VAR and different assumptions and approximations could produce materially different VAR estimates.

Our VAR exposure represents an estimate of potential losses that would be recognized for our trading and price risk management portfolio of derivative
financial instruments, physical contracts and gas in storage due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon within a specified confidence level. A one-day time horizon and a 95 percent confidence level were used in our VAR data. Actual
future gains and losses will differ from those estimated by the VAR calculation based on actual fluctuations in commodity prices, operating exposures and timing thereof, and the changes in the Company’s trading and price risk management
portfolio of derivative financial instruments and physical contracts. VAR information should be evaluated in light of this information and the methodology’s other limitations.



The potential impact on our
future earnings, as measured by the VAR, was $3.2 million and $5.1 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The following table details the average, high and low VAR calculations:

The variations in the
VAR data are reflective of our marketing and trading growth and market volatility during the year.

Risk Policy and Oversight

– We control the scope of risk management, marketing and trading operations through a comprehensive set of policies and procedures involving senior levels of
management. Our Board of Directors affirms the risk limit parameters with our audit committee having oversight responsibilities for the policies. A risk oversight committee, comprised of corporate and business segment officers, oversees all
activities related to commodity price, credit and interest rate risk management, marketing and trading activities. The committee also proposes risk metrics including VAR and position loss limits. We have a corporate risk control organization lead by
the Vice President of Risk Control, who is assigned responsibility for establishing and enforcing the policies, procedures and limits and evaluating the risks inherent in proposed transactions. Key risk control activities include credit review and
approval, credit and performance risk measurement and monitoring, validation of transactions, portfolio valuation, VAR and other risk metrics.

To the extent open commodity positions exist, fluctuating commodity prices can impact our financial results and financial position either favorably or
unfavorably. As a result, we cannot predict with precision the impact risk management decisions may have on the business, operating results or financial position.



ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders

ONEOK, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of ONEOK, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2002 and 2001 and the related consolidated
statements of income, shareholders’ equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2002. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of ONEOK, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
December 31, 2002, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

As discussed in Notes A, D and F to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets, effective January 1, 2002, the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, effective January 1, 2001 and the provisions of Emerging Issues Task Force 98-10,

SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Nature of Operations

– ONEOK, Inc. and subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company” or “ONEOK”) is a diversified energy
company engaged in the production, processing, gathering, storage, transportation, distribution, and marketing of natural gas, electricity and natural gas liquids. The Company manages its business in six segments: Marketing and Trading, Gathering
and Processing, Transportation and Storage, Distribution, Production and Other.

The Marketing and Trading segment markets natural gas to wholesale and retail customers and markets electricity to wholesale customers. The Company owns and operates gas processing plants, as well as gathering pipelines in Oklahoma,
Kansas and Texas through its Gathering and Processing segment. The Transportation and Storage segment owns and leases natural gas storage facilities and transports gas in Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas. The Company’s Distribution segment provides
natural gas distribution services in Oklahoma and Kansas through its divisions Oklahoma Natural Gas Company (ONG) and Kansas Gas Service Company (KGS), respectively. The Production segment produces natural gas and oil and owns natural gas and oil
reserves. The Company’s Other segment, whose results of operations are not material, operates and leases the Company’s headquarters building and parking facility.

Critical Accounting Policies

Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities

– The Company engages in price risk management activities for both
trading and non-trading purposes. On January 1, 2000, the Company adopted Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 98-10, “Accounting for Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities” (EITF 98-10) for its energy trading contracts. EITF 98-10
requires entities involved in energy trading activities to account for energy trading contracts using mark-to-market accounting. The adoption of EITF 98-10 was accounted for as a change in accounting principle and the cumulative effect at January 1,
2000 of $2.1 million, net of tax, was recognized. Forwards, swaps, options, and energy transportation and storage contracts utilized for trading activities are reflected at fair value as assets and liabilities from price risk management activities
in the consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of these assets and liabilities are affected by the actual timing of settlements related to these contracts and current period changes resulting primarily from newly originated transactions and the
impact of price movements. Changes in fair value are recognized in energy trading revenues, in the consolidated statements of income. Market prices used to determine fair value of these assets and liabilities reflect management’s best estimate
considering various factors including closing exchange and over-the-counter quotations, time value and volatility underlying the commitments. Market prices are adjusted for the potential impact of liquidating our position in an orderly manner over a
reasonable period of time under present market conditions.

During the third quarter of 2002, the Company adopted the applicable provisions of Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 02-3, “Issues Involved in Accounting for Derivative Contracts Held for Trading Purposes and Contracts
Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities” (EITF 02-3). EITF 02-3 provides that all mark-to-market gains and losses on energy trading contracts should be presented on a net basis (energy contract sales less energy contract
costs) in the income statement without regard to the settlement provisions of the contract. Prior to the third quarter of 2002, energy trading revenues and costs were presented on a gross basis. The historical financial results of all energy trading
contracts have been restated to reflect the adoption of EITF 02-3. Energy trading revenues include natural gas, reservation fees, crude oil, natural gas liquids, and basis. Basis is the natural gas price differential that exists between two trading
locations relative to the Henry Hub price.

In October 2002, the
Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) rescinded EITF 98-10. As a result, energy-related contracts that are not accounted for pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133,
“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” (Statement 133), will no longer be carried at fair value, but rather will be accounted for as executory contracts and accounted for on an accrual basis. As a result of the
rescission of this statement, the EITF also agreed that energy trading inventories carried under storage agreements should no longer be carried at fair value, but should be carried at the lower of cost or market.

The rescission is effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 31,
2002 and for all existing energy trading contracts and inventory as of October 25, 2002, and will be applied in periods beginning after December 15, 2002. Additionally, the rescission applies immediately to contracts entered into on or after October
25, 2002. Changes to the accounting for existing contracts as a result of the rescission of EITF 98-10 will be reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle on January 1, 2003. At this time, the Company estimates this will
result in a cumulative effect loss, net of tax, of approximately $141.0 million. Any impact from this change will be non-cash and may be recovered in energy trading



operating income in future periods. The impact of adopting the rescission of EITF 98-10 will be included
in the March 31, 2003 financial statements. For further discussion, see Note D.

Regulation

– The Company’s intrastate transmission pipelines and distribution operations are subject to the rate regulation and accounting requirements of the Oklahoma Corporation Commission (OCC), Kansas Corporation
Commission (KCC) and Texas Railroad Commission (TRC). Certain other transportation activities of the Company are subject to regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). ONG, KGS and portions of the Transportation and Storage
segment follow the accounting and reporting guidance contained in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, “Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation” (Statement 71). Allocation of costs and revenues to
accounting periods for rate-making and regulatory purposes may differ from bases generally applied by non-regulated operations. Such allocations to meet regulatory accounting requirements are considered to be generally accepted accounting principles
for regulated utilities, provided that there is a demonstrable ability to recover any deferred costs in future rates.

During the rate-making process, regulatory commissions may require a utility to defer recognition of certain costs to be recovered through rates over time
as opposed to expensing such costs as incurred. This allows the utility to stabilize rates over time rather than passing such costs on to the customer for immediate recovery. This causes certain expenses to be deferred as a regulatory asset and
amortized to expense as they are recovered through rates. Total regulatory assets resulting from this deferral process are approximately $218.0 million and $235.3 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Although no further unbundling of
services is anticipated, should this occur, certain of these assets may no longer meet the criteria for following Statement 71 and, accordingly, a write-off of regulatory assets and stranded costs may be required. However, the Company does not
anticipate that these costs, if any, will be significant. See Note E.

KGS was subject to a three-year rate moratorium, which was set to expire in November 2000. As a result of implementing a weather normalization mechanism in Kansas, KGS agreed to a two-year extension of the rate moratorium. The
extended rate moratorium expired in late November 2002 and KGS filed a rate case with the KCC on January 31, 2003. KGS expects the regulatory approval process to take approximately eight months. Until a final order is received, KGS will operate
under the current rate schedule. ONG is not subject to a rate moratorium.

Impairments

– The Company accounts for the impairment of long-lived assets when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the assets carrying amount. The impairment
loss is measured by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying amount. Fair values are based on discounted future cash flows or information provided by sales and purchases of similar assets. The Company evaluates impairment of assets on
the lowest possible level.

Significant Accounting Policies

Consolidation

– The consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of ONEOK, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Investments in 20 percent to 50 percent-owned affiliates are accounted
for on the equity method. Investments in less than twenty percent owned affiliates are accounted for on the cost method.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

– Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments, which are readily convertible into cash and have original
maturities of three months or less.

Inventories

–
Materials and supplies are valued at average cost. Noncurrent gas in storage is classified as property and is valued at cost. The Marketing and Trading segment’s gas in storage, which is recorded in current price risk management assets, is
carried at fair value. Cost of current gas in storage for ONG is determined under the last-in, first-out (LIFO) methodology. The estimated replacement cost of current gas in storage valued under the LIFO method was $2.5 million and $1.3 million at
December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, compared to its value under the LIFO method of $2.3 million and $3.0 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Current gas in storage for all other companies is determined using the weighted
average cost of gas method.

Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities

– To minimize the risk from fluctuations in the price of natural gas and crude oil, the Company’s non-trading segments periodically enter into futures transactions, swaps, and options in order to hedge anticipated
sales of natural gas and crude oil production, fuel requirements and inventories in its natural gas liquids business. Interest rate swaps are also used to manage interest rate risk.



Prior to 2001, in order to
qualify as a hedge, the price movements in the underlying commodity derivatives had to be sufficiently correlated with the hedged transaction. Gains and losses from hedging transactions were recognized in income and reflected as cash flows from
operating activities in the periods for which the underlying commodity or interest rate transactions were hedged. If the necessary correlation to the commodity or interest rate transaction being hedged was not maintained, the Company ceased to
account for the contract as a hedge and recognized a gain or loss in current earnings to the extent the contract results had not been offset by the effects of the price or interest rate changes on the hedged item. If the underlying commodity or
interest rate transaction being hedged by the derivative was disposed of or otherwise terminated, the gain or loss associated with such derivatives was no longer deferred and was recognized in the period the underlying was eliminated.

On January 1, 2001, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement 133,
amended by Statement No. 137 and Statement No. 138. Statement 137 delayed the implementation of Statement 133 until fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000. Statement 138 amended the accounting and reporting standards of Statement 133 for certain
derivative instruments and hedging activities. Statement 138 also amends Statement 133 for decisions made by the FASB relating to the Derivatives Implementation Group (DIG) process.

Under Statement 133, entities are required to record all derivative instruments in the balance sheet at fair value. The
accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and, if so, on the reason for holding it. If certain conditions are met, entities may elect
to designate a derivative instrument as a hedge of exposures to changes in fair values, cash flows, or foreign currencies. If the hedged exposure is a fair value exposure, the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recognized in earnings in
the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged. If the hedged exposure is a cash flow exposure, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is
reported initially as a component of other comprehensive income (outside earnings) and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings. Any amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness, as well
as the ineffective portion of the hedge, are reported in earnings immediately. See Note D.

Regulated Property

– Regulated properties are stated at cost, which includes an allowance for funds used during construction. The allowance for funds used during construction represents the
capitalization of the estimated average cost of borrowed funds (6.4 percent and 6.0 percent in fiscal years 2002 and 2001, respectively) used during the construction of major projects and is recorded as a credit to interest expense.

Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method based upon rates
prescribed for ratemaking purposes. The average depreciation rate for property that is regulated by the OCC approximated 3.0 percent, 2.9 percent and 3.0 percent in fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The average depreciation rates for
properties regulated by the KCC, excluding Mid-Continent Market Center (MCMC), were approximately 3.4 percent, 3.4 percent and 3.3 percent in fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The average depreciation rates for MCMC properties were 3.6
percent, 3.4 percent and 3.3 percent in fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Maintenance and repairs are charged directly to expense. Generally, the cost of property retired or sold, plus removal costs, less salvage, is charged to accumulated depreciation. Gains and losses from sales or transfers of
operating units or systems are recognized in income.

The
following table sets forth the remaining life and service years of the Company’s regulated properties.

Remaining

Production
Property

– The Company uses the successful-efforts method to account for costs incurred in the acquisition and development of natural gas and oil reserves. Costs to acquire mineral interests in proved reserves and to drill and equip
development wells are capitalized. Geological and geophysical costs and costs to drill exploratory wells which do not find proved reserves are expensed. Unproved oil and gas properties, which are individually significant, are periodically assessed
for impairment. The remaining unproved oil and gas properties are aggregated and amortized based upon remaining lease terms and exploratory and developmental drilling experience. Depreciation and depletion are calculated using the unit-of-production
method based upon periodic estimates of proved oil and gas reserves.



Other Property

–
Gas processing plants and all other properties are stated at cost. Gas processing plants are depreciated using various rates based on estimated lives of available gas reserves. All other property and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line
method over its estimated useful life.

Goodwill

–
Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of net assets acquired. The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” (Statement 142) on January 1, 2002.
Under Statement 142, goodwill is no longer amortized but reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if certain indicators arise. See Note F.

Environmental Expenditures

– The Company accrues for losses associated with environmental remediation obligations when such losses are
probable and reasonably estimable. Accruals for estimated losses from environmental remediation obligations generally are recognized no later than completion of the remedial feasibility study. Such accruals are adjusted as further information
develops or circumstances change. Recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recorded as assets when their receipt is deemed probable.

Revenue Recognition

– The Company’s Marketing and Trading, Gathering and Processing, Transportation and
Storage, and Distribution segments recognize revenue when services are rendered or product is delivered. Major industrial and commercial gas distribution customers are invoiced as of the end of each month. Certain gas distribution customers,
primarily residential and some commercial, are invoiced on a cycle basis throughout the month, and the Company accrues unbilled revenues at the end of each month. ONG’s and KGS’s tariff rates for residential and commercial customers
contain a temperature normalization clause that provides for billing adjustments from actual volumes to normalized volumes during the winter heating season.

Revenues from the Production segment are recognized on the sales method when oil and gas production volumes are delivered to the purchaser.

Income Taxes

– Deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax
consequences of “temporary differences” by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities. The effect on
deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is deferred and amortized for operations regulated by the OCC and KCC and for all other operations, is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company continues to amortize
previously deferred investment tax credits over the period prescribed by the OCC and KCC for ratemaking purposes.

Common Stock Options and Awards

– At December 31, 2002, the Company has stock-based compensation plans, which are described more fully in Note
R. The Company accounts for the plans under the recognition and measurement principles of APB Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees” (APB 25), and related Interpretations. The following table sets forth the effect on
net income and earnings per share if the Company had applied the fair-value recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” (Statement 123) to stock-based employee
compensation.



Earnings Per Common
Share

– In accordance with a pronouncement of the FASB’s Staff at the EITF meeting in April 2001, codified as EITF Topic No. D-95 (Topic D-95), the Company revised its computation of earnings per common share (EPS). In accordance with
Topic D-95, the dilutive effect of the Company’s Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is now considered in the computation of basic EPS, utilizing the “if-converted” method. Under the Company’s “if-converted” method,
the dilutive effect of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock on EPS cannot be less than the amount that would result from the application of the “two-class” method of computing EPS. The “two-class” method is an earnings
allocation formula that determines EPS for the common stock and the participating Series A Convertible Preferred Stock according to dividends declared and participating rights in the undistributed earnings. The Series A Convertible Preferred Stock
is a participating instrument with the Company’s common stock with respect to the payment of dividends. For all periods presented, the “two-class” method resulted in additional dilution. Accordingly, EPS for such periods reflects this
further dilution. The Company restated the EPS amounts for all periods to be consistent with the revised methodology. See Note S.

As a result of the Company’s repurchase and exchange of its Series A Convertible Preferred Stock with Westar Industries in February 2003, the Company
will no longer apply the provisions of Topic D-95 to its EPS computation for periods beginning February 2003. See Note W.

Labor Force

– The Company employed approximately 3,600 persons at December 31, 2002. Approximately 23 percent of the workforce, all of whom
are employed by KGS, are covered by collective bargaining agreements that will expire in 2003.

Use of Estimates

– Certain amounts included in or affecting the Company’s financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated, requiring the Company to make certain
assumptions with respect to values or conditions which cannot be known with certainty at the time the financial statements are prepared. Items which may be estimated include, but are not limited to, the economic useful life of assets, fair value of
assets and liabilities, obligations under employee benefit plans, provisions for uncollectible accounts receivable, unbilled revenues for gas delivered but for which meters have not been read, gas purchased expense for gas received but for which no
invoice has been received, the results of litigation and various other recorded or disclosed amounts. Accordingly, the reported amounts of the Company’s assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures are necessarily
affected by these estimates.

The Company evaluates these
estimates on an ongoing basis using historical experience, consultation with experts and other methods the Company considers reasonable in the particular circumstances. Nevertheless, actual results may differ significantly from the estimates. Any
effects on the Company’s financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known.

Reclassifications

– Certain amounts in prior period consolidated
financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the 2002 presentation.



(B) ACQUISITIONS AND
DISPOSITIONS

In December 2002, the Company sold of some of
its midstream natural gas assets for a purchase price of approximately $92 million to an affiliate of Mustang Fuel Corporation, a private, independent oil and gas company. The assets that were sold are located in north central Oklahoma and include
three processing plants and related gathering systems and the Company’s interest in a fourth processing plant. The sale of these assets is part of the Company’s strategy to dispose of assets that are not considered core assets for its
future.

In the second quarter of 2002, the Company sold the
majority of its investment in Magnum Hunter Resources (MHR) for a pre-tax gain of approximately $7.6 million, which is included in other income in the Other segment for the year ended December 31, 2002. The Company retained approximately 1.5 million
stock purchase warrants.

On April 5, 2000, the Company acquired
certain natural gas gathering and processing assets located in Oklahoma, Kansas and western Texas from Kinder Morgan, Inc. (KMI). The Company also acquired KMI’s marketing and trading operations, as well as some storage and transmission
pipelines in the mid-continent region. The Company paid approximately $123.5 million for these assets and also assumed certain liabilities, including $157.7 million for an uneconomic lease obligation. The Company also assumed some firm capacity
lease obligations to unaffiliated parties for which the Company established a reserve of approximately $220.1 million for out-of-market terms of those obligations. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase. The results of operations of this
acquisition are included in the consolidated statement of income subsequent to the purchase date.

In June 2001, the Company sold its forty percent interest in K. Stewart Petroleum Corporation, a privately held exploration company, for a sales price of $7.7 million.

In March 2000, the Company completed the sale of its 42.4 percent partnership
interest in Indian Basin Gas Processing Plant and gathering system for $55 million, resulting in a gain of approximately $26.7 million, which is included in other income in the Gathering and Processing segment.

In March 2000, the Company completed the acquisition of assets located in
Oklahoma, Kansas, and the Texas panhandle from Dynegy, Inc. for $305 million. The assets include gathering systems, gas processing facilities, and transmission pipelines.

On January 20, 2000, the Board of Directors of the Company voted unanimously to terminate the merger agreement with Southwest
Gas Corporation (Southwest) in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement. In 2002, the Company accrued $5.0 million and paid $3.0 million for settlement of certain claims related to this terminated merger and expensed $2.1 million of ongoing
litigation costs. In 2001, the Company expensed $3.7 million of ongoing litigation costs. In 2000, the Company expensed $13.7 million of previously deferred transaction and litigation costs. These costs were recorded to other expense for all
periods. See Note M.

(C)

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

In November 2002, the Company agreed to sell approximately 70 percent of the natural gas and oil producing properties of its Production segment (the
component) for $300 million cash, subject to adjustment. The component is accounted for as a discontinued operation in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144 “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets” (Statement 144). Accordingly, amounts in the financial statements and related notes for all periods shown reflect discontinued operations accounting. The Company’s decision to sell the component was based on strategic evaluations
of the Production segment goals and favorable market conditions. The sale was completed in January 2003 and the Company recognized a pretax gain on the sale of the discontinued component of approximately $74.4 million in the first quarter of 2003.

The amounts of revenue, costs and income taxes reported in
discontinued operations are as follows:



The major classes of
discontinued assets and liabilities included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet are as follows:

PRICE RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Market risks are monitored by a risk control group that operates independently from the operating segments that create or
actively manage these risk exposures. The risk control group ensures compliance with the Company’s risk management policies.

Risk Policy and Oversight

– The Company controls the scope of risk management, marketing and trading operations through a comprehensive set of
policies and procedures involving senior levels of management. The Company’s Board of Directors affirms the risk limit parameters with its audit committee having oversight responsibilities for the policies. A risk oversight committee, comprised
of corporate and business segment officers, oversees all activities related to commodity price, credit and interest rate risk management, marketing and trading activities. The committee also proposes risk metrics including value-at-risk (VAR) and
position loss limits. The Company has a corporate risk control organization led by the



Vice President of Risk
Control, which is assigned responsibility for establishing and enforcing the policies, procedures and limits and evaluating the risks inherent in proposed transactions. Key risk control activities include credit review and approval, credit and
performance risk measurement and monitoring, validation of transactions, portfolio valuation, VAR and other risk metrics.

To the extent open commodity positions exist, fluctuating commodity prices can impact the financial results and financial position of the Company either
favorably or unfavorably. As a result, the Company cannot predict with precision the impact risk management decisions may have on the business, operating results or financial position.

Trading Activities

The Company’s operating results are impacted by commodity price fluctuations. The Company routinely enters into derivative financial instruments in
order to minimize the risk of commodity price fluctuations related to its purchase and sale commitments, fuel requirements, transportation and storage contracts and inventories in its natural gas marketing and trading business.

The Marketing and Trading segment includes the Company’s wholesale and
retail natural gas marketing and trading operations. The Marketing and Trading segment generally attempts to balance its fixed-price physical and financial purchase and sales commitments in terms of contract volumes and the timing of performance and
delivery obligations. To the extent a net open position exists, fluctuating commodity market prices can impact the Company’s financial position and results of operations, either favorably or unfavorably. The net open positions are actively
managed and the impact of the changing prices on the Company’s financial condition at a point in time is not necessarily indicative of the impact of price movements throughout the year.

Fair value

– The fair value and the average fair value of
derivative financial instruments, purchase and sale commitments, fuel requirements, transportation and storage contracts and inventories related to trading price risk management activities held during 2002 and 2001 are set forth as follows:

The Company did not hold any other commodity-type contracts for trading price risk management purposes at December 31, 2002.

Notional value

– The notional contractual quantities associated
with trading price risk management activities are set forth as follows:



The Company expanded its
traded products to include natural gas liquids and the related derivative components including ethane and propane during 2002.

Notional amounts reflect the volume and indicated activity of transactions, but do not represent the amounts exchanged by the parties or cash requirements
associated with these financial instruments. Accordingly, notional amounts do not accurately measure the Company’s exposure to market or credit risk.

Credit Risk

– In conjunction with the market valuation of its energy commodity contracts, the Company provides reserves for risks associated
with its contract commitments, including credit risk. Credit risk relates to the risk of loss that the Company would incur as a result of nonperformance by counterparties pursuant to the terms of their contractual obligations. The Company maintains
credit policies with regard to its counterparties that management believes significantly minimize overall credit risk. These policies include an evaluation of potential counterparties’ financial condition (including credit ratings), collateral
requirements under certain circumstances and the use of standardized agreements which allow for netting of positive and negative exposures associated with a single counterparty.

Counterparties in its trading portfolio consist primarily of financial institutions, major energy companies, and local
distribution companies. This concentration of counterparties may impact the Company’s overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively in that the counterparties may be similarly affected by changes in economic, regulatory or
other conditions. Based on the Company’s policies, its exposures and its credit and other reserves, the Company does not anticipate a material adverse effect on financial position or results of operations as a result of counterparty
nonperformance.

Non-Trading Activities

Financial instruments are also utilized for non-trading purposes to hedge
natural gas and crude oil production anticipated sales, anticipated fuel requirements, and inventories in the natural gas liquids business to hedge the impact of fair value fluctuations. The Company is subject to the risk of fluctuation in interest
rates in the normal course of business. The Company manages interest rate risk through the use of fixed rate debt, floating rate debt and, at times, interest rate swaps.

Operating margins associated with the Gathering and Processing segment’s natural gas gathering, processing and
fractionation activities are sensitive to changes in natural gas liquids prices, principally as a result of contractual terms under which natural gas is processed and products are sold and the availability of inlet volumes. Also, certain processing
plant assets are impacted by changes in, and the relationship between, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices, which, in turn influences the volumes of gas processed.

In 2000, the Company entered into derivative instruments related to the production of natural gas, most of which expired in
2001. These derivative instruments were designed as cash flow hedges to hedge the Production segment’s exposure to changes in the price of natural gas. Changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments are reflected initially in other



comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently realized in earnings when the forecasted transaction affects
earnings. In 2000, the Company recorded a cumulative effect charge of $2.2 million, net of tax, in the income statement and $28 million, net of tax, in accumulated other comprehensive loss to recognize at fair value the ineffective and effective
portions, respectively, of the losses on all derivative instruments that were designated as cash flow hedging instruments, which primarily consisted of costless option collars and swaps on natural gas production.

The Company realized gains in earnings of approximately $3.9 million and
losses of $14.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, related to production hedges. The amounts are reported in operating revenues. Accumulated other comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2002, includes
approximately $0.9 million related to cash flow exposure for production hedges and will be realized in earnings within the next 24 months.

In July 2001, the Company entered into interest rate swaps, which were designated fair value hedges, on a total of $400 million in fixed rate long-term
debt. The interest rate under these swaps resets periodically based on the three-month LIBOR or the six-month LIBOR at the reset date. In October 2001, the Company entered into an agreement to lock in the interest rates for each reset period under
the swap agreements through the first quarter of 2003. In December 2001, the Company entered into interest rate swaps, which were designated fair value hedges, on a total of $200 million in fixed rate long-term debt. In January 2003, the rates were
locked through the first quarter of 2004. In 2002, the Company recorded a $79 million net increase in price risk management assets and liabilities to recognize the interest rate swaps at fair value. Long-term debt was also increased to recognize the
change in fair value of the related hedged liability. See Note K.

Fair value

– The following table represents the estimated fair values of derivative instruments related to the Company’s non-trading price risk management activities. The fair value is the carrying value for these
instruments at December 31, 2002 and 2001.

*

This excludes hedges related to the regulated entities as any income statement effect will be recovered through the cost of gas.

Notional value

– The Company was a party to natural gas commodity
derivative instruments including swaps and options covering 6.6 Bcf and 19.0 Bcf of natural gas for December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Credit Risk

– The Company maintains credit policies with regard to its counterparties that management believes significantly minimize overall
credit risk. These policies include an evaluation of potential counterparties’ financial condition (including credit ratings), collateral requirements under certain circumstances and the use of standardized agreements which allow for netting of
positive and negative exposures associated with a single counterparty.

The counterparties to the non-trading instruments include large integrated energy companies. Accordingly, the Company does not anticipate a material adverse effect on financial position or results of operations as a result of
counterparty nonperformance.

Financial Instruments

The following table represents the carrying amounts and
estimated fair values of the Company’s financial instruments, excluding trading activities, which are marked to market, and non-trading commodity instruments, which are listed in the table above.



The fair value of cash
and cash equivalents, accounts and notes receivable and notes payable approximate book value due to their short-term nature. The estimated fair value of long-term debt has been determined using quoted market prices of the same or similar issues,
discounted cash flows, and/or rates currently available to the Company for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities.

(E)

REGULATORY ASSETS

The table presents a summary of regulatory assets, net of amortization, at December 31, 2002 and 2001.

The remaining recovery
period for these assets that the Company is not earning a return on is set forth in the table below.



The OCC directed ONG to assume
responsibility for, and ownership of, customer service lines and has authorized the Company to defer as regulatory assets the depreciation and operation and maintenance expenses incurred in connection with this plan. The recovery methodology,
amount, and calculation of these deferrals will be addressed in ONG’s next rate case filing. Through December 2002, the Company has deferred approximately $1.9 million associated with this Commission directive. These deferred costs are included
in the caption “Other” in the above table of regulatory assets.

The OCC has authorized ONG to defer the incremental costs associated with a five-year cathodic protection program to be implemented to comply with the OCC’s Pipeline Safety Department inspection reports. The recovery methodology
and amount of these deferred expenses will be addressed in ONG’s next rate case filing. Through December 2002, the Company has deferred approximately $2.8 million associated with this program. These deferred costs are included in the caption
“Other” in the above table of regulatory assets.

The
OCC has authorized recovery of the take-or-pay settlement, pension and postretirement benefit costs over a 10 to 20 year period. KGS has been deferring and recording postretirement benefits in excess of pay-as-you-go as a regulatory asset as
authorized by the KCC. KGS included this regulatory asset in the rate case filing with the KCC in January 2003. See Note W.

The KCC has allowed certain transition costs to be amortized and recovered in rates over a 40-year period with no rate of return on the unrecovered
balance. Management believes that all transition costs recorded as a regulatory asset will be recovered through rates based on the accounting orders received and regulatory precedents established by the KCC. These costs were included in the rate
case filing with the KCC in January 2003.

The Company amortizes
reacquired debt costs in accordance with the accounting rules prescribed by the OCC and KCC. These costs were included as a component of interest in the most recent rate filing with the OCC and were included in the rate filing with the KCC in
January 2003.

In accordance with various rate orders received
from the KCC, KGS has not yet collected through rates the amounts necessary to pay a significant portion of the net deferred income tax liabilities. As management believes it is probable that the net future increases in income taxes payable will be
recovered from customers, it has recorded a regulatory asset for these amounts. KGS included the net deferred income tax liabilities in the rate case filed with the KCC in January 2003.

The KCC authorized deferral of weather normalization costs in 2000. In 2001, the KCC authorized deferral of line replacement
costs related to the re-piping of certain mobile home parks in Kansas. KGS included the weather normalization rider and the line replacement costs in the rate case filed with the KCC in January 2003.

Recovery through rates resulted in amortization of regulatory assets of
approximately $11.9 million, $11.3 million and $10.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

(F)

GOODWILL

The Company adopted Statement 142 on January 1, 2002. Under Statement 142, goodwill is no longer amortized but reviewed for impairment annually or more
frequently if certain indicators arise. Statement 142 prescribes a two phase process for testing the impairment of goodwill. The first phase identifies indicators of impairment. If an impairment is indicated, the second phase measures the
impairment. In accordance with the provisions of Statement 142, the Company has performed the first of the required impairment tests of goodwill and, based upon this transition impairment test, no impairment to goodwill was indicated and the Company
did not record a charge in connection with the adoption of Statement 142. The Company will perform its annual test of goodwill as of January 1, 2003. Had the Company been accounting for its goodwill under Statement 142 for all periods presented, the
Company’s net income and earnings per share would have been as follows:



The changes in the
carrying amount of goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 are as follows:

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

The table below gives an overview of comprehensive income for the periods indicated.



Accumulated other
comprehensive loss of $5.5 million at December 31, 2002, includes unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments and minimum pension liability adjustments.

CAPITAL STOCK

Series A Convertible Preferred Stock

– The Company issued Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, at the time of the
November 1997 transaction with Westar Energy Corp. (formerly Western Resources, Inc.). On February 5, 2003, the Company repurchased from Westar Industries approximately 9 million shares (approximately 18.1 million shares of common stock equivalents)
of its Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. The Company exchanged the remaining shares for 21.8 million shares of its newly-created Series D Convertible Preferred Stock. See Note W.

The terms of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock provide that holders are entitled to receive a dividend payment, with
respect to each dividend period of the common stock, equal to 3.0 times the dividend amount declared in respect of each share of common stock for the first five years of the agreement. In November 2002, the rate was reduced to 2.5 times the dividend
amount declared in respect to each share of common stock, and at no time can the dividend be less than $1.80 per share on an aggregate annual basis. The dividend multiple was adjusted to reflect the 2001 two-for-one common stock split. Preferential
cash dividends are paid quarterly on each share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, but those dividends are not cumulative to the extent they are not paid on any dividend payment date.

The Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is convertible, subject to certain
restrictions, at the option of the holder, into ONEOK, Inc. Common Stock at the rate of two shares for each share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock.

The liquidation preference of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is equal to that payable per share of the Company’s Common Stock, as adjusted
to reflect any stock split or similar events, assuming conversion of all outstanding shares of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock immediately prior to the event triggering the liquidation preference, plus any dividends.

Holders of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock are entitled to vote together
with holders of the Company’s Common Stock with respect to certain matters. Holders of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock cannot vote in any election of directors to the Company’s Board of Directors or on any matter submitted to the
Company’s shareholders other than those previously discussed and other matters as required by law.

Series B Convertible Preferred Stock

– The terms of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock are the same as Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, except that the dividend amount is equal to
the greater of 2.5 times the common stock dividend, and at no time could the dividend be less than $1.50 per share on an aggregate annual basis during the first five years after the agreement, which ended November 27, 2002, and not less than $1.80
on an aggregate annual basis thereafter. There are no shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock currently outstanding.



Series C Preferred
Stock

– Series C Preferred Stock is designed to protect ONEOK, Inc. shareholders from coercive or unfair takeover tactics. Holders of Series C Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, in preference to the holders of ONEOK Common Stock,
quarterly dividends in an amount per share equal to the greater of $0.50 or subject to adjustment, 100 times the aggregate per share amount of all cash dividends, and 100 times the aggregate per share amount (payable in kind) of all non-cash
dividends. No Series C Preferred Stock has been issued.

Common Stock

– At December 31, 2002, the Company had approximately 176 million shares of authorized and unreserved common stock available for issuance.

On January 18, 2001, the Company’s Board of Directors approved, and on May 17, 2001, the shareholders of the Company
voted in favor of, a two-for-one common stock split, which was effected through the issuance of one additional share of common stock for each share of common stock outstanding to holders of record on May 23, 2001, with distribution of the shares on
June 11, 2001. The Company retained the current par value of $0.01 per share for all shares of common stock. Shareholders’ equity reflects the stock split by reclassifying from Paid in Capital to Common Stock an amount equal to the cumulative
par value of the additional shares issued to effect the split. All share and per share amounts contained herein for all periods reflect this stock split. Outstanding convertible preferred stock is assumed to convert to common stock on a two-for-one
basis in the calculations of earnings per share.

The Board of
Directors has reserved 12.0 million shares of ONEOK, Inc.’s common stock for the Direct Stock Purchase and Dividend Reinvestment Plan, of which 188,000 shares, 424,000 shares and 190,000 shares were issued in fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively. In January 2001, the Company amended and restated, in its entirety, the existing Direct Stock Purchase and Dividend Reinvestment Plan. The Company has reserved approximately 13.2 million shares for the Thrift Plan for Employees of
ONEOK, Inc. and Subsidiaries, less the number of shares issued to date under this plan.

During 1999, the Company initiated a stock buyback plan for up to 15 percent of its capital stock. The program authorized the Company to make purchases of its common stock on the open market with the timing and terms of
purchases and the number of shares purchased to be determined by management based on market conditions and other factors. Through April 30, 2001, the shares purchased under this plan totaled 5.1 million, which has been adjusted for the two-for-one
stock split. The purchased shares are held in treasury and available for general corporate purposes, funding of stock-based compensation plans, and resale at a future date, or retirement. Purchases were financed with short-term debt or were made
from available funds. This plan expired in 2001.

During 2001,
the Company began a second stock buyback plan for up to 10 percent of its capital stock. The program authorized the Company to make purchases of its common stock on the open market with the timing and terms of purchases and the number of shares
purchased to be determined by management based on market conditions and other factors. The purchased shares are held in treasury and available for general corporate purposes, funding of stock-based compensation plans, and resale at a future date, or
retirement. This plan expired in 2002. At that time, the Company had not purchased any stock under this plan.

Under the most restrictive covenants of the Company’s loan agreements, $364.1 million (72 percent) of retained earnings were available to pay dividends at December 31, 2002. Under the
Company’s existing credit agreement, it is restricted from declaring or making any dividend payment, directly or indirectly, or incurring any obligation to do so unless the aggregate amount so declared, paid or expended after August 31, 1998,
would not exceed an amount equal to 100 percent of our net income arising after August 31, 1998, plus $125 million and computed on a cumulative consolidated basis with other such transactions by the Company. The Company’s credit agreement
contains no restrictions on the transfer of assets of its subsidiaries to ONEOK (the parent company) in the form of loans, advances or cash dividends without the consent of a third party.

(I)

PAID IN CAPITAL

Paid in capital was $339.7 million and $338.1 million for common stock at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Paid in capital for convertible
preferred stock was $564.2 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001.

(J)

LINES OF CREDIT AND SHORT-TERM NOTES PAYABLE

Commercial paper and short-term notes payable totaling $265.5 million was outstanding at December 31, 2002. Commercial paper and short-term notes payable
totaling $599.1 million were outstanding at December 31, 2001. The commercial paper and notes carried average interest rates of 1.99 percent and 4.25 percent at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The



Company has a $850 million short-term unsecured revolving credit facility, which provides a back-up line
of credit for commercial paper in addition to providing short-term funds. Interest rates and facility fees are based on prevailing market rates and the Company’s credit ratings. No amounts were outstanding under the line of credit and no
compensating balance requirements existed at December 31, 2002. Maximum short-term debt from all sources as approved by the Company’s Board of Directors is $1.2 billion.

(K)

LONG-TERM DEBT

The aggregate maturities of long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2002, are $6.3 million; $6.3 million; $356.3 million; $306.3 million; and $6.3
million for 2003 through 2007, respectively, including $6.0 million, which is callable at the option of the holder in each of those years, and $187.0 million, which becomes callable at par at the option of ONEOK during 2003.

In January 2003, the Company issued long-term debt concurrent with its public
equity offering. See Note W.

In June 2002, the Company issued
$3.5 million of long-term variable rate debt, which is secured by the corporate airplane, at an interest rate of 1.25 percent over London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR). All remaining long-term notes payable are unsecured. In August 2002, the
Company completed a tender offer to purchase all of the outstanding 8.44% Senior Notes due 2004 and the 8.32% Senior Notes due 2007 for a total purchase price of approximately $65 million. The total purchase price included a premium of approximately
$2.9 million and consent fees of approximately $1.8 million to purchase the notes, which are reflected in interest expense in the income statement. In April 2002, the Company retired $240 million of two-year floating rate notes that were issued in
April 2000. The interest rate for these notes reset quarterly at a 0.65 percent spread over the three month LIBOR. The proceeds from the notes were used to fund acquisitions. In 2001, the Company issued a $400 million note at a rate of 7.125%. The
proceeds from the note were used to refinance short-term debt.

The Company is subject to the risk of fluctuation in interest rates in the normal course of business. The Company manages interest rate risk through the use of fixed rate debt, floating rate debt and, at times, interest rate swaps.
In July 2001, the Company entered into interest rate swaps on a total of $400 million in fixed rate long-term debt. The interest rate under these swaps resets periodically based on the three-month LIBOR or the six-month LIBOR at the reset date. In
October 2001, the Company entered into an agreement to lock in the interest rates for each reset period under the swap agreements through the first quarter of 2003. In December 2001, the Company entered into interest rate swaps on a total of $200
million in fixed rate long-term debt. In January 2003, the rates were locked through the first quarter of 2004. In 2002, the Company recorded a $79.0 million net increase in price risk management assets to recognize at fair value its derivatives
that are designated as fair value hedging instruments. Long-term debt was increased by approximately $78.3 million to recognize the change in fair value of the related hedged liability. The swaps generated $20.6 million of interest rate savings
during 2002. See further discussion of interest rate risk in Note D.

The following table sets forth the Company’s Long-Term Debt for the periods indicated.



The Company’s
Revolving Credit Facility has customary covenants that relate to liens, investments, fundamental changes in the business, the restriction of certain payments, changes in the nature of the business, transactions with affiliates, burdensome
agreements, the use of the proceeds, and a limit on the Company’s debt to capital ratio. Other debt agreements have negative covenants that relate to liens and sale/leaseback transactions. At December 31, 2002, the Company was in compliance
with all covenants.

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

Retirement Plans

– The Company has defined benefit and defined contribution retirement plans covering substantially all employees. Company
officers and certain key employees are also eligible to participate in supplemental retirement plans. The Company generally funds pension costs at a level equal to the minimum amount required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974.

Other Postretirement Benefit Plans

– The
Company sponsors welfare care plans that provide postretirement medical benefits and life insurance benefits to substantially all employees who retire under the Retirement Plans with at least five years of service. Non-bargaining unit employees
retiring between the ages of 50 and 55 have access only to Company provided medical benefits. Non-bargaining unit employees retiring at age 55 or older are eligible for both the Company provided medical and life insurance benefits. The plans are
contributory, with retiree contributions adjusted periodically, and contain other cost-sharing features such as deductibles and coinsurance.

The Company elected to delay recognition of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO) and amortize it over 20 years as a component of net
periodic postretirement benefit cost.

The following tables set
forth the Company’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans benefit obligations, fair value of plan assets, and funded status at December 31, 2002 and 2001.





For measurement
purposes, a 10 percent annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered medical benefits (i.e., medical cost trend rate) was assumed for 2002. The rate was assumed to decrease gradually to 5 percent by the year 2007 and remain at that level
thereafter. The medical cost trend rate assumption has a significant effect on the amounts reported. For example, increasing the assumed medical cost trend by one percentage point in each year would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation as of December 31, 2002, by $15.0 million and the aggregate of the service and interest cost components of net periodic postretirement benefit cost for the year ended December 31, 2002, by $1.5 million. Decreasing the assumed medical cost
trend by one percentage point in each year would decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2002, by $12.4 million and the aggregate of the service and interest cost components of net periodic postretirement
benefit cost for the year ended December 31, 2002, by $1.2 million.

Employee Thrift Plan

– The Company has a Thrift Plan covering substantially all employees. Employee contributions are discretionary. Subject to certain limits, the Company matches employee contributions. The cost of the
plan was $8.5 million, $8.8 million and $6.7 million in fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Postemployment Benefits

– The Company pays postemployment benefits to former or inactive employees after employment but before normal retirement in compliance with specific separation
agreements. Employees hired after January 1, 1999 are not eligible for this benefit.

Regulatory Treatment

– The OCC has approved the recovery of ONG pension costs and other postretirement benefit costs through rates. The costs recovered through rates are based on current funding requirements and
the net periodic postretirement benefit cost for pension and postretirement costs, respectively. Differences, if any, between the expense and the amount ordered through rates are charged to earnings.

Prior to the acquisition of the assets regulated by the KCC in fiscal 1998,
Western Resources, Inc. had established a corporate-owned life insurance (“COLI”) program that it believed in the long term would offset the expenses of its postretirement and postemployment benefit plans. Accordingly, the KCC issued an
order permitting the deferral of postretirement and postemployment benefit expenses in excess of amounts recognized on a pay-as-you-go basis. The Company did not acquire the COLI program. In connection with the KCC’s approval of the
acquisition, the KCC granted the Company the benefit of all previous accounting orders issued to Western and requested that the Company submit a plan of recovery either through a general rate increase or through specific cost savings or revenue
increases. Based on regulatory precedents established by the KCC and the accounting order, which permits the Company to seek recovery through rates, management believes that it is probable that accrued postretirement and postemployment benefits can
be recovered in rates. The Company filed for recovery of these costs in the rate case filed with the KCC in January 2003 requesting recovery over a period not to exceed approximately 10 years. If these costs cannot be recovered in rates charged to
customers, the Company would be required to record a one-time charge to expense for a portion of the regulatory asset established for postretirement and postemployment benefit costs totaling approximately $49.2 million at December 31, 2002.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Leases

– The initial term of the Company’s headquarters building, ONEOK Plaza, is for 25 years, expiring in 2009, with six five-year
renewal options. At the end of the initial term or any renewal period, the Company can purchase the property at its fair market value. Annual rent expense for the lease will be approximately $6.8 million until 2009. Rent payments were $9.3 million
in fiscal years 2002, 2001 and 2000. Estimated future minimum rental payments for the lease are $9.3 million for each of the years ending December 31, 2003 through 2009.



The Company has the right to sublet excess office space in ONEOK Plaza. The Company received rental revenue of $3.2 million in fiscal year 2002 and $3.5 million in fiscal years 2001 and 2000 for
various subleases. Estimated minimum future rental payments to be received under existing contracts for subleases are $3.0 million in 2003, $2.5 million in 2004, $1.8 million in 2005, $1.3 million in 2006, $0.5 million in 2007 and a total of $0.7
million thereafter.

Other operating leases include a gas
processing plant, office buildings, and equipment. Future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases (with initial or remaining lease terms in excess of one year) as of December 31, 2002, are $29.9 million in 2003, $26.1 million in
2004, $27.5 million in 2005, $40.7 million in 2006 and $26.7 million in 2007. The above amounts include lease payments for auto leases that are accounted for as operating leases but are treated as capital leases for income tax purposes. Also, the
above amounts include the following minimum lease payments relating to the lease of a gas processing plant: $16.2 million in 2003, $20.9 million in 2004, $24.2 million in 2005, $37.7 million in 2006 and $24.2 million in 2007. The Company has a
liability for uneconomic lease terms relating to the gas processing plant, which was acquired from KMI. Accordingly, the liability is amortized to rent expense in the amount of $13.0 million per year over the term of the lease. The amortization of
the liability reduces rent expense; however, the cash outflow under the lease remains the same.

Southwest Gas Corporation

– In May 1999, a series of lawsuits were filed in connection with the Company’s and Southern Union Company’s (Southern Union) failed attempts to merge
with Southwest. The Company, Southern Union and Southwest all sued each other and Southern Union made claims against a member of the Arizona Corporation Commission and other individuals, including officers and directors of the Company.

On August 9, 2002, the Company and Southwest settled their claims against each
other for a payment of $3.0 million by ONEOK to Southwest. On January 3, 2003, the Company entered into a definitive settlement agreement with Southern Union resolving all remaining legal issues. It also resolved the claims against John A. Gaberino,
Jr. and Eugene Dubay related to this matter. Under the terms of the settlement, the Company paid $5.0 million to Southern Union, which is included in the December 31, 2002 financial statements. The Company and its affiliated parties are released
from any claims against them brought by Southern Union related to the terminated acquisition of Southwest.

Two substantially identical derivative actions were filed by shareholders against members of the Board of Directors of the Company alleging violation of their fiduciary duties to the Company by causing
or allowing the Company to engage in certain fraudulent and improper schemes related to the planned acquisition of Southwest and waste of corporate assets. These two cases have been consolidated. They allege conduct by the Company caused the Company
to be sued by both Southwest and Southern Union, which exposed the Company to millions of dollars in liabilities. The plaintiffs seek an award of compensatory and punitive damages and costs, disbursements and reasonable attorney fees. The Company
and its independent directors and officers named as defendants filed Motions to Dismiss the action for failure of the plaintiffs to make a pre-suit demand on the Company’s Board of Directors. In addition, the independent directors and certain
officers filed Motions to Dismiss the action for failure to state a claim. On February 26, 2001, the action was stayed until one of the parties notifies the Court that a dissolution of the stay is requested.

Except as set forth above, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss
associated with these matters. If substantial damages were ultimately awarded, this could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows and financial position.

Environmental

– The Company has 12 manufactured gas sites located
in Kansas, which may contain potentially harmful materials that are classified as hazardous material. Hazardous materials are subject to control or remediation under various environmental laws and regulations. A consent agreement with the Kansas
Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) presently governs all future work at these sites. The terms of the consent agreement allow the Company to investigate these sites and set remediation priorities based upon the results of the investigations
and risk analysis. Remedial investigation has commenced on four sites. However, a comprehensive study is not complete and the results to date do not provide a sufficient basis for a reasonable estimation of the total liability. The liability accrued
is reflective of an estimate of the total cost of remedial investigation and feasibility study. Through December 31, 2002, the costs of the investigations and risk analysis related to these manufactured gas sites have been immaterial. The site
situations are not common and the Company has no previous experience with similar remediation efforts. The information currently available estimates the cost of remediation to range from $100,000 to $10 million per site based on a limited comparison
of costs incurred by others to remediate comparable sites. As such, the information provides an insufficient basis to reasonably estimate a minimum range of the Company’s liability. These estimates do not give effect to potential insurance
recoveries, recoveries through rates or from unaffiliated parties. At this time, the Company is not recovering any environmental amounts in rates. The KCC has permitted others to recover remediation costs through rates. It should be noted that
additional information and testing could



result in costs significantly
below or in excess of the amounts estimated above. To the extent that such remediation costs are not recovered, the costs could be material to the Company’s results of operations and cash flows depending on the remediation done and number of
years over which the remediation is completed.

Yaggy
Facility

– In January 2001, the Yaggy gas storage facility’s operating parameters were changed as mandated by the KDHE following natural gas explosions and eruptions of natural gas geysers in or near Hutchison, Kansas. In July 2002,
the KDHE issued an administrative order that assessed a $180,000 civil penalty against the Company, based on alleged violations of several KDHE regulations. A status conference was held on February 12, 2003, and another one has been scheduled for
April 10, 2003, regarding progress toward reaching an agreed consent order. The Company believes there are no long-term environmental effects from the Yaggy storage facility.

Two separate class action lawsuits have been filed against the Company in connection with the natural gas explosions and
eruptions of natural gas geysers that occurred in or near Hutchinson, Kansas in January 2001. These class action lawsuits were filed on the grounds that the eruptions and explosions related to natural gas that allegedly escaped from the Yaggy
storage facility. On January 17, 2003, the two-year statute of limitations for personal injury claims and all non-class members expired. In addition to the two class action matters, sixteen other cases have been filed against the Company or its
subsidiaries seeking recovery for various claims, including property damage, personal injury, loss of business and, in some instances, punitive damages. Although no assurances can be given, the Company believes that the ultimate resolution of these
matters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations. The Company’s insurance carrier in these cases represents the Company and its subsidiaries. The Company is vigorously defending itself against
all claims.

Other

– The OCC staff filed an
application on February 1, 2001, to review the gas procurement practices of ONG in acquiring its gas supply for the 2000/2001 heating season and to determine if these practices were consistent with least cost procurement practices and whether the
Company’s procurement decisions resulted in fair, just and reasonable costs being borne by ONG customers. In a hearing on October 31, 2001, the OCC issued an oral ruling that ONG not be allowed to recover the balance in the Company’s
unrecovered purchased gas cost (UPGC) account related to the unrecovered gas costs from the 2000/2001 winter. This was effective with the first billing cycle for the month following the issuance of a final order. A final order, issued on November
20, 2001, halted the recovery process effective December 1, 2001. On December 12, 2001, the OCC approved a request to stay the order and allowed ONG to begin collecting unrecovered gas costs, subject to refund had the Company ultimately lost the
case. In the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company took a charge of $34.6 million as a result of this order. In May 2002, the Company, along with the staff of the Public Utility Division and the Consumer Services Division of the OCC, the Oklahoma
Attorney General, and other stipulating parties, entered into a joint settlement agreement resolving this gas cost issue and ongoing litigation related to a contract with Dynamic Energy Resources, Inc.

The settlement agreement has a $33.7 million value to ONG customers that will
be realized over a three-year period. In July 2002, immediate cash savings were provided to all ONG customers in the form of billing credits totaling approximately $9.1 million, with an additional $1.0 million available for former customers
returning to the ONG system. If the additional $1.0 million is not fully refunded to customers returning to the ONG system by December 2005, the remainder will be included in the final billing credit. ONG is replacing certain gas contracts, which is
expected to reduce gas costs by approximately $13.8 million, due to avoided reservation fees between April 2003 and October 2005. Additional savings of approximately $8.0 million from the use of storage service in lieu of those contracts are
expected to occur between November 2003 and March 2005. Any expected savings from the use of storage that are not achieved, any remaining billing credits not issued to returning customers and an additional $1.8 million credit will be added to the
final billing credit scheduled to be provided to customers in December 2005. As a result of this settlement agreement, the Company revised its estimate of the charge taken in the fourth quarter of 2001 downward by $14.2 million to $20.4 million and
recorded the adjustment in the second quarter of 2002 as a decrease to cost of gas.

The Company is a party to other litigation matters and claims, which are normal in the course of its operations, and while the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes the
final outcome of such matters will not have a materially adverse effect on consolidated results of operations, financial position, or liquidity.

INCOME TAXES

The following table sets forth the Company’s provisions for income taxes for the periods indicated:



The following table is a
reconciliation of the Company’s provision for income taxes for the periods indicated.

The following table sets
forth the tax effects of temporary differences that gave rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and liabilities for the periods indicated.



The Company has
remaining net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately $26.2 million and $344.3 million, respectively, at December 31, 2002, which expire, unless previously utilized, at various dates through the year
2022. This includes federal carryforwards of $1.2 million and state carryforwards of $11.9 million related to the discontinued component. Management believes the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the
deferred tax assets. At December 31, 2002, the Company had $6.0 million in deferred investment tax credits recorded in other deferred credits, which will be amortized over the next 13 years.

(O)

SEGMENT INFORMATION

Management has divided its operations into six reportable segments based on similarities in economic characteristics, products and services, types of
customers, methods of distribution and regulatory environment. These segments are as follows: (1) the Marketing and Trading segment markets natural gas to wholesale and retail customers and markets electricity to wholesale customers; (2) the
Gathering and Processing segment gathers and processes natural gas and fractionates, stores and markets natural gas liquids; (3) the Transportation and Storage segment gathers, transports and stores natural gas for others and buys and sells natural
gas; (4) the Distribution segment distributes natural gas to residential, commercial and industrial customers, leases pipeline capacity to others and provides transportation services to end-use customers; (5) the Production segment develops and
produces natural gas and oil; and (6) the Other segment primarily operates and leases the Company’s headquarters building and a related parking facility.

During the first quarter of 2002, the Power segment was combined with the Marketing and Trading segment, eliminating the Power segment. This reflects the
Company’s strategy of trading around the Company’s recently completed electric generating power plant. All segment data has been reclassified to reflect this change.

In July 2002, the Company completed a transaction to transfer certain transmission assets in Kansas from the Transportation
and Storage segment to the Distribution segment. All historical financial and statistical information has been adjusted for this transfer.

The accounting policies of the segments are substantially the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies. Intersegment
gross sales are recorded on the same basis as sales to unaffiliated customers. Intersegment sales for the Marketing and Trading segment were $299.2 million, $614.7 million and $299.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively. All corporate overhead costs relating to a reportable segment have been allocated for the purpose of calculating operating income, including depreciation expense related to the Company’s computer operating system, which is
recorded in the Other segment. The Company’s equity method investments do not represent



operating segments of the
Company. There are no single external customers from which the Company receives ten percent or more of consolidated revenues.

The following tables set forth certain selected financial information for the Company’s six operating segments for the periods indicated.



(P)

QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA (UNAUDITED)

Total operating revenues are consistently greater during the heating season from November through March due to the large volume of natural gas sold to
customers for heating. The following tables set forth the unaudited quarterly results of operations for the periods indicated.



During the fourth
quarter of 2001, the Company took a charge of $37.4 million to operating income related to the Enron bankruptcy filing, and, in the first quarter of 2002, it recovered $14.0 million of this charge. During the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company took
a charge of $34.6 million against operating income related to unrecovered gas costs associated with the 2000/2001 winter, and, in the second quarter of 2002, the Company increased operating income by $14.2 million related to a settlement with the
OCC on this matter. For further discussion of these charges, see Note M.

(Q)

SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION

The following tables set forth supplemental information relative to the Company’s cash flows for the periods indicated.



(R)

STOCK BASED COMPENSATION

Stock Splits

– Due to the 2001 stock split, the number of shares and related exercise prices have been adjusted to maintain both the total
market value of common stock underlying the options and Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) share elections, and the relationship between the fair market value of the common stock and the exercise price of the options and ESPP share elections.

Deferred Compensation Plans

Employee Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan –

The ONEOK,
Inc. Employee Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan provides select employees, as approved by the Board of Directors, with the option to defer portions of their compensation and provides non-qualified deferred compensation benefits which are not
available due to limitations on employer and employee contributions to qualified defined contribution plans under the federal tax laws. Under the plan, participants have the option to defer their salary and/or bonus compensation to a short-term
deferral account, which pays out a minimum of five years from commencement, or a long-term deferral account, which pays out at retirement or termination of the employee. Participants are immediately 100% vested. Short-term deferral accounts are
allocated to the Five Year Treasury Bond Fund. Long-term deferral accounts are allocated among various investment options, including ONEOK Common Stock. At the distribution date, cash is distributed to the employees based on the fair market value of
the investment at that date.

Deferred Compensation Plan for
Non-Employee Directors

– The ONEOK, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors provides directors of the Company, who are not employees of the Company, the option to defer all or a portion of their compensation for their
service on the Company’s Board of Directors. Under the plan, directors may elect either a cash deferral option or a phantom stock option. Under the cash deferral option, directors may defer the receipt of all or a portion of their annual
retainer and/or meeting fees, plus accrued interest. Under the phantom stock option, directors may defer all or a portion of their annual retainer and/or meeting fees and receive such fees on a deferred basis in the form of shares of common stock
under the Company’s Long-Term Incentive Plan. Shares are distributed to non-employee directors at the fair market value of the Company’s common stock at the date of distribution.

Stock Option Plans

Long-Term Incentive Plan

– The ONEOK, Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan provides for the granting of incentive stock options, non-statutory stock
options, stock bonus awards, and restricted stock awards to key employees and the granting of stock awards to non-employee directors. The Company has reserved approximately 7.8 million shares of common stock for the plan, less the number of shares
previously issued under the plan. The maximum numbers of shares for which options or other awards may be granted to any employee during any year is 300,000.

Under the plan, options may be granted by the Executive Compensation Committee (the Committee). Stock options and awards may be granted at any time until
all shares authorized are transferred, except that no incentive stock option may be granted under the plan after August 17, 2005. Options may be granted which are not exercisable until a fixed future date or in installments. The plan also provides
for restored options to be granted in the event an optionee surrenders shares of



common stock that the optionee already owns in full or partial payment of the option price of an option
being exercised and/or surrenders shares of common stock to satisfy withholding tax obligations incident to the exercise of an option. A restored option is for the number of shares surrendered by the optionee and has an option price equal to the
fair market value of the common stock on the date on which the exercise of an option resulted in the grant of the restored option.

Options issued to date become void upon voluntary termination of employment other than retirement. In the event of retirement or involuntary termination,
the optionee may exercise the option within three months. In the event of death, the option may be exercised by the personal representative of the optionee within a period to be determined by the Committee and stated in the option. A portion of the
options issued to date can be exercised after one year from grant date and an option must be exercised no later than ten years after grant date.

Stock Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors

– The ONEOK, Inc. Stock Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors provides for the
granting of incentive stock bonus awards, performance unit awards, restricted stock awards, and non-qualified stock options to Non-Employee Directors. The Company has reserved 700,000 shares, less the number of shares previously issued under the
plan. The maximum number of shares of common stock with respect to which options or other awards may be granted to any Non-Employee Director during any year is 20,000.

Under the plan, options may be granted by the Committee at any time on or before January 18, 2011. Options may be exercisable
in full at the time of grant or may become exercisable in one or more installments. The plan also provides for restored options in the event that the optionee surrenders shares of common stock that the optionee already owns in full or partial
payment of the option price of an option being exercised and/or surrenders shares of common stock to satisfy withholding tax obligations incident to the exercise of an option. A restored option is for the number of shares surrendered by the
optionee, and has an option price equal to the fair market value of the common stock on the date the exercise of an option resulted in the grant of the restored option. Options issued to date become void upon termination of service as a Non-Employee
Director. Such options must be exercised no later than ten years after the date of grant of the option. In the event of death, the option may be exercised by the personal representative of the optionee.

The following table sets forth the stock option activity for the periods
indicated.



At December 31, 2002, the
Company had 1,896,866 outstanding options with exercise prices ranging between $11.85 to $17.78 and a weighted average remaining life of 7.62 years. Of these options, 876,378 were exercisable at December 31, 2002, with a weighted average exercise
price of $16.22.

The Company also had 1,166,810 options
outstanding at December 31, 2002, with exercise prices ranging between $17.78 and $26.67 and a weighted average remaining life of 7.57 years. Of these options, 501,892 were exercisable at December 31, 2002, at a weighted average exercise price of
$21.65.

Restricted Stock Awards

– Under the
Long-Term Incentive Plan, restricted stock awards also may be granted to key officers and employees. Ownership of the common stock vests over a three-year period. Shares awarded may not be sold during the vesting period. The fair market value of the
shares associated with the restricted stock awards is recorded as unearned compensation in shareholders’ equity and is amortized to compensation expense over the vesting period. The dividends on the restricted stock awards are reinvested in
common stock. The average price of shares granted was $17.05, $22.31 and $13.16 for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Restricted stock information has been restated to give effect to the 2001 two-for-one stock split. The following table sets forth the restricted stock
activity for the periods indicated.

Employee Stock
Purchase Plan

– In 1995, the Company authorized the ESPP and the Company currently has 2.8 million shares reserved for the ESPP, less the number of shares issued to date under this plan. Subject to certain exclusions, all full-time
employees are eligible to participate. Under the terms of the plan, employees can choose to have up to ten percent of their annual earnings withheld to purchase the Company’s common stock. The Committee may allow contributions to be made by
other means provided that in no event will contributions from all means exceed ten percent of the employee’s annual earnings. The purchase price of the stock is 85 percent of the lower of its grant date or exercise date market price.
Approximately 61 percent, 56 percent, and 56 percent of eligible employees participated in the plan in fiscal years 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. Under the plan, the Company sold 285,200 shares in 2002, 192,593 shares in 2001, and 523,044
shares in 2000.

Accounting Treatment

– The Company
has applied APB 25 in accounting for both plans through 2002. Accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements for the Company’s options and the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. The Company adopted
Statement 123 on January 1, 2003, and will expense the fair value of all stock options beginning with options granted on or after January 1, 2003. See Note A for disclosure of the Company’s pro forma net income and earnings per share
information had the Company applied the provisions of Statement 123 to determine the compensation cost under these plans for the periods indicated.



The fair market value of each
option granted was estimated on the date of grant based on the Black-Scholes model using the following assumptions: volatility of 22.1 percent for 2002, 21.1 percent for 2001, and 21.2 percent for 2000; dividend yield of 3.6 percent for 2002, 5.5
percent for 2001, and 6.3 percent for 2000; and risk-free interest rate of 5.1 percent for 2002, 5.2 percent for 2001, and 5.7 percent for 2000.

Expected life ranged from 1 to 10 years based upon experience to date and the make-up of the optionees. Fair value of options granted at fair market value
under the Plan were $3.88, $3.17 and $2.76 for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Fair value of options granted above fair market value under the Plan was $3.50 for the year ended December 31, 2001. The average exercise
price of options granted above fair market value is $23.49 for the year ended December 31, 2001.

(S)

EARNINGS PER SHARE INFORMATION

The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the periods indicated. There were
167,116, 158,989, and 113,836 option shares excluded from the calculation of Diluted Earnings per Share for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, due to being antidilutive in those periods.



(T)

OIL AND GAS PRODUCING ACTIVITIES

The following table sets forth the Company’s historical cost information relating to its production operations for the periods indicated.



The following table sets
forth the results of operations of the Company’s oil and gas producing activities for the periods indicated. The results exclude general office overhead and interest expense attributable to oil and gas production.

(U)

OIL AND GAS RESERVES (UNAUDITED)

The Company emphasizes that the volumes of reserves shown are estimates, which, by their nature, are subject to later revision. The estimates are made by
the Company utilizing all available geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data. These estimates are reviewed annually both internally and by an independent reserve engineer, Ralph E. Davis and Associates, and revised,
either upward or downward, as warranted by additional performance data.

The following table sets forth estimates of the Company’s proved oil and gas reserves, net of royalty interests and changes herein, for the periods indicated.



(V)

DISCOUNTED FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS (UNAUDITED)

The following table sets forth estimates of the standard measure of discounted future cash flows from proved reserves of oil and natural gas for the
periods indicated.

Future cash inflows are
computed by applying year-end prices (averaging $30.20 per barrel of oil, adjusted for transportation and other charges, and $4.69 per Mcf of gas at December 31, 2002) to the year-end quantities of proved reserves. As of December 31, 2002, a portion
of proved developed gas production for continuing operations in 2003 has been hedged. The effects of these hedges are not reflected in the computation of future cash flows above. If the effects of the hedges had been included, the future cash
inflows would have decreased by approximately $1.2 million.



These estimated future cash
flows are reduced by estimated future development and production costs based on year-end cost levels, assuming continuation of existing economic conditions, and by estimated future income tax expense. The tax expense is calculated by applying the
current year-end statutory tax rates to pretax net cash flows (net of tax depreciation, depletion, and lease amortization allowances) applicable to oil and gas production.

The following table sets forth the changes in standardized measure of discounted future net cash flow relating to proved oil
and gas reserves for the periods indicated:

(W)

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS (UNAUDITED)

On January 3, 2003, the Company closed the purchase of all of the Texas assets of Southern Union Company for $420 million. The gas distribution operations
serve approximately 535,000 customers in cities located throughout Texas, including the major cities of El Paso and Austin, as well as the cities of Port Arthur, Galveston, Brownsville, and others. Over 90 percent of the customers are residential.
The acquisition includes a 125-mile natural gas transmission system, as well as other energy related domestic assets involved in gas marketing, retail sales of propane and distribution of propane. The purchase also includes natural gas distribution
investments in Mexico. The distribution assets will be operated under the name Texas Gas Service Company, a division of ONEOK, Inc.

On January 3, 2003, the Company completed a definitive settlement agreement with Southern Union resolving all remaining legal issues stemming from the
Company’s terminated offer to acquire Southwest Gas. It also resolved the claims against John A. Gaberino, Jr. and Eugene Dubay related to this matter. Under the terms of the settlement, the Company has paid $5 million to Southern Union, which
is included in the December 31, 2002, financial statements.

On
January 9, 2003, the Company entered into an agreement with Westar Energy, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary, Westar Industries, Inc., to repurchase a portion of the shares of the Company’s Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (Series A)
held by Westar and to exchange Westar’s remaining 10.9 million shares of Series A for 21.8 million newly-created shares of ONEOK’s $0.925 Series D Convertible Preferred Stock (Series D). The Series A shares were convertible into two shares
of common stock, reflecting the two-for-one stock split in 2001, and the Series D shares are convertible into one share of common stock. The Series D has substantially the same terms as the Series A, except that (a) the Series D has a fixed
quarterly cash dividend of 23.125 cents per share, (b) the Series D is redeemable by ONEOK at any time after August 1, 2006, at a redemption price of $20, in the event that the closing price of ONEOK common stock exceeds $25 for 30 consecutive
trading days, (c) each share of Series D is convertible into one share of ONEOK common stock, and (d) Westar Industries may not convert any shares of Series D held by it unless the annual per share dividend for the ONEOK common stock for the
previous year is greater than 92.5 cents per share and such conversion would not subject ONEOK to the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. The agreement also restricts Westar from selling more than five percent to any one person or group who
already owns five percent or more of ONEOK’s outstanding common stock. The KCC approved the Company’s agreement with Westar on January 17, 2003. On February 5, 2003, the Company consummated the agreement by



purchasing $300 million (approximately 18.1 million shares of common stock equivalents) of its Series A
convertible preferred stock from Westar Industries. The Company exchanged Westar’s remaining 10.9 million Series A shares for approximately 21.8 million shares of the Company’s newly-created Series D convertible preferred stock. Also, in
connection with that transaction, a new rights agreement, a new shareholder agreement and a new registration rights agreement became effective. In addition, the Company agreed to register for resale, within 60 days after the February 5, 2003,
closing, all of the shares of its common stock held by Westar Industries, as well as all the shares of its Series D convertible preferred stock issued to Westar Industries and all of the shares of its common stock issuable upon conversion of the
Series D convertible preferred stock. As a result of this transaction and the Company’s recently completed stock offering, discussed below, Westar’s equity interest in the Company has been reduced from approximately 44.4 percent to
approximately 27.4 percent on a fully diluted basis.

As a result
of the Westar transaction, the Company will no longer apply the provisions of EITF Topic D-95 to its EPS computation beginning in February 2003, because the Series D does not participate in earnings beyond the stated dividend rate of 92.5 cents per
share. Under Topic D-95, the Company was required to reduce EPS by the dilutive effect of the two-class method of EPS computation.

On January 12, 2003, the Company announced plans for concurrent offerings of its common stock and equity units under its $1 billion shelf registration
statement. On January 28, 2003, the Company issued 12 million shares of common stock at the public offering price of $17.19 per share, resulting in net proceeds to the Company, after underwriting discounts and commissions, of $16.524 per share, or
$198.3 million in the aggregate. The Company granted the underwriters a 30-day over-allotment option to purchase up to an additional 1.8 million shares of the Company’s common stock at the same price, which was exercised on February 7, 2003,
resulting in additional net proceeds to the Company of $29.7 million.

Also on January 28, 2003, the Company issued 14 million equity units at a public offering price of $25 per unit, resulting in net proceeds to the Company, after underwriting discounts and commissions, of $24.25 per share, or $339.5
million in the aggregate. Each equity unit consists of a stock purchase contract for the purchase of shares of the Company’s common stock and, initially, a senior note due February 16, 2008, issued pursuant to the Company’s existing
Indenture with SunTrust Bank, as trustee. The equity units carry a total annual coupon rate of 8.5% (4.0% annual face amount of the senior notes plus 4.5% annual contract adjustment payments). Each stock purchase contract issued as a part of the
equity units carries a maximum conversion premium of up to 20 percent over the $17.19 closing price of the Company’s common stock on January 22, 2003. The Company granted the underwriters a 13-day over-allotment option to purchase up to an
additional 2.1 million additional equity units at the same price, which was exercised on January 31, 2003, resulting in additional net proceeds to the Company of $50.9 million.

On January 31, 2003, the Company announced that it had closed on the sale of certain natural gas and oil producing properties
for $300 million in cash, subject to adjustment. Pursuant to the sale, ONEOK Resources Company, the production segment of ONEOK, Inc., sold natural gas and oil reserves in Oklahoma and Texas. The sale included approximately 1,900 wells, 475 of which
were operated by the Company. The Company recorded a pretax gain of approximately $74.4 million in the first quarter of 2003 related to this sale. See Note C.

KGS filed a rate case on January 31, 2003, to increase rates by $76 million. The KCC has up to 240 days to review the application and issue a final order.
If approved, the new rates would become effective for the 2003/2004 winter heating season. Until regulatory approval is received, KGS will operate under the current rate schedule.
