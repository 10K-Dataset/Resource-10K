PART
I

ITEM
1.

BUSINESS

GENERAL

We are a
diversified energy company and successor to the company founded in 1906 known as
Oklahoma Natural Gas Company.  Our common stock is listed on the NYSE
under the trading symbol “OKE.”  We are the sole general partner and,
as of December 31, 2009, we owned 45.1 percent of ONEOK Partners, L.P. (NYSE:
OKS), one of the largest publicly traded master limited
partnerships.  As a result of ONEOK Partners’ February 2010 public
offering of common units, we own a 42.8 percent aggregate equity
interest.  ONEOK Partners is a leader in the gathering, processing,
storage and transportation of natural gas in the United States.  In
addition, ONEOK Partners owns one of the nation’s premier natural gas liquids
systems, connecting NGL supply in the Mid-Continent and Rocky Mountain regions
with key market centers.  We are the largest natural gas distributor
in Oklahoma and Kansas and the third largest natural gas distributor in Texas,
providing service as a regulated public utility to wholesale and retail
customers.  Our largest distribution markets are Oklahoma City and
Tulsa, Oklahoma; Kansas City, Wichita and Topeka, Kansas; and Austin and El
Paso, Texas.  Our energy services operation is engaged in providing
premium natural gas marketing services to its customers across the United
States.

DESCRIPTION
OF BUSINESS

We report
operations in the following business segments:

·

ONEOK
      Partners;

·

Distribution;
      and

·

Energy
      Services.

Business
Strategy

Our
primary business strategy is to deliver consistent growth and sustainable
earnings, while focusing on safe, reliable, environmentally responsible and
legally compliant operations for our customers, employees, contractors and the
public through the following:

·

increasing
      distributable cash flow at our ONEOK Partners segment through a
      combination of strategic acquisitions and growth
  projects;

·

increasing
      operating income within our Distribution segment through rate strategies,
      rate base growth and operating efficiencies, while targeting our allowed
      return on equity;

·

continuing
      our focus on our key markets in our Energy Services
    segment;

·

executing
      strategic acquisitions; and

·

managing
      our balance sheet to maintain strong credit ratings at or above current
      investment-grade levels.

ONEOK Partners

- ONEOK
Partners’ primary business objectives are to generate cash flow sufficient to
pay quarterly cash distributions to its unitholders and to increase those
distributions over time.  ONEOK Partners’ ability to maintain and grow
its distributions to unitholders depends on, among other things, the growth of
its existing businesses and strategic acquisitions.  ONEOK Partners
plans to continue pursuing internal growth opportunities and strategic
acquisitions related to gathering, processing, fractionating, transporting,
storing and marketing natural gas and NGLs that will utilize its core
capabilities, minimize commodity price risk and provide long-term, sustainable
and stable cash flows.  ONEOK Partners’ strategy focuses on
maintaining stable cash flows and earnings through predominantly fee-based
income and by managing commodity price and spread risk.

Distribution

- Our integrated
strategy for our LDCs incorporates a rates and regulatory plan that includes
positive relationships with regulators, consistent strategies and synchronized
rate case filings.  We focus on growth of our customer count and rate
base through efficient investment in our system while emphasizing safety and
cost control.  We provide customer choice programs designed to reduce
volumetric sensitivity and create value for our customers.

Energy Services

- Our Energy
Services segment creates value by providing premium services to our customers in
delivering physical and risk management products and services through our
network of contracted gas supply and contracted transportation and storage
assets.  We optimize our storage and transportation capacity through the
daily application of market knowledge and effective risk
management.

-5
- -


Outlook

We expect
a moderate economic recovery in 2010, with inflationary pressures beginning in
2011.  Although recent volatility in the financial markets could limit
our access to financial markets on a timely basis or increase our cost of
capital in the future, we anticipate improved credit markets during 2010,
compared with 2009; however, inflation risks may increase the cost of
capital.  We anticipate the consolidation of underperforming assets in
the industry, particularly those with high commodity price exposure and/or high
levels of debt.  Additionally, we anticipate an improving commodity
price environment during 2010, compared with 2009.

ONEOK Partners

- ONEOK
Partners intends to pursue continued growth in its natural gas businesses
through well connections and contract renegotiations and through new plant
construction, expansions and extensions of its existing systems and
plants.  For its natural gas liquids business, ONEOK Partners will continue
to focus on adding new supply connections and expanding existing assets. 
ONEOK Partners plans to spend approximately $362 million on capital expenditures
in 2010, of which approximately $278 million is expected to be for growth
projects.  ONEOK Partners may also pursue strategic acquisitions
related to gathering, processing, fractionating, storing, transporting or
marketing natural gas and NGLs.

Distribution

- In our
Distribution segment, we plan to grow our asset base through efficient capital
investment in infrastructure and technology and increase the level of
sustainable earnings.

Energy Services

- In our
Energy Services segment, we will continue our emphasis on generating recurring
margins by providing premium products and services to our core LDC and electric
utility customers, while maintaining the focus on our contracted level of
long-term storage and transportation contracts supporting these premium
services.  We will use our competitive position of long-term
contracted assets to extract incremental value through the daily optimization of
those assets.  Additionally, we will use our risk management expertise
to establish base margins and capture incremental margins related to location
and seasonal differences.

Description of Business

- Our
ONEOK Partners segment is engaged in the gathering and processing of natural gas
and gathering, transportation and fractionation of NGLs, primarily in the
Mid-Continent and Rocky Mountain regions, which include the Anadarko Basin of
Oklahoma, Fort Worth Basin of Texas, Hugoton and Central Kansas Uplift Basins of
Kansas; and the Williston Basin of Montana and North Dakota and the Powder River
Basin of Wyoming, respectively.  These operations include the
gathering of natural gas produced from crude oil and natural gas
wells.  Through gathering systems, natural gas is aggregated and
treated or processed for removal of water vapor, solids and other contaminants,
and to extract NGLs in order to provide marketable natural gas, commonly
referred to as residue gas.  When the NGLs are separated from the
unprocessed natural gas at the processing plants, the NGLs are generally in the
form of a mixed, unfractionated NGL stream.  In the Powder River
Basin, the natural gas that ONEOK Partners gathers is coal bed methane, or dry
gas, that does not require processing or NGL extraction, in order to be
marketable; dry gas is gathered, compressed and delivered into a downstream
pipeline or marketed for a fee.

Revenue
from the gathering and processing business is primarily derived from the
following three types of contracts:

·

Percent
      of Proceeds - ONEOK Partners retains a percentage of the NGLs and/or a
      percentage of the residue gas as payment for gathering, treating,
      compressing and processing the producer’s natural gas.  This
      type of contract represented approximately 50 percent and 62 percent of
      gathering and processing net margin for 2009 and 2008,
      respectively.

·

Fee
      - ONEOK Partners is paid a fee for the services it provides based on Btus
      gathered, treated, compressed and/or processed.  This type of
      contract represented approximately 35 percent and 23 percent of gathering
      and processing net margin for 2009 and 2008,
  respectively.

-7
- -


·

Keep-Whole
      - ONEOK Partners extracts NGLs from unprocessed natural gas and returns to
      the producer volumes of residue gas containing the same amount of Btus as
      the unprocessed natural gas that was originally delivered.  This
      type of contract represented approximately 15 percent of gathering and
      processing net margin for both 2009 and 2008, with approximately 84
      percent and 89 percent of that contracted volume, respectively, containing
      language that effectively converts these contracts into fee contracts when
      the gross processing spread is
negative.

ONEOK
Partners also gathers, treats, fractionates, transports and stores
NGLs.  ONEOK Partners’ natural gas liquids gathering pipelines deliver
unfractionated NGLs gathered from natural gas processing plants located in
Oklahoma, Kansas, Texas and the Rocky Mountain region to fractionators it owns
in Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas.  The NGLs are then separated through
the fractionation process into the individual NGL products that realize the
greater economic value of the NGL components.  The individual NGL
products are then stored or distributed to petrochemical manufacturers, heating
fuel users, refineries and propane distributors through ONEOK Partners’
FERC-regulated distribution pipelines that move NGL products from Oklahoma and
Kansas to the market centers in Conway, Kansas, and Mont Belvieu, Texas, as well
as the Midwest markets near Chicago, Illinois.

Revenue
for the natural gas liquids business is primarily derived from the following
types of services:

·

Exchange
      services - ONEOK Partners gathers and transports unfractionated NGLs to
      its fractionators, where they are separated into marketable NGL products
      and redelivered to a market center for a
fee;

·

Optimization
      and marketing - ONEOK Partners uses its asset base, portfolio of contracts
      and market knowledge to capture location and seasonal price differentials
      through transactions that optimize the flow of its NGL products between
      the major market centers in Conway, Kansas, and Mont Belvieu, Texas, as
      well as markets near Chicago,
Illinois;

·

Isomerization
      - ONEOK Partners converts normal butane to the more valuable iso-butane
      used by the refining industry to increase the octane of motor
      gasoline;

·

Storage
      services - ONEOK Partners stores NGLs for a fee;
  and

·

Transportation
      - ONEOK Partners transports NGLs under its FERC-regulated
      tariffs.

ONEOK
Partners operates interstate and intrastate natural gas transmission pipelines,
natural gas storage facilities and non-processable natural gas gathering
facilities.  ONEOK Partners also provides natural gas transportation
and storage services in accordance with Section 311(a) of the Natural Gas Policy
Act.  ONEOK Partners’ interstate assets transport natural gas through
FERC-regulated interstate natural gas pipelines that access supply from Canada
and from the Mid-Continent, Rocky Mountain and Gulf Coast
regions.  ONEOK Partners’ intrastate natural gas pipeline assets are
located in Oklahoma, Texas and Kansas, and have access to major natural gas
producing areas in those states.  ONEOK Partners owns underground
natural gas storage facilities in Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas.

ONEOK
Partners’ revenues from its natural gas pipelines are typically derived from fee
services under the following types of contracts:

·

Firm
      service - Customers can reserve a fixed quantity of pipeline or storage
      capacity for the terms of their contracts.  Under this type of
      contract, the customer pays a fixed fee for a specified quantity
      regardless of their actual usage and is generally guaranteed access to the
      capacity they reserve; and

·

Interruptible
      service - Customers with interruptible service transportation and storage
      agreements may utilize available capacity after firm-service requests are
      satisfied or on an as available basis.  Under the interruptible
      service contract, the customer is not guaranteed use of our pipelines and
      storage facilities unless excess capacity is
  available.

The main
factors that affect ONEOK Partners’ margins are:

·

NGL
      transportation and fractionation volumes and associated
    fees;

·

natural
      gas processing, gathering, transportation and storage volumes and
      associated fees;

·

weather
      impacts on demand and operations;

·

the
      Mid-Continent, Gulf Coast and Rocky Mountain natural gas price, crude oil
      price and the daily average OPIS price for its products
    sold;

·

the
      relative value of ethane to natural gas;
and

·

regional
      and seasonal natural gas and NGL product price
    differentials.

Market Conditions and
Seasonality

-

Supply

- ONEOK
Partners’ business is affected by the economy, commodity price volatility and
weather.  The strength of the economy has a direct relationship on
manufacturing and industrial companies’ demand for natural gas and NGL
products.  Volatility in the commodity markets impacts the decisions
of ONEOK Partners’ customers related to the output from natural gas wells,
storage activity for natural gas and natural gas liquids, and demand for the
various NGL products.  In addition, its natural gas liquids pipelines
and fractionation facilities are affected by operational or market-driven
changes in the output of the gas processing plants to which they are
connected.  Natural gas and NGL

-8
- -


output
from gas processing plants may increase or decrease, affecting the quality of
natural gas and volume of NGLs transported through the systems, as a result of
the gross processing spread, which is the difference between the relative Btu
value of the composite price of NGLs and the Btu value of natural gas, primarily
ethane and natural gas.  In addition, volumes delivered through the
system may increase or decrease as a result of the relative NGL price between
the Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast regions.  Natural gas transportation
throughput fluctuates due to rainfall that impacts irrigation demand, warmer
temperatures that affect power generation demand and cooler temperatures that
affect heating demand.

Natural
gas and NGL supply is affected by rig availability, operating capability and
producer drilling activity, which is sensitive to commodity prices, exploration
success, available capital and regulatory control.  Higher crude oil
prices in the second half of 2009 and advances in horizontal drilling and
completion technology are having a positive impact on drilling activity in the
shale areas, providing an offset to the less favorable supply projections in the
non-shale areas.

Additionally,
significant factors that can impact the supply of Canadian natural gas
transported by ONEOK Partners’ pipelines are the Canadian natural gas available
for export, Canadian storage capacity and demand for Canadian natural gas in
other U.S. consumer markets.

Demand

-

Demand for gathering
and processing services is typically aligned with the production of natural
gas.  ONEOK Partners’ plant operations can be adjusted to respond to
market conditions, such as demand for ethane.  By changing operating
parameters at certain plants, ONEOK Partners can reduce, to some extent, the
amount of ethane and propane recovered if prices or processing margins are
unfavorable.

Demand
for natural gas pipeline transportation service and natural gas storage is
directly related to demand for natural gas in the markets that the natural gas
pipelines and storage facilities serve, and is affected by weather, the economy,
and natural gas price volatility.  The effect of weather on ONEOK
Partners’ natural gas pipelines operations is discussed below under
“Seasonality.”  The strength of the economy directly impacts
manufacturing and industrial companies that consume natural
gas.  Commodity price volatility can influence customers’ decisions
related to the usage of natural gas versus alternative fuels and natural gas
storage injection and withdrawal activity.

Demand
for NGLs and the ability of natural gas processors to successfully and
economically sustain their operations impacts the volume of unfractionated NGLs
produced by natural gas processing plants, thereby affecting the demand for
natural gas liquids gathering, fractionation and distribution
services.  Natural gas and propane are subject to weather-related
seasonal demand.  Other NGL products are affected by economic
conditions and the demand associated with the various industries that utilize
the commodity, such as butanes and natural gasoline, which are used by the
refining industry as blending stocks for motor fuel, denaturant for ethanol and
diluents for crude oil.  Ethane/propane mix, propane, normal butane
and natural gasoline are used by the petrochemical industry to produce chemical
products, such as plastic, rubber and synthetic fiber.

Commodity Prices

-
During 2009 and 2008, both crude oil and natural gas prices were volatile, with
NYMEX crude oil settlement prices ranging from $33.87 to $79.09 per Bbl in 2009,
compared with $49.62 to $134.62 per Bbl in 2008.  NYMEX natural gas
settlement prices ranged from $2.84 to $6.14 per MMBtu in 2009, compared with
$6.47 to $13.11 per MMBtu in 2008.

Seasonality

- Some of
ONEOK Partners’ products, such as natural gas and propane used for heating, are
subject to seasonality, resulting in more demand during the months of November
through March.  As a result, prices of these products are typically
higher during that time period.  Demand has also increased for natural
gas in the summer periods, as more electric generation is now dependent upon
natural gas as a fuel.

Competition

- ONEOK
Partners’ natural gas and natural gas liquids businesses compete directly with
other companies for natural gas and NGL supplies, markets and
services.  Competition for natural gas transportation services
continues to increase as the FERC and state regulatory bodies continue to
encourage more competition in the natural gas markets.  Competition is
based primarily on fees for services, quality of services provided, current and
forward natural gas and NGL prices and proximity to supply areas and
markets.  ONEOK Partners believes that its assets enable it to
effectively compete.

ONEOK
Partners’ natural gas gathering and processing business competes for natural gas
supplies with independent exploration and production companies that have
gathering and processing assets, pipeline companies and their affiliated
marketing companies, national and local natural gas gatherers and processors,
and marketers in the Mid-Continent and Rocky Mountain regions.  ONEOK
Partners’ natural gas liquids business competes with other fractionators,
storage providers, gatherers and transporters for NGL supplies in the Rocky
Mountain, Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast regions.  The factors that
typically affect ONEOK Partners’ ability to compete for natural gas and NGL
supplies are:

·

fees
      charged under its contracts;

·

pressures
      maintained on its gathering
systems;

·

location
      of its assets relative to those of its
  competitors;

·

location
      of its assets relative to drilling
activity;

·

efficiency
      and reliability of its operations;
and

·

receipt
      and delivery capabilities that exist in each system, plant, fractionator
      and storage location.

ONEOK
Partners is responding to these industry conditions by making capital
investments to access new supplies, increase gathering, fractionation, storage
and transportation capacity, increase storage, withdrawal and injection
capabilities, improve natural gas processing efficiency and reduce operating
costs, evaluating consolidation opportunities to maximize earnings, selling
assets in non-core operating areas and renegotiating unprofitable
contracts.  The principal goal of the contract renegotiation effort is
to eliminate unprofitable contracts and improve margins, primarily during
periods when the gross processing spread is negative.

Government Regulation

- The
FERC has traditionally maintained that a processing plant is not a facility for
the transportation or sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce and,
therefore, is not subject to jurisdiction under the Natural Gas
Act.  Although the FERC has made no specific declaration as to the
jurisdictional status of ONEOK Partners’ natural gas processing operations or
facilities, ONEOK Partners’ natural gas processing plants are primarily involved
in removing NGLs and, therefore, ONEOK Partners believes, its natural gas
processing plants are exempt from FERC jurisdiction.  The Natural Gas
Act also exempts natural gas gathering facilities from the jurisdiction of the
FERC.  ONEOK Partners believes its gathering facilities and operations
meet the criteria used by the FERC for non-jurisdictional gathering facility
status.  However, ONEOK Partners is subject to newly adopted FERC
regulations that require it to publicly post certain gas flow information on
ONEOK Partners’ Web sites.  Interstate transmission facilities remain
subject to FERC jurisdiction.  The FERC has historically distinguished
between these two types of facilities, either interstate or intrastate, on a
fact-specific basis.  ONEOK Partners transports residue gas from its
plants to interstate pipelines in accordance with Section 311(a) of the Natural
Gas Policy Act.

Oklahoma,
Kansas, Wyoming, Montana and North Dakota also have statutes regulating, in
various degrees, the gathering of natural gas in those states.  In
each state, regulation is applied on a case-by-case basis if a complaint is
filed against the gatherer with the appropriate state regulatory
agency.

ONEOK
Partners’ interstate natural gas pipelines are regulated under the Natural Gas
Act and Natural Gas Policy Act, which give the FERC jurisdiction to regulate
virtually all aspects of the pipeline activities.  ONEOK Partners’
intrastate natural gas transportation assets in Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas are
regulated by the OCC, KCC and RRC, respectively.  ONEOK Partners has
flexibility in establishing natural gas transportation rates with
customers.  However, there are maximum rates that ONEOK Partners can
charge its customers in Oklahoma and Kansas.

ONEOK
Partners’ proprietary natural gas liquids gathering pipelines, fractionation and
storage facilities in Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas are not regulated by the FERC
or the states’ respective corporation commissions.  ONEOK Partners’
remaining natural gas liquids gathering and distribution pipelines are
interstate pipelines regulated by the FERC.  ONEOK Partners transports
unfractionated NGLs and NGL products pursuant to filed tariffs.

further discussion in the “Environmental and Safety Matters”
section.

Distribution

Business Strategy

-

Our Distribution segment
focuses on increasing the level of sustainable earnings through safe, reliable,
environmentally responsible and legally compliant natural gas distribution
operations.

The
integrated strategy for our LDCs incorporates:

·

a
      rates and regulatory strategy that includes fostering positive
      relationships with regulators and synchronized rate case filings among our
      LDCs;

·

a
      focus on the growth of our customer count and rate base through efficient
      investment in our system, while emphasizing safety and cost control;
      and

·

providing
      customer programs designed to reduce volumetric sensitivity and create
      value for our customers.

Our
regulatory strategy incorporates rate features that provide strategies to reduce
earnings lag, protect margin and mitigate risks.  These strategies
include performance-based rate mechanisms in Oklahoma and capital-recovery
mechanisms in Kansas and portions of Texas.  In Texas, we also have
cost-of-service adjustments in certain markets served that address investments
in rate base and changes in expense.  Margin protection strategies
include increased customer fixed charges in all three states, as well as weather
normalization mechanisms.  Risk mitigation strategies include
fuel-related bad-debt recovery mechanisms in Oklahoma, Kansas and portions of
Texas.

Description of Business

- Our
Distribution segment provides natural gas distribution services to more than two
million customers in Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas through Oklahoma Natural Gas,
Kansas Gas Service and Texas Gas Service, respectively, each a division of
ONEOK.  We serve residential, commercial, industrial and
transportation customers in all three states.  In addition, our
distribution companies in Oklahoma and Kansas serve wholesale
customers.

Our
operating results are primarily affected by the number of customers, usage and
the ability to collect delivery rates that provide a reasonable rate of return
on our investment and recovery of our cost of service.  Natural gas
costs are passed through to our customers based on the actual cost of gas
purchased by the respective distribution companies and related
expenses.  Substantial fluctuations in natural gas sales can occur
from year to year without materially or adversely impacting our net margin,
since the fluctuations in natural gas costs affect natural gas sales and cost of
gas by an equivalent amount.  Higher natural gas costs may cause
customers to conserve or, in the case of industrial customers, to use
alternative energy sources.  Higher natural gas costs may also
adversely impact our accounts receivable collections, resulting in higher
bad-debt expense.  Recovery of the fuel-related portion of bad debts
is allowed in all three states.

The rate
structure for Oklahoma Natural Gas includes two service rate options for
residential gas sales customers.  Customers with usage greater than 50
dekatherms per month pay a fixed monthly service charge with no volumetric
delivery fee, while customers with usage less than 50 dekatherms per month pay a
lower monthly service charge coupled with a per dekatherm delivery
charge.

Oklahoma
Natural Gas, Kansas Gas Service and Texas Gas Service distribute natural gas as
public utilities to approximately 87 percent, 70 percent and 13 percent of the
distribution markets for Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas,
respectively.  Natural gas sold to residential and commercial
customers accounts for approximately 80 and 19 percent of natural gas sales,
respectively, in Oklahoma; 76 and 19 percent of natural gas sales, respectively,
in Kansas; and 69 and 23 percent of natural gas sales, respectively, in
Texas.

Market Conditions and
Seasonality

-

Supply

- Our
Distribution segment purchased 169 Bcf and 182 Bcf of natural gas supply in 2009
and 2008, respectively.  Our gas supply portfolio consists of
long-term, seasonal and short-term contracts from a diverse group of
suppliers.  These contracts are awarded through competitive bid
processes to ensure reliable and competitively priced gas supply.  Our
Distribution segment’s natural gas supply is purchased from a combination of
direct wellhead production, natural gas processing plants, natural gas marketers
and production companies.

We are
responsible for acquiring sufficient natural gas supplies, interstate and
intrastate pipeline capacity and storage capacity to meet customer
requirements.  As such, we must contract for both reliable and
adequate supplies and delivery capacity to our distribution system, while
considering: (i)

the dynamics of the
interstate and intrastate pipeline and storage capacity market; (ii) our peaking
facilities and storage and contractual commitments; and (iii)

the demand
characteristics of our customer base.

An
objective of our supply sourcing strategy is to diversify our supply among
multiple production areas and suppliers.  This strategy is designed to
protect receipt of supply from being curtailed by physical interruption,
possible financial difficulties of a single supplier, natural disasters and
other unforeseen force majeure events.

We do not
anticipate problems with securing natural gas supply to satisfy customer
demand.  However, if supply shortages occur, each of our LDCs has
curtailment tariff provisions in place that provide for: (i) reducing or
discontinuing gas service to large industrial users; and (ii) requesting that
residential and commercial customers reduce their gas requirements to an amount
essential for public health and safety.  In addition, during times of
critical supply problems, curtailments of deliveries to customers with firm
contracts may be made in accordance with guidelines established by appropriate
federal, state and local regulatory agencies.

Natural
gas supply requirements are affected by changes in the natural gas consumption
pattern of our customers that are driven by factors other than
weather.  Economic conditions impact usage of commercial and
industrial customers.  Natural gas usage per residential customer may
decline as customers change their consumption patterns in response to: (i) more
volatile and higher natural gas prices, as discussed above; (ii)

customers’ improving
the energy efficiency of existing homes by replacing doors and windows and
adding insulation, along with retrofitting natural gas appliances with more
efficient appliances; (iii) more energy-efficient construction; and (iv) fuel
switching.  In each jurisdiction in which we operate, changes in
customer usage profiles have been reflected in recent rate case proceedings
where rates have been adjusted to reflect current customer usage.

In
December 2007, Oklahoma Natural Gas was authorized by the OCC to implement a
natural gas hedging program as a three-year pilot program, with up to $10
million per year in hedge costs to be recovered from
customers.  Kansas Gas Service has a natural gas hedging program in
place, which was approved as a permanent program by the KCC in 2005 and is
subject to annual KCC review.  The program is designed to reduce
volatility in the natural gas price paid by consumers.  The costs of
this program are borne by the Kansas Gas Service customers.  Texas Gas
Service also has a natural gas hedging program for certain of its
jurisdictions.

In
managing our gas supply portfolios, we partially mitigate gas price volatility
using a combination of financial derivatives and the triggering of forward
prices on certain gas supply contracts.  Our Distribution segment does
not utilize financial derivatives for speculative purposes nor does it have
trading operations.  In addition, we utilized 34.3 Bcf of contracted
storage capacity in 2009, which allows gas to be purchased during the off-peak
season and stored for use in the winter periods.

Demand

- See
discussion below under “Seasonality” and “Competition” for factors affecting
demand.

Seasonality

- Natural
gas sales to residential and commercial customers are seasonal, as a substantial
portion of their natural gas is used for heating.  Accordingly, the
volume of natural gas sales is normally higher during the months of November
through March than in other months of the year.  The impact on margins
resulting from weather that is above or below normal is substantially offset
through weather normalization adjustments (WNA), which are now approved by the
regulatory authorities for all of our Oklahoma and Kansas service
territories.  WNA allows us to increase customer billing to offset
lower gas usage when weather is warmer than normal and decrease customer billing
to offset higher gas usage when weather is colder than normal.  In
2009, approximately 94 percent of Texas Gas Service’s margins were protected
from abnormal weather due to a higher customer charge and/or WNA
clauses.

Competition

-

We can face competition
based on customers’ preference for natural gas compared with other energy
products, and the comparative prices of those products.  The most
significant product competition occurs between natural gas and electricity in
the residential and small commercial markets.  We compete for heating,
cooking and other general energy

-12

needs. 
Customers and builders typically make the decision on the type of equipment to
install at initial installation and use the chosen energy source for the life of
the equipment.  The markets in our service territories have become
increasingly competitive.  Changes in the competitive position of
natural gas relative to electricity and other energy products have the potential
of causing a decline in consumption or in the number of future natural gas
customers.

However,
recent studies have demonstrated that assessing energy efficiency in terms of
full-cycle analysis highlights the high overall efficiency of natural gas as a
preferred fuel in residential and commercial uses, compared with
electricity.  These studies may have a positive impact on the
promotion of natural gas for these primary uses as national energy and
environmental policies and standards are reshaped.

We
believe that we must maintain a competitive advantage in order to retain our
customers, and, accordingly, we focus on providing safe, reliable, efficient
service and controlling costs.  Our Distribution segment is subject to
competition from other pipelines for our existing industrial
load.  Oklahoma Natural Gas, Kansas Gas Service and Texas Gas Service
compete for service to large industrial and commercial customers, and
competition has and may continue to impact margins.

Under our
transportation tariffs, qualifying industrial and commercial customers are able
to purchase their natural gas commodity from the supplier of their choice and
have us transport it for a fee.  A portion of transportation services
provided is at negotiated rates that are generally below the maximum approved
transportation tariff rates.  Reduced rate transportation service may
be negotiated when a competitive pipeline is in proximity or another viable
energy option is available.  Increased competition could potentially
lower these rates.  Texas Gas Service files all negotiated
transportation service contracts under a separate, confidential tariff at
the RRC.

Government Regulation

- Rates
charged by our Distribution segment for natural gas services are established by
the OCC for Oklahoma Natural Gas and by the KCC for Kansas Gas
Service.  Texas Gas Service is subject to regulatory oversight by the
various municipalities that it serves, which have primary jurisdiction in their
respective areas.  Rates in unincorporated areas and all appellate
matters are subject to regulatory oversight by the RRC.  Natural gas
purchase costs are included in the Purchased Gas Adjustment (PGA) clause rate
that is billed to customers.  Our distribution companies do not make a
profit on the cost of gas.  Other changes in costs must be recovered
through periodic rate adjustments approved by the OCC, KCC, RRC and various
municipalities in Texas.  See page 49 for a detailed description of
our various regulatory initiatives.

Oklahoma
Natural Gas has settled all known claims arising out of long-term gas supply
contracts containing “take-or-pay” provisions that require us to pay for volumes
of natural gas contracted for but not taken.  The OCC has previously
authorized recovery of the accumulated settlement costs over a 20-year period
expiring in 2014 of approximately $7.0 million annually, through a combination
of a surcharge from customers, revenue from transportation under Section 311(a)
of the Natural Gas Policy Act and other intrastate transportation
revenues.

See
further discussion in the “Environmental and Safety Matters”
section.

Energy
Services

Business Strategy

- Our Energy
Services segment utilizes our network of contracted gas supply and contracted
transportation and storage assets to provide premium services to our
customers.  The asset positions afford us the flexibility to develop
innovative, customer-specific demand delivery services for those we serve, at a
competitive cost.  With these services and a focus on customer
relationships, we expect to attract new customers and retain existing customers
that generate recurring margins.

We follow
a strategy of optimizing our storage and cross-regional transportation capacity
through the application of market knowledge and effective risk
management.  We maximize value by actively hedging the risks
associated with seasonal and locational price differentials that are inherent to
storage and transportation contracts.  At the same time, we capitalize
on opportunities created by market volatility, weather-related events,
supply-demand imbalances and market inefficiencies, which allow us to capture
additional margin.  Using market information, we manage these
asset-based positions and seek to provide incremental margin in our trading
portfolio.

Through
our wholesale marketing and risk management capabilities, we are a full-service
provider in our retail operations.  We offer a broad range of products
and are expanding our markets.  We manage the commodity price and
volumetric risk in these operations through a variety of risk management and
hedging activities.

It is our
intention to minimize the mark-to-market earnings impact that our forward hedges
have on current period earnings. When possible, we implement effective hedging
strategies using derivative instruments that qualify as hedges for accounting
purposes.

-13
- -


Our
Energy Services segment requires working capital to purchase natural gas
inventory, to reserve transportation and storage capacity and to meet cash
collateral requirements associated with our risk management
activities.  Our inventory purchases and hedging strategies are
implemented with consideration given to ONEOK’s overall working capital
requirements and liquidity.  Restrictions on our access to working
capital may impact our inventory purchases and risk management activities, which
could impact our results.

Description of Business

- Our
Energy Services segment’s primary focus is to create value for our customers by
delivering physical natural gas products and risk management services through
our network of contracted transportation and storage capacity and natural gas
supply.  This contracted storage and transportation capacity connects
the major supply and demand centers throughout the United States and into
Canada.  Our customers are primarily LDCs, electric utilities and
industrial end users.  Our customers’ natural gas needs vary with
seasonal changes in weather and are therefore somewhat
unpredictable.

To ensure
natural gas is available when our customers need it, we offer premium services
and products that satisfy our customers’ swing and peaking natural gas commodity
requirements on a year-round basis.  We also provide no-notice
service, weather-related protection and other custom solutions based on our
customers’ specific needs.  Our storage and transportation capacity
not only enables us to provide these services, but also during periods when
customers do need these services, it also provides us opportunities to optimize
our contracted assets through the application of market knowledge and risk
management skills.

We
actively manage the commodity price and volatility risks associated with
providing energy risk management services to our customers by executing
derivative instruments in accordance with the parameters established in our
commodity risk management policy.  The derivative instruments consist
of over-the-counter transactions such as forward, swap and option contracts, and
NYMEX futures and option contracts.

We
utilize our experience to optimize the value of our contracted assets, and we
use our risk management and marketing capabilities to both manage risk and
generate additional margins.  We apply a combination of cash flow and
fair value hedge accounting when implementing hedging strategies that take
advantage of favorable market conditions.  See Note

D

of

the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report
for additional information.  Additionally, certain non-trading
transactions, which are economic hedges of our accrual transactions, such as our
storage and transportation contracts, will not qualify for hedge accounting
treatment.  These economic hedges receive mark-to-market accounting
treatment, as they are derivative contracts and are not designated as part of a
hedge relationship.  As a result, the underlying risk being hedged
receives accrual accounting treatment, while we use mark-to-market accounting
treatment for the economic hedges.  We cannot predict the earnings
fluctuations from mark-to-market accounting, and the impact on earnings could be
material.

Our
working capital requirements related to our inventory in storage were as high as
$684.8 million during 2009 but had decreased to $264.0 million by December 31,
2009.  In addition, our use of financial derivatives can result in the
need for increased working capital due to margin requirements.  During
2009, our margin requirements with counterparties ranged from zero to $107.7
million.

Our
Energy Services segment conducts business with our ONEOK Partners and our
Distribution segments.  These services are provided under agreements
with market-based terms.  Additionally, business with our Distribution
segment is awarded through a competitive bidding process.

Market Conditions and
Seasonality

-

Supply

- Our Energy
Services segment maintains a gas supply portfolio consisting of various
term-length contracted supply in all of the major producing regions, including
the Rocky Mountain, Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast.  During periods of
high natural gas demand, we utilize storage capacity to supplement natural gas
supply volumes to meet our peak day demand obligations or market
needs.

Demand

- Demand under
our swing and peaking natural gas requirements contracts in our wholesale
operation is usually driven by the extent to which temperatures vary from normal
levels.  A significant portion of this business is contracted during
the winter period of November through March.  Our retail business’
demand for natural gas is primarily driven by industrial process requirements
and the use of residential heating and is significantly impacted by temperature
variations.

Seasonality

-

Due to the seasonality of
natural gas consumption, storage withdrawals and demand for our products and
services, earnings are normally higher during the winter months than the summer
months.  Natural gas sales volumes are typically higher in the winter
heating months than in the summer months, reflecting increased demand due to
greater heating requirements and, typically, higher natural gas
prices.  During periods of high natural gas demand, we utilize storage
capacity to supplement natural gas supply volumes to meet our premium product
and service obligations or market needs.

-14
- -


Competition

-

Market conditions continue
to affect credit and liquidity, as there are fewer counterparties with which we
conduct business, compared with last year, when several counterparties exited
this business or scaled back their operations.  In response to a
competitive marketing environment, our strategy is to concentrate our efforts on
providing reliable service during peak demand periods and capturing
opportunities created by short-term pricing volatility.  We can
effectively compete in the market by utilizing our contracted storage and
transportation assets.  We continue to focus on building and
strengthening supplier and customer relationships to execute our strategy and
increase our market presence.

Government Regulation

- Our
Energy Services segment purchases natural gas for resale at negotiated rates in
interstate commerce.  As such, it has automatically been granted by
FERC a blanket certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing such
sales.  This is a limited certificate that does not subject Energy
Services to any other regulation of FERC under its Natural Gas Act
jurisdiction.  Holders of blanket marketing certificates are subject
to certain reporting and document retention requirements, and Energy Services is
in compliance with such requirements.

It is
unclear how Congress and the current Administration’s efforts to improve market
transparency and stabilize the over-the-counter (OTC) derivative markets will
impact our ability to access OTC energy derivatives products and markets, which
are critical to our business.  We currently use the OTC markets to
manage business risks including fluctuating currency rates, and commodity prices
and for the hedging of inventory and capacity contracts.  Most of the
current proposals before Congress contain exemptions for these activities that
would limit the impact on our operations.  Additional matters
associated with this action that are not yet defined include the potential for
increased capital requirements and a reduction in the overall liquidity of the
markets.  We anticipate that there will also be an administrative
burden of new reporting and record keeping that will be required by one or more
of the federal agencies providing market oversight.

Other

Through
ONEOK Leasing Company and ONEOK Parking Company, L.L.C., we own a parking garage
and an office building (ONEOK Plaza) in downtown Tulsa, Oklahoma, where our
headquarters are located.  ONEOK Leasing Company leases excess office
space to others and operates our headquarters office building.  ONEOK
Parking Company, L.L.C. owns and operates a parking garage adjacent to our
headquarters.

ENVIRONMENTAL
AND SAFETY MATTERS

Additional
information about our environmental matters is included in Note L of the Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report.

Pipeline Safety

- We are
subject to United States Department of Transportation regulations, including
integrity management regulations.  The Pipeline Safety Improvement Act
of 2002 requires pipeline companies to perform integrity assessments on pipeline
segments that pass through densely populated areas or near specifically
designated high consequence areas.  We are in compliance with all
material requirements associated with the various pipeline safety
regulations.  We cannot provide assurance that existing pipeline
safety regulations will not be revised or interpreted in a different manner or
that new regulations will not be adopted that could result in increased
compliance costs or additional operating restrictions.

Air and Water Emissions

- The
Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws impose restrictions
and controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into the air and water in the
United States.  Under the Clean Air Act, a federally enforceable
operating permit is required for sources of significant air
emissions.  We may be required to incur certain capital expenditures
for air pollution-control equipment in connection with obtaining or maintaining
permits and approvals for sources of air emissions.  The Clean Water
Act imposes substantial potential liability for the removal of pollutants
discharged to waters of the United States and remediation of waters affected by
such discharge.  We are in compliance with all material requirements
associated with the various air and water quality regulations.

The
United States Congress is actively considering legislation to reduce greenhouse
gas emissions, including carbon dioxide and methane.  In addition,
other federal, state and regional initiatives to regulate greenhouse gas
emissions are under way.  We are monitoring federal and state
legislation to assess the potential impact on our operations.  We
estimate our direct greenhouse gas emissions annually as we collect all
applicable greenhouse gas emission data for the previous year.  Our
most recent estimate for ONEOK and ONEOK Partners indicates that our emissions
are less than 5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents on an annual
basis.  We expect to complete our annual estimate for 2009 during the
second quarter of 2010 and will post the information on our Web site when
available.  We will continue efforts to improve our ability to
quantify our direct greenhouse gas emissions and will report such emissions as
required by the EPA’s Mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting rule released in
September 2009.  The rule requires greenhouse gas emissions reporting
for affected facilities on an annual basis, beginning with our 2010 emissions
report that will be due in March 2011 and will require us to track the emission
equivalents for the gas delivered by us to our distribution customers and
emission equivalents for all NGLs

-15
- -


delivered
to customers of ONEOK Partners.  At this time, no legislation or other
rules have been enacted as to what costs, fees or expenses will be associated
with any of these emissions.  In addition, the EPA has issued a
proposed rule on air-quality standards, “National Emission Standards for
Hazardous Air Pollutants for Reciprocating Internal Combustion Engines,” also
known as RICE NESHAP, scheduled to be adopted in early 2013.  The
proposed rule will require capital expenditures over the next three years for
the purchase and installation of new emissions-control equipment.  We do
not expect these expenditures to have a material impact on our results of
operations, financial position or cash flows.

Superfund

- The Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, also known as CERCLA or
Superfund, imposes liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the
original act, on certain classes of persons who contributed to the release of a
hazardous substance into the environment.  These persons include the
owner or operator of a facility where the release occurred and companies that
disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the
facility.  Under CERCLA, these persons may be liable for the costs of
cleaning up the hazardous substances released into the environment, damages to
natural resources and the costs of certain health studies.

Chemical Site Security

- The
United States Department of Homeland Security (Homeland Security) released an
interim rule in April 2007 that requires companies to provide reports on sites
where certain chemicals, including many hydrocarbon products, are
stored.  We completed the Homeland Security assessments, and our
facilities were subsequently assigned, on a preliminary basis, one of four
risk-based tiers ranging from high (Tier 1) to low (Tier 4) risk, or not tiered
at all due to low risk.  One of our facilities has been given a Tier 4
rating, and four of our facilities have been given a preliminary Tier 4
rating.  We are currently waiting for Homeland Security’s analysis to
determine if any of our other facilities will be tiered and require Site
Security Plans and possible physical security enhancements.

Pipeline Security

- Homeland
Security’s Transportation Security Administration, along with the United States
Department of Transportation have completed a review and inspection of our
“critical facilities” and identified no material security issues.

Environmental Footprint

- Our
environmental and climate change strategy focuses on taking steps to minimize
the impact of our operations on the environment.  These strategies
include: (i) developing and maintaining an accurate greenhouse gas emissions
inventory, according to new rules issued by the EPA; (ii) improving the
efficiency of our various pipelines, natural gas processing facilities and
natural gas liquids fractionation facilities; (iii) following developing
technologies for emission control; (iv) following developing technologies to
capture carbon dioxide to keep it from reaching the atmosphere; and (v)
analyzing options for future energy investment.

Currently,
certain subsidiaries of ONEOK Partners participate in the Processing and
Transmission sectors, and LDCs in our Distribution segment participate in the
Distribution sector of the EPA’s Natural Gas STAR Program to voluntarily reduce
methane emissions.  A subsidiary in our ONEOK Partners’ segment was
honored in 2008 as the “Natural Gas STAR Gathering and Processing Partner of the
Year” for its efforts to positively address environmental issues through
voluntary implementation of emission-reduction opportunities.  In
addition, we continue to focus on maintaining low rates of
lost-and-unaccounted-for methane gas through expanded implementation of best
practices to limit the release of methane during pipeline and facility
maintenance and operations.  Our most recent calculation of our annual
lost-and-unaccounted-for natural gas, for all of our business operations, is
less than 1 percent of total throughput.  We expect to complete our
annual estimate for 2009 during the second quarter of 2010 and will post the
information on our Web site when available.

ITEM
1A.

RISK
FACTORS

Our investors should consider the
following risks that could affect us and our business.  Although we
have tried to discuss key factors, our investors need to be aware that other
risks may prove to be important in the future.  New risks may emerge
at any time, and we cannot predict such risks or estimate the extent to which
they may affect our financial performance.  Investors should carefully
consider the following discussion of risks and the other information included or
incorporated by reference in this Annual Report, including “Forward-Looking
Statements,” which are included in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operation.

RISK
FACTORS INHERENT IN OUR BUSINESS

Market
volatility and capital availability could adversely affect our
business.

The
capital and credit markets have been experiencing volatility and
disruption.  During the fourth quarter of 2008 and continuing into
2009, the volatility and disruption reached unprecedented levels.  In
many cases, the capital markets have exerted downward pressure on equity values
and reduced the credit capacity for certain companies.  Our ability to
grow could be constrained if we do not have regular access to the capital and
credit markets.  If similar or more severe levels of market disruption
and volatility return, our access to capital and credit markets could be
disrupted, making growth through acquisitions and development projects difficult
or impractical to pursue until such time as markets stabilize.

Our
operating results may be materially adversely affected by unfavorable economic
and market conditions.

Economic
conditions worldwide have from time to time contributed to slowdowns in the oil
and gas industry, as well as in the specific segments and markets in which we
operate, resulting in reduced demand and increased price competition for our
products and services.  Our operating results in one or more
geographic regions may also be affected by uncertain or changing economic
conditions within that region.  Volatility in commodity prices may
have an impact on many of our customers, which, in turn, could have a negative
impact on their ability to meet their obligations to us.  If global
economic and market conditions (including volatility in commodity markets), or
economic conditions in the United States or other key markets, remain uncertain
or persist, spread or deteriorate further, we may experience material impacts on
our business, financial condition, results of operations, and
liquidity.

Uncertainty
in the capital markets may increase the cost of debt and equity capital, which
may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and
business.

In 2008
and continuing into 2009, economic conditions in the United States experienced a
downturn, primarily due to the sub-prime lending crisis, volatile energy prices,
inflation concerns, slower economic activity, decreased consumer confidence,
reduced corporate profits and capital spending, and increased
unemployment.  These conditions had an adverse impact on the credit
markets.  Although some of these conditions have improved in 2009 and 2010,
continued uncertainty about market conditions may have an adverse effect on us
resulting from, but not limited to, difficulty in obtaining financing necessary
to expand facilities or acquire assets, increased financing cost and
increasingly restrictive covenants.

Our
cash flow depends heavily on the earnings and distributions of ONEOK
Partners.

Our
partnership interest in ONEOK Partners is one of our largest cash-generating
assets.  Therefore, our cash flow is heavily dependent upon the
ability of ONEOK Partners to make distributions to its partners.  A
significant decline in ONEOK Partners’ earnings and/or cash distributions would
have a corresponding negative impact on us.  For information on the
risk factors inherent in the business of ONEOK Partners, see the section below
entitled “Risk Factors Related to ONEOK Partners’ Business” and Item 1A. Risk
Factors in the ONEOK Partners Annual Report.

-18
- -


Some
of our nonregulated businesses have a higher level of risk than our regulated
businesses.

Some of
our nonregulated operations, which includes ONEOK Partners’ gathering and
processing business, most of its natural gas liquids business, and our energy
services business, have a higher level of risk than our regulated operations,
which include our distribution and ONEOK Partners’ natural gas pipelines
business and a portion of its natural gas liquids business.  We and
ONEOK Partners expect to continue investing in natural gas and natural gas
liquids projects and other related projects, some or all of which may involve
nonregulated businesses or assets.  These projects could involve risks
associated with operational factors, such as competition and dependence on
certain suppliers and customers, and financial, economic and political factors,
such as rapid and significant changes in commodity prices, the cost and
availability of capital and counterparty risk, including the inability of a
counterparty, customer or supplier to fulfill a contractual
obligation.

Our
LDCs have recorded certain assets that may not be recoverable from our
customers.

Accounting
principles that govern our LDCs permit certain assets that result from the
regulatory process to be recorded on our balance sheet that could not be
recorded under GAAP for nonregulated entities.  We consider factors
such as rate orders from regulators, previous rate orders for substantially
similar costs, written approval from the regulators and analysis of
recoverability from internal and external legal counsel to determine the
probability of future recovery of these assets.  If we determine
future recovery is no longer probable, we would be required to write off the
regulatory assets at that time.

Terrorist
attacks aimed at our facilities could adversely affect our
business.

Since the
September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the United States government has
issued warnings that energy assets, specifically the nation’s pipeline
infrastructure, may be future targets of terrorist
organizations.  These developments may subject our operations to
increased risks.  Any future terrorist attack that may target our
facilities, those of our customers and, in some cases, those of other pipelines,
could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Our
businesses are subject to market and credit risks.

We are
exposed to market and credit risks in all of our operations.  To
minimize the risk of commodity price fluctuations, we periodically enter into
derivative transactions to hedge anticipated purchases and sales of natural gas,
NGLs, crude oil, fuel requirements and firm transportation
commitments.  Interest-rate swaps are also used to manage
interest-rate risk.  Currency forward contracts are used to mitigate
unexpected changes that may occur in anticipated revenue streams of our Canadian
natural gas sales and purchases driven by currency rate
fluctuations.  However, financial derivative instrument contracts do
not eliminate the risks.  Specifically, such risks include commodity
price changes, market supply shortages, interest rate changes and counterparty
default.  The impact of these variables could result in our inability
to fulfill contractual obligations, significantly higher energy or fuel costs
relative to corresponding sales contracts, or increased interest
expense.

We are
subject to the risk of loss resulting from nonpayment and/or nonperformance by
customers of our Energy Services segment.  The customers of our Energy
Services segment are predominantly LDCs, industrial customers, natural gas
producers and marketers that may experience deterioration of their financial
condition as a result of changing market conditions or financial difficulties
that could impact their creditworthiness or ability to pay for our
services.  Although we attempt to obtain adequate security for these
risks, if we fail to adequately assess the creditworthiness of existing or
future customers, unanticipated deterioration in their creditworthiness and any
resulting nonpayment and/or nonperformance could adversely impact results of
operations for our Energy Services segment.  In addition, if any of
our Energy Services segment’s customers filed for bankruptcy protection, we may
not be able to recover amounts owed, which could materially negatively impact
the results of operations for our Energy Services segment.

Increased
competition could have a significant adverse financial impact on
us.

The
natural gas and natural gas liquids industries are expected to remain highly
competitive.  The demand for natural gas and NGLs is primarily a
function of commodity prices, including prices for alternative energy sources,
customer usage rates, weather, economic conditions and service
costs.  Our ability to compete also depends on a number of other
factors, including competition from other pipelines for our existing load, the
efficiency, quality and reliability of the services we provide, and competition
for throughput for our gathering systems, pipelines, processing plants,
fractionators and storage facilities.

We cannot
predict when we will be subject to changes in legislation or regulation, nor can
we predict the impact of these changes on our financial position, results of
operations or cash flows.  Although we believe our businesses are
positioned to compete effectively in the energy market, there are no assurances
that this will be true in the future.

-19
- -


We
may not be able to successfully make additional strategic acquisitions or
integrate businesses we acquire into our operations.

Our
ability to successfully make strategic acquisitions and investments will depend
on: (i) the extent to which acquisitions and investment opportunities
become available; (ii) our success in bidding for the opportunities that do
become available; (iii) regulatory approval, if required, of the
acquisitions on favorable terms; and (iv) our access to capital, including
our ability to use our equity in acquisitions or investments, and the terms upon
which we obtain capital.  If we are unable to make strategic
investments and acquisitions, we may be unable to grow.  If we are
unable to successfully integrate new businesses into our operations, we could
experience increased costs and losses on our investments.

Acquisitions that appear to be
accretive may nevertheless reduce our cash from operations on a per share
basis.

Any
acquisition involves potential risks that may include, among other
things:

·

mistaken
      assumptions about volumes, revenues and costs, including potential
      synergies;

·

an
      inability to successfully integrate the businesses we
    acquire;

·

decrease
      in our liquidity as a result of our using a significant portion of our
      available cash or borrowing capacity to finance the
      acquisition;

·

a
      significant increase in our interest expense or financial leverage if we
      incur additional debt to finance the
  acquisition;

·

the
      assumption of unknown liabilities for which we are not indemnified or for
      which our indemnity is inadequate;

·

an
      inability to hire, train or retain qualified personnel to manage and
      operate the acquired business and
assets;

·

limitations
      on rights to indemnity from the
seller;

·

mistaken
      assumptions about the overall costs of equity or
  debt;

·

the
      diversion of management’s and employees’ attention from other business
      concerns;

·

unforeseen
      difficulties operating in new product areas or new geographic
      areas;

·

increased
      regulatory burdens;

·

customer
      or key employee losses at an acquired business;
  and

·

increased
      regulatory requirements.

If we
consummate any future acquisitions, our capitalization and results of operations
may change significantly, and investors will not have the opportunity to
evaluate the economic, financial and other relevant information that we will
consider in determining the application of our resources to future
acquisitions.

Any
reduction in our credit ratings could materially and adversely affect our
business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.

Our
long-term senior unsecured debt has been assigned an investment-grade rating by
S&P of “BBB” (Stable) and Moody’s of “Baa2” (Stable).  However, we
cannot provide assurance that any of our current ratings will remain in effect
for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn
entirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so
warrant.  Specifically, if S&P or Moody’s were to downgrade our
long-term rating, particularly below investment grade, our borrowing costs would
increase, which would adversely affect our financial results, and our potential
pool of investors and funding sources could decrease.  If S&P or
Moody’s were to downgrade the long-term ratings of ONEOK Partners below
investment grade, ONEOK Partners would, under certain circumstances, be required
to offer to repurchase certain of its senior notes.  Further, if our
short-term ratings were to fall below A-2 (capacity to meet its financial
commitment on the obligation is satisfactory) or P-2 (strong ability to repay
short-term debt obligations), the current ratings assigned by S&P and
Moody’s, respectively, it could significantly limit our access to the commercial
paper market.  Any such downgrade of our long- or short-term ratings
could significantly increase our cost of capital and reduce the availability of
capital and, thus, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, liquidity and results of operations.  Ratings from credit
agencies are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our
securities.  Each rating should be evaluated independently of any
other rating.

A
downgrade in our credit ratings below investment grade would negatively affect
the operations of our Energy Services segment.  If our credit ratings fall
below investment grade, ratings triggers and/or adequate assurance clauses in
many of our financial and wholesale physical contracts would be in effect. 
A ratings trigger or adequate assurance clause gives a counterparty the right to
suspend or terminate the agreement unless margin thresholds are met.
 Margin requirements related to the trading activities of our Energy
Services segment may also increase as a result of market volatility without
regard to our credit rating.  The additional increase in capital
required to support our Energy Services segment would materially negatively
impact our ability to compete, as well as our ability to actively manage the
risk associated with existing storage and transportation contracts.

-20
- -


Employees
within our marketing and trading operations may violate our risk management
policies.

We have
developed and implemented a comprehensive set of policies and procedures that
involve both our senior management and the Audit Committee of our Board of
Directors to assist us in managing risks associated with, among other things,
the trading activities of our Energy Services segment.  However, if
our employees fail to adhere to these mandatory policies and procedures, we may
be exposed to greater risk than we had anticipated.

Our
indebtedness could impair our financial condition and our ability to fulfill our
other obligations.

As of
December 31, 2009, we had total indebtedness for borrowed money of approximately
$1.9 billion, which excludes the debt of ONEOK Partners.  Our
indebtedness could have significant consequences.  For example, it
could:

·

make
      it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our
      notes and our other indebtedness due to the increased debt-service
      obligations, which could in turn result in an event of default on such
      other indebtedness or our notes;

·

impair
      our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working
      capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or general business
      purposes;

·

diminish
      our ability to withstand a downturn in our business or the
      economy;

·

require
      us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to
      debt-service payments, reducing the availability of cash for working
      capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or general corporate
      purposes;

·

limit
      our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business
      and the industry in which we operate;
and

·

place
      us at a competitive disadvantage compared with our competitors that have
      proportionately less debt.

We are
not prohibited under the indentures governing our senior notes from incurring
additional indebtedness, but our debt agreements do subject us to certain
operational limitations summarized in the next paragraph.  If we incur
significant additional indebtedness, it could worsen the negative consequences
mentioned above and could adversely affect our ability to repay our other
indebtedness.

Our
revolving debt agreements with banks contain provisions that restrict our
ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to expand or pursue our
business activities.  For example, certain of these agreements contain
provisions that, among other things, limit our ability to make loans or
investments, make material changes to the nature of our business, merge,
consolidate or engage in asset sales, grant liens, or make negative
pledges.  Certain agreements also require us to maintain certain
financial ratios, which limit the amount of additional indebtedness we can
incur, as described in the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section of Item 7,
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operation.  These restrictions could result in higher costs of
borrowing and impair our ability to generate additional cash.  Future
financing agreements we may enter into may contain similar or more restrictive
covenants.

If we are
unable to meet our debt-service obligations, we could be forced to restructure
or refinance our indebtedness, seek additional equity capital or sell
assets.  We may be unable to obtain financing or sell assets on
satisfactory terms, or at all.

We
are subject to comprehensive energy regulation by governmental agencies, and the
recovery of our costs is dependent on regulatory action.

We are
subject to comprehensive regulation by several federal, state and municipal
utility regulatory agencies, which significantly influences our operating
environment and our ability to recover our costs from utility
customers.  The utility regulatory authorities in Oklahoma, Kansas and
Texas regulate many aspects of our utility operations, including customer
service and the rates that we can charge customers.  Federal, state
and local agencies also have jurisdiction over many of our other activities,
including regulation by the FERC of our storage and interstate pipeline
assets.  The profitability of our regulated operations is dependent on
our ability to pass costs related to providing energy and other commodities
through to our customers by filing synchronized rate cases.  The
regulatory environment applicable to our regulated businesses could impair our
ability to recover costs historically absorbed by our customers.

We are
unable to predict the impact that the future regulatory activities of these
agencies will have on our operating results.  Changes in regulations
or the imposition of additional regulations could have an adverse impact on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.  Further, the
results of our LDCs’ operations could be negatively impacted if the cost
recovery mechanisms authorized by our rate cases do not function as
anticipated.

Additionally,
the regulatory authorities of each state in which we operate allow LDC’s to
obtain weather protection.  If the weather protection clause is
disallowed, it would affect our business.

-21
- -


The
volatility of natural gas prices may negatively impact LDC customers’ perception
of natural gas.

Natural
gas costs are passed through to the customers of our LDCs based on the actual
cost of the natural gas purchased by the particular LDC.  Substantial
fluctuations in natural gas prices can occur from year to
year.  Sustained periods of high natural gas prices or of pronounced
natural gas price volatility may negatively impact our LDC customers’ perception
of natural gas, which could lead to customers selecting other energy
alternatives, such as electricity, and to difficulties in the rate-making
process.  Additionally, high natural gas prices may cause customers to
conserve more and may also adversely impact our accounts receivable collections,
resulting in higher bad-debt expense.

Our
business is subject to increased regulatory oversight and potential
penalties.

The
natural gas industry historically has been heavily regulated; therefore, there
is no assurance that a more stringent regulatory approach will not be pursued by
the FERC and the United States Congress, especially in light of previous market
power abuse by certain companies engaged in interstate commerce.  In
response to this issue, the United States Congress, in the Energy Policy Act of
2005 (EPACT), developed requirements intended to ensure that the energy market
is not impacted by the exercise of market power or manipulative
conduct.  The FERC then adopted the Market Manipulation Rules to
implement the authority granted under EPACT.  These rules are intended
to prohibit fraud and manipulation and are subject to broad
interpretation.  EPACT also gave the FERC increased penalty authority
for violations of these rules, as well as other FERC rules.

Demand
for services of our Distribution and Energy Services segments and for certain of
ONEOK Partners’ products is highly weather sensitive and seasonal.

The
demand for natural gas and for certain of ONEOK Partners’ products, such as
propane, is weather sensitive and seasonal, with a significant portion of
revenues derived from sales to retail markets for heating during the winter
months.  Weather conditions directly influence the volume of, among
other things, natural gas and propane delivered to
customers.  Deviations in weather from normal levels and the seasonal
nature of certain of our segments’ business can create large variations in
earnings and short-term cash requirements.

Proposed
KCC “ring-fencing” regulations may have a significant impact on our natural gas
distribution business in Kansas.

The KCC
is considering new regulations, commonly known as “ring-fencing,” that would
require us to operate our Kansas Gas Service division in a separate, financially
independent entity.  This new entity would not be permitted to rely upon
the overall credit of ONEOK to obtain financing for its operations, potentially
increasing the cost of its financing.  In addition, this new entity may be
required to register with the SEC as a reporting entity, repurchase and reissue
public debt (including the payment of prepayment premiums), and negotiate
separate credit facilities, all at substantial cost.  If these additional
costs, along with the other costs and expenses associated with the
reorganization, are not recoverable from Kansas Gas Service customers, it would
lower the earnings of our Distribution segment.  Adoption by the KCC of
certain of these proposed regulations may require prior authorization from the
Kansas legislature.

We
are subject to environmental regulations that could be difficult and costly to
comply with.

We are
subject to multiple environmental laws and regulations affecting many aspects of
present and future operations, including air emissions, water quality,
wastewater discharges, solid and hazardous wastes and hazardous material and
substance management.  These laws and regulations generally require us
to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental registrations,
licenses, permits, inspections and other approvals.  Failure to comply
with these laws, regulations, permits and licenses may expose us to fines,
penalties and/or interruptions in our operations that could be material to the
results of operations.  If a leak or spill of hazardous substance
occurs from our lines or facilities in the process of transporting natural gas
or NGLs or at any facility that we own, operate or otherwise use, we could be
held jointly and severally liable for all resulting liabilities, including
investigation and clean-up costs, which could materially affect our results of
operations and cash flows.  In addition, emission controls required
under the federal Clean Air Act and other similar federal and state laws could
require unexpected capital expenditures at our facilities.  In
addition, the EPA has issued a proposed rule on air-quality standards, “National
Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Reciprocating Internal
Combustion Engines,” also known as RICE NESHAP, scheduled to be adopted in early
2013.  The proposed rule will require capital expenditures over the
next three years for the purchase and installation of new emissions-control
equipment.  We do not expect these expenditures to have a material impact
on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.  We
cannot assure that existing environmental regulations will not be revised or
that new regulations will not be adopted or become applicable to
us.  Revised or additional regulations that result in increased
compliance costs or additional operating restrictions, particularly if those
costs are not fully recoverable from customers, could have a material adverse

-22

effect on
our business, financial condition and results of operations.  For
further discussion on this topic, see Note L of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements in this Annual Report.

We
are subject to risks that could limit our access to capital, thereby increasing
our costs and adversely affecting our results of operations.

We have
grown rapidly in the last several years as a result of
acquisitions.  Further acquisitions may require additional
capital.  If we are not able to access capital at competitive rates,
our strategy of enhancing the earnings potential of our existing assets,
including through acquisitions of complementary assets or businesses, will be
adversely affected.  A number of factors could adversely affect our
ability to access capital, including: (i) general economic conditions;
(ii) capital market conditions; (iii) market prices for natural gas,
NGLs and other hydrocarbons; (iv) the overall health of the energy and
related industries; (v) our ability to maintain our investment-grade credit
ratings; and (vi) our capital structure.  Much of our business is
capital intensive, and achievement of our long-term growth targets is dependent,
at least in part, upon our ability to access capital at rates and on terms we
determine to be attractive.  If our ability to access capital becomes
significantly constrained, our interest costs will likely increase and our
financial condition and future results of operations could be significantly
harmed.

Energy
efficiency and technological advances may affect the demand for natural gas and
adversely affect our operating results.

The
national trend toward increased conservation and technological advances,
including installation of improved insulation and the development of more
efficient furnaces and other heating devices, may decrease the demand for
natural gas by residential customers.  More strict conservation
measures in the future or technological advances in heating, conservation,
energy generation or other devices could adversely affect our
operations.

The
cost of providing pension and postretirement health care benefits to eligible
employees and qualified retirees is subject to changes in pension fund values
and changing demographics and may increase.

We have a
defined benefit pension plan for certain employees and postretirement welfare
plans that provide postretirement medical and life insurance benefits to certain
employees who retire with at least five years of service.  The cost of
providing these benefits to eligible current and former employees is subject to
changes in the market value of our pension and postretirement benefit plan
assets, changing demographics, including longer life expectancy of plan
participants and their beneficiaries and changes in health care
costs.  For further discussion of our defined benefit pension plan,
see Note K of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual
Report.

Any
sustained declines in equity markets and reductions in bond yields may have a
material adverse effect on the value of our pension and postretirement benefit
plan assets.  In these circumstances, additional cash contributions to
our pension plans may be required.

Our
business could be adversely affected by strikes or work stoppages by our
unionized employees.

As of
January 31, 2010, 681of our 4,758 employees were represented by collective
bargaining units under collective bargaining agreements.  We are
involved periodically in discussions with collective bargaining units
representing some of our employees to negotiate or renegotiate labor
agreements.  We cannot predict the results of these negotiations,
including whether any failure to reach new agreements will have a negative
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations or whether
we will be able to reach any agreement with the collective bargaining
units.  Any failure to reach agreement on new labor contracts might
result in a work stoppage.  Any future work stoppage could, depending
on the operations and the length of the work stoppage, have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of certain
operations.

We
may face significant costs to comply with the regulation of greenhouse gas
emissions.

Greenhouse
gas emissions originate primarily from combustion engine exhaust, heater exhaust
and fugitive methane gas emissions.  Various federal and state
legislative proposals have been introduced to regulate the emission of
greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide and methane, and the United States
Supreme Court has ruled that carbon dioxide is a pollutant subject to regulation
by the EPA.  In addition, there have been international efforts
seeking legally binding reductions in emissions of greenhouse
gases.

-23
- -


We
believe it is likely that future governmental legislation and/or regulation may
require us either to limit greenhouse gas emissions from our operations or to
purchase allowances for such emissions that are actually attributable to our
distribution customers or attributable to NGL customers of ONEOK
Partners.  However, we cannot predict precisely what form these future
regulations will take, the stringency of the regulations, or when they will
become effective.  Several bills have been introduced in the United
States Congress that would require carbon dioxide emission
reductions.  Previously considered proposals have included, among
other things, limitations on the amount of greenhouse gases that can be emitted
(so called “caps”) together with systems of emissions
allowances.  This system could require us to reduce emissions, even
though the technology is not currently available for efficient reduction, or to
purchase allowances for such emissions.  Emissions also could be taxed
independently of limits.

In
addition to activities on the federal level, state and regional initiatives
could also lead to the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions sooner and/or
independent of federal regulation.  These regulations could be more
stringent than any federal legislation that is adopted.

Future
legislation and/or regulation designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions could
make some of our activities uneconomic to maintain or
operate.  Further, we may not be able to pass on the higher costs to
our customers or recover all costs related to complying with greenhouse gas
regulatory requirements.  Our future results of operations, cash flows
or financial condition could be adversely affected if such costs are not
recovered through regulated rates or otherwise passed on to our
customers.

We
continue to monitor legislative and regulatory developments in this
area.  Although the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions may have a
material impact on our operations and rates, we believe it is premature to
attempt to quantify the potential costs of the impacts.

We
do not fully hedge against commodity price changes, time differentials or
locational differentials.  This could result in decreased revenues and
increased costs, thereby resulting in lower margins and adversely affecting our
results of operations.

Certain
of our nonregulated businesses are exposed to market risk and the impact of
market price fluctuations of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil.  Market
risk refers to the risk of loss of cash flows and future earnings arising from
adverse changes in commodity prices.  Our Energy Services segment’s
primary exposures arise from seasonal and locational price differentials and our
ability to execute hedges.  Our ONEOK Partners segment’s primary
exposures arise from commodity prices with respect to processing agreements and
the differentials between NGL and natural gas prices and their impact on our
natural gas and NGL transportation, fractionation and exchange throughputs; the
differentials between the individual NGL products; differentials between NGL
prices at different locations and the seasonal differentials impacting the
volume of natural gas and NGLs stored.  Our ONEOK Partners and Energy
Services segments are also exposed to the risk of changing prices or the cost of
transportation resulting from purchasing natural gas or NGLs at one location and
selling it at another (referred to as basis risk).  To minimize the
risk from market price fluctuations of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil, we use
physical forward transactions and commodity derivative instruments such as
futures contracts, swaps and options to manage market risk of existing or
anticipated purchases and sales of natural gas, NGLs and crude
oil.  We adhere to policies and procedures that monitor our exposure
to market risk from open positions.  However, we do not fully hedge
against commodity price changes, and therefore, we retain some exposure to
market risk.  Accordingly, any adverse changes to commodity prices
could result in decreased revenue and/or increased costs.

Our
Distribution segment uses storage to minimize the volatility of natural gas
costs for our customers by storing natural gas in periods of low demand for
consumption in peak demand periods.  In addition, various natural gas
supply contracts allow us the option to convert index-based purchases to fixed
prices.  Also, we use derivative instruments to hedge the cost of
anticipated natural gas purchases during the winter heating months to protect
customers from upward volatility in the market price of natural
gas.

Federal,
state and local jurisdictions may challenge our tax return
positions.

The
positions taken in our federal and state tax return filings require significant
judgments, use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex
tax laws.  Significant judgment is also required in assessing the
timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items.  Despite
management’s belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, certain
positions may be successfully challenged by federal, state and local
jurisdictions.

Although
we control ONEOK Partners, we may have conflicts of interest with ONEOK Partners
which could subject us to claims that we have breached our fiduciary duty to
ONEOK Partners and its unitholders.

We are
the sole general partner and owned 45.1 percent of ONEOK Partners as of December
31, 2009.  Conflicts of interest may arise between us and ONEOK
Partners and its unitholders.  In resolving these conflicts, we may
favor our own interests and the interests of our affiliates over the interests
of ONEOK Partners and its unitholders as long as the resolution does not
conflict with the ONEOK Partners’ partnership agreement or our fiduciary duties
to ONEOK Partners and its unitholders.

We
are subject to physical and financial risks associated with climate
change.

There is
a growing belief that emissions of greenhouse gases may be linked to global
climate change.  Climate change creates physical and financial
risk.  Our customers’ energy needs vary with weather conditions,
primarily temperature and humidity.  For residential customers,
heating and cooling represent their largest energy use.  To the extent
weather conditions are affected by climate change, customers’ energy use could
increase or decrease depending on the duration and magnitude of any
changes.  Increased energy use due to weather changes may require us
to invest in more pipeline and other infrastructure to serve increased
demand.  A decrease in energy use due to weather changes may affect
our financial condition, through decreased revenues.  Extreme weather
conditions in general require more system backup, adding to costs, and can
contribute to increased system stresses, including service
interruptions.  Weather conditions outside of our operating territory
could also have an impact on our revenues.  Severe weather impacts our
operating territories primarily through hurricanes, thunderstorms, tornadoes and
snow or ice storms.  To the extent the frequency of extreme weather
events increases, this could increase our cost of providing
service.  We may not be able to pass on the higher costs to our
customers or recover all the costs related to mitigating these physical
risks.  To the extent financial markets view climate change and
emissions of greenhouse gases as a financial risk, this could negatively affect
our ability to access capital markets or cause us to receive less favorable
terms and conditions in future financings.  Our business could be
affected by the potential for lawsuits against greenhouse gas emitters, based on
links drawn between greenhouse gas emissions and climate change.

RISK
FACTORS RELATED TO ONEOK PARTNERS’ BUSINESS

The
volatility of natural gas, crude oil and NGL prices could adversely affect ONEOK
Partners’ cash flow.

A
significant portion of ONEOK Partners’ revenues are derived from the sale of
commodities that are received as payment for gathering and processing services,
for the transportation and storage of natural gas, and for the sale of purity
NGL products in ONEOK Partners’ natural gas liquids
business.  Commodity prices have been volatile and are likely to
continue to be so in the future.  The prices ONEOK Partners receives
for its commodities are subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of
factors beyond ONEOK Partners’ control, including the following:

·

overall
      domestic and global economic
conditions;

·

relatively
      minor changes in the supply of, and demand for, domestic and foreign
      energy;

·

market
      uncertainty;

·

the
      availability and cost of transportation
  capacity;

·

the
      level of consumer product demand;

·

geopolitical
      conditions impacting supply and demand for natural gas and crude
      oil;

·

weather
      conditions;

·

domestic
      and foreign governmental regulations and
taxes;

·

the
      price and availability of alternative
fuels;

·

speculation
      in the commodity futures markets;

·

overall
      domestic and global economic
conditions;

·

the
      price of natural gas, crude oil, NGL and liquefied natural gas imports;
      and

·

the
      effect of worldwide energy conservation
  measures.

These
external factors and the volatile nature of the energy markets make it difficult
to reliably estimate future prices of commodities and the impact commodity price
fluctuations have on our customers and their need for our
services.  As commodity prices decline, ONEOK Partners is paid less
for its commodities, thereby reducing its cash flow.  In addition,
production could also decline.

-25
- -


ONEOK
Partners’ use of financial instruments to hedge market risk may result in
reduced income.

ONEOK
Partners utilizes financial instruments to mitigate its exposure to interest
rate and commodity price fluctuations.  Hedging instruments that are
used to reduce its exposure to interest rate fluctuations could expose it to
risk of financial loss where it has contracted for variable-rate swap
instruments to hedge fixed-rate instruments and the variable rate exceeds the
fixed rate.  In addition, these hedging arrangements may limit the
benefit ONEOK Partners would otherwise receive if it has contracted for
fixed-rate swap agreements to hedge variable-rate instruments and the variable
rate falls below the fixed rate.  Hedging arrangements that are used
to reduce ONEOK Partners’ exposure to commodity price fluctuations may limit the
benefit ONEOK Partners would otherwise receive if market prices for natural gas,
crude oil and NGLs exceed the stated price in the hedge instrument for these
commodities.

ONEOK
Partners’ inability to develop and execute growth projects and acquire new
assets could result in reduced cash distributions to its unitholders and to
ONEOK.

ONEOK
Partners’ primary business objectives are to generate cash flow sufficient to
pay quarterly cash distributions to unitholders and to increase quarterly cash
distributions over time.  ONEOK Partners’ ability to maintain and grow its
distributions to unitholders, including ONEOK, depends on the growth of its
existing businesses and strategic acquisitions.  Accordingly, if ONEOK
Partners is unable to implement business development opportunities and finance
such activities on economically acceptable terms, its future growth will be
limited, which could adversely impact its and our results of operations and cash
flows.

Growing
ONEOK Partners’ business by constructing new pipelines and plants or making
modifications to its existing facilities subjects ONEOK Partners to construction
risks and risks that adequate natural gas or NGL supplies will not be available
upon completion of the facilities.

One of
the ways ONEOK Partners intends to grow its business is through the construction
of new pipelines and new gathering, processing, storage and fractionation
facilities and through modifications to ONEOK Partners’ existing pipelines and
existing gathering, processing, storage and fractionation
facilities.  The construction and modification of pipelines and
gathering, processing, storage and fractionation facilities may require
significant capital expenditures, which may exceed ONEOK Partners’ estimates,
and involves numerous regulatory, environmental, political and legal
uncertainties.  Construction projects in ONEOK Partners’ industry may
increase demand for labor, materials and rights of way, which, may, in turn,
impact ONEOK Partners’ costs and schedule.  If ONEOK Partners
undertakes these projects, it may not be able to complete them on schedule or at
the budgeted cost.  Additionally, ONEOK Partners’ revenues may not
increase immediately upon the expenditure of funds on a particular
project.  For instance, if ONEOK Partners builds a new pipeline, the
construction will occur over an extended period of time, and ONEOK Partners will
not receive any material increases in revenues until after completion of the
project.  ONEOK Partners may have only limited natural gas or NGL
supplies committed to these facilities prior to their
construction.  Additionally, ONEOK Partners may construct facilities
to capture anticipated future growth in production in a region in which
anticipated production growth does not materialize.  ONEOK Partners
may also rely on estimates of proved reserves in ONEOK Partners’ decision to
construct new pipelines and facilities, which may prove to be inaccurate because
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved
reserves.  As a result, new facilities may not be able to attract
enough natural gas or NGLs to achieve ONEOK Partners’ expected investment
return, which could materially adversely affect ONEOK Partners’ results of
operations and financial condition.

ONEOK
Partners does not own all of the land on which its pipelines and facilities are
located, and it leases certain facilities and equipment, which could disrupt its
operations.

ONEOK
Partners does not own all of the land on which certain of its pipelines and
facilities are located, and is, therefore, subject to the risk of increased
costs to maintain necessary land use.  ONEOK Partners obtains the
rights to construct and operate certain of its pipelines and related facilities
on land owned by third parties and governmental agencies for a specific period
of time.  ONEOK Partners’ loss of these rights, through its inability
to renew right-of-way contracts on acceptable terms or increased costs to renew
such rights, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition,
results of operations and cash flows.

Additionally,
certain gas processing or other facilities (or parts thereof) used by ONEOK
Partners are leased from third parties for specific periods.  ONEOK
Partners’ inability to renew equipment leases or otherwise maintain the right to
utilize such facilities and equipment on acceptable terms, or the increased
costs to maintain such rights, could have a material adverse effect on our
results of operations and cash flows.

-26

ONEOK
Partners’ operations are subject to operational hazards and unforeseen
interruptions, which could materially adversely affect its business and for
which ONEOK Partners may not be adequately insured.

ONEOK
Partners’ operations are subject to all of the risks and hazards typically
associated with the operation of natural gas and natural gas liquids gathering
and transportation pipelines, storage facilities and processing and
fractionation plants.  Operating risks include, but are not limited to,
leaks, pipeline ruptures, the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes,
and the performance of pipeline facilities below expected levels of capacity and
efficiency.  Other operational hazards and unforeseen interruptions include
adverse weather conditions, accidents, the collision of equipment with ONEOK
Partners’ pipeline facilities (for example, this may occur if a third party were
to perform excavation or construction work near ONEOK Partners’ facilities) and
catastrophic events such as explosions, fires, hurricanes, earthquakes, floods
or other similar events beyond ONEOK Partners’ control.  It is also
possible that ONEOK Partners’ infrastructure facilities could be direct targets
or indirect casualties of an act of terrorism.  A casualty occurrence
might result in injury or loss of life, extensive property damage or
environmental damage.  Liabilities incurred and interruptions to the
operation of ONEOK Partners’ pipeline caused by such an event could reduce
revenues generated by ONEOK Partners and increase expenses, thereby impairing
ONEOK Partners’ ability to meet its obligations.  Insurance proceeds
may not be adequate to cover all liabilities or expenses incurred or revenues
lost, and ONEOK Partners is not fully insured against all risks inherent to
ONEOK Partners’ business.

As a
result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain insurance
policies can increase substantially, and in some instances, certain insurance
may become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of
coverage.  Consequently, ONEOK Partners may not be able to renew
existing insurance policies or procure other desirable insurance on commercially
reasonable terms, if at all.  If ONEOK Partners was to incur a
significant liability for which ONEOK Partners was not fully insured, it could
have a material adverse effect on ONEOK Partners’ financial position and results
of operations.  Further, the proceeds of any such insurance may not be
paid in a timely manner and may be insufficient if such an event were to
occur.

A
shortage of skilled labor may make it difficult for ONEOK Partners to maintain
labor productivity and competitive costs, which could affect operations and cash
flows available for distribution.

ONEOK
Partners’ operations require skilled and experienced laborers with proficiency
in multiple tasks.  In recent years, a shortage of workers trained in
various skills associated with the midstream energy business has caused ONEOK
Partners to conduct certain operations without full staff, thus hiring outside
resources, which decreases its productivity and increases its
costs.  This shortage of trained workers is the result of experienced
workers reaching retirement age, combined with the difficulty of attracting new
laborers to the midstream energy industry.  This shortage of skilled
labor could continue over an extended period.  If the shortage of
experienced labor continues or worsens, it could have an adverse impact on ONEOK
Partners’ labor productivity and costs and ONEOK Partners’ ability to expand
production in the event there is an increase in the demand for ONEOK Partners’
products and services, which could adversely affect its operations and cash
flows available for distribution to unitholders.

If
the level of drilling and production in the Mid-Continent, Rocky Mountain, Texas
and Gulf Coast regions substantially declines near its assets, ONEOK Partners’
volumes and revenue could decline.

ONEOK
Partners’ ability to maintain or expand its businesses depends largely on the
level of drilling and production by third parties in the Mid-Continent, Rocky
Mountain, Texas and Gulf Coast regions.  Drilling and production are
impacted by factors beyond ONEOK Partners’ control, including:

·

demand
      and prices for natural gas, NGLs and crude
oil;

·

producers’
      finding and developing costs of
reserves;

·

producers’
      desire and ability to obtain necessary permits in a timely and economic
      manner;

·

natural
      gas field characteristics and production
  performance;

·

surface
      access and infrastructure issues;
and

·

capacity
      constraints on natural gas, crude oil and natural gas liquids pipelines
      from the producing areas and ONEOK Partners’
  facilities.

In
addition, drilling and production may be impacted by environmental regulations
governing water discharge.  If the level of drilling and production in
any of these regions substantially declines, ONEOK Partners’ volumes and revenue
could be materially reduced.

-27

If
production from the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin remains flat or declines
and demand for natural gas from the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin is greater
in market areas other than the Midwestern United States, demand for ONEOK
Partners’ interstate gas transportation services could significantly
decrease.

ONEOK
Partners depends on natural gas supply from the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin
for some of ONEOK Partners’ interstate pipelines, primarily ONEOK Partners’
investment in Northern Border Pipeline, that transport Canadian natural gas from
the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin to the Midwestern U.S. market
area.  If demand for natural gas increases in Canada or other markets
not served by ONEOK Partners’ interstate pipelines and/or production remains
flat or declines, demand for transportation service on ONEOK Partners’
interstate natural gas pipelines could decrease significantly, which could
adversely impact ONEOK Partners’ results of operations and cash flows available
for distributions.

Pipeline
integrity programs and repairs may impose significant costs and
liabilities.

Pursuant
to a United States Department of Transportation rule, pipeline operators were
required to develop integrity management programs for intrastate and interstate
natural gas and natural gas liquids pipelines located near high consequence
areas, where a leak or rupture could do the most harm.  The rule also
requires operators to perform ongoing assessments of pipeline integrity;
identify and characterize applicable threats to pipeline segments that could
impact a high consequence area; improve data collection, integration and
analysis; repair and remediate the pipeline as necessary; and implement
preventive and mitigating actions.  The results of these testing
programs could cause ONEOK Partners to incur significant capital and operating
expenditures to make repairs or take remediation, preventive or mitigating
actions that are determined to be necessary.

ONEOK
Partners’ regulated pipelines’ transportation rates are subject to review and
possible adjustment by federal and state regulators.

ONEOK
Partners’ regulated pipelines are subject to extensive regulation by the FERC
and state regulatory agencies, which regulate most aspects of ONEOK Partners’
pipeline business, including ONEOK Partners’ transportation
rates.  Under the Natural Gas Act, which is applicable to interstate
natural gas pipelines, and the Interstate Commerce Act, which is applicable to
crude oil and natural gas liquids pipelines, interstate transportation rates
must be just and reasonable and not unduly discriminatory.

Action by
the FERC or a state regulatory agency could adversely affect ONEOK Partners’
pipeline business’ ability to establish or charge rates that would cover future
increases in their costs, or even to continue to collect rates that cover
current costs, including a reasonable return.  ONEOK Partners cannot
assure unitholders that its pipeline systems will be able to recover all of its
costs through existing or future rates.

ONEOK
Partners’ regulated pipeline companies have recorded certain assets that may not
be recoverable from its customers.

Accounting
policies for FERC-regulated companies permit certain assets that result from the
regulated ratemaking process to be recorded on ONEOK Partners balance sheet that
could not be recorded under GAAP for nonregulated entities.  ONEOK
Partners considers factors such as regulatory changes and the impact of
competition to determine the probability of future recovery of these
assets.  If ONEOK Partners determines future recovery is no longer
probable, ONEOK Partners would be required to write off the regulatory assets at
that time.

ONEOK
Partners’ operations are subject to federal and state laws and regulations
relating to the protection of the environment, which may expose it to
significant costs and liabilities.

The risk
of incurring substantial environmental costs and liabilities is inherent in
ONEOK Partners’ business.  ONEOK Partners’ operations are subject to
extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge
of materials into, or otherwise relating to the protection of, the
environment.  Examples of these laws include:

·

the
      Clean Air Act and analogous state laws that impose obligations related to
      air emissions;

·

the
      Clean Water Act and analogous state laws that regulate discharge of waste
      water from ONEOK Partners’ facilities to state and federal
      waters;

·

the
      federal CERCLA and analogous state laws that regulate the cleanup of
      hazardous substances that may have been released at properties currently
      or previously owned or operated by ONEOK Partners or locations to which
      ONEOK Partners has sent waste for
disposal;

·

the
      federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and analogous state laws
      that impose requirements for the handling and discharge of solid and
      hazardous waste from ONEOK Partners’ facilities;
  and

·

the
      EPA has issued a proposed rule on air quality standards, known as RICE
      NESHAP, scheduled to be adopted in early
2013.

-28
- -


Various
governmental authorities, including the EPA, have the power to enforce
compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under
them.  Violators are subject to administrative, civil and criminal
penalties, including civil fines, injunctions or both.  Joint and
several, strict liability may be incurred without regard to fault under the
CERCLA, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and analogous state laws for the
remediation of contaminated areas.

There is
an inherent risk of incurring environmental costs and liabilities in ONEOK
Partners’ business due to its handling of the products it gathers, transports,
processes and stores, air emissions related to its operations, historical
industry operations and waste disposal practices, some of which may be
material.  Private parties, including the owners of properties through
which ONEOK Partners’ pipeline systems pass, may have the right to pursue legal
actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for non-compliance with
environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property damage
arising from ONEOK Partners’ operations.  Some sites ONEOK Partners
operates are located near current or former third-party hydrocarbon storage and
processing operations, and there is a risk that contamination has migrated from
those sites to ONEOK Partners’ sites.  In addition, increasingly
strict laws, regulations and enforcement policies could significantly increase
ONEOK Partners’ compliance costs and the cost of any remediation that may become
necessary, some of which may be material.  Additional information is
included under Item 1, Business under “Environmental and Safety Matters” and in
Note L of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual
Report.

ONEOK
Partners’ insurance may not cover all environmental risks and costs or may not
provide sufficient coverage in the event an environmental claim is made against
ONEOK Partners.  ONEOK Partners’ business may be materially adversely
affected by increased costs due to stricter pollution-control requirements or
liabilities resulting from non-compliance with required operating or other
regulatory permits.  New environmental regulations might also
materially adversely affect ONEOK Partners’ products and activities, and federal
and state agencies could impose additional safety requirements, all of which
could materially affect ONEOK Partners’ profitability.

In
the competition for customers, ONEOK Partners may have significant levels of
uncontracted or discounted transportation and storage capacity on its natural
gas and natural gas liquids pipelines, processing, fractionation and storage
assets.

ONEOK
Partners’ natural gas and natural gas liquids pipelines, processing,
fractionation and storage assets compete with other pipelines, processing,
fractionation and storage facilities for natural gas and NGL supplies delivered
to the markets it serves.  As a result of competition, at any given
time ONEOK Partners may have significant levels of uncontracted or discounted
capacity on its pipelines, processing, fractionation and in its storage assets,
which could have a material adverse impact on ONEOK Partners’ results of
operations.

ONEOK
Partners is exposed to the credit risk of its customers or counterparties, and
its credit risk management may not be adequate to protect against such
risk.

ONEOK
Partners is subject to the risk of loss resulting from nonpayment and/or
nonperformance by ONEOK Partners’ customers or counterparties.  ONEOK
Partners’ customers or counterparties may experience rapid deterioration of
their financial condition as a result of changing market conditions or financial
difficulties that could impact their creditworthiness or ability to pay ONEOK
Partners for its services.  ONEOK Partners assesses the
creditworthiness of its customers or counterparties and obtains collateral as it
deems appropriate.  If ONEOK Partners fails to adequately assess the
creditworthiness of existing or future customers or counterparties,
unanticipated deterioration in their creditworthiness and any resulting
nonpayment and/or nonperformance could adversely impact ONEOK Partners’ results
of operations.  In addition, if any of ONEOK Partners’ customers or
counterparties files for bankruptcy protection, this could have a material
negative impact on ONEOK Partners’ results of operations.

Any reduction in ONEOK Partners’
credit ratings could materially and adversely affect its business, financial
condition, liquidity and results of operations.

ONEOK
Partners’ senior unsecured long-term debt has been assigned an investment-grade
rating by Moody’s of “Baa2” (Stable) and by S&P of “BBB”
(Stable).  However, we cannot provide assurance that any of its
current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a
rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in its
judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant.  Specifically, if
Moody’s or S&P were to downgrade ONEOK Partners’ long-term debt rating,
particularly below investment grade, its borrowing costs would increase, which
would adversely affect its financial results, and its potential pool of
investors and funding sources could decrease.  Ratings from credit
agencies are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold ONEOK Partners’
securities.  Each rating should be evaluated independently of any
other rating.

-29
- -


A
downgrade of ONEOK Partners’ credit rating may require ONEOK Partners to offer
to repurchase certain of its senior notes or may impair its ability to access
capital.

ONEOK
Partners could be required to offer to repurchase certain of its senior notes
due 2010 and 2011 at par value, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, if Moody’s
or S&P rates those senior notes below investment grade (Baa3 for Moody’s and
BBB- for S&P) and the investment-grade rating is not reinstated within a
period of 40 days; however, once the $250 million 2010 senior notes have been
retired, whether by maturity, redemption or otherwise, ONEOK Partners will no
longer have any obligation to offer to repurchase the $225 million 2011 senior
notes in the event its credit rating falls below investment
grade.  Further, the indenture governing ONEOK Partners’ senior notes
due 2010 and 2011 include an event of default upon acceleration of other
indebtedness of $25 million or more, and the indentures governing ONEOK
Partners’ senior notes due 2012, 2016, 2019, 2036 and 2037 include an event of
default upon the acceleration of other indebtedness of $100 million or more that
would be triggered by such an offer to repurchase.  Such an event of
default would entitle the trustee or the holders of 25 percent in aggregate
principal amount of the outstanding senior notes due 2010, 2011, 2012, 2016,
2019, 2036 and 2037 to declare those notes immediately due and payable in
full.  ONEOK Partners may not have sufficient cash on hand to
repurchase and repay any accelerated senior notes, which may cause ONEOK
Partners to borrow money under its credit facilities or seek alternative
financing sources to finance the repurchases and repayment.  ONEOK
Partners could also face difficulties accessing capital or its borrowing costs
could increase, impacting its ability to obtain financing for acquisitions or
capital expenditures, to refinance indebtedness and to fulfill its debt
obligations.

ONEOK
Partners has adopted certain valuation methodologies that may result in a shift
of income, gain, loss and deduction between the general partner and the
unitholders.  The IRS may challenge this treatment, which could
adversely affect the value of its limited partner units.

When
ONEOK Partners issues additional units or engages in certain other transactions,
ONEOK Partners determines the fair market value of its assets and allocates any
unrealized gain or loss attributable to its assets to the capital accounts of
its unitholders and its general partner.  ONEOK Partners’ methodology
may be viewed as understating the value of its assets.  In that case,
there may be a shift of income, gain, loss and deduction between certain
unitholders and the general partner, which may be unfavorable to such
unitholders.  Moreover, under ONEOK Partners’ current valuation
methods, subsequent purchasers of common units may have a greater portion of
their Internal Revenue Code Section 743(b) adjustment allocated to ONEOK
Partners’ tangible assets and a lesser portion allocated to ONEOK Partners’
intangible assets.  The IRS may challenge ONEOK Partners’ valuation
methods or ONEOK Partners’ allocation of the Section 743(b) adjustment
attributable to ONEOK Partners’ tangible and intangible assets, and allocations
of income, gain, loss and deduction between the general partner and certain of
ONEOK Partners’ unitholders.

A
successful IRS challenge to these methods or allocations could adversely affect
the amount of taxable income or loss being allocated to ONEOK Partners’
unitholders.  It also could affect the amount of gain from ONEOK
Partners unitholders’ sale of common units and could have a negative impact on
the value of the common units or result in audit adjustments to ONEOK Partners
unitholders’ tax returns without the benefit of additional
deductions.

ONEOK
Partners’ treatment of a purchaser of common units as having the same tax
benefits as the seller could be challenged, resulting in a reduction in value of
the common units.

Because
ONEOK Partners cannot match transferors and transferees of common units, ONEOK
Partners is required to maintain the uniformity of the economic and tax
characteristics of these units in the hands of the purchasers and sellers of
these units.  ONEOK Partners does so by adopting certain depreciation
conventions that do not conform to all aspects of the United States Treasury
regulations.  An IRS challenge to these conventions could adversely
affect the tax benefits to a unitholder of ownership of the common units and
could have a negative impact on their value or result in audit adjustments to
ONEOK Partners unitholders’ tax returns.

      approximately 3.1 Bcf/d of peak transportation
  capacity;

·

approximately
      5,600 miles of intrastate natural gas gathering and state-regulated
      intrastate transmission pipelines with peak transportation capacity of
      approximately 3.4 Bcf/d;

·

approximately
      51.6 Bcf of total active working natural gas storage
    capacity;

·

      of approximately 502 MBbl/d;

·

approximately
      160 miles of natural gas liquids distribution pipelines with peak
      transportation capacity of approximately 66
  MBbl/d;

·

two
      natural gas liquids fractionators with operating capacity of approximately
      260 MBbl/d;

·

      MBbl/d of fractionation capacity, including leased
    capacity;

·

      percent ownership interest in one natural gas liquids fractionator with
      ONEOK Partners’ proportional share of operating capacity of approximately
      128 MBbl/d;

·

interest
      in one natural gas liquids fractionator with ONEOK Partners’ proportional
      share of operating capacity of approximately 11
  MBbl/d;

·

one
      isomerization unit with operating capacity of 9
  MBbl/d;

·

six
      NGL storage facilities and four other leased facilities in Oklahoma,
      Kansas and Texas, with approximately 23.2 MMBbl of total operating
      underground NGL storage capacity;

·

approximately
      1,800 miles of FERC-regulated natural gas liquids gathering pipelines with
      peak capacity of approximately 298
MBbl/d;

·

approximately
      3,500 miles of FERC-regulated natural gas liquids and refined petroleum
      products distribution pipelines with peak transportation capacity of 691
      MBbl/d;

·

eight
      NGL product terminals in Missouri, Nebraska, Iowa and Illinois;
      and

·

above-
      and below-ground storage facilities associated with its FERC-regulated
      natural gas liquids pipeline operations in Iowa, Illinois, Nebraska and
      Kansas with 978 MBbl operating
capacity.

ONEOK
Partners’ natural gas pipelines business owns five underground natural gas
storage facilities in Oklahoma, three underground natural gas storage facilities
in Kansas and three underground natural gas storage facilities in
Texas.  One of its natural gas storage facilities in Kansas has been
idle since 2001, following natural gas explosions and eruptions of natural gas
geysers.  ONEOK Partners began injecting brine into the idled facility
in the first quarter of 2007 in order to ensure the long-term integrity of the
idled facility.  ONEOK Partners expects to complete the injection
process by the end of 2011.  Monitoring of the facility and review of
the data for the geoengineering studies are ongoing, in compliance with a KDHE
order while ONEOK Partners evaluates the alternatives for the facility. 
Following the testing of the gathered data, ONEOK Partners expects that the
facility will be returned to storage service, although most likely for a product
other than natural gas.  The return to service will require KDHE
approval.  It is possible, however, that testing could reveal that it is
not safe to return the facility to service or that the KDHE will not grant the
required permits to resume service.

Utilization

- The utilization
rates for ONEOK Partners’ various assets for 2009 and 2008, respectively, were
as follows:

·

natural
      gas processing plants were approximately 68 percent and 71 percent
      utilized, respectively;

·

natural
      gas pipelines were approximately 86 percent and 83 percent subscribed, and
      storage facilities were fully
subscribed;

·

non-FERC-regulated
      natural gas liquids pipelines were approximately 51 percent and 73 percent
      subscribed;

·

average
      contracted natural gas storage volumes were approximately 58 percent and
      74 percent of storage capacity;

·

natural
      gas liquids fractionators were approximately 88 percent and 87 percent
      utilized;

-31
- -


·

FERC-regulated
      natural gas liquids gathering pipelines were approximately 58 percent and
      55 percent utilized; and

·

FERC-regulated
      natural gas liquids distribution pipelines were approximately 62 percent
      and 49 percent utilized.

ONEOK
Partners calculates utilization on its assets using a weighted-average approach,
adjusting for the in-service dates of assets placed in service during 2009 and
2008.  The utilization rate of ONEOK Partners’ non-FERC regulated NGL
pipelines and FERC-regulated NGL gathering pipelines reflects the Arbuckle
pipeline placed in service in August 2009.  The utilization rate of
ONEOK Partners’ fractionation facilities reflects approximate proportional
capacity associated with ownership interests noted above.

On
January 1, 2007, the Bushton Plant was temporarily idled as a result of a
decline in natural gas volumes available for natural gas processing at this
straddle plant.  Volumes declined due to natural field declines and as
a result of contract terminations, as differing process technology made it more
cost efficient to process natural gas at other facilities.  ONEOK
Partners has contracted for all of ONEOK’s capacity at the plant.

During
2008, ONEOK Partners added new natural gas liquids fractionation facilities at
the Bushton location, in conjunction with other changes that were made to the
NGL fractionation capabilities of the existing plant.  Although the
Bushton Plant remains idled, ONEOK Partners currently has 150 MBbl/d of active
NGL fractionation capacity as a result of combining the previously existing
fractionation equipment with the new fractionation facilities.  ONEOK
Partners resumed fractionating NGLs at the facilities in the second half of
2008.

PROCEEDINGS

Will
Price, et al. v. Gas Pipelines, et al. (f/k/a Quinque Operating Company, et al.
v. Gas Pipelines, et al.),

26th Judicial District, District
Court of Stevens County, Kansas, Civil Department, Case No. 99C30 (“Price
I”).

Plaintiffs brought suit on May 28, 1999, against us and
our division, Oklahoma Natural Gas, four subsidiaries of ONEOK Partners,
Mid-Continent Market Center, L.L.C., ONEOK Field Services Company, L.L.C., ONEOK
WesTex Transmission, L.L.C. and ONEOK Hydrocarbon, L.P. (formerly Koch
Hydrocarbon, LP, successor to Koch Hydrocarbon Company), as well as
approximately 225 other defendants.  Plaintiffs sought class
certification for their claims for monetary damages, alleging that the
defendants had underpaid gas producers and royalty owners throughout the United
States by intentionally understating both the volume and the heating content of
purchased gas.  After extensive briefing and a hearing, the Court
refused to certify the class sought by plaintiffs. Plaintiffs then filed an
amended petition limiting the purported class to gas producers and royalty
owners in Kansas, Colorado and Wyoming and limiting the claim to
undermeasurement of volumes.  Oral argument on the plaintiffs’ motion
to certify this suit as a class action was conducted on April 1,
2005.  On September 18, 2009, the Court denied the plaintiffs' motions
for class certification, which, in effect, limits the named plaintiffs to
pursuing individual claims against only those defendants who purchased or
measured their gas.  On October 2, 2009, the plaintiffs filed a motion
for reconsideration of the Court’s denial of class certification, and the
defendants filed their brief on January 18, 2010, in opposition to plaintiffs’
motion.  Oral argument on the motion was held on February 10, 2010,
and the Court took the matter under advisement.

Price and Stixon Petroleum, et al. v. Gas Pipelines, et al.

, 26th Judicial District, District
Court of Stevens County, Kansas, Civil Department, Case No. 03C232 (“Price
II”).

This action was filed by the plaintiffs on May 12, 2003,
after the Court denied class status in Price I. Plaintiffs are seeking monetary
damages based upon a claim that 21 groups of defendants, including us and our
division, Oklahoma Natural Gas, four subsidiaries of ONEOK Partners,
Mid-Continent Market Center, L.L.C., ONEOK Field Services Company, L.L.C., ONEOK
WesTex Transmission, L.L.C. and ONEOK Hydrocarbon, L.P. (formerly Koch
Hydrocarbon, LP, successor to Koch Hydrocarbon Company), intentionally underpaid
gas producers and royalty owners by understating the heating content of
purchased gas in Kansas, Colorado and Wyoming.  Price II has been
consolidated with Price I for the determination of whether either or both cases
may properly be certified as class actions. Oral argument on the plaintiffs’
motion to certify this suit as a class action was conducted on April 1,
2005.  On September 18, 2009, the Court denied the plaintiffs' motions
for class certification, which, in effect, limits the named plaintiffs to
pursuing individual claims against only those defendants who purchased or
measured their gas.  On October 2, 2009, the plaintiffs filed a motion
for reconsideration of the Court’s denial of class certification, and the
defendants filed their brief on January 18, 2010, in opposition to plaintiffs’
motion.  Oral argument on the motion is scheduled for February 10,
2010.  Oral argument on the motion was held on February 10, 2010, and
the Court took the matter under advisement.

Mont
Belvieu Emissions

, Texas
Commission on Environmental Quality

-

The Texas Commission on
Environmental Quality (TCEQ) issued a Notice of Enforcement on March 13, 2009,
alleging that air emissions at the ONEOK Partners Mont Belvieu fractionator
operated by ONEOK Hydrocarbon Southwest, L.L.C. (OHSL), a subsidiary of ONEOK
Partners, exceeded the emissions allowed under its air permit and that OHSL
failed to isolate the source of the emissions in a timely manner.  OHSL
reached agreement with the TCEQ staff on the terms of a settlement under which
it would pay $160,000 and confirm that it has adopted a plan to timely address
similar emissions issues in the future.  Half of the OHSL payment
obligation would be satisfied by contributions to local environmental projects
in Texas.  This settlement was incorporated into an Agreed Order,
which was approved by the TCEQ on January 27, 2010.  Payment of all
amounts due under the order has been made, and the matter is
concluded.

Gas Index
Pricing Litigation:

We, ONEOK Energy
Services Company, L.P. (“OESC”) and one other affiliate are defending, either
individually or together, against the following lawsuits that claim damages
resulting from the alleged market manipulation or false reporting of prices to
gas index publications by us and others:

Samuel P. Leggett, et al. v. Duke
Energy Corporation, et al.

(filed in the Chancery Court for the
Twenty-Fifth Judicial District at Somerville, Tennessee, in January 2005);

Sinclair Oil Corporation v. ONEOK
Energy Services Corporation, L.P., et al.

(filed in the United States
District Court for the District of Wyoming in September 2005, transferred to
MDL-1566 in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada);

J.P. Morgan Trust Company v. ONEOK,
Inc., et al.

(filed in the District Court of Wyandotte County, Kansas, in
October 2005, transferred to MDL-1566 in the United States District Court for
the District of Nevada);

Learjet, Inc., et al. v. ONEOK,
Inc., et al.

(filed in the District Court of Wyandotte, Kansas, in
November 2005, transferred to MDL-1566 in the United States District Court for
the District of Nevada);

Breckenridge Brewery of Colorado,
LLC, et al. v. ONEOK, Inc., et al.

(filed in the District Court of Denver
County, Colorado, in May 2006, transferred to MDL-1566 in the United States
District Court for the District of Nevada);

Missouri Public Service Commission
v. ONEOK, Inc., et al.

(filed in the Sixth Judicial Circuit Court of
Jackson County, Missouri, in October 2006);

Arandell Corporation, et al. v. Xcel
Energy, Inc., et al.

(filed in the Circuit Court for Dane County,
Wisconsin, in December 2006, transferred to MDL-1566 in the United States
District Court for the District of Nevada);

Heartland Regional Medical Center,
et al. v. ONEOK, Inc., et al.

(filed in the Circuit Court of Buchanan
County, Missouri, in March 2007, transferred to MDL-1566 in the United States
District Court for the District of Nevada);

NewPage Wisconsin System v. CMS
Energy Resource Management Company, et al.

(filed in the Circuit Court
for Wood County, Wisconsin, in March 2009, transferred to MDL-1566 in the United
States District Court for the District of Nevada).  In each of these
lawsuits, the plaintiffs allege that we, OESC and one other affiliate and
approximately ten other energy companies and their affiliates engaged in an
illegal scheme to inflate natural gas prices by providing false information to
gas price index publications during the years from 2000 to 2002.  All
of the complaints arise out of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission
investigation into and reports concerning false gas price index-reporting or
manipulation in the energy marketing industry.  Other than as noted
below, each of the cases are in pretrial discovery.

Motions
to dismiss were granted in the

Leggett, Sinclair, Breckenridge,

and

Service Commission

cases.  The dismissal of the

Sinclair

case was appealed to
the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, but is in the process
of being remanded back to the multi-district litigation matter MDL-1566 in the
United States District Court for the District of Nevada for further
proceedings.  The dismissal of the

Leggett

case was reversed by
the Tennessee Court of Appeals on October 29, 2008, but the defendants,
including us and OESC, appealed the decision to the Tennessee Supreme Court
which heard oral argument on November 5, 2009.  On January 8, 2009,
summary judgment was granted in favor of all of the defendants except one in the

Breckenridge

case and
judgment was entered against the plaintiffs in favor of those defendants,
including us, OESC and our other affiliate.  The dismissal of the

Missouri Public Service
Commission

case was affirmed by the Missouri Court of Appeals on December
8, 2009, but the plaintiff has filed a motion for rehearing and an application
to

transfer
the appeal to the Missouri Supreme Court. We continue to analyze all of these
claims and are vigorously defending against them.

7.                      MANAGEMENT’S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND

RESULTS
OF OPERATION

The
following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our audited
consolidated financial statements and the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements in this Annual Report.

EXECUTIVE
SUMMARY

The
following discussion highlights some of our achievements and significant issues
affecting us during the past year.  Please refer to the “Capital
Projects,” “Financial Results and Operating Information,” and “Liquidity and
Capital Resources” sections of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operation and our consolidated financial statements and
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information.

Outlook -

We expect a moderate
economic recovery in 2010, with inflationary pressures beginning in
2011.  Although recent volatility in the financial markets could limit
our access to financial markets on a timely basis or increase our cost of
capital in the future, we anticipate improved credit markets during 2010,
compared with 2009; however, inflation risks may increase the cost of
capital.  We anticipate the consolidation of underperforming assets in
the industry, particularly those with high commodity price exposure and/or high
levels of debt.  Additionally, we anticipate an improving commodity
price environment during 2010, compared with 2009.

Operating Results

- Diluted
earnings per share of common stock from continuing operations (EPS) decreased to
$2.87 in 2009, compared with $2.95 in 2008.  Operating income for 2009
decreased to $894.6 million from $917.0 million for 2008.  This
decrease in operating income is due primarily to the following:

·

lower
      realized commodity prices and narrower NGL product price differentials,
      offset partially by increased natural gas volumes processed and NGL
      volumes gathered, fractionated and transported in our ONEOK Partners
      segment;

·

increased
      operating expenses in our ONEOK Partners segment, due primarily to higher
      employee-related costs, the operation of the Overland Pass Pipeline and
      the Arbuckle Pipeline and increased costs at ONEOK Partners’ fractionation
      facilities, which includes the expanded Bushton Plant fractionator;
      and

·

increased
      depreciation and amortization in our ONEOK Partners segment, due primarily
      to ONEOK Partners’ completed capital projects; offset partially
      by

·

increased
      net margin in our Energy Services segment, due primarily to increased
      transportation margins, net of hedging activities, and increased premium
      services margins; and

·

increased
      net margin in our Distribution segment, due primarily to capital-recovery
      mechanisms.

ONEOK Partners’ Equity
Issuances

- In July 2009, ONEOK Partners completed an underwritten public
offering of 5,486,690 common units, including the partial exercise by the
underwriters of their over-allotment option, at $45.81 per common unit,
generating net proceeds of approximately $241.6 million.  In
conjunction with the offering, ONEOK Partners GP contributed an aggregate of
$5.1 million to ONEOK Partners in order to maintain its 2 percent general
partner interest.  ONEOK Partners used the proceeds from the sale of
common units and the general partner contributions to repay borrowings under the
existing ONEOK Partners Credit Agreement and for general partnership
purposes.

In
February 2010, ONEOK Partners completed an underwritten public offering of
5,500,900 common units, including the partial exercise by the underwriters of
their over-allotment option, at $60.75 per common unit, generating net proceeds
of approximately $322.6 million.  In conjunction with the offering, ONEOK
Partners GP contributed $6.8 million in order to maintain its 2 percent general
partner interest.  ONEOK Partners used the proceeds from the sale of common
units and the general partner contribution to repay borrowings under the ONEOK
Partners Credit Agreement and for general partnership purposes.  As a
result of these transactions, we hold a 42.8 percent aggregate equity interest
in ONEOK Partners.

ONEOK Partners’ Debt Issuance

- - In March 2009, ONEOK Partners completed an underwritten public offering of
$500 million aggregate principal amount of 8.625 percent Senior Notes due
2019.  ONEOK Partners used the net proceeds of approximately $494.3
million from the offering to repay indebtedness outstanding under the ONEOK
Partners Credit Agreement.

Dividends/Distributions

-
During 2009, we paid dividends totaling $1.64 per share, an increase of
approximately 5 percent over the $1.56 per share paid during 2008.  We
declared a quarterly dividend of $0.44 per share ($1.76 per share on an
annualized basis) in January 2010, an increase of approximately 10 percent over
the $0.40 declared in January 2009.  During 2009, ONEOK Partners paid
cash distributions totaling $4.33 per unit, an increase of approximately 3
percent over the $4.205 per unit paid during 2008.  A cash
distribution from ONEOK Partners of $1.10 per unit ($4.40 per unit on an
annualized basis) was declared in January 2010, an increase of approximately 2
percent over the $1.08 declared in January 2009.

SIGNIFICANT
ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES

Acquisition of NGL Pipeline

-
In October 2007, ONEOK Partners completed the acquisition of an interstate
natural gas liquids and refined petroleum products pipeline system and related
assets from a subsidiary of Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L.P. (Kinder Morgan)
for approximately $300 million, before working capital
adjustments.  The FERC-regulated system extends from Bushton and
Conway, Kansas, to Chicago, Illinois, and transports, stores and delivers a full
range of NGL products and refined petroleum products.  The transaction
also included a 50 percent ownership interest in
Heartland.  ConocoPhillips owns the other 50 percent of Heartland and
is the managing partner of the Heartland joint venture, which consists primarily
of a refined petroleum products terminal and pipelines with access to two other
refined petroleum products terminals.  ONEOK Partners’ investment in
Heartland is accounted for under the equity method of
accounting.  Financing for this transaction came from a portion of the
proceeds of ONEOK Partners’ September 2007 issuance of $600 million 6.85 percent
Senior Notes due 2037.  The working capital settlement was finalized
in April 2008, with no material adjustments.

CAPITAL
PROJECTS

All of
the capital projects discussed below are in our ONEOK Partners
segment.

Overland Pass Pipeline

- In
November 2008, Overland Pass Pipeline Company completed construction of a
760-mile natural gas liquids pipeline from Opal, Wyoming, to the Mid-Continent
natural gas liquids market center in Conway, Kansas.  The Overland
Pass Pipeline is designed to transport approximately 110 MBbl/d of
unfractionated NGLs and can be increased to approximately 255 MBbl/d with
additional pump facilities.  Overland Pass Pipeline Company is a joint
venture between ONEOK Partners and a subsidiary of The Williams Companies, Inc.
(Williams).  A subsidiary of ONEOK Partners owns 99 percent of the
joint venture and operates the pipeline.  On or before November 17,
2010, Williams has the option to increase its ownership in Overland Pass
Pipeline Company, which includes the Piceance Lateral and D-J Basin Lateral
pipeline projects, up to 50 percent, with the purchase price being determined in
accordance with the joint venture’s operating agreement.  If Williams
exercises its option to increase its ownership to the full 50 percent, Williams
would have the option

-38
- -


to become
operator.  If Williams does not elect to increase its ownership to at
least 10 percent, ONEOK Partners will have the right, but not the obligation, to
purchase Williams’ entire ownership interest, with the purchase price being
determined in accordance with the joint venture’s operating
agreement.  The project costs for the Overland Pass Pipeline, the
Piceance Lateral Pipeline and the DJ Basin Lateral Pipeline in total are
approximately $780 million, excluding AFUDC.

As part
of a long-term agreement, Williams dedicated its NGL production from two of its
natural gas processing plants in Wyoming, capable of delivering over 70 MBbl/d
to the Overland Pass Pipeline.  Subsidiaries of ONEOK Partners are
providing downstream fractionation, storage and transportation services to
Williams.  ONEOK Partners has also reached agreements with certain
producers for supply commitments to the D-J Basin and Piceance Lateral
pipelines.  ONEOK Partners has NGL production dedicated from new and
existing plants that it expects to provide throughput of more than 200 MBbl/d to
the Overland Pass Pipeline over the next three to five years.

ONEOK
Partners also invested approximately $239 million, excluding AFUDC, to expand
its existing fractionation and storage capabilities and to increase the capacity
of its natural gas liquids distribution pipelines.  Part of this
expansion included adding new fractionation facilities at ONEOK Partners’
Bushton, Kansas, location, which increased the total fractionation capacity at
the Bushton facility to 150 MBbl/d from 80 MBbl/d.  The addition of
the new facilities and the upgrade to the existing fractionator were completed
in October 2008.  Additionally, portions of the natural gas liquids
distribution pipeline upgrades were completed in the second and third quarters
of 2008.

Piceance Lateral Pipeline

- In
October 2009, Overland Pass Pipeline Company placed in service the 150-mile
natural gas liquids lateral pipeline from the Piceance Basin in Colorado to the
Overland Pass Pipeline.  The pipeline has capacity to transport as
much as 100 MBbl/d of unfractionated NGLs.  Williams has dedicated its
NGL production from its new Willow Creek natural gas processing plant, and will
dedicate NGL production from an additional existing natural gas processing
plant.  Another plant owned by a third party has also been
dedicated.  ONEOK Partners continues to negotiate with other producers
for supply commitments.

D-J Basin Lateral Pipeline

-
In March 2009, Overland Pass Pipeline Company placed in service the 125-mile
natural gas liquids lateral pipeline from the Denver-Julesburg Basin in
northeastern Colorado to the Overland Pass Pipeline.  The pipeline has
capacity to transport as much as 55 MBbl/d of unfractionated
NGLs.  ONEOK Partners continues to discuss with its producers
opportunities from new drilling and plant upgrades over the next two
years.

Arbuckle Natural Gas Liquids
Pipeline

- In August 2009, the 440-mile Arbuckle pipeline project, a
natural gas liquids pipeline system that delivers unfractionated NGLs from
points in southern Oklahoma and Texas to the Texas Gulf Coast was placed in
service.  The Arbuckle pipeline system has the capacity to transport
160 MBbl/d of unfractionated NGLs, expandable to 240 MBbl/d with additional pump
facilities, and connects ONEOK Partners’ existing Mid-Continent infrastructure
with its fractionation facility in Mont Belvieu, Texas, and other Gulf Coast
region fractionators.  ONEOK Partners has NGL production dedicated
from existing and new natural gas processing plants that it expects to provide
throughput of more than 210 MBbl/d over the next three to five
years.

The
demand for surface easements increased dramatically in Texas and Oklahoma over
the last two years because of increased oil and natural gas exploration and
production activities, as well as pipeline construction.  As
previously reported, project costs have been more expensive than originally
estimated due to delays associated with right-of-way acquisition, increased
materials costs and difficult construction conditions associated with several
weeks of heavy spring rains in 2009, resulting in greatly reduced construction
productivity.  ONEOK Partners also experienced increased costs due to
a number of scope changes, arising primarily from additional supply development
opportunities.  ONEOK Partners estimates project costs will be
approximately $490 million, excluding AFUDC, for the current
capacity.

Williston Basin Gas Processing Plant
Expansion

- The expansion of ONEOK Partners’ Grasslands natural gas
processing facility in North Dakota was placed in service in March 2009. 
The expansion increased processing capacity to approximately 100 MMcf/d from its
previous capacity of 63 MMcf/d and increased fractionation capacity to
approximately 12 MBbl/d from 8 MBbl/d.  The cost of the project was
approximately $46 million, excluding AFUDC.

Guardian Pipeline Expansion and
Extension

- In February 2009, ONEOK Partners completed the 119-mile
extension of its Guardian Pipeline.  The pipeline has capacity to
transport 537 MMcf/d of natural gas north from Ixonia, Wisconsin, to the Green
Bay, Wisconsin, area.  The project is supported by 15-year shipper
commitments with We Energies and Wisconsin Public Service Corporation, and the
capacity is close to fully subscribed.  The project cost approximately
$320 million, excluding AFUDC.

REGULATORY

It is
unclear how Congress and the current Administration’s efforts to improve market
transparency and stabilize the over-the-counter (OTC) derivative markets will
impact our ability to access OTC energy derivatives products and markets, which
are critical to our business.  We currently use the OTC markets to
manage business risks including fluctuating commodity prices, interest rates,
currency rates and for the hedging of inventory and capacity
contracts.  Most of the current proposals before Congress contain
exemptions for these activities that would limit the impact on our
operations.  Additional matters associated with these proposals that
are not yet defined include the potential for increased capital requirements and
a reduction in the overall liquidity of the markets.  There may also
be an administrative burden of new reporting and record keeping required by one
or more of the federal agencies providing market oversight.

In
addition, the EPA has issued a proposed rule on air-quality standards, “National
Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Reciprocating Internal
Combustion Engines,” also known as RICE NESHAP, scheduled to be adopted in early
2013.  The proposed rule will require capital expenditures over the
next three years for the purchase and installation of new emissions-control
equipment.  We do not expect these expenditures to have a material impact
on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

Several
regulatory initiatives positively impacted the earnings and future earnings
potential for our Distribution segment.  See discussion of our
Distribution segment’s regulatory initiative beginning on page 49.

disclosure
      of subsequent events review.

The above
accounting standards did not or are not expected to have a material impact on
our consolidated financial statements, results of operations or cash
flows.

CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

The
preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in
accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions with respect
to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty that affect the
reported amount of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial
statements.  These estimates and assumptions also affect the reported
amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.  Although
we believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable, actual results could
differ from our estimates.

The
following is a summary of our most critical accounting estimates, which are
defined as those estimates most important to the portrayal of our financial
condition and results of operations and requiring management’s most difficult,
subjective or complex judgment, particularly because of the need to make
estimates concerning the impact of inherently uncertain matters.  We
have discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting policies
and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.

Fair Value Measurements

-

Determining Fair
Value

- We define fair value as the price that would be received to sell
an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date.  We use the market and income
approaches to determine the fair value of our assets and liabilities and
consider the markets in which the transactions are executed.  While
many of the contracts in our portfolio are executed in liquid markets where
price transparency exists, some contracts are executed in markets for which
market prices may exist but the market may be relatively
inactive.  This results in limited price transparency that requires
management’s judgment and assumptions to estimate fair values.  Inputs
into our fair value estimates include commodity exchange prices,
over-the-counter quotes, volatility, historical correlations of pricing data and
LIBOR and other liquid money market instrument rates.  We also utilize
internally developed basis curves that incorporate observable and unobservable
market data.  We validate our valuation inputs with third-party
information and settlement prices from other sources, where
available.  In addition, as prescribed by the income approach, we
compute the fair value of our derivative portfolio by discounting the projected
future cash flows

-40
- -


from our
derivative assets and liabilities to present value.  The interest rate
yields used to calculate the present value discount factors are derived from
LIBOR, Eurodollar futures and Treasury swaps.  The projected cash
flows are then multiplied by the appropriate discount factors to determine the
present value or fair value of our derivative instruments.  We also
take into consideration the potential impact on market prices of liquidating
positions in an orderly manner and over a reasonable period of time using
current market conditions.  We consider current market data in
evaluating counterparties’ nonperformance risk by using specific and sector bond
yields and also monitor the credit default swap markets, net of collateral, as
well as our own risk of nonperformance.  Although we use our best
estimates to determine the fair value of the derivative contracts we have
executed, the ultimate market prices realized could differ from our estimates,
and the differences could be material.

Fair Value Hierarchy

- - We utilize a fair value hierarchy to prioritize inputs to valuation techniques
based on observable and unobservable data and categorize the inputs into three
levels, with the highest priority given to Level 1 and the lowest priority given
to Level 3.  The levels are described below:

·

Level
      1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or
      liabilities;

·

Level
      2 - Significant observable pricing inputs other than quoted prices
      included within Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable
      as of the reporting date.  Essentially, this represents inputs
      that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market
      data; and

·

Level
      3 - May include one or more unobservable inputs that are significant in
      establishing a fair value estimate.  These unobservable inputs
      are developed based on the best information available and may include our
      own internal data.

Determining
the appropriate classification of our fair value measurements within the fair
value hierarchy requires management’s judgment regarding the degree to which
market data is observable or corroborated by observable market data. 
Transfers in and out of Level 3 typically result from derivatives for which fair
value is determined based on multiple inputs.  If prices change for a
particular input from the previous measurement date to the current measurement
date, the impact could result in the derivative being moved between Level 2 and
Level 3, depending upon management’s judgment of the significance of the price
change of that particular input to the total fair value of the
derivative.

See Note
C of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for
more discussion of fair value measurements.

Derivatives, Accounting for
Financially Settled Transactions and Risk Management Activities

- We
engage in wholesale energy marketing, retail marketing, trading and risk
management activities.  We record all derivative instruments at fair
value, with the exception of normal purchases and normal sales that are expected
to result in physical delivery.

Market
value changes result in a change in the fair value of our derivative
instruments.  The accounting for changes in the fair value of a
derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as
part of a hedging relationship and, if so, the nature of the risk being hedged
and how effective the hedging instrument is.  If the derivative
instrument does not qualify or is not designated as part of a hedging
relationship, then we account for changes in fair value of the derivative in
earnings as they occur.  Commodity price volatility may have a
significant impact on the gain or loss in any given period.  For more
information on fair value sensitivity and a discussion of the market risk of
pricing changes, see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about
Market Risk.

To reduce
our exposure to fluctuations in natural gas, NGLs and condensate prices, we
periodically enter into futures, forwards, options or swap transactions in order
to hedge anticipated purchases and sales of natural gas, NGLs and condensate and
fuel requirements.  Interest-rate swaps are also used to manage
interest-rate risk.  Under certain conditions, we designate these
derivative instruments as a hedge against our exposure to changes in fair values
or cash flow.  For hedges of exposure to changes in cash flow, the
effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported
initially as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and is
subsequently recorded to earnings when the forecasted transaction affects
earnings.  Any ineffectiveness of designated hedges is reported in
earnings during the period the ineffectiveness occurs.  For hedges
against our exposure in changes in fair value, the gain or loss on the
derivative instrument is recognized in earnings during the period of change
together with the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the
risk being hedged.  We do not believe that changes in our fair value
estimates of our derivative instruments have a material impact on our results of
operations as the majority of our derivatives are accounted for as hedges for
which ineffectiveness is not material.

Upon
election, many of our purchase and sale agreements that otherwise would be
required to follow the accounting for derivative instruments qualify as normal
purchases and normal sales that result in physical delivery and are therefore
exempt from fair value accounting treatment.

D of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for

activities.

Impairment of Goodwill, Long-lived
Assets and Intangible Assets

- We assess our goodwill and intangible
assets with an indefinite useful life for impairment at least annually as of
July 1.  There were no impairment charges resulting from our July 1,
2009, 2008 or 2007, impairment tests.

As part
of our impairment test, an initial assessment is made by comparing the fair
value of a reporting unit with its book value, including goodwill.  To
estimate the fair value of our reporting units, we use two generally accepted
valuation approaches, an income approach and a market approach.  Under
the income approach, we use anticipated cash flows over a period of years plus a
terminal value and discount these amounts to their present value using
appropriate rates of return that are consistent with a market participant’s
perspective.  Under the market approach, we apply multiples to
forecasted cash flows.  The multiples used are consistent with a
market participant’s perspective of historical asset
transactions.  The forecasted cash flows are consistent with a market
participant’s perspective of average forecasted cash flows for a reporting unit
over a period of years.

Our
estimates of fair value significantly exceeded the book value of our reporting
units and our indefinite-lived intangible assets in our July 1, 2009, impairment
test.  Even if the estimated fair values used in our July 1, 2009,
impairment test were reduced by 10 percent, no impairment charges would have
resulted.  The following table sets forth our goodwill, by segment, at
both December 31, 2009 and 2008:

See Notes
A and F of the Note to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report

As part
of our indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test, we compare the
estimated fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets with their book
values.  The fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets is
estimated using the market approach.  Under the market approach, we
apply multiples to forecasted cash flows of the assets associated with our
indefinite-lived intangible assets.  The multiples used are consistent
with a market participant’s perspective of historical asset
transactions.  We determined that there were no impairments to our
indefinite-lived intangible assets in 2009 or 2008.

We had
$427.7 million and $435.4 million of intangible assets recorded on our
Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, of
which $272.2 million and $279.8 million, respectively, was recorded in our ONEOK
Partners segment.

We assess
our long-lived assets, including intangible assets with a finite useful life,
for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its
carrying amount may not be recoverable.  In step one of the impairment
test, the carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds
the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use
and eventual disposition of the asset.  If the carrying amount is not
recoverable, we record an impairment loss equal to the difference between the
carrying value and the fair value of the long-lived asset.  This type
of analysis requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding industry
economic factors and the profitability of future business
strategies.  We determined that there were no asset impairments in
2009, 2008 or 2007.

For the
investments we account for under the equity method, the impairment test
considers whether the fair value of the equity investment as a whole, not the
underlying net assets, has declined and whether that decline is other than
temporary.  Therefore, we periodically re-evaluate the amount at which
we carry our equity method investments to determine whether current events or
circumstances warrant adjustments to our carrying value.  We determined
that there were no impairments to our investments in unconsolidated affiliates
in 2009, 2008 or 2007.

Our
impairment tests require the use of assumptions and estimates.  If
actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates or our
assumptions and estimates change due to new information, we may be exposed to an
impairment charge.

Pension and Postretirement Employee
Benefits

- We have defined benefit retirement plans covering certain
full-time employees.  We sponsor welfare plans that provide
postretirement medical and life insurance benefits to certain employees who
retire with at least five years of service.  Our actuarial consultant
calculates the expense and liability related to these plans and uses statistical
and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events.  These
factors include assumptions about the discount rate, expected return on plan
assets, rate of future compensation increases, age and employment
periods.  In determining the projected benefit obligations and costs,
assumptions can change from period to period and result in material changes in
the costs and liabilities we recognize.  See Note K of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for additional
information.

Assumed
health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported
for our health care plans.  A one-percentage point change in assumed
health care cost trend rates would have the following effects.

(17,803

During
2009, we recorded net periodic benefit costs of $31.7 million related to our
defined benefit pension plans and $26.1 million related to postretirement
benefits.  We estimate that in 2010, we will record net periodic
benefit costs of $32.6 million related to our defined benefit pension plans and
$20.9 million related to postretirement benefits.  In determining our
estimated expenses for 2010, we assumed an 8.50 percent expected return on plan
assets and a discount rate of 6.00 percent.  A decrease in our
expected return on plan assets to 8.25 percent would increase our 2010 estimated
net periodic benefit costs by approximately $2.1 million for our defined benefit
pension plans and would not have a significant impact on our postretirement
benefit plan.  A decrease in our assumed discount rate to 5.75 percent
would increase our 2010 estimated net periodic benefit costs by approximately
$2.9 million for our defined benefit pension plans and would not have a
significant impact on our postretirement benefit plan.  For 2010, we
anticipate our total contributions to our defined benefit pension plans and
postretirement benefit plan to be $43.3 million and $12.4 million, respectively,
and the expected benefit payments for our postretirement benefit plan are
estimated to be $15.4 million.

Contingencies

- Our accounting
for contingencies covers a variety of business activities, including
contingencies for legal and environmental exposures.  We accrue these
contingencies when our assessments indicate that it is probable that a liability
has been incurred or an asset will not be recovered, and an amount can be
reasonably estimated.  We base our estimates on currently available
facts and our estimates of the ultimate outcome or
resolution.  Accruals for estimated losses from environmental
remediation obligations generally are recognized no later than completion of the
remediation feasibility study.  Recoveries of environmental
remediation costs from other parties are recorded as assets when their receipt
is deemed probable.  Our expenditures for environmental evaluation,
mitigation, remediation and compliance to date have not been significant in
relation to our financial position or results of operations, and our
expenditures related to environmental matters had no material effects upon
earnings or cash flows during 2009, 2008 and 2007.  Actual results may
differ from our estimates resulting in an impact, positive or negative, on
earnings.  See Note L of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements in this Annual Report for additional discussion of
contingencies.

    to:

-

increased
      transportation margins, net of hedging
  activities;

-

increased
      premium services margins;

-

increased
      storage and marketing margins, net of hedging activities;
    and

-

increased
      retail marketing margins;

·

increased
      net margin in our Distribution segment, due primarily to capital-recovery
      mechanisms and revenue rider recoveries; offset partially
    by

·

decreased
      net margin in our ONEOK Partners segment, due primarily
  to:

-

lower
      realized commodity prices and narrower NGL product price differentials;
      offset partially by

-

increased
      NGL volumes gathered, fractionated and transported, primarily associated
      with the completion of the Overland Pass Pipeline and related expansion
      projects, and the Arbuckle Pipeline, as well as new NGL supply
      connections;

-

increased
      natural gas transportation margins from the Guardian Pipeline expansion
      and extension that was completed in February 2009 and an increase in
      volumes contracted on Midwestern Gas Transmission in ONEOK Partners’
      natural gas pipelines business; and

-

increased
      natural gas volumes processed and sold in our ONEOK Partners segment’s
      gathering and processing business.

Operating
costs increased due primarily to higher employee-related costs, incremental
costs associated with the operation of the Overland Pass Pipeline, the Arbuckle
Pipeline and the expanded Bushton Plant fractionator, outside services expenses
and general taxes related to the completed capital projects in our ONEOK
Partners segment, and increased employee-related costs in our Distribution
segment.  These increases were slightly offset by lower bad-debt
expense in our Distribution segment.

Depreciation
and amortization expense increased primarily as a result of ONEOK Partners’
completed capital projects.

Equity
earnings from investments decreased due primarily to lower subscription volumes
and rates on Northern Border Pipeline, of which ONEOK Partners owns a 50 percent
interest.  Additionally, there was a gain on the sale of Bison
Pipeline

-44
- -


LLC by
Northern Border Pipeline in 2008.  Equity earnings from investments
also decreased due to lower natural gas volumes gathered in ONEOK Partners’
various natural gas gathering and processing equity investments, whose assets
are primarily located in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming.

Allowance
for equity funds used during construction decreased due primarily to the
completion of the Arbuckle Pipeline, the Overland Pass Pipeline and related
expansion projects, and the Guardian Pipeline expansion and
extension.

Interest
expense increased due primarily to ONEOK Partners’ March 2009 debt issuance and
a decrease in capitalized interest due to the completion of ONEOK Partners’
capital projects, offset partially by decreased borrowings by
ONEOK.

Net
income attributable to noncontrolling interests for 2009 and 2008 primarily
reflects the remaining 54.9 percent and 52.3 percent, respectively, of ONEOK
Partners that we do not own.  The decrease in net income attributable
to noncontrolling interests was due to the decreased income of our ONEOK
Partners segment.

Capital
expenditures decreased due to the completion of the capital projects in our
ONEOK Partners segment.

2008 vs. 2007

- Energy markets
were affected by higher commodity prices during 2008, compared with
2007.  The increase in commodity prices had a direct impact on our
revenues and cost of sales and fuel.  Net margin increased due
primarily to the following:

·

increased
      net margin in our ONEOK Partners segment, due primarily
  to:

-

wider
      NGL product price differentials;

-

higher
      realized commodity prices;

-

incremental
      net margin associated with the assets acquired from Kinder Morgan;
      and

-

increased
      NGL gathering and fractionation
volumes;

·

increased
      margin in our Distribution segment, due primarily to the implementation of
      new rate mechanisms; offset partially
by

·

decreased
      margin in our Energy Services segment, due primarily to a decrease in
      storage and marketing margins and transportation margins, net of hedging
      activities.

Operating
costs increased due primarily to incremental operating expenses associated with
the assets acquired from Kinder Morgan, increased outside services primarily
associated with scheduled maintenance activities at ONEOK Partners’ Medford,
Oklahoma, and Mont Belvieu, Texas, fractionators, and chemical
costs.  Operating costs also increased due to costs associated with
the startup of the newly expanded Bushton, Kansas, fractionator and Overland
Pass Pipeline, both in our ONEOK Partners segment.

Depreciation
and amortization increased due primarily to the assets acquired from Kinder
Morgan and depreciation expense associated with ONEOK Partners’ completed
capital projects.  Additionally, our Distribution segment had an
increase in depreciation and amortization, due primarily to additional
investment in property, plant and equipment.

Equity
earnings from investments increased due primarily to ONEOK Partners’ share of
the gain on the sale of Bison Pipeline LLC by Northern Border Pipeline in 2008,
and ONEOK Partners’ earnings related to higher gathering revenues in its natural
gas gathering and processing business’ various investments, offset partially by
reduced throughput on Northern Border Pipeline.

Allowance
for equity funds used during construction and capital expenditures increased due
to ONEOK Partners’ capital projects.

Interest
expense increased due primarily to increased borrowings to fund ONEOK Partners’
capital projects.

Net
income attributable to noncontrolling interests for 2008 and 2007 reflects the
remaining 52.3 percent and 54.3 percent, respectively, of ONEOK Partners that we
did not own.  The increase in 2008 is due to the increase in income
for our ONEOK Partners segment, offset partially by our increased equity
ownership interest in ONEOK Partners.

Selected Financial Results and
Operating Information

- The following tables set forth certain selected
financial results and operating information for our ONEOK Partners segment for
the periods indicated:

2009 vs. 2008

- Net margin
decreased due primarily to the following:

·

a
      decrease of $106.0 million due to lower realized commodity prices in ONEOK
      Partners’ natural gas gathering and processing business;
    and

·

a
      decrease of $41.7 million due to narrower NGL product price differentials
      in ONEOK Partners’ natural gas liquids business; offset partially
      by

·

an
      increase of $68.7 million due to increased NGL volumes gathered,
      fractionated and transported, primarily associated with the completion of
      the Overland Pass Pipeline and related expansion projects, and the
      Arbuckle Pipeline, as well as new NGL supply connections in ONEOK
      Partners’ natural gas liquids
business;

·

an
      increase of $38.8 million due to higher natural gas transportation margins
      from the Guardian Pipeline expansion and extension that was completed in
      February 2009 and an increase in volumes contracted on Midwestern Gas
      Transmission in ONEOK Partners’ natural gas pipelines business;
      and

·

an
      increase of $22.3 million due to higher volumes processed and sold in
      ONEOK Partners’ natural gas gathering and processing
    business.

Operating
costs increased due primarily to higher employee-related costs, incremental
costs associated with the operation of the Overland Pass Pipeline and related
expansion projects, and the Arbuckle Pipeline and costs associated with the
expanded Bushton Plant fractionator.

Depreciation
and amortization expense increased primarily as a result of ONEOK Partners’
completed capital projects.

Equity
earnings from investments decreased due primarily to lower subscription volumes
and rates on Northern Border Pipeline.  Additionally, there was a gain
on the sale of Bison Pipeline LLC by Northern Border Pipeline in the third
quarter of 2008.  Equity earnings from investments also decreased due
to lower natural gas volumes gathered in ONEOK Partners’ various natural gas
gathering and processing equity investments whose assets are primarily located
in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming.

Allowance
for equity funds used during construction decreased due primarily to the
completion of the Arbuckle Pipeline in July 2009, the Overland Pass Pipeline and
related expansion projects, and the Guardian Pipeline expansion and extension
that was placed in service in February 2009.

Interest
expense increased due primarily to ONEOK Partners’ March 2009 debt issuance and
a decrease in capitalized interest due to the completion of ONEOK Partners’
capital projects.

Capital expenditures decreased due
primarily to the completions of ONEOK Partners’ capital
projects.

-46
- -


2008 vs. 2007

- Net margin
increased due primarily to the following:

·

an
      increase in ONEOK Partners’ natural gas liquids business due to the
      following:

-

an
      increase of $88.6 million due to more favorable NGL product price
      differentials;

-

an
      increase of $58.7 million due to increased volumes gathered, fractionated
      and transported, primarily resulting from increased volumes on the assets
      acquired from Kinder Morgan in October 2007, the completion of the
      Overland Pass Pipeline in the fourth quarter of 2008 and other new supply
      connections; offset partially by increased fuel costs associated with
      these higher volumes; and

-

an
      increase of $8.4 million in certain operational measurement gains,
      primarily at NGL storage caverns;

·

an
      increase in ONEOK Partners’ natural gas gathering and processing business
      due to the following:

-

an
      increase of $58.4 million due to higher realized commodity
      prices;

-

an
      increase of $11.9 million due to improved contractual
    terms;

-

an
      increase of $7.0 million due to higher volumes sold and processed; offset
      partially by

-

a
      decrease of $8.6 million due to a one-time favorable contract settlement
      that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2007;
and

·

an
      increase of $11.7 million due to increased transportation and storage
      margins primarily as a result of the impact of higher natural gas prices
      on retained fuel, and new and renegotiated storage contracts in ONEOK
      Partners’ natural gas business.

Operating
costs increased due primarily to incremental operating expenses associated with
the assets acquired from Kinder Morgan, increased outside service costs
primarily associated with scheduled maintenance activities at ONEOK Partners’
Medford, Oklahoma, and Mont Belvieu, Texas, fractionators, and chemical
costs.  Operating costs also increased due to costs associated with
the startup of ONEOK Partners’ newly expanded Bushton, Kansas, fractionator and
Overland Pass Pipeline.

Depreciation
and amortization increased due primarily to depreciation expense associated with
ONEOK Partners’ completed capital projects and the assets acquired from Kinder
Morgan.

Equity
earnings from investments increased due primarily to higher gathering revenues
in ONEOK Partners’ various investments, as well as an $8.3 million gain on the
sale of Bison Pipeline LLC by Northern Border Pipeline in 2008, offset partially
by reduced throughput on Northern Border Pipeline.  ONEOK Partners
owns a 50 percent equity interest in Northern Border Pipeline.

Allowance
for equity funds used during construction and capital expenditures increased due
to ONEOK Partners’ capital projects.

Interest
expense increased due primarily to increased borrowings to fund ONEOK Partners’
capital projects.

      authorized recovery of the fuel-related portion of bad debts in Oklahoma,
      effective January 2009; and

·

a
      decrease of $5.3 million in vehicle-related
  costs.

Depreciation
and amortization expense increased due primarily to the following:

·

an
      increase of $4.8 million in regulatory amortization associated with
      previously deferred costs that have been approved for recovery in our
      revenues; and

·

an
      increase of $1.0 million in depreciation expense related to our investment
      in property, plant and equipment.

2008 vs. 2007

- Net margin
increased due primarily to:

·

an
      increase of $15.7 million resulting from the implementation of new rate
      mechanisms, which includes a $12.4 million increase in Oklahoma and a $3.3
      million increase in Texas; and

·

an
      increase of $2.2 million related to recovery of carrying costs for natural
      gas in storage.

Operating
costs decreased due primarily to:

·

a
      decrease of $4.3 million in employee-related costs;
  and

·

a
      decrease of $1.0 million in bad debt expense; offset partially
      by

      revenue rider recoveries.

Capital Expenditures

- Our
capital expenditure program includes expenditures for extending service to new
areas, modifications to customer service lines, increasing system capabilities,
general replacements and improvements.  It is our practice to maintain
and upgrade facilities to ensure safe, reliable and efficient
operations.  Our capital expenditure program included $37.3 million,
$51.8 million and $50.6 million for new business development in 2009, 2008 and
2007, respectively.

-48
- -


Capital
expenditures decreased for 2009, compared with the same periods last year,
primarily as a result of lower spending on growth projects due to the economic
slowdowns experienced in our service territories during 2009.

Regulatory
Initiatives

Oklahoma

- In
December 2008, the OCC approved a final order to increase the recovery level of
Oklahoma Natural Gas’ Capital Investment Mechanism (CIM) to $12.6 million from
$7.6 million annually.  The recovery mechanism allows Oklahoma Natural
Gas to collect a rate of return, depreciation and 50 percent of the property tax
expense associated with

-49
- -


incremental
capital investments to maintain its facilities since its 2005 rate
case.  The increased recovery level was effective in January
2009.

In August
2009, Oklahoma Natural Gas filed the 2009 CIM application with the OCC
increasing the level of recoveries to $17.3 million through the CIM
rider.  In November 2009, the OCC approved a final order to authorize
the CIM recoveries of $17.3 million earned in 2009, which will be collected from
customers beginning in January 2010.  The impact from the OCC order
was an increase in revenues of $17.3 million in 2009.

In
December 2008, the OCC issued a final order authorizing Oklahoma Natural Gas to
defer the fuel-related portion of bad debts for recovery in the purchased-gas
adjustment mechanism.  The associated deferrals began in January 2009
and are expected to be recovered in the monthly purchased-gas cost-adjustment
mechanism in 2010.

In 2005,
the OCC authorized Oklahoma Natural Gas’ transmission pipeline Integrity
Management Program (IMP), intended to comply with the Federal Pipeline Safety
Improvement Act of 2002.  An IMP application was filed at the OCC in
January  2009, requesting recovery of all costs incurred, deferred and
not recovered (inclusive of operations and maintenance expense, depreciation,
property taxes and a rate of return) through base rates associated with IMP
deferrals for 2008 and annual true-ups associated with the prior recovery
period.  In June 2009, the OCC approved this application for recovery
of $10.5 million in IMP costs.

In May
2009, the OCC approved Oklahoma Natural Gas and the OCC Staff’s joint
application for a performance-based rate change mechanism.  A
performance-based rate structure shares efficiency savings with customers,
alleviates the need for multiple tariff filings, saving ratepayers the cost of
such frequent filings, and allows for timely oversight of Oklahoma Natural Gas’
capital investment decisions.

In June
2009, Oklahoma Natural Gas filed an application with the OCC requesting an
increase of approximately $66.1 million in base rates, which includes existing
riders that would effectively reduce the requested rate increase to a net amount
of $37.6 million.  On October 28, 2009, Oklahoma Natural Gas, the OCC
Staff, the Oklahoma Attorney General and other intervening parties signed and
filed a Stipulation Settlement in this case.  In December 2009, the
Commission approved a rate increase of $54.5 million, which includes existing
riders that would effectively reduce the rate increase to a net amount of $25.7
million, and the new rates went into effect on December 18, 2009.  The
estimated impact on 2010 operating income is $14 million.

On
January 27, 2010, Oklahoma Natural Gas filed an application and supporting
testimony requesting recovery of the IMP deferral for 2009 and annual
adjustments associated with the prior recovery period in the amount of $15.7
million.

Kansas

- In December
2008, the KCC approved Kansas Gas Service’s request to impose a surcharge
designed to annually collect approximately $2.9 million in costs associated with
its Gas System Reliability Surcharge (GSRS) mechanism.  The GSRS mechanism
allows natural gas utilities to earn a return and recover carrying costs
associated with investments made to comply with state and federal pipeline
safety requirements or costs to relocate existing facilities pursuant to
requests made by a government entity.  The authorized GSRS collections
were billed effective with customer billings on January 1,
2009.

In
December 2009, the KCC approved Kansas Gas Service’s application to increase the
GSRS, resulting in a $3.9 million increase in operating income for 2010,
effective with customer billings in January 2010.

In
September 2009, the KCC authorized us to defer the difference between current
GAAP pension and post retirement expenses and the level of these expenses
incorporated in base rates as either a regulatory asset or liability.  In
conjunction with the deferral, we are required to fund the applicable amount of
our pension and post retirement costs.  Amortization and recovery of the
accumulated deferrals will begin with the effective date of our next rate change
and will continue for a period not to exceed five years.  The impact from
the KCC order was a decrease in operating expenses of $3.0 million for
2009.

In
December 2009, Kansas Gas Service filed an application with the KCC to become an
Efficiency Kansas Loan Program utility partner, contingent upon the commission
approving a rate mechanism that would recover losses from declining sales and an
energy conservation rider to recover program costs.

Texas

- In June 2009,
Austin and the surrounding cities in our central Texas service area approved an
increase in base rates of $1.1 million and a $5.0 million decrease in
depreciation and amortization expense, plus recovery of the fuel-related portion
of bad debts and carrying costs for natural gas in storage.  The new
rates were effective July 2009.

-50
- -


In August
2009, the cities of the Rio Grande Valley service area approved an increase in
base rates of $1.3 million and a $1.6 million decrease in depreciation and
amortization expense, plus recovery of the fuel-related portion of bad
debts.  The new rates were effective September 2009.

In
December 2009, Texas Gas Service filed a statement of intent to increase rates
in its El Paso service area by $7.3 million.  If approved, new rates
will become effective by May 2010.

General

- Certain costs to be
recovered through the ratemaking process have been capitalized as regulatory
assets.  Should recovery cease due to regulatory actions, certain of
these assets may no longer meet the criteria for recognition and accordingly, a
write-off of regulatory assets and stranded costs may be
required.  There were no write-offs of regulatory assets resulting
from the failure to meet the criteria for capitalization during 2009 or
2008.

Energy
Services

Selected Financial Results

-
The following table sets forth certain selected financial results for our Energy
Services segment for the periods indicated:

The
following table shows our margins by activity for the periods
indicated:

Marketing,
storage and transportation, gross, primarily includes marketing, purchases and
sales, premium services and the impact of cash flow and fair value hedges, and
other derivative instruments used to manage our risk associated with these
activities.  Storage and transportation costs primarily include the
cost of leasing capacity, storage injection and withdrawal fees, fuel charges
and gathering fees.  Risk management and operational decisions have an
impact on the net result of our marketing, premium services and storage
activities.  We evaluate our strategies on an ongoing basis to
optimize the value of our contracted assets and to minimize the financial impact
of market conditions on the services we provide.

Retail
marketing includes net margin from providing physical marketing, supply services
and risk management services to residential, municipal, and small commercial and
industrial customers.

Financial
trading net margin includes activities that are generally executed using
financially settled derivatives.  These activities are normally short
term in nature, with a focus on capturing short-term price
volatility.  Revenues in our Consolidated Statements of Income include
financial trading margins, as well as certain physical natural gas transactions
with our trading counterparties.  Revenues and cost of sales and fuel
from such physical transactions are reported on a net basis.

-51
- -


2009 vs. 2008

- Net margin
increased due primarily to the following:

·

an
      increase of $41.3 million in transportation margins, net of hedging
      activities, due primarily to higher realized Rocky
      Mountain-to-Mid-Continent transportation margins, resulting from the
      following:

-

realization
      of more favorable hedges related to transportation spreads;
      and

-

favorable
      unrealized fair-value changes on non-qualifying economic hedge activity
      and ineffectiveness on qualified
hedges;

·

an
      increase of $13.9 million in premium services, primarily associated with
      managing our demand load, due to warmer weather in the first quarter of
      2009, offset partially by increased peaking demand load due to colder than
      normal weather in the fourth quarter of
2009;

·

an
      increase of $7.8 million in storage and marketing margins, net of hedging
      activities, due primarily to the
following:

-

favorable
      unrealized fair value changes on non-qualifying economic hedge activity
      and marketing margin; and

-

the
      impact of a lower of cost or market inventory write-down of $9.7 million
      in the third quarter 2008; offset partially
by

-

lower
      realized seasonal storage differentials;
and

·

an
      increase of $3.2 million in retail marketing
  margins.

Operating
costs increased due to higher legal-related costs and employee-related
costs.

2008 vs. 2007

- Net margin
decreased due primarily to the following:

·

a
      net decrease of $40.3 million in transportation margins, net of hedging
      activities, due primarily to decreased basis differentials between the
      Rocky Mountain and Mid-Continent regions, and increased
      transportation-related costs in
2008;

·

a
      decrease of $13.9 million in financial trading
  margins;

·

a
      decrease of $3.4 million in premium services, primarily due to colder than
      anticipated weather and market conditions that increased supply costs of
      providing these services; and

·

a
      net decrease of $79.9 million in storage and marketing margins, net of
      hedging activities, due primarily
to:

-

hedging
      opportunities associated with weather-related events that led to higher
      storage margins in 2007 compared with
2008;

-

lower
      2008 storage margins related to storage risk management positions and the
      impact of changes in natural gas prices on these positions;
      and

-

fewer
      opportunities to optimize storage capacity due to the significant decline
      in natural gas prices in the second half of
  2008;

-

the
      impact of a lower of cost or market inventory write-down of $9.7 million
      in the third quarter of 2008; offset partially
  by

-

changes
      in the unrealized fair value of derivative instruments associated with
      storage and marketing activities and improved marketing margins, which
      benefited from price movements and optimization
  activities.

Operating
costs decreased due primarily to lower employee-related costs.

Our
natural gas in storage at December 31, 2009, was 60.8 Bcf, compared with 81.9
Bcf at December 31, 2008.  At December 31, 2009, our total natural gas
storage capacity under lease was 82.8 Bcf, with maximum withdrawal capability of
2.3 Bcf/d and maximum injection capability of 1.4 Bcf/d.  Our current
natural gas transportation capacity is 1.7 Bcf/d.

Natural
gas volumes marketed decreased during 2009, compared with 2008, due primarily to
significantly warmer weather in November 2009, compared with 2008.  In
addition, during the first quarter of 2009, compared with the first quarter
2008, we experienced fewer incremental sales from inventory beyond our normal
baseload due to warmer than normal temperatures.

Natural
gas volumes marketed decreased during 2008, compared with 2007, due to increased
injections in the third quarter of 2008.  In addition, demand for
natural gas was impacted by weather-related events in the third quarter of 2008,
including warmer weather and demand disruption caused by Hurricane
Ike.

Contingencies

Legal Proceedings

- We are a
party to various litigation matters and claims that are normal in the course of
our operations.  While the results of litigation and claims cannot be
predicted with certainty, we believe the final outcome of such matters will not
have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations,
financial position or liquidity.  Additional information about our
legal proceedings is included under Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings, in this
Annual Report.

LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

General

- Part of our strategy
is to grow through internally generated growth projects and acquisitions that
strengthen and complement our existing assets.  ONEOK and ONEOK
Partners have relied primarily on operating cash flow, commercial paper, bank
credit facilities, debt issuances and/or the sale of equity for their liquidity
and capital resource requirements.  ONEOK and ONEOK Partners fund
their operating expenses, debt service, dividends to shareholders and
distributions to unitholders primarily with operating cash flow.  We
expect to continue to use these sources for liquidity and capital resource needs
on both a short- and long-term basis.  Neither ONEOK or ONEOK Partners
guarantees the debt or other similar commitments to unaffiliated parties, and
ONEOK does not guarantee the debt or other similar commitments of ONEOK
Partners.

During
2009, the capital markets improved significantly from year-end 2008. 
Throughout 2009 and continuing in 2010, ONEOK had access to the commercial paper
markets to meet its short-term funding needs, and continued to have access to
the ONEOK Credit Agreement which expires in July 2011.  ONEOK Partners
continued to have access to the ONEOK Partners Credit Agreement, which was
adequate to fund its short-term liquidity needs and expires in March
2012.  ONEOK Partners was able to access the public debt and equity
markets to meet its long-term financing needs for 2009.

We expect
a moderate economic recovery in 2010, with inflationary pressures beginning in
2011.  Although recent volatility in the financial markets could limit
our access to financial markets or increase our cost of capital in the future,
we anticipate improved credit markets during 2010, compared with
2009.  ONEOK’s and ONEOK Partners’ ability to continue to access
capital markets for debt and equity financing under reasonable terms depends on
our and ONEOK Partner’s respective financial condition and credit ratings, and
market conditions.  ONEOK and ONEOK Partners anticipate that cash flow
generated from operations, existing capital resources and ability to obtain
financing will enable both to maintain current levels of operations and planned
operations, collateral requirements and capital expenditures.

In
February 2009, ONEOK repaid $100 million of maturing long-term debt with cash

Cash Management

- ONEOK and
ONEOK Partners each use similar centralized cash management programs that
concentrate the cash assets of their operating subsidiaries in joint accounts
for the purpose of providing financial flexibility and lowering the cost of
borrowing, transaction costs and bank fees.  Both centralized cash
management programs provide that funds in excess of the daily needs of the
operating subsidiaries are concentrated, consolidated or otherwise made
available for use by other entities within the respective consolidated
groups.  ONEOK Partners’ operating subsidiaries participate in these
programs to the extent they are permitted pursuant to FERC regulations or their
operating agreements.  Under these cash management programs, depending
on whether a participating subsidiary has short-term cash surpluses or cash
requirements, ONEOK and ONEOK Partners provide cash to their respective
subsidiaries or the subsidiaries provide cash to them.

Short-term Liquidity

- ONEOK’s
principal sources of short-term liquidity consist of cash generated from
operating activities, quarterly distributions from ONEOK Partners and the ONEOK
Credit Agreement as discussed below.  ONEOK also has a commercial
paper program that can be utilized for short-term liquidity needs, and to the
extent commercial paper is unavailable, the ONEOK Credit Agreement may be
utilized.  ONEOK Partners’ principal sources of short-term liquidity
consist of cash generated from operating activities and borrowings under the
ONEOK Partners Credit Agreement.

The total
amount of short-term borrowings authorized by ONEOK’s Board of Directors is $2.5
billion.  At December 31, 2009, ONEOK had $358.9 million commercial
paper outstanding, $37.0 million letters of credit issued under the ONEOK Credit
Agreement and available cash and cash equivalents of approximately $26.2
million.  ONEOK had $804.1 million of credit available at December 31,
2009, under the ONEOK Credit Agreement.  The amount of credit
available under committed bank lines decreased by $400 million when ONEOK’s
364-day revolving credit facility dated August 6, 2008, expired on August 5,
2009.  As of December 31, 2009, ONEOK could have issued $2.9 billion
of additional short- and long-term debt under the most restrictive provisions
contained in its various borrowing agreements.

The total
amount of short-term borrowings authorized by the Board of Directors of ONEOK
Partners GP, the general partner of ONEOK Partners, is $1.5
billion.  At December 31, 2009, ONEOK Partners had $523 million in
borrowings outstanding under the ONEOK Partners Credit Agreement and available
cash and cash equivalents of approximately $3.2 million.  As of
December 31, 2009, ONEOK Partners’ borrowing capacity was limited to $367.1
million of additional short- and long-term debt under the most restrictive
provisions of the ONEOK Partners Credit Agreement.  At December 31,
2009, ONEOK Partners had a total of $24.2 million in letters of credit issued
outside the ONEOK Partners Credit Agreement.

The ONEOK
Credit Agreement contains certain financial, operational and legal
covenants.  These requirements include, among others:

·

a
      $400 million sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of
      credit;

·

a
      limitation on ONEOK’s stand-alone debt-to-capital ratio, which may not
      exceed 67.5 percent at the end of any calendar
  quarter;

·

a
      requirement that ONEOK maintains the power to control the management and
      policies of ONEOK Partners,

·

a
      limit on new investments in master limited partnerships;
    and

·

other
      customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants relating
      to liens, investments, fundamental changes in ONEOK’s businesses, changes
      in the nature of ONEOK’s businesses, transactions with affiliates, the use
      of proceeds and a covenant that prevents ONEOK from restricting its
      subsidiaries’ ability to pay
dividends.

The debt
covenant calculations in the ONEOK Credit Agreement exclude the debt of ONEOK
Partners.  Upon breach of any covenant by ONEOK, amounts outstanding
under the ONEOK Credit Agreement may become immediately due and
payable.  At December 31, 2009, ONEOK’s stand-alone debt-to-capital
ratio, as defined by the ONEOK Credit Agreement, was 45.4 percent, and ONEOK was
in compliance with all covenants under the ONEOK Credit Agreement.

Under the
ONEOK Partners Credit Agreement, ONEOK Partners is required to comply with
certain financial, operational and legal covenants.  Among other
things, these requirements include maintaining a ratio of indebtedness to
adjusted EBITDA (EBITDA, as defined in ONEOK Partners’ Credit Agreement, as
adjusted for all non-cash charges and increased for projected EBITDA from
certain lender-approved capital expansion projects) of no more than 5 to
1.  If ONEOK Partners consummates one or more acquisitions in which
the aggregate purchase price is $25 million or more, the allowable ratio of
indebtedness to adjusted EBITDA will be increased to 5.5 to 1 for the three
calendar quarters following the acquisition.  Upon any breach of any
covenant by ONEOK Partners in its ONEOK Partners Credit Agreement, amounts
outstanding under the ONEOK Partners Credit Agreement may become immediately due
and payable.  At December 31, 2009, ONEOK

-54
- -


Partners’
ratio of indebtedness to adjusted EBITDA was 4.5 to 1, and ONEOK Partners was in
compliance with all covenants under the ONEOK Partners Credit
Agreement.

At
December 31, 2009, the average interest rate on ONEOK and ONEOK Partners
short-term debt outstanding was 0.3 percent and 0.54 percent, respectively, and
the weighted-average for the year ended December 31, 2009, was 1.26 percent and
2.13 percent, respectively.  Based on the forward LIBOR curve, we
expect the interest rates on ONEOK and ONEOK Partners’ short-term borrowings to
increase in 2010, compared with interest rates on amounts outstanding at
December 31, 2009.

Long-term Financing

- In
addition to the principal sources of short-term liquidity discussed above,
options available to ONEOK to meet its longer-term cash requirements include the
issuance of equity, issuance of long-term notes, issuance of convertible debt
securities, asset securitization and the sale and leaseback of
facilities.  Options available to ONEOK Partners to meet its
longer-term cash requirements include the issuance of common units, issuance of
long-term notes, issuance of convertible debt securities, and asset
securitization and sale and leaseback of facilities.

ONEOK and
ONEOK Partners are subject to changes in the debt and equity markets, and there
is no assurance they will be able or willing to access the public or private
markets in the future.  ONEOK and ONEOK Partners may choose to meet
their cash requirements by utilizing some combination of cash flows from
operations, borrowing under existing credit facilities, altering the timing of
controllable expenditures, restricting future acquisitions and capital projects,
or pursuing other debt or equity financing alternatives.  Some of
these alternatives could involve higher costs or negatively affect their
respective credit ratings, among other factors.  Based on ONEOK’s and
ONEOK Partners’ investment-grade credit ratings, general financial condition and
market expectations regarding their future earnings and projected cash flows,
ONEOK and ONEOK Partners believe that they will be able to meet their respective
cash requirements and maintain their investment-grade credit
ratings.

ONEOK Partners Equity
Issuances

-

In July
2009, ONEOK Partners completed an underwritten public offering of 5,486,690
common units, including the partial exercise by the underwriters of their
over-allotment option, at $45.81 per common unit, generating net proceeds of
approximately $241.6 million.  In conjunction with the offering, ONEOK
Partners GP contributed an aggregate of $5.1 million to ONEOK Partners in order
to maintain its 2 percent general partner interest.  ONEOK Partners
used the proceeds from the sale of common units and the general partner
contributions to repay borrowings under the ONEOK Partners Credit Agreement and
for general partnership purposes.  As a result of these transactions,
our interest in ONEOK Partners was 45.1 percent.

In
February 2010, ONEOK Partners completed an underwritten public offering of
5,500,900 common units, including the partial exercise by the underwriters of
their over-allotment option, at $60.75 per common unit, generating net proceeds
of approximately $322.6 million.  In conjunction with the offering, ONEOK
Partners GP contributed $6.8 million in order to maintain its 2 percent general
partner interest.  ONEOK Partners used the proceeds from the sale of common
units and the general partner contribution to repay borrowings under the ONEOK
Partners Credit Agreement and for general partnership purposes.  As a
result of these transactions, we hold a 42.8 percent aggregate equity interest
in ONEOK Partners.

ONEOK Partners Debt
Issuance

- In March 2009, ONEOK Partners completed an underwritten public
offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 8.625 percent Senior
Notes due 2019 (the 2019 Notes).  ONEOK Partners used the net proceeds
of approximately $494.3 million from the offering to repay indebtedness
outstanding under the ONEOK Partners Credit Agreement. For more information
regarding the 2019 Notes, refer to discussion in Note I of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report.

Debt Covenants

- The
terms of the 2019 Notes are governed by an indenture, dated as of September 25,
2006, between ONEOK Partners and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee, as
supplemented by the Fifth Supplemental Indenture, dated March 3, 2009
(Indenture).  The Indentures does not limit the aggregate principal
amount of debt securities that may be issued and provides that debt securities
may be issued from time to time in one or more additional series.  The
Indenture contains covenants including, among other provisions, limitations on
ONEOK Partners’ ability to place liens on its property or assets and to sell and
lease back its property.

ONEOK
Partners’ $250 million and $225 million senior notes, due June 15, 2010, and
March 15, 2011, respectively, contain provisions that require ONEOK Partners to
offer to repurchase the senior notes at par value if its Moody’s or S&P
credit rating falls below investment grade (Baa3 for Moody’s or BBB- for
S&P) and the investment-grade rating is not reinstated within a period of 40
days; however, once the $250 million 2010 senior notes have been retired,
whether by maturity, redemption or otherwise, ONEOK Partners will no longer have
any obligation to offer to repurchase the $225 million 2011 senior notes in the
event its credit rating falls below investment grade.  Further, the
indentures governing ONEOK Partners’ senior notes due 2010 and 2011 include an
event of default upon acceleration of other indebtedness of $25 million or
more

-55
- -


and the
indentures governing the senior notes due 2012, 2016, 2019, 2036 and 2037
include an event of default upon the acceleration of other indebtedness of $100
million or more that would be triggered by such an offer to
repurchase.  Such an event of default would entitle the trustee or the
holders of 25 percent in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding senior
notes due 2010, 2011, 2012, 2016, 2019, 2036 and 2037 to declare those notes
immediately due and payable in full.

ONEOK
Partners may redeem the notes due 2012, 2016, 2019, 2036 and 2037, in whole or
in part, at any time prior to their maturity at a redemption price equal to the
principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and a make-whole
premium.  The redemption price will never be less than 100 percent of
the principal amount of the respective note plus accrued and unpaid interest to
the redemption date.  The notes due 2012, 2016, 2019, 2036 and 2037
are senior unsecured obligations, ranking equally in right of payment with all
of ONEOK Partners’ existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness, and
effectively junior to all of the existing and future debt and other liabilities
of any non-guarantor subsidiaries, and are nonrecourse to ONEOK.

Capital Expenditures

- ONEOK’s
and ONEOK Partners’ capital expenditures are typically financed through
operating cash flows, short- and long-term debt and the issuance of
equity.  Total capital expenditures were $791.2 million, $1,473.1
million and $883.7 million for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, exclusive of
acquisitions.  Of these amounts, ONEOK Partners’ capital expenditures
were $615.7 million, $1,253.9 million and $709.9 million for 2009, 2008 and
2007, respectively, exclusive of acquisitions.  Our capital
expenditures are driven primarily by ONEOK Partners’ capital projects discussed
beginning on page 38.

Capital
expenditures in 2009 were significantly less than 2008 capital expenditures, due
primarily to the completion of the Arbuckle Pipeline, the Overland Pass Pipeline
and related expansion projects, the Williston Basin gas processing plant
expansion and the Guardian Pipeline expansion and extension.  The
following table sets forth our 2010 projected capital expenditures, excluding
AFUDC:

Investment in Northern Border
Pipeline

- During 2009, ONEOK Partners made equity contributions of
$42.3 million to Northern Border.  ONEOK Partners does not anticipate
making any material equity contributions in 2010.

Overland Pass Pipeline Company

- - A subsidiary of ONEOK Partners owns 99 percent of Overland Pass Pipeline
Company and operates the pipeline.  On or before November 17, 2010,
Williams has the option to increase its ownership in Overland Pass Pipeline
Company up to a total of 50 percent, with the purchase price being determined in
accordance with the joint venture’s operating agreement.

Credit Ratings

ratings as of December 31, 2009, are shown in the table below:

ONEOK’s
commercial paper is rated P2 by Moody’s and A2 by S&P.  ONEOK’s
and ONEOK Partners’ credit ratings, which are currently investment grade, may be
affected by a material change in financial ratios or a material event affecting
the business.  The most common criteria for assessment of credit
ratings are the debt-to-capital ratio, business risk profile, pretax and
after-tax interest coverage, and liquidity.  ONEOK and ONEOK Partners
do not currently anticipate their respective credit ratings to be
downgraded.  However, if our credit ratings were downgraded, the
interest rates on our commercial paper borrowings and borrowings under the ONEOK
Credit Agreement would increase, and we could potentially lose access to the
commercial paper market.  Likewise, ONEOK Partners would see increased
borrowing costs under the ONEOK Partners Credit Agreement.  In the
event that ONEOK is unable to borrow funds under its commercial paper program
and there has not been a material adverse change in its business, ONEOK would
continue to have access to the ONEOK Credit Agreement, which expires in July
2011.  An adverse rating change alone is not a default under the ONEOK
Credit Agreement or the ONEOK Partners Credit Agreement but could trigger
repurchase obligations with respect to certain ONEOK Partners’ long-term
debt.  See additional discussion about our credit ratings under “Debt
Covenants.”

-56
- -


If ONEOK
Partners’ repurchase obligations are triggered, it may not have sufficient cash
on hand to repurchase and repay any accelerated senior notes, which may cause it
to borrow money under its credit facilities, seek alternative financing sources
or sell assets to finance the repurchases and repayment.  ONEOK
Partners could also face difficulties accessing capital or its borrowing costs
could increase, impacting its ability to obtain financing for acquisitions or
capital expenditures, to refinance indebtedness and to fulfill its debt
obligations.

Our
Energy Services segment relies upon the investment-grade rating of ONEOK’s
senior unsecured long-term debt to reduce its collateral
requirements.  If ONEOK’s credit ratings were to decline below
investment grade, our ability to participate in energy marketing and trading
activities could be significantly limited.  Without an
investment-grade rating, we may be required to fund margin requirements with our
counterparties with cash, letters of credit or other negotiable
instruments.  At December 31, 2009, we could have been required to
fund approximately $26.9 million in margin requirements related to financial
contracts upon such a downgrade.  A decline in ONEOK’s credit rating
below investment grade may also significantly impact other business
segments.

Other
than ONEOK Partners’ note repurchase obligations and the margin requirements for
our Energy Services segment described above, we have determined that we do not
have significant exposure to rating triggers under ONEOK’s trust indentures,
building leases, equipment leases and other various contracts.  Rating
triggers are defined as provisions that would create an automatic default or
acceleration of indebtedness based on a change in our credit
rating.

In the
normal course of business, ONEOK’s and ONEOK Partners’ counterparties provide
secured and unsecured credit.  In the event of a downgrade in ONEOK’s
or ONEOK Partners’ credit ratings or a significant change in ONEOK’s or ONEOK
Partners’ counterparties’ evaluation of our creditworthiness, ONEOK or ONEOK
Partners could be required to provide additional collateral in the form of cash,
letters of credit or other negotiable instruments as a condition of continuing
to conduct business with such counterparties.

Commodity Prices

- We are
subject to commodity price volatility.  Significant fluctuations in
commodity prices may impact our overall liquidity due to the impact commodity
price changes have on our cash flows from operating activities, including the
impact on working capital for NGLs and natural gas held in storage, margin
requirements and certain energy-related receivables.  We believe that
ONEOK’s and ONEOK Partners’ available credit and cash and cash equivalents are
adequate to meet liquidity requirements associated with commodity price
volatility.  See discussion beginning on page 62 under “Commodity
Price Risk” in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market
Risk, for information on our hedging activities.

Pension and Postretirement Benefit
Plans

- Information about our pension and postretirement benefits plans,
including anticipated contributions, is included under Note K of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report.

General
market factors in 2009 negatively impacted the funded status of our plan, and as
a result, we made contributions to our pension plans of $77.3 million during
2009.  We do not expect that our funding requirements in 2010 will
have a material impact on our liquidity.

ENVIRONMENTAL
MATTERS

Information
about our environmental matters is included in “Environmental and Safety
Matters” of Item 1, Business and Note L of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements in this Annual Report.  We cannot assure that existing
environmental regulations will not be revised or that new regulations will not
be adopted or become applicable to us.  Revised or additional
regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating
restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.  Our expenditures for
environmental evaluation, mitigation, remediation and compliance to date have
not been significant in relation to our financial position or results of
operations, and our expenditures related to environmental matters had no
material effects upon earnings or cash flows during 2009, 2008 and
2007.

CASH
FLOW ANALYSIS

We use
the indirect method to prepare our Consolidated Statements of Cash
Flows.  Under this method, we reconcile net income to cash flows
provided by operating activities by adjusting net income for those items that
impact net income but may not result in actual cash receipts or payments during
the period.  These reconciling items include depreciation and
amortization, allowance for equity funds used during construction, gain on sale
of assets, equity earnings from investments, distributions received from
unconsolidated affiliates, deferred income taxes, stock-based compensation
expense, allowance for doubtful accounts, and changes in our assets and
liabilities not classified as investing or financing
activities.

-57
- -


The
following table sets forth the changes in cash flows by operating, investing and
financing activities for the periods indicated:

Operating Cash Flows

-
Operating cash flows are affected by earnings from our business
activities.  We provide services to producers and consumers of natural
gas, condensate and NGLs.  Changes in commodity prices and demand for
our services or products, whether because of general economic conditions,
changes in demand for the end products that are made with our products or
increased competition from other service providers, could affect our earnings
and operating cash flows.

2009 vs. 2008

- Cash
flows from operating activities, before changes in operating assets and
liabilities, were $974.3 million for 2009, compared with $991.0 million for
2008.  The decrease was due primarily to lower realized commodity
prices and narrower NGL product price differentials in our ONEOK Partners
segment, offset partially by increased NGL volumes gathered, fractionated and
transported, primarily associated with the completion of the Overland Pass
Pipeline and related expansion projects, and the Arbuckle Pipeline, as well as
new NGL supply connections in our ONEOK Partners segment, and increased
transportation margins, net of hedging activities, in our Energy Services
segment.

The
changes in operating assets and liabilities increased operating cash flows
$478.4 million for 2009, compared with a decrease of $515.3 million for 2008,
primarily as a result of the following:

·

a
decrease in cash collateral and margin requirements in our Energy Services
segment;

·

the
impact of commodity prices on our operating assets and liabilities;
and

·

the
timing of cash receipts from our revenues resulting in increased accounts
receivable; offset partially by

·

the
timing of payments for purchases of commodities and other expenses resulting in
increased accounts payable.

2008 vs. 2007

- Cash
flows from operating activities, before changes in operating assets and
liabilities, were $991.0 million for 2008, compared with $826.0 million for
2007.  The increase was due primarily to higher realized commodity
prices and wider NGL product price differentials in our ONEOK Partners segment
and implementation of new rate mechanisms in our Distribution
segment.

The
changes in operating assets and liabilities decreased operating cash flows
$515.3 million for 2008, compared with an increase of $203.6 million for 2007,
primarily as a result of the following:

·

the
timing of cash receipts from our revenues resulting in decreased accounts
receivable;

·

the
timing of payments for purchases of commodities and other expenses resulting in
decreased accounts

payable;
and

·

the
changes in volumes of commodities in storage.

Investing Cash Flows

- Cash
used in investing activities decreased for 2009, compared with 2008, due
primarily to reduced capital expenditures as a result of the completion of the
Arbuckle Pipeline and Overland Pass Pipeline and related expansion projects, the
Williston Basin gas processing plant expansion and the Guardian Pipeline
expansion and extension in our ONEOK Partners segment.  Cash used in
investing activities increased for 2008, compared with 2007, due primarily to
increased spending for our capital projects.

Financing Cash Flows

- Net
repayments of notes payable were $1.4 billion during 2009, compared with net
borrowings of $2.1 billion for 2008 and net borrowings of $196.6 million for
2007.  Due to volatility in the credit markets in late 2008, ONEOK and
ONEOK Partners borrowed under their available credit facilities to fund their
respective working capital requirements in late 2008 and the first part of
2009.

During
2009, ONEOK Partners completed a public offering of common units generating net
proceeds of approximately $241.6 million.  ONEOK Partners used the
proceeds to repay borrowings under the ONEOK Partners Credit Agreement and for
general partnership purposes.  During 2008, ONEOK Partners’ public
sale of 2.6 million common units generated net proceeds of approximately $147.0
million.  ONEOK Partners used a portion of the proceeds to repay
borrowings under the ONEOK Partners Credit Agreement.

In March
2009, ONEOK Partners completed an underwritten public offering of senior notes
and received proceeds totaling approximately $498.3 million, net of discounts
but before offering expenses.  ONEOK Partners used the net proceeds
from the notes to repay borrowings under the ONEOK Partners Credit
Agreement.  In 2007, ONEOK Partners completed an underwritten public
offering of senior notes and received proceeds totaling approximately $598.1
million, net of discounts.  ONEOK Partners used the net proceeds from
the notes to repay borrowings under the ONEOK Partners Credit Agreement and
finance the $300 million acquisition of assets, before working capital
adjustments, from a subsidiary of Kinder Morgan in October 2007.

In
February 2009 and 2008, ONEOK repaid $100.0 million and $402.3 million,
respectively, of maturing long-term debt with available cash and short-term
borrowings.

During
2007, we paid $20.1 million for the settlement of the forward purchase contract
related to our stock repurchase in February and approximately $370 million for
our stock repurchase in June.

Dividends
paid were $1.64 per share, $1.56 per share and $1.40 per share for 2009, 2008
and 2007, respectively.

Distributions
paid to limited partners by ONEOK Partners were $4.33 per unit, $4.205 per unit
and $3.98 per unit for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Long-term Debt

-
Long-term debt as reported in our Consolidated Balance Sheets includes
unamortized debt discount and the mark-to-market effect of interest-rate
swaps.

-59
- -


Interest Payments on
Debt

- Interest expense is calculated by multiplying long-term debt by
the respective coupon rates, adjusted for active swaps.

Operating Leases

-
Our operating leases include a natural gas processing plant, office space,
pipeline equipment, rights of way and vehicles.  Operating lease
obligations for ONEOK Partners exclude intercompany payments related to the
lease of a gas processing plant.

Firm Transportation and
Storage Contracts

- We are party to fixed-price contracts for firm
transportation and storage capacity.  However, the costs associated
with our Distribution segment’s contracts are recovered through rates as allowed
by the applicable regulatory agency and are excluded from the table
above.

Financial and Physical
Derivatives

- These are obligations arising from our fixed- and
variable-price purchase commitments for financial and physical commodity
derivatives.  However, the commitments associated with our
Distribution segment’s contracts are recovered through rates as allowed by the
applicable regulatory agency and are excluded from the table
above.  Estimated future variable-price purchase commitments are based
on market information at December 31, 2009.  Actual future
variable-price purchase commitments may vary depending on market prices at the
time of delivery.  Not included in these amounts are offsetting cash
inflows from our ONEOK Partners and Energy Services segments’ product sales and
net positive settlements.  As market information changes daily and is
potentially volatile, these values may change
significantly.  Additionally, product sales may require additional
purchase obligations to fulfill sales obligations that are not reflected in
these amounts.

Employee Benefit
Plans

- Employee benefit plans include our anticipated contribution to
maintain the minimum required funding level to our pension and postretirement
benefit plans for 2010.  See Note K of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements in this Annual Report for discussion of our employee
benefit plans.

Purchase Commitments

- - Purchase commitments include commitments related to ONEOK Partners’ growth
capital expenditures and other rights of way commitments.  Purchase
commitments exclude commodity purchase contracts, which are included in the
“Financial and physical derivatives” amounts.

ITEM  7A

.                      QUANTITATIVE
AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Risk Policy and Oversight

- We
control the scope of risk management, marketing and trading operations through a
comprehensive set of policies and procedures involving senior levels of
management.  The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors has
oversight responsibilities for our risk management limits and
policies.  Our risk oversight committee, comprised of corporate and
business segment officers, oversees all activities related to commodity price
and credit risk management, and marketing and trading activities.  The
committee also monitors risk metrics including value-at-risk (VAR) and
mark-to-market losses.  We have a risk control group that is assigned
responsibility for establishing and enforcing the policies and procedures and
monitoring certain risk metrics.  Key risk control activities include
risk measurement and monitoring, validation of transactions, portfolio
valuation, VAR and other risk metrics.

Our
exposure to market risk discussed below includes forward-looking statements and
represents an estimate of possible changes in future earnings that would occur
assuming hypothetical future movements in interest rates or commodity
prices.  Our views on market risk are not necessarily indicative of
actual results that may occur and do not represent the maximum possible gains
and losses that may occur since actual gains and losses will differ from those
estimated based on actual fluctuations in interest rates or commodity prices and
the timing of transactions.

COMMODITY
PRICE RISK

We are
exposed to commodity price risk and the impact of market price fluctuations of
natural gas, NGLs and crude oil.  Commodity price risk refers to the
risk of loss in cash flows and future earnings arising from adverse changes in
energy prices.  To minimize the risk from market price fluctuations of
natural gas, NGLs and crude oil, we use commodity derivative instruments such as
futures, physical forward contracts, swaps and options to manage commodity price
risk associated with existing or anticipated purchase and sale agreements,
existing physical natural gas in storage and basis risk.

ONEOK
Partners

ONEOK
Partners is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of receiving commodities
in exchange for its gathering and processing services.  To a lesser
extent, ONEOK Partners is exposed to the relative price differential between
NGLs and natural gas, or the gross processing spread, with respect to its
keep-whole processing contracts.  ONEOK Partners is also exposed to
the risk of price fluctuations and the cost of transportation at various market
locations.  As part of ONEOK Partners’ hedging strategy, ONEOK
Partners uses commodity fixed-price physical forwards and derivative contracts,
including NYMEX-based futures and over-the-counter swaps, to minimize earnings
volatility in its natural gas gathering and processing business related to
natural gas, NGL and condensate price fluctuations.

ONEOK
Partners reduces its gross processing spread exposure through a combination of
physical and financial hedges.  ONEOK Partners utilizes a portion of
its percent-of-proceeds equity natural gas as an offset, or natural hedge, to an
equivalent portion of its keep-whole shrink requirements.  This has
the effect of converting ONEOK Partners’ gross processing spread risk to NGL
commodity price risk, and ONEOK Partners then uses financial instruments to
hedge the sale of NGLs.

-62
- -


As of
December 31, 2009, ONEOK Partners had $0.5 million of derivative assets and
$18.8 million of derivative liabilities, excluding the impact of netting, all of
which related to commodity contracts.

The following tables set
forth ONEOK Partners’ hedging information for the periods indicated, as of
February 22, 2010:

ONEOK
Partners’ commodity price risk is estimated as a hypothetical change in the
price of NGLs, crude oil and natural gas at December 31, 2009, excluding the
effects of hedging and assuming normal operating conditions.  ONEOK
Partners’ condensate sales are based on the price of crude oil.  ONEOK
Partners estimates the following:

·

a
      $0.01 per gallon decrease in the composite price of NGLs would decrease
      annual net margin by approximately $1.0
million;

·

a
      $1.00 per barrel decrease in the price of crude oil would decrease annual
      net margin by approximately $1.1 million;
and

·

a
      $0.10 per MMBtu decrease in the price of natural gas would decrease annual
      net margin by approximately $1.2
million.

ONEOK
Partners is also exposed to commodity price risk primarily as a result of NGLs
in storage, the relative values of the various NGL products to each other, the
relative value of NGLs to natural gas and the relative value of NGL purchases at
one location and sales at another location, known as basis
risk.  ONEOK Partners utilizes fixed-price physical forward contracts
to reduce earnings volatility related to NGL price
fluctuations.  ONEOK Partners has not entered into any financial
instruments with respect to its NGL marketing activities.

In
addition, ONEOK Partners is exposed to commodity price risk as its natural gas
interstate and intrastate pipelines collect natural gas from its customers for
operations or as part of its fee for services provided.  When the
amount of natural gas consumed in operations by these pipelines differs from the
amount provided by its customers, the pipelines must buy or sell natural gas, or
store or use natural gas from inventory, which exposes ONEOK Partners to
commodity price risk.  At December 31, 2009, there were no hedges in
place with respect to natural gas price risk from ONEOK Partners’ natural gas
pipeline business.

Distribution

Our
Distribution segment uses derivative instruments to hedge the cost of
anticipated natural gas purchases during the winter heating months to protect
their customers from upward volatility in the market price of natural
gas.  Gains or losses associated with these derivative instruments are
included in, and recoverable through, the monthly purchased gas cost-adjustment
mechanism.

Energy
Services

Our
Energy Services segment is exposed to commodity price risk, basis risk and price
volatility arising from natural gas in storage, requirement contracts, asset
management contracts and index-based purchases and sales of natural gas at
various market locations.  We minimize the volatility of our exposure
to commodity price risk through the use of derivative instruments, which, under
certain circumstances, are designated as cash flow or fair value
hedges.  We are also exposed to

-63
- -


commodity
price risk from fixed-price purchases and sales of natural gas, which we hedge
with derivative instruments.  Both the fixed-price purchases and sales
and related derivatives are recorded at fair value.

Fair Value Component of the Energy
Marketing and Risk Management Assets and Liabilities

- The following
table sets forth the fair value component of the energy marketing and risk
management assets and liabilities, excluding $161.5 million and $21.0 million of
net assets at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, from derivative
instruments declared as either fair value or cash flow hedges for the periods

(a)
      - This balance has been adjusted by $255.1 million from the amount
      reported in our Annual Report

on
      Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008. The adjustment was
      made in order to exclude

from
      this table the gains on cash flow hedges that were reclassified into
      earnings from accumulated

      weighted-average cost or market.

(b)
      - The maturities of derivatives are based on injection and withdrawal
      periods from April through March,

which
      is consistent with our business strategy. The maturities are as
      follows: $(1.8) million matures

through
      March 2010, $4.2 million matures through March 2011 and $0.3 million
      matures through

March
      2015.

The
change in the net fair value of derivatives outstanding includes the effect of
settled energy contracts and current period changes resulting primarily from
newly originated transactions and the impact of market movements on the fair
value of energy marketing and risk management assets and
liabilities.

For
further discussion of fair value measurements and trading activities and
assumptions used in our trading activities, see the “Critical Accounting
Policies and Estimates” section of Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operation.  Also, see Notes C
and D of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual
Report.

VAR Disclosure of Commodity Price
Risk

- The potential impact on our future earnings, as measured by VAR,
was $5.4 million and $7.9 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008,
respectively.  The following table sets forth the average, high and
low VAR calculations for the periods indicated:

Our VAR
calculation includes derivatives, executory storage and transportation
agreements and their related hedges.  The variations in the VAR data
are reflective of market volatility and changes in our portfolio during the
year.  The decrease in average VAR for 2009, compared with 2008, was
due primarily to price fluctuations between various locations and a decrease in
the overall position of our portfolio in 2009.

Our VAR
calculation uses historical prices, placing more emphasis on the most recent
price movements.  We calculate the VAR on our mark-to-market
derivative positions, which reflects the risk associated with derivatives whose
change in fair value will impact current period earnings.  VAR
associated with these derivative positions was not material during 2009 or
2008.  To the extent open commodity positions exist, fluctuating
commodity prices can impact our financial results and financial position either
favorably or unfavorably.  As a result, we cannot predict with
precision the impact risk management decisions may have on the business,
operating results or financial position.

INTEREST
RATE RISK

General

- We are subject to
the risk of interest-rate fluctuation in the normal course of
business.  We manage interest-rate risk through the use of fixed-rate
debt, floating-rate debt and, at times, interest-rate
swaps.  Fixed-rate swaps are used to reduce our risk of increased
interest costs during periods of rising interest rates.  Floating-rate
swaps are used to convert the fixed rates of long-term borrowings into
short-term variable rates.  At December 31, 2009, the interest rate on
all of ONEOK and ONEOK Partners’ long-term debt was fixed.

Fair Value Hedges

- At
December 31, 2009, we were not using any interest-rate swaps.  See
Note D of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report
for discussion of the impact of interest-rate swaps and net interest expense
savings from terminated swaps.

Total net
swap savings for 2009, 2008 and 2007 were $10.6 million, $17.4 million and $8.2
million, respectively.  Total swap savings for 2010 are expected to be
$10.2 million.

CURRENCY
EXCHANGE RATE RISK

As a
result of our Energy Services segment’s operations in Canada, we are exposed to
currency exchange rate risk from our commodity purchases and sales related to
our firm transportation and storage contracts.  To reduce our exposure
to exchange-rate fluctuations, we use physical forward transactions, which
result in an actual two-way flow of currency on the settlement date since we
exchange U.S. dollars for Canadian dollars with another party.  We
have not designated these transactions for hedge accounting treatment;
therefore, the gains and losses associated with the change in fair value are
recorded in net margin.  At December 31, 2009 and 2008, our exposure
to risk from currency transactions gains and losses was not
material.  The currency transaction gain recognized during 2009 was
immaterial.  We recognized a currency transaction loss of $3.1 million
and a currency transaction gain of $4.1 million during 2008 and 2007,
respectively.

COUNTERPARTY
CREDIT RISK

ONEOK and
ONEOK Partners assess the creditworthiness of their counterparties on an ongoing
basis and require security, including prepayments and other forms of collateral,
when appropriate.

STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT
REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the
Board of Directors and Shareholders

ONEOK,
Inc.:

In our
opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related
consolidated statements of income, shareholders

’

equity, comprehensive income
and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of ONEOK, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company)

at December 31, 2009 and
2008, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2009,

in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America.  Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2009, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (COSO).  The Company

’

s management is responsible for
these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting, included in Management

’

s Report on Internal Control
over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A in the Company

’

s Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2009.  Our responsibility is to express opinions on these
financial statements and on the Company

’

s internal control over
financial reporting based on our integrated audits.  We conducted our
audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects.  Our audits of the financial statements included examining,
on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation.  Our audit of internal control over financial reporting
included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
the assessed risk.  Our audits also included performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.  We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinions.

A
company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company’s internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of
the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and
(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection
of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that
could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

ONEOK,
INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES
TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

A.           SUMMARY
OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Organization and Nature of
Operations

- We are a
diversified energy company and successor to the company founded in 1906 known as
Oklahoma Natural Gas Company.  Our common stock is listed on the NYSE
under the trading symbol “OKE.”  We are the sole general partner and
as of December 31, 2009, we owned 45.1 percent of ONEOK Partners, L.P. (NYSE:
OKS), one of the largest publicly traded master limited
partnerships.  As a result of ONEOK Partners’ February 2010 public
offering of common units, we own a 42.9 percent aggregate equity interest in
ONEOK Partners.

We have
divided our operations into three reportable business segments based on
similarities in economic characteristics, products and services, types of
customers, methods of distribution and regulatory environment.  These
segments are as follows:

·

ONEOK
      Partners;

·

Distribution;
      and

·

Energy
      Services.

Our ONEOK
Partners segment is engaged in the gathering and processing of natural gas and
transportation and fractionation of NGLs, primarily in the Mid-Continent and
Rocky Mountain regions that include the Anadarko Basin of Oklahoma, Fort Worth
Basin of Texas, Hugoton and Central Uplift Basins of Kansas; and the Williston
Basin of Montana and North Dakota and Powder River Basin of Wyoming,
respectively.  These operations include the gathering and processing
of natural gas produced from crude oil and natural gas wells.  Through
gathering systems, unprocessed natural gas is aggregated and treated or
processed for removal of water vapor, solids and other contaminants, and to
extract NGLs in order to provide marketable natural gas, commonly referred to as
residue gas.  When the NGLs are separated from the unprocessed natural
gas at the processing plants, the NGLs are generally in the form of a mixed,
unfractionated NGL stream.  In the Powder River Basin, the natural gas
that ONEOK Partners gathers is coal bed methane, or dry gas, that does not
require processing in order to be marketable; dry gas is gathered, compressed
and delivered into a pipeline for a fee.

ONEOK
Partners operates interstate and intrastate natural gas transmission pipelines,
natural gas storage facilities and non-processable natural gas gathering
facilities.  ONEOK Partners also provides natural gas transportation
and storage services in accordance with Section 311(a) of the Natural Gas Policy
Act.  ONEOK Partners’ interstate assets transport natural gas through
FERC-regulated interstate natural gas pipelines that access supply from Canada
and from the Mid-Continent, Rocky Mountain and Gulf Coast
regions.  ONEOK Partners’ intrastate natural gas pipeline assets are
located in Oklahoma, Texas and Kansas, and have access to major natural gas
producing areas in those states.  ONEOK Partners owns underground
natural gas storage facilities in Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas.

ONEOK
Partners also gathers, treats, fractionates, transports and stores
NGLs.  ONEOK Partners’ natural gas liquids gathering pipelines deliver
unfractionated NGLs gathered from natural gas processing plants located in
Oklahoma, Kansas, Texas and the Rocky Mountain region to fractionators it owns
in Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas.  The NGLs are then separated through
the fractionation process into the individual NGL products that realize the
greater economic value of the NGL components.  The individual NGL
products are then stored or distributed to petrochemical manufacturers, heating
fuel users, refineries and propane distributors through ONEOK Partners’
FERC-regulated distribution pipelines that move NGL products from Oklahoma and
Kansas to the market centers in Conway, Kansas, and Mont Belvieu, Texas, as well
as the Midwest markets near Chicago, Illinois.

Our
Distribution segment provides natural gas distribution services to more than two
million customers in Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas through Oklahoma Natural Gas,
Kansas Gas Service and Texas Gas Service, respectively, each a division of
ONEOK.  We serve residential, commercial, industrial and
transportation customers in all three states.  In addition, our
distribution companies in Oklahoma and Kansas serve wholesale customers, and in
Texas we serve public authority customers, such as cities, governmental agencies
and schools.

Our
Energy Services segment’s primary focus is to create value for our customers by
delivering physical natural gas products and risk management services through
our network of contracted transportation and storage capacity and natural gas
supply.  This contracted storage and transportation capacity connects
the major supply and demand centers throughout the United States and into
Canada.  Our customers are primarily LDCs, electric utilities, and
commercial and industrial end users.  Our

-75
- -


customers’
natural gas needs vary with seasonal changes in weather and are therefore
somewhat unpredictable.  To ensure natural gas is available when our
customers need it, we offer premium services and products that satisfy our
customers’ swing and peaking natural gas commodity requirements on a year-round
basis.  We also provide no-notice service, weather-related protection
and other custom solutions based on our customers’ specific
needs.  Our storage and transportation capacity allows us
opportunities to optimize our contracted assets through our application of
market knowledge and risk management skills.

Fair Value Measurements

-

Determining Fair
Value

- We define fair value as the price that would be received to sell
an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date.  We use the market and income
approaches to determine the fair value of our assets and liabilities and
consider the markets in which the transactions are executed.  While
many of the contracts in our portfolio are executed in liquid markets where
price transparency exists, some contracts are executed in markets for which
market prices may exist but the market may be relatively
inactive.  This results in limited price transparency that requires
management’s judgment and assumptions to estimate fair values.  Inputs
into our fair value estimates include commodity exchange prices,
over-the-counter quotes, volatility, historical correlations of pricing data and
LIBOR and other liquid money market instrument rates.  We also utilize
internally developed basis curves that incorporate observable and unobservable
market data.  We validate our valuation inputs with third-party
information and settlement prices from other sources, where
available.  In addition, as prescribed by the income approach, we
compute the fair value of our derivative portfolio by discounting the projected
future cash flows from our derivative assets and liabilities to present
value.  The interest rate yields used to calculate the present value
discount factors are derived from LIBOR, Eurodollar futures and Treasury
swaps.  The projected cash flows are then multiplied by the
appropriate discount factors to determine the present value or fair value of our
derivative instruments.  We also take into consideration the potential
impact on market prices of liquidating positions in an orderly manner over a
reasonable period of time under current market conditions.  We
consider current market data in evaluating counterparties’, as well as our own,
nonperformance risk, net of collateral, by using specific and sector bond yields
and also monitoring the credit default swap markets.  Although we use
our best estimates to determine the fair value of the derivative contracts we
have executed, the ultimate market prices realized could differ from our
estimates, and the differences could be material.

The FASB
has provided guidance that allows for companies to elect measuring specified
financial assets and liabilities, firm commitments, and nonfinancial warranty
and insurance contracts at fair value on a contract-by-contract basis, with
changes in fair value recognized in earnings each reporting period.  For
the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, we did not elect the fair value
option under this guidance, and therefore there was no impact on our
consolidated financial statements.

Fair Value Hierarchy

- - We utilize a fair value hierarchy to prioritize inputs to our valuation
techniques based on observable and unobservable data and categorize the inputs
into three levels, with the highest priority given to Level 1 and the lowest
priority given to Level 3.  The levels are described
below.

·

Level
      1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or
      liabilities.

·

Level
      2 - Significant observable pricing inputs other than quoted prices
      included within Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable
      as of the reporting date.  Essentially, this represents inputs
      that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market
      data.

·

Level
      3 - May include one or more unobservable inputs that are significant in
      establishing a fair value estimate.  These unobservable inputs
      are developed based on the best information available and may include our
      own internal data.

Determining
the appropriate classification of our fair value measurements within the fair
value hierarchy requires management’s judgment regarding the degree to which
market data is observable or corroborated by observable market
data.  See Note C for additional disclosures of our fair value
measurements.

Derivatives and Risk Management
Activities

- We engage in wholesale energy marketing, retail marketing,
trading and risk management activities.  We record all derivative
instruments at fair value, with the exception of normal purchases and normal
sales that are expected to result in physical delivery.  See previous
discussion in “Fair Value Measurements” for additional
information.  Market value changes result in a change in the fair
value of our derivative instruments.  Commodity price volatility may
have a significant impact on the fair value of our derivative instruments as of
a given date; however, we do not believe that changes in our fair value
estimates of our derivative instruments have a material impact on our results of
operations, as the majority of our derivatives are accounted for as hedges for
which ineffectiveness is not material.

-76
- -


The
accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on
whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship
and, if so, the reason for holding it.

If
certain conditions are met, we may elect to designate a derivative instrument as
a hedge of exposure to changes in fair values, cash flows or foreign
currency.  Certain non-trading derivative transactions, which are
economic hedges of our accrual transactions, such as our storage and
transportation contracts, do not qualify for hedge accounting
treatment.

The table
below summarizes the various ways in which we account for our derivative
instruments and the impact on our consolidated financial
statements:

Gains or
losses associated with the fair value of derivative instruments entered into by
our Distribution segment are included in, and recoverable through, the monthly
purchased-gas cost mechanism.

To reduce
our exposure to fluctuations in natural gas, NGLs and condensate prices, we
periodically enter into futures, forwards, options or swap transactions in order
to hedge anticipated purchases and sales of natural gas, NGLs, condensate and
fuel requirements.  Interest-rate swaps are also used from time to
time to manage interest-rate risk.  Under certain conditions, we
designate these derivative instruments as a hedge of exposure to changes in fair
values or cash flows.  We formally document all relationships between
hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as risk management objectives and
strategies for undertaking various hedge transactions and methods for assessing
and testing correlation and hedge ineffectiveness.  We specifically
identify the asset, liability, firm commitment or forecasted transaction that
has been designated as the hedged item.  We assess the effectiveness
of hedging relationships quarterly by performing a regression analysis on our
cash flow and fair value hedging relationships to determine whether the hedge
relationships are highly effective on a retrospective and prospective
basis.  We also document our normal purchases and normal sales
transactions that we expect to result in physical delivery and which we elect to
exempt from derivative accounting treatment.

The
presentation of settled derivative instruments on either a gross or net basis in
our Consolidated Statements of Income is dependent on the relevant facts and
circumstances of our different types of activities rather than based solely on
the terms of the individual contracts.  All financially settled
derivative instruments, as well as derivative instruments considered held for
trading purposes that result in physical delivery, are reported on a net basis
in revenues in our Consolidated Statements of Income.  The realized
revenues and purchase costs of derivative instruments that are not considered
held for trading purposes and non-derivative contracts are reported on a gross
basis.  Derivatives that qualify as normal purchases or normal sales
that will result in physical delivery are also reported on a gross
basis.

Revenues
in our Consolidated Statements of Income include financial trading margins, as
well as certain physical natural gas transactions with our trading
counterparties.  Revenues and cost of sales and fuel from such
physical transactions are reported on a net basis.

Cash
flows from futures, forwards, options and swaps that are accounted for as hedges
are included in the same Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows category as the
cash flows from the related hedged items.

See Note
C and D for more discussion of our fair value measurements and risk management
and hedging activities using derivatives.

Impairment of Goodwill, Long-lived
Assets and Intangible Assets

- We assess our goodwill and intangible
assets with an indefinite useful life for impairment at least
annually.  As part of our impairment test, an initial assessment is
made by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its book value,
including goodwill.  If the fair value is less than the book value, an
impairment is indicated, and we must perform a second test to measure the amount
of the impairment.  In the second test, we calculate the implied fair
value of the goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible
net assets of the reporting unit from the fair value determined in step one of
the assessment.  If the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds the
implied fair value of the goodwill, we will record an impairment
charge.

We use
two generally accepted valuation approaches, an income approach and a market
approach, to estimate the fair value of our reporting units.  Under
the income approach, we use anticipated cash flows over a period of years plus a
terminal value and discount these amounts to their present value using
appropriate rates of return that are consistent with a market participant’s
perspective.  Under the market approach, we apply multiples to
forecasted cash flows.  The multiples used are consistent with a
market participant’s perspective of historical asset
transactions.  The forecasted cash flows are consistent with a market
participant’s perspective of forecasted average cash flow amounts over a period
of years.  We determined that there were no asset impairments in 2009,
2008 or 2007.

As part
of our indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test, we compare the
estimated fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets with their book
values.  The fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets is
estimated using the market approach.  Under the market approach, we
apply multiples to forecasted cash flows of the assets associated with our
indefinite-lived intangible assets.  The multiples used are consistent
with historical asset transactions.  We determined that there were no
impairments to our indefinite-lived intangible asset in 2009 or
2008.

We assess
our long-lived assets, including intangible assets with a finite useful life,
for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its
carrying amount may not be recoverable.  In step one of the impairment
test, an impairment is indicated if the carrying amount of a long-lived asset
exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from
the use and eventual disposition of the assets.  We record an
impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the fair
value of the long-lived asset.  This type of analysis requires us to
make assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors and the
profitability of future business strategies.  We determined that there
were no asset impairments in 2009, 2008 or 2007.

For the
investments we account for under the equity method, the impairment test
considers whether the fair value of the equity investment as a whole, not the
underlying net assets, has declined and whether that decline is other than
temporary.  Therefore, we periodically reevaluate the amount at which
we carry our equity method investments to determine whether current events or
circumstances warrant adjustments to our carrying value.  We determined
that there were no impairments to our investments in unconsolidated affiliates
in 2009, 2008 or 2007.

Our
impairment tests require the use of assumptions and estimates.  If
actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates or our
assumptions and estimates change due to new information, we may be exposed to an
impairment charge.

See Note
F for our goodwill and intangible assets disclosures.

Pension and Postretirement Employee
Benefits

- We have defined benefit retirement plans covering certain
full-time employees.  We sponsor welfare plans that provide
postretirement medical and life insurance benefits to certain employees who
retire with at least five years of service.  Our actuarial consultant
calculates the expense and liability related to these plans and uses statistical
and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events.  These
factors include assumptions about the discount rate, expected return on plan
assets, rate of future compensation increases, age and employment
periods.  In determining the projected benefit obligations and costs,
assumptions can change from period to period and result in material changes in
the costs and liabilities we recognize.  See Note K for more
discussion of pension and postretirement employee benefits.

Contingencies

- Our accounting
for contingencies covers a variety of business activities, including
contingencies for legal and environmental exposures.  We accrue these
contingencies when our assessments indicate that it is probable that a liability
has been incurred or an asset will not be recovered and an amount can be
reasonably estimated.  We base our estimates on

-78
- -


currently
available facts and our estimates of the ultimate outcome or
resolution.  Accruals for estimated losses from environmental
remediation obligations generally are recognized no later than completion of the
remediation feasibility study.  Recoveries of environmental
remediation costs from other parties are recorded as assets when their receipt
is deemed probable.  Actual results may differ from our estimates
resulting in an impact, positive or negative, on earnings.  See Note L
for additional discussion of contingencies.

Consolidation

- Our
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of ONEOK and our
subsidiaries over which we have control.  We have recorded
noncontrolling interests in consolidated subsidiaries on our Consolidated
Balance Sheets to recognize the percent of ONEOK Partners that we do not
own.  We reflected our ownership interest in ONEOK Partners’
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in our consolidated accumulated
other comprehensive income (loss).  The remaining percent is reflected
as an adjustment to noncontrolling interests in consolidated
subsidiaries.  All significant intercompany balances and transactions
have been eliminated in consolidation.

Investments
in affiliates are accounted for using the equity method if we have the ability
to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies of our
investee; conversely, if we do not have the ability to exercise significant
influence, then we use the cost method.  Impairment of equity and cost
method investments is recorded when the impairments are other than
temporary.

Use of Estimates

- The
preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in
accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions with respect
to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty that affect the
reported amount of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial
statements.  These estimates and assumptions also affect the reported
amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.  Items
that may be estimated include, but are not limited to, the economic useful life
of assets, fair value of assets and liabilities, obligations under employee
benefit plans, provisions for uncollectible accounts receivable, unbilled
revenues for natural gas delivered but for which meters have not been read, gas
purchased expense for natural gas purchased but for which no invoice has been
received, provision for income taxes, including any deferred tax valuation
allowances, the results of litigation and various other recorded or disclosed
amounts.

We
evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis using historical experience,
consultation with experts and other methods we consider reasonable based on the
particular circumstances.  Nevertheless, actual results may differ
significantly from the estimates.  Any effects on our financial
position or results of operations from revisions to these estimates are recorded
in the period when the facts that give rise to the revision become
known.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

-
Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments, which are readily
convertible into cash and have original maturities of three months or
less.

Accounts Receivable, Net

-
Accounts receivable represent valid claims against non-affiliated customers for
products sold or services rendered, net of allowances for doubtful
accounts.  We assess the credit worthiness of our counterparties on an
ongoing basis and require security, including prepayments and other forms of
collateral, when appropriate.  Outstanding customer receivables are
regularly reviewed for possible non-payment indicators and allowances for
doubtful accounts are recorded based upon management’s estimate of
collectibility at each balance sheet date.

Inventories

- Our current
natural gas and NGLs in storage are determined using the lower of
weighted-average cost or market method.  Noncurrent natural gas and
NGLs are classified as property and valued at cost.  Materials and
supplies are valued at average cost.

Commodity Imbalances

-

Natural gas and NGL
imbalances are valued at market or their contractually stipulated
rate.  Natural gas imbalances and NGL exchanges are settled in cash or
made up in-kind, subject to the terms of the pipelines’ tariffs or by
agreement.

Property, Plant and Equipment

- - Our properties are stated at cost, including AFUDC.  Generally, the
cost of regulated property retired or sold, plus removal costs, less salvage, is
charged to accumulated depreciation.  Gains and losses from sales or
transfers of non-regulated properties or an entire operating unit or system of
our regulated properties are recognized in income.  Maintenance and
repairs are charged directly to expense.

-79
- -


The
interest portion of AFUDC represents the cost of borrowed funds used to finance
construction activities.  We capitalize interest costs during the
construction or upgrade of qualifying assets.  Interest costs
capitalized in 2009, 2008 and 2007 were $17.0 million, $39.9 million and $15.4
million, respectively.  Capitalized interest is recorded as a
reduction to interest expense.  The equity portion of AFUDC represents
the capitalization of the estimated average cost of equity used during the
construction of major projects and is recorded in the cost of our regulated
properties and as a credit to the allowance for equity funds used during
construction.

Our
properties are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated
useful lives.  Generally, we apply composite depreciation rates to
functional groups of property having similar economic
circumstances.  We periodically conduct depreciation studies to assess
the economic lives of our assets.  For our regulated assets, these
depreciation studies are completed as a part of our rate proceedings, and the
changes in economic lives, if applicable, are implemented prospectively when the
new rates are billed.  For our non-regulated assets, if it is determined
that the estimated economic life changes, then the changes are made
prospectively.  Changes in the estimated economic lives of our property,
plant and equipment could have a material effect on our financial position or
results of operations.

Property,
plant and equipment on our Consolidated Balance Sheets includes construction
work in progress for capital projects that have not yet been placed in service
and therefore are not being depreciated.  Assets are transferred out
of construction work in progress when they are substantially complete and ready
for their intended use.

See Note
E for disclosures of our property, plant and equipment.

Revenue Recognition

- Our ONEOK Partners
segment includes natural gas gathering and processing, natural gas liquids, and
natural gas pipelines operations.  ONEOK Partners’ natural gas
gathering and processing operations record revenue when gas is processed in or
transported through its facilities.  ONEOK Partners’ natural gas
liquids operations record revenues based upon contracted services and actual
volumes exchanged or stored under service agreements in the period services are
provided.  Revenue for ONEOK Partners’ natural gas pipelines and a
portion of its natural gas liquids operations is recognized based upon
contracted capacity and contracted volumes transported and stored under service
agreements in the period services are provided.

Our
Distribution segment’s major industrial and commercial natural gas distribution
customers are invoiced at the end of each month.  All natural gas
residential distribution customers and some commercial customers are invoiced on
a cyclical basis throughout the month, and we accrue unbilled revenues at the
end of each month.

Our
Energy Services segment’s wholesale customers are invoiced at the end of each
month based on physical sales.  Retail customers are invoiced on a cyclical
basis throughout the month, and we accrue unbilled revenues at the end of each
month.  Demand payments received for requirements contracts are
recognized in the period in which the service is provided.  Our
fixed-price physical sales are accounted for as derivatives and are recorded at
fair value.  See previous discussion in “Derivative and Risk
Management Activities” for additional information.

Income Taxes

- Deferred income
taxes are provided for according to the difference between the financial
statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities and carry-forward
items, based on income tax laws and rates existing at the time the temporary
differences are expected to reverse.  The effect on deferred taxes of
a change in tax rates is deferred and amortized for operations regulated by the
OCC, KCC, RRC and various municipalities in Texas if, as a result of an action
by a regulator, it is probable that the effect of the change in tax rates will
be recovered from or returned to customers through future rates.  For
all other operations, the effect is recognized in income in the period that
includes the enactment date.  We continue to amortize previously
deferred investment tax credits for ratemaking purposes over the period
prescribed by the OCC, KCC, RRC and various municipalities in
Texas.

In June
2006, the FASB provided guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes
recognized in the financial statements.  The FASB prescribed a
more-likely-than-not recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the
financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position that is taken
or expected to be taken in a tax return.  We reflect penalties and
interest as part of income tax expense as they become applicable for tax
provisions that do not meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold and
measurement attribute.  During 2009, 2008 and 2007, our tax positions
that would require establishment of a reserve were immaterial.

-80
- -


We file
numerous consolidated and separate income tax returns in the United States
federal jurisdiction and in many state jurisdictions.  We also file
returns in Canada.  No extensions of statute of limitations have been
requested or granted.  Our 2008 United States federal income tax
return is currently under audit.  The statute of limitations remains
open for 2007 and 2006.  See Note M for additional discussion of
income taxes.

Regulation

- Our distribution
operations and ONEOK Partners’ intrastate natural gas transmission pipelines are
subject to the rate regulation and accounting requirements of the OCC, KCC, RRC
and various municipalities in Texas.  ONEOK Partners’ interstate
natural gas and natural gas liquids pipelines are subject to regulation by the
FERC.  In Kansas and Texas, natural gas storage may be regulated by
the state and the FERC for certain types of services.  Oklahoma
Natural Gas, Kansas Gas Service, Texas Gas Service and portions of our ONEOK
Partners segment follow the accounting and reporting guidance for regulated
operations.  During the rate-making process, regulatory authorities
set the framework for what we can charge customers for our services and
establish the manner that our costs are accounted for, including allowing us to
defer recognition of certain costs and permitting recovery of the amounts
through rates over time as opposed to expensing such costs as
incurred.  Certain examples of types of regulatory guidance include
costs for fuel and losses, acquisition costs, contributions in aid of
construction, charges for depreciation, and gains or losses on disposition of
assets.  This allows us to stabilize rates over time rather than
passing such costs on to the customer for immediate recovery.  Actions
by regulatory authorities could have an effect on the amount recovered from rate
payers.  Any difference in the amount recoverable and the amount
deferred is recorded as income or expense at the time of the regulatory
action.  A write-off of regulatory assets and costs not recovered may
be required if all or a portion of the regulated operations have rates that are
no longer:

·

established
      by independent, third-party
regulators;

·

designed
      to recover the specific entity’s costs of providing regulated services;
      and

·

set
      at levels that will recover our costs when considering the demand and
      competition for our services.

At
December 31, 2009 and 2008, we recorded regulatory assets of approximately
$488.6 million and $523.3 million, respectively, which are being recovered
through various rate cases or are expected to be
recovered.  Regulatory assets are being recovered as a result of
approved rate proceedings over varying time periods up to 40
years.  These assets are reflected in other assets on our Consolidated
Balance Sheets.

Asset Retirement Obligations

-
Asset retirement obligations

represent legal
obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from
the acquisition, construction, development and/or normal use of the
asset.  We recognize the fair value of a liability for an asset
retirement obligation in the period when it is incurred if a reasonable estimate
of the fair value can be made.  The fair value of the liability is
added to the carrying amount of the associated asset, and this additional
carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset.  The
liability is accreted at the end of each period through charges to operating
expense.  If the obligation is settled for an amount other than the
carrying amount of the liability, we will recognize a gain or loss on
settlement.  The depreciation and amortization expense is immaterial
to our consolidated financial statements.

In
accordance with long-standing regulatory treatment, we collect through rates the
estimated costs of removal on certain regulated properties through depreciation
expense, with a corresponding credit to accumulated depreciation and
amortization.  These removal costs are non-legal
obligations.  However, these non-legal asset-removal obligations are
accounted for as a regulatory liability.  Historically, the regulatory
authorities that have jurisdiction over our regulated operations have not
required us to quantify this amount; rather, these costs are addressed
prospectively in depreciation rates and are set in each general rate
order.  We have made an estimate of our removal cost liability using
current rates since the last general rate order in each of our
jurisdictions.  However, significant uncertainty exists regarding the
ultimate determination of this liability, pending, among other issues,
clarification of regulatory intent.  We continue to monitor the
regulatory authorities and the liability may be adjusted as more information is
obtained.  We record the estimated non-legal asset removal obligation
in non-current liabilities in other deferred credits on our Consolidated Balance
Sheets.  To the extent this estimated liability is adjusted, such
amounts will be reclassified between accumulated depreciation and amortization
and other deferred credits and therefore will not have an impact on
earnings.

Share-Based Payment

- We
expense the fair value of share-based payments net of estimated
forfeitures.  We estimate forfeiture rates based on historical
forfeitures under our share-based payment plans.

Earnings per Common Share

-
Basic EPS is calculated based on the daily weighted-average number of shares of
common stock outstanding during the period.  Diluted EPS is calculated
based on the daily weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding
during the period plus potentially dilutive components.  The dilutive
components are calculated

-81
- -


based on
the dilutive effect for each quarter.  For fiscal year periods, the
dilutive components for each quarter are averaged to arrive at the fiscal
year-to-date dilutive component.

Recently
Issued Accounting Updates

The
following recently issued accounting updates affect our consolidated financial
statements:

FASB Accounting Standards
Codification

- In June 2009, the FASB established the FASB Accounting
Standards Codification (Codification) as the source of authoritative accounting
principles recognized by the FASB to be applied by nongovernmental entities in
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with
GAAP.  While the Codification does not change GAAP, it does change the
manner in which we reference authoritative accounting principles in our
consolidated financial statements.  The Codification has been
implemented in this Annual Report.

Noncontrolling Interests

-
Effective for our year beginning January 1, 2009, we retroactively adopted new
presentation and disclosure requirements for existing noncontrolling interests
(previously referred to as minority interests).  We report
noncontrolling interests as a component of equity in our Consolidated Balance
Sheets and the amounts of consolidated net income attributable to noncontrolling
interests and to us in our Consolidated Statements of Income.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities

- Effective for our year beginning January 1, 2009, we provide
enhanced disclosures about how derivative and hedging activities affect our
financial position, financial performance and cash flows.  These
additional disclosures have been applied prospectively.  See Notes A
and D for applicable disclosures.

Fair Value Measurements and
Disclosures

- In January 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010-06, “Improving
Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements,” which provides new disclosure
requirements and clarifies existing disclosures of fair value
measurements.  We will apply this guidance to our disclosures beginning
with our March 31, 2010, Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and do not expect the
impact to be material.

See Note
C for more discussion of our fair value measurements.

Postretirement Benefit Plan
Assets

- Effective for our fiscal year ending December 31, 2009, we have
provided enhanced disclosures about our plan assets, including our investment
policies, major categories of plan assets, significant concentrations of risk
within plan assets and inputs and valuation techniques used to measure the fair
value of plan assets.  These additional disclosure requirements have
been applied prospectively.  See Note K for applicable
disclosures.

Subsequent Events

- Effective
for our quarter ended June 30, 2009, the FASB established standards related to
the accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet
date but before consolidated financial statements are issued.  We have
evaluated subsequent events through February 23, 2010, the date our consolidated
financial statements were issued, and we believe all required subsequent events
disclosures have been made.

B.           ACQUISITION

Acquisition of NGL Pipeline

-
In October 2007, ONEOK Partners completed the acquisition of an interstate
natural gas liquids and refined petroleum products pipeline system and related
assets from a subsidiary of Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L.P. for
approximately $300 million, before working capital adjustments.  The
FERC-regulated system extends from Bushton and Conway, Kansas, to Chicago,
Illinois, and transports, stores and delivers a full range of NGL and refined
petroleum products.  The transaction also included a 50 percent
ownership interest in Heartland.  ConocoPhillips owns the other 50
percent of Heartland and is the managing partner of the Heartland joint venture,
which consists primarily of a refined petroleum products terminal and pipelines
with access to two other refined petroleum products terminals.  ONEOK
Partners’ investment in Heartland is accounted for under the equity method of
accounting.  Financing for this transaction came from a portion of the
proceeds of ONEOK Partners’ September 2007 issuance of $600 million 6.85 percent
Senior Notes due 2037.  The working capital settlement was finalized
in April 2008, with no material adjustments.

C.           FAIR
VALUE MEASUREMENTS

See Note
A for a discussion of our fair value measurements, the fair value hierarchy and
the related accounting treatment.  See Note K for our disclosures
related to the plan assets of our employee benefit plans.

Recurring Fair Value
Measurements

- The following tables set forth our recurring fair value
measurements for the periods indicated:

-83
- -


We
categorize derivatives for which fair value is determined using multiple inputs
within a single level, based on the lowest level input that is significant to
the fair value measurement in its entirety.

Our Level
1 fair value measurements are based on NYMEX-settled prices, actively quoted
prices for equity securities and foreign currency forward exchange
rates.  These balances are predominantly comprised of exchange-traded
derivative contracts, including futures and certain options for natural gas and
crude oil, that are valued based on unadjusted quoted prices in active
markets.  Also included in Level 1 are equity securities and foreign
currency forwards.

Our Level
2 fair value inputs are based on NYMEX-settled prices for natural gas and crude
oil that are utilized to determine the fair value of certain non-exchange traded
financial instruments, including natural gas and crude oil swaps,
respectively.

Our Level
3 inputs include internally developed basis curves incorporating observable and
unobservable market data, NGL price curves from a pricing service, historical
correlations of NGL product prices to published NYMEX crude oil prices, market
volatilities derived from the most recent NYMEX close spot prices and forward
LIBOR curves, and adjustments for the credit risk of our
counterparties.  We corroborate the data on which our fair value
estimates are based using our market knowledge of recent transactions, analysis
of historical correlations and validation with independent broker quotes or a
pricing service.  The derivatives categorized as Level 3 include
natural gas basis swaps, swing swaps, options and physical forward contracts,
NGL swaps and interest-rate swaps.  Also included in Level 3 are the
fair values of firm commitments and long-term debt that have been
hedged.  We do not believe that our derivative instruments categorized
as Level 3 have a material impact on our results of operations, as the majority
of our derivatives are accounted for as hedges for which ineffectiveness is not
material.

The
following tables set forth the reconciliation of our Level 3 fair value
measurements for the periods indicated:

Realized/

unrealized gains (losses) include the
realization of our derivative contracts through maturity and changes in fair
value of our hedged firm commitments and fixed-rate debt swapped to a floating
rate.  Maturities represent the long-term debt associated with an
interest-rate swap that matured during the period.  Terminations prior
to maturity represent the long-term debt associated with an interest-rate
swap that was terminated during the period.  Transfers into Level 3
represent existing assets or liabilities that were previously categorized at a
higher level for which the unobservable inputs became a more significant portion
of the fair value estimates.  Transfers out of Level 3 represent existing
assets and liabilities that were previously classified as Level 3 for which the
inputs became observable in accordance with our hierarchy policy

discussed in Note A.

Investment Securities

-

The tables below show
information about our investment securities classified as available-for-sale for
the periods indicated:

We
transferred securities from available-for-sale to trading during the year ended
December 31, 2008, and recognized a $7.7 million gain, due to a reconsideration
event in August 2008 when our NYMEX Holding, Inc. Class A shares held were
converted to CME Group, Inc. (CME) Class A shares due to the NYMEX Holding, Inc.
and CME merger.  A modification was made to the number of shares
required to be maintained by NYMEX Holding, Inc. Class A owners that resulted in
our sale of certain shares and the reclassification of the remaining shares to
trading.  These trading securities were still held as of December 31,
2009.

The gains
reclassified into earnings from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)
for the year ended December 31, 2008, of $11.1 million include the $7.7 million
gain discussed previously, as well as a $3.4 million realized gain on the sale
of available-for-sale securities.  For the available-for-sale
securities sold in 2008, we used specific identification to determine the
cost.  Proceeds received from the sale were approximately $3.9
million.

-85
- -


Other Financial Instruments

-

The
approximate fair value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and
accounts payable is equal to book value, due to its short-term
nature.  The fair value of notes payable approximates the carrying
value since the interest rates, prescribed by each borrowing’s respective credit
agreement, are periodically adjusted to reflect current market
conditions.

The
estimated fair value of long-term debt, including current maturities, was $4.83
billion and $3.95 billion at December 31, 2009 and 2008,
respectively.  The book value of long-term debt, including current
maturities, was $4.60 billion and $4.23 billion at December 31, 2009 and 2008,
respectively.  The estimated fair value of long-term debt has been
determined using quoted market prices of the same or similar issues with similar
terms and maturities.

D.           RISK
MANAGEMENT AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES USING DERIVATIVES

See
      Note A for a discussion of the accounting treatment of our risk management
      and hedging activities using
derivatives.

Energy
Marketing and Risk Management Activities

Our
Energy Services and ONEOK Partners segments are exposed to various risks that we
manage by periodically entering into derivative instruments.  These
risks include the following:

·

Commodity price
      risk

- We are exposed to the risk of loss in cash flows and future
      earnings arising from adverse changes in the price of natural gas, NGLs
      and condensate.  We use commodity derivative instruments such as
      futures, physical forward contracts, swaps and options to mitigate the
      commodity price risk associated with a portion of the forecasted purchases
      and sales of commodities and natural gas and natural gas liquids in
      storage;

·

Basis risk

- We
      are exposed to the risk of loss in cash flows and future earnings arising
      from adverse changes in the price differentials between pipeline receipt
      and delivery locations.  Our firm transportation capacity allows
      us to purchase gas at a pipeline receipt point and sell gas at a pipeline
      delivery point.  Our Energy Services segment periodically enters
      into basis swaps between the transportation receipt and delivery points in
      order to protect the fair value of these location price differentials
      related to our firm commitments;
and

·

Currency exchange rate
      risk

- As a result of our Energy Services segment’s activities in
      Canada, we are exposed to the risk of loss in cash flows and future
      earnings from adverse changes in currency exchange rates on our commodity
      purchases and sales, primarily related to our firm transportation and
      storage contracts that are transacted in a currency other than our
      functional currency, the U.S. dollar.  To reduce our exposure to
      exchange-rate fluctuations, we use physical forward transactions, which
      result in an actual two-way flow of currency on the settlement date in
      which we exchange U.S. dollars for Canadian dollars with another
      party.

The
following derivative instruments are used to manage our exposure to these
risks:

·

Futures
      contracts

- Standardized exchange-traded contracts to purchase
      or sell natural gas and crude oil at a specified price, requiring delivery
      on or settlement through the sale or purchase of an offsetting contract by
      a specified future date under the provisions of exchange
      regulations;

·

Forward
      contracts

- Commitments to purchase or sell natural gas, crude
      oil or NGLs for delivery at some specified time in the future.  We
      also use currency forward contracts to manage our currency exchange rate
      risk.  Forward contracts are different from futures in that
      forwards are customized and non-exchange
traded;

·

Swaps

-
      Financial trades involving the exchange of payments based on two different
      pricing structures for a commodity.  In a typical commodity swap,
      parties exchange payments based on changes in the price of a commodity or
      a market index, while fixing the price they effectively pay or receive for
      the physical commodity.  As a result, one party assumes the risks and
      benefits of movements in market prices, while the other party assumes the
      risks and benefits of a fixed price for the commodity;
  and

·

Options

-
      Contractual agreements that give the holder the right, but not the
      obligation, to buy or sell a fixed quantity of a commodity, at a fixed
      price, within a specified period of time.  Options may either be
      standardized, exchange traded or customized and non-exchange
      traded.

Our
objectives for entering into such contracts include but are not limited
to:

·

reducing
      the variability of cash flows by locking in the price for all or a portion
      of anticipated index-based physical purchases and sales, transportation
      fuel requirements, asset management transactions and customer-related
      business activities;

-86
- -


·

locking
      in a price differential to protect the fair value between transportation
      receipt and delivery points and to protect the fair value of natural gas
      or NGLs that are purchased in one month and sold in a later month;
      and

·

reducing
      our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
      rates.

Our
Energy Services segment also enters into derivative contracts for financial
trading purposes primarily to capitalize on opportunities created by market
volatility, weather-related events, supply-demand imbalances and market
liquidity

inefficiencies,
which allows us to capture additional margin.  Financial trading
activities are executed generally using financially settled derivatives and are
normally short term in nature.

With
respect to the net open positions that exist within our marketing and financial
trading operations, fluctuating commodity prices can impact our financial
position and results of operations.  The net open positions are
actively managed, and the impact of the changing prices on our financial
condition at a point in time is not necessarily indicative of the impact of
price movements throughout the year.

Our
Distribution segment also uses derivative instruments to hedge the cost of
anticipated natural gas purchases during the winter heating months to protect
our customers from upward volatility in the market price of natural
gas.  The use of these derivative instruments and the associated
recovery of these costs have been approved by the OCC, KCC and regulatory
authorities in certain of our Texas jurisdictions.

We are
also subject to fluctuation in interest rates.  We manage
interest-rate risk through the use of fixed-rate debt, floating-rate debt and
interest-rate swaps.  Interest-rate swaps are agreements to exchange
an interest payment at some future point based on the differential between two
interest rates.  At December 31, 2009, we were not using any
interest-rate swaps.  At December 31, 2008, the interest on $170
million of our fixed-rate debt was swapped to floating using interest-rate
swaps.  The floating rate was based on both the three- or six-month
LIBOR, depending upon the swap.  Based on the actual performance for
the year ended December 31, 2008, the weighted-average interest rate on the
swapped debt decreased from 6.17 percent to 4.39 percent.  At December
31, 2008, we recorded a net asset of $1.5 million to recognize the interest-rate
swaps at fair value.

held for the period indicated:

These
notional amounts are used to summarize the volume of financial
instruments.  However, they do not reflect the extent to which the
positions offset one another and consequently do not reflect our actual exposure
to market or credit risk.

Cash Flow Hedges

-

Our Energy Services and
ONEOK Partners segments use derivative instruments to hedge the cash flows
associated with anticipated purchases and sales of natural gas, NGLs and
condensate and cost of fuel used in the transportation of natural
gas.  Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at December 31,
2009, includes losses of approximately $3.9 million, net of tax, related to
these hedges that will be recognized within the next 22 months as the forecasted
transactions affect earnings.  If prices remain at current levels, we
will recognize $4.3 million in net losses over the next 12 months, and we will
recognize net gains of $0.4 million thereafter.

In 2009,
cost of sales and fuel in our Consolidated Statements of Income includes $11.3
million reflecting an adjustment to inventory at the lower of cost or
market.  We reclassified $11.3 million of deferred gains, before
income taxes, on associated cash flow hedges from accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) into earnings.

During
the third and fourth quarters of 2008, the carrying value of natural gas in
storage was written down by $308.5 million in order to record inventory at the
lower of cost or market.  We reclassified $298.8 million of deferred
gains, before income taxes, on associated cash flow hedges from accumulated
other comprehensive income (loss) into earnings.

Through
an affiliate, our ONEOK Partners segment periodically enters into derivative
instruments to hedge the cash flows associated with its exposure to changes in
the price of natural gas, NGLs and condensate.  At December 31, 2009,
our ONEOK Partners’ segment reflected an unrealized loss of $18.2 million in
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), with a corresponding offset in
energy marketing and risk management assets and liabilities.  If
prices remain at current levels, the loss will be realized within the next 12
months as the forecasted transactions affect earnings.

discontinue cash flow hedge treatment, which will affect earnings.  In
2009, 2008 and 2007, there were no gains or losses due to the discontinuance of
cash flow hedge treatment since the underlying transactions were no longer
probable.

ONEOK and

Our
Energy Services segment uses basis swaps to hedge the fair value of location
price differentials related to certain firm transportation
commitments.  Net gains or losses from the fair value hedges and
ineffectiveness are recorded to cost of sales and fuel.  The
ineffectiveness related to these hedges included gains of $2.7 million and
losses of $3.3 million and $5.3 million for 2009, 2008, and 2007,
respectively.

Cost of
sales and fuel in our Consolidated Statements of Income include gains of $253.2
million for 2009, related to the change in fair value of derivatives declared as
fair value hedges.  Revenues include losses of $250.5 million for
2009, to recognize the change in fair value of the hedged firm
commitments.

Credit Risk

- We monitor the
creditworthiness of our counterparties and compliance with management’s risk
tolerance as determined by our Risk Oversight and Strategy
Committee.  We maintain credit policies with regard to our
counterparties that we believe minimize overall credit risk.  These
policies include an evaluation of potential counterparties’ financial condition
(including credit ratings, bond yields and credit default swap rates),
collateral requirements under certain circumstances and the use of standardized
master-netting agreements that allow us to net the positive and negative
exposures associated with a single counterparty.  We have
counterparties whose credit is not rated, and for those customers we use
internally developed credit ratings.

Some of
our derivative instruments contain provisions that require us to maintain an
investment-grade credit rating from S&P and/or Moody’s.  If our
credit ratings on senior unsecured long-term debt were to decline below
investment grade, we would be in violation of these provisions, and the
counterparties to the derivative instruments could request collateralization on
derivative instruments in net liability positions.  The aggregate fair
value of all derivative instruments with contingent features related to credit
risk that were in a net liability position as of December 31, 2009, was $53.0
million for which we have posted collateral of $26.1 million in the normal
course of business.  If the contingent features underlying these
agreements were triggered on December 31, 2009, we would have been required to
post an additional $26.9 million of collateral to our
counterparties.

The
counterparties to our derivative contracts consist primarily of major energy
companies, LDCs, electric utilities, financial institutions and commercial and
industrial end-users.  This concentration of counterparties may impact
our overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that
the counterparties may be similarly affected by changes in economic, regulatory
or other conditions.  Based on our policies, exposures, credit and
other reserves, we do not anticipate a material adverse effect on our financial
position or results of operations as a result of counterparty
nonperformance.

H.           CREDIT
FACILITIES AND SHORT-TERM NOTES PAYABLE

ONEOK Credit Agreement

-

Under the ONEOK Credit
Agreement, which expires July 2011, ONEOK is required to comply with certain
financial, operational and legal covenants.  Among other things, these
requirements include:

·

a
      $400 million sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of
      credit;

·

a
      limitation on ONEOK’s stand-alone debt-to-capital ratio, which may not
      exceed 67.5 percent at the end of any calendar
  quarter;

·

a
      requirement that ONEOK maintains the power to control the management and
      policies of ONEOK Partners; and

·

a
      limit on new investments in master limited
  partnerships.

The ONEOK
Credit Agreement also contains customary affirmative and negative covenants,
including covenants relating to liens, investments, fundamental changes in our
businesses, changes in the nature of ONEOK’s businesses, transactions with
affiliates, the use of proceeds and a covenant that prevents ONEOK from
restricting its subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends.

The debt
covenant calculations in the ONEOK Credit Agreement exclude the debt of ONEOK
Partners.  Upon breach of any covenant by ONEOK, amounts outstanding
under the ONEOK Credit Agreement may become immediately due and
payable.  At December 31, 2009, ONEOK’s stand-alone debt-to-capital
ratio, as defined by the ONEOK Credit Agreement, was 45.4 percent, and ONEOK was
in compliance with all covenants under the ONEOK Credit Agreement.

At
December 31, 2009, ONEOK had $358.9 million in commercial paper outstanding and
$37.0 million in letters of credit issued under the ONEOK Credit Agreement,
leaving $804.1 million of credit available under the ONEOK Credit
Agreement.

The
average interest rate on ONEOK’s short-term debt outstanding was 0.30 percent
and 4.51 percent at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

At
December 31, 2008, ONEOK had no commercial paper outstanding, $1.4 billion in
borrowings outstanding and $64.6 million in letters of credit issued under the
ONEOK Credit Agreement, leaving $135.4 million of credit available under the
ONEOK Credit Agreement and the $400 million 364-Day revolving credit facility
dated August 6, 2008, which expired on August 5, 2009.

ONEOK Partners Credit
Agreement

- Under the ONEOK Partners Credit Agreement, which expires
March 2012, ONEOK Partners is required to comply with certain financial,
operational and legal covenants.  Among other things, these
requirements include maintaining a ratio of indebtedness to adjusted EBITDA
(EBITDA, as defined in ONEOK Partners Credit Agreement, as adjusted for all
non-cash charges and increased for projected EBITDA from certain lender-approved
capital expansion projects) of no more than 5 to 1.  If ONEOK Partners
consummates one or more acquisitions in which the aggregate purchase price is
$25 million or more, the allowable ratio of indebtedness to adjusted EBITDA will
be increased to 5.5 to 1 for the three calendar quarters following the
acquisition.  Upon breach of any covenant, discussed above, amounts
outstanding under the ONEOK Partners Credit Agreement may become immediately due
and payable.  At December 31, 2009, ONEOK Partners’ ratio of
indebtedness to adjusted EBITDA was 4.5 to 1, and ONEOK Partners was in
compliance with all covenants under the ONEOK Partners Credit
Agreement.

At
December 31, 2009 and 2008, ONEOK Partners had $523 million and $870 million,
respectively, in borrowings outstanding under the ONEOK Partners Credit
Agreement and under the most restrictive provisions of

the ONEOK Partners Credit
Agreement had $367.1 million and $130 million, respectively, of credit
available.  At December 31, 2009 and 2008, ONEOK Partners had a total
of $24.2 million and $49.2 million, respectively, issued in letters of credit
outside of the ONEOK Partners Credit Agreement.  Borrowings under the
ONEOK Partners Credit Agreement are nonrecourse to ONEOK.

The
average interest rate of short-term debt outstanding under the ONEOK Partners
Credit Agreement was 0.54 percent and 4.22 percent at December 31, 2009 and
2008, respectively.

Borrowings
under the ONEOK Credit Agreement and the ONEOK Partners Credit Agreement are
typically short term in nature, ranging from one day to six months. 
Accordingly, these borrowings are classified as short-term notes
payable.

million.

In
February 2009, ONEOK repaid $100 million of maturing long-term debt with cash
from operations and short-term borrowings.

ONEOK Partners’ Debt Issuance

-

In March
2009, ONEOK Partners completed an underwritten public offering of $500 million
aggregate principal amount of 8.625 percent Senior Notes due 2019 (2019
Notes).  The net proceeds from the 2019 Notes of approximately $494.3
million were used to repay indebtedness outstanding under the ONEOK Partners
Credit Agreement.  The 2019 Notes will mature on March 1,
2019.  ONEOK Partners will pay interest on the 2019 Notes on March 1
and September 1 of each year.  The first payment of interest on the
2019 Notes was made on September 1, 2009.

Debt Covenants

- The terms of
the ONEOK Partners 2019 Notes are governed by an indenture, dated as of
September 25, 2006, between ONEOK Partners and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as
trustee, as supplemented by the Fifth Supplemental Indenture, dated March 3,
2009 (Indenture).  The Indenture does not limit the aggregate
principal amount of debt securities that may be issued and provides that debt
securities may be issued from time to time in one or more additional
series.  The Indenture contains covenants including, among other
provisions, limitations on ONEOK Partners’ ability to place liens on its
property or assets and to sell and lease back its property.

ONEOK
Partners’ $250 million and $225 million senior notes, due June 15, 2010, and
March 15, 2011, respectively, contain provisions that require ONEOK Partners to
offer to repurchase the senior notes at par value if its Moody’s or S&P
credit rating falls below investment grade (Baa3 for Moody’s or BBB- for
S&P) and the investment-grade rating is not reinstated within a period of 40
days; however, once the $250 million 2010 senior notes have been retired,
whether by maturity, redemption or otherwise, ONEOK Partners will no longer have
any obligation to offer to repurchase the $225 million 2011 senior notes in the
event its credit rating falls below investment grade.  Further, the
indentures governing ONEOK Partners’ senior notes due 2010 and 2011 include an
event of default upon acceleration of other indebtedness of $25 million or more
and the indentures governing the senior notes due 2012, 2016, 2019, 2036 and
2037 include an event of default upon the acceleration of other indebtedness of
$100 million or more that would be triggered by such an offer to
repurchase.  Such an event of default would entitle the trustee or the
holders of 25 percent in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding senior
notes due 2010, 2011, 2012, 2016, 2019, 2036 and 2037 to declare those notes
immediately due and payable in full.

ONEOK
Partners may redeem the notes due 2012, 2016, 2019, 2036 and 2037, in whole or
in part, at any time prior to their maturity at a redemption price equal to the
principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and a make-whole
premium.  The redemption price will never be less than 100 percent of
the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption
date.  The  notes due 2012, 2016, 2019, 2036 and 2037, are
senior unsecured obligations, ranking equally in right of payment with all of
ONEOK Partners’ existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness, and
effectively junior to any of the existing and future debt and other liabilities
of ay non-guarantor subsidiaries.

Debt Guarantee

- The ONEOK
Partners notes due 2012, 2016, 2019, 2036 and 2037, are fully and
unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by ONEOK Partners’ wholly
owned subsidiary, ONEOK Partners Intermediate Limited Partnership (Intermediate
Partnership).  ONEOK Partners’ long-term debt is nonrecourse to
ONEOK.  The guarantee ranks equally in right of payment to all of the
Intermediate Partnership’s existing and future unsecured senior
indebtedness.  ONEOK Partners has no significant assets or operations
other than its investment in the Intermediate Partnership, which is

-96
- -


also
consolidated.  At December 31, 2009, the Intermediate Partnership held
partnership interests in the equity of ONEOK Partners’ subsidiaries, as well as
a 50 percent interest in Northern Border Pipeline.

Guardian Pipeline Senior Notes

- - These notes were issued under a master shelf agreement with certain financial
institutions.  Principal payments are due quarterly through
2022.  Interest rates on the $109.8 million in notes outstanding at
December 31, 2009, range from 7.61 percent to 8.27 percent, with an average rate
of 7.85 percent.  Guardian Pipeline’s senior notes contain financial
covenants that require the maintenance of a ratio of (i) EBITDAR, as defined in
the master shelf agreement dated as of November 8, 2001, to fixed charges
(interest expense plus operating lease expense) of not less than 1.5 to 1; and
(ii) total indebtedness to EBITDAR of not greater than 5.75 to
1.  Upon any breach of these covenants, all amounts outstanding under
the master shelf agreement may become due and payable immediately.  At
December 31, 2009, Guardian Pipeline’s EBITDAR-to-fixed-charges ratio was 4.6 to
1, the ratio of total indebtedness to EBITDAR was 2.2 to 1, and Guardian
Pipeline was in compliance with its financial covenants.

third-quarter 2009 dividends paid on our common stock to shareholders of record
at the close of business on July 31, 2009, and November 13, 2009, respectively,
were $0.42 per share.  Additionally, a quarterly dividend of $0.44 per

2010.

K.           EMPLOYEE
BENEFIT PLANS

Retirement
and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans

Retirement Plans

- We have
defined benefit retirement plans covering certain full-time
employees.  Nonbargaining unit employees hired after December 31,
2004, are not eligible for our defined benefit pension plan; however, they are
covered by a defined contribution profit-sharing plan.  Certain
officers and key employees are also eligible to participate in supplemental
retirement plans.  We generally fund our pension costs at a level
needed to maintain or exceed the minimum funding levels required by the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the Pension Protection Act of
2006.

Other Postretirement Benefit
Plans

- We sponsor welfare plans that provide postretirement medical and
life insurance benefits to certain employees who retire with at least five years
of service.  The postretirement medical plan is contributory based on
hire date, age and years of service, with retiree contributions adjusted
periodically, and contains other cost-sharing features such as deductibles and
coinsurance.

Regulatory Treatment

- The
OCC, KCC, and regulatory authorities in Texas have approved the recovery of
pension costs and other postretirement benefits costs through rates for Oklahoma
Natural Gas, Kansas Gas Service and Texas Gas Service,
respectively.  The costs recovered through rates are based on current
funding requirements and the net periodic benefit cost

-97
- -


for
pension and postretirement costs.  Differences, if any, between the
expense and the amount recovered through rates are reflected in earnings, net of
authorized deferrals.

Our
regulated entities have historically recovered pension and other postretirement
benefit costs through rates.  We believe it is probable that regulators
will continue to include the net periodic pension and other postretirement
benefit costs in our regulated entities’ cost of service.  Accordingly, we
have recorded a regulatory asset for the minimum liability associated with our
regulated entities’ pension and other postretirement benefit obligations that
otherwise would have been recorded in accumulated other comprehensive
income.

Measurement Date Change

-
Effective for our year ended December 31, 2008, we changed our measurement date
from September 30 to December 31.  We determined our net periodic benefit
cost for the period October 1, 2007, through December 31, 2008, based on a
measurement date of September 30, 2007.  The net periodic benefit cost
for the period of October 1, 2007, through December 31, 2007, was reflected as
an adjustment to retained earnings as of December 31, 2008.  The
impact of this adjustment was a $7.6 million reduction to retained earnings, net
of taxes.

Obligations and Funded Status

- - The following tables set forth our pension and other postretirement benefit
plans benefit obligations and fair value of plan assets for the periods
indicated.  Due to the change in our measurement date discussed above,
the changes in our benefit obligation and plan assets shown in the following
tables for 2008 are for the 15-month period from October 1, 2007 through
December 31, 2008.

The
accumulated benefit obligation for our pension plans was $939.9 million and
$824.7 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

There are
no plan assets expected to be withdrawn and returned to us in 2010.

We
determine our overall expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, based on
our review of historical returns and economic growth models.

We
determine our discount rates annually.  For 2009, we changed our
methodology to estimate our discount rate based upon a comparison of the
expected cash flows associated with our future payments under our pension and
postretirement obligations to a hypothetical bond portfolio created using high
quality bonds that closely match expected cash flows.  Bond portfolios are
developed by selecting a bond for each of the next 60 years based on the
maturity dates of the bonds.  Bonds

-100
- -


selected
to be included in the portfolios are only those rated by Moody’s as AA- or
better and exclude callable bonds, bonds with less than a minimum issue size,
yield outliers and other filtering criteria to remove unsuitable
bonds.  The change in methodology did not have a material impact on
the determination of our discount rate.

In 2008
and 2007, we developed the discount rates based on matching the amount and
timing of the projected benefit payments to a spot-rate yield curve, which
provided zero-coupon interest rates into the future.  The methodology for
developing the yield curve included selecting the bonds to be included (only
bonds rated Aa by Moody’s but excluding callable bonds, bonds with less than a
minimum issue size, yield outliers and various other filtering criteria to
remove unsuitable bonds).  Once the bonds were selected, a best-fit
regression curve to the bond data was determined, modeling yields to maturity as
a function of years to maturity.  This coupon yield curve was converted to
a spot-yield curve using the calculation technique that assumed the price of a
coupon bond for a given maturity equaled the present value of the underlying
bond cash flows using zero-coupon spot rates.  Once the yield curve was
developed, the projected cash flows for the plan for each year in the future
were calculated.  These projected cash-flow values were based on the most
recent valuation.  Each annual cash flow of the plan obligations was
discounted using the yield at the appropriate point on the curve, and then the
single equivalent discount rate that would yield the same value for the cash
flow was determined.

Plan Assets

-

Our investment strategy
is to invest plan assets in accordance with sound investment practices that
emphasize long-term fundamentals.  The goal of this strategy is to
maximize investment returns while managing risk in order to meet the plan’s
current and projected financial obligations.  The plan’s investments
include a diverse blend of various domestic and international equities,
investments in various classes of debt securities, insurance contracts and
venture capital.  The target allocation for the assets of our pension
plan is as follows:

Corporate
      bonds / insurance contracts

Contributions

-

For 2009, $77.1 million
and $8.9 million of contributions were made to our pension plan and other
postretirement benefit plan, respectively.  We anticipate our total
2010 contributions will be $43.3 million for the pension plan and $12.4 million
for the other postretirement benefit plan.

Pension and Other Postretirement
Benefit Payments

- Benefit payments for our pension and other
postretirement benefit plans for the period ending December 31, 2009, were $56.4
million and $13.3 million, respectively.  The following table sets
forth the pension benefits and postretirement benefit payments expected to be
paid in 2010-2019:

employee service.

Other
Employee Benefit Plans

Thrift Plan

- We have a Thrift
Plan covering all full-time employees, and employee contributions are
discretionary.  We match 100 percent of employee contributions up to 6
percent of each participant’s eligible compensation, subject to certain
limits.  Our contributions made to the plan were $14.7 million, $14.7
million and $13.2 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Profit-Sharing Plan

- We have
a profit-sharing plan for all nonbargaining unit employees hired after December
31, 2004.  Nonbargaining unit employees who were employed prior to
January 1, 2005, were given a one-time opportunity to make an irrevocable
election to participate in the profit-sharing plan and not accrue any additional
benefits under our defined-benefit pension plan after December 31,
2004.  We plan to make a contribution to the profit-sharing plan each
quarter equal to 1 percent of each participant’s eligible compensation during
the quarter.  Additional discretionary employer contributions may be
made at the end of each year.  Employee contributions are not allowed
under the plan.  Our contributions made to the plan were $4.7 million,
$3.2 million and $2.7 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Employee Deferred Compensation Plan

-

The ONEOK,
Inc. 2005 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan provides select employees, as
approved by our Board of Directors, with the option to defer portions of their
compensation and provides nonqualified deferred compensation benefits that are
not available due to limitations on employer and employee contributions to
qualified defined contribution plans under the federal tax laws.  Our
contributions made to the plan were not material in 2009, 2008 and
2007.

L.           COMMITMENTS
AND CONTINGENCIES

Commitments

- In March 2008,
ONEOK Leasing Company, a subsidiary of ONEOK, purchased ONEOK Plaza for a total
purchase price of approximately $48 million, which included $17.1 million for
the present value of the remaining lease payments and $30.9 million for the base
purchase price.

We lease
excess office space in ONEOK Plaza.  We received rental revenue of
$3.3 million in 2009, $2.6 million in 2008 and $2.9 million in
2007.  Estimated minimum future rental payments to be received under
existing contracts for subleases are $2.3 million in 2010, $2.2 million in 2011,
$1.3 million in 2012, $1.2 million in 2013 and $0.9 million in
2014.

Operating
leases represent future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating
leases on a gas processing plant, office space, pipeline equipment,
rights-of-way and vehicles.  Firm transportation and storage contracts
are fixed-price contracts that provide us with firm transportation and storage
capacity.  The following table sets forth our operating lease and firm
transportation and storage contract payments for the periods

The
amounts in the ONEOK table above include minimum lease payments relating to the
lease of a gas processing plant of $24.2 million in 2010 and $30.6 million in
2011.  We acquired the lease in a business combination and recorded a
liability for uneconomic lease terms.  The liability is accreted to
rent expense in the amount of $13.0 million per year over the term of the lease;
however, the cash outflow under the lease remains the same.  The
amounts in the ONEOK Partners table above exclude intercompany payments relating
to the lease of a gas processing plant.

Investment in Northern Border
Pipeline

- In 2009, ONEOK Partners made equity contributions of
$42.3 million to Northern Border.  ONEOK Partners does not anticipate
any material equity contributions in 2010.

Overland Pass Pipeline Company

- - Overland Pass Pipeline Company is a joint venture between ONEOK Partners and a
subsidiary of The Williams Companies, Inc. (Williams).  A subsidiary
of ONEOK Partners owns 99 percent of the joint venture and operates the
pipeline.  On or before November 17, 2010, Williams has the option to
increase its ownership in Overland Pass Pipeline Company up to a total of 50
percent, with the purchase price being determined in accordance with the joint
venture’s operating agreement.  If Williams exercises its option to
increase its ownership to 50 percent, Williams would have the option to become
operator.  Should Williams exercise its option to obtain a 50 percent
ownership interest, ONEOK Partners may be required to deconsolidate Overland
Pass Pipeline Company and account for it under the equity method
accounting.

Environmental Liabilities

- We
are subject to multiple environmental, historical and wildlife preservation laws
and regulations affecting many aspects of our present and future
operations.  Regulated activities include those involving air
emissions, stormwater and wastewater discharges, handling and disposal of solid
and hazardous wastes, hazardous materials

-104
- -


transportation,
and pipeline and facility construction.  These laws and regulations
require us to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental clearances,
registrations, licenses, permits and other approvals.  Failure to
comply with these laws, regulations, permits and licenses may expose us to
fines, penalties and/or interruptions in our operations that could be material
to our results of operations.  If a leak or spill of hazardous
substances or petroleum products occurs from lines or facilities that we own,
operate or otherwise use, we could be held jointly and severally liable for all
resulting liabilities, including response, investigation and clean-up costs,
which could materially affect our results of operations and cash
flows.  In addition, emission controls required under the federal
Clean Air Act and other similar federal and state laws could require unexpected
capital expenditures at our facilities.  We cannot assure that
existing environmental regulations will not be revised or that new regulations
will not be adopted or become applicable to us.  Revised or additional
regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating
restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

We own or
retain legal responsibility for the environmental conditions at 12 former
manufactured gas sites in Kansas.  These sites contain potentially
harmful materials that are subject to control or remediation under various
environmental laws and regulations.  A consent agreement with the KDHE
presently governs all work at these sites.  The terms of the consent
agreement allow us to investigate these sites and set remediation activities
based upon the results of the investigations and risk
analysis.  Remediation typically involves the management of
contaminated soils and may involve removal of structures and monitoring and/or
remediation of groundwater.

Of the 12
sites, we have begun soil remediation on 11 sites.  Regulatory closure
has been achieved at two locations, and we have completed or are near completion
of soil remediation at nine sites.  We have begun site assessment at
the remaining site where no active remediation has occurred.

Our
expenditures for environmental evaluation, mitigation, remediation and
compliance to date have not been significant in relation to our financial
position or results of operations, and our expenditures related to environmental
matters had no material effects upon earnings or cash flows during 2009, 2008 or
2007.

In
addition, the EPA has issued a proposed rule on air-quality standards, “National
Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Reciprocating Internal
Combustion Engines,” also known as RICE NESHAP, scheduled to be adopted in early
2013.  The proposed rule will require capital expenditures over the
next three years for the purchase and installation of new emissions-control
equipment.  We do not expect these expenditures to have a material impact
on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

Legal Proceedings

- We are a
party to various litigation matters and claims that have arisen in the normal
course of our operations.  While the results of litigation and claims
cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe the final outcome of such matters
will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of
operations, financial position or liquidity.

At
December 31, 2009, ONEOK Partners had approximately $2.6 million of tax benefits
available related to net operating loss carryforwards, which will expire between
the years 2022 and 2028.  We believe that it is more likely than not
that the tax benefits of the net operating loss carryforwards will be utilized
prior to their expiration; therefore, no valuation allowance is
necessary.

We had
income taxes receivable of approximately $94.6 million and $69.9 million at
December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

N.           SEGMENTS

Segment Descriptions

- Our
operations are divided into three reportable business segments based on
similarities in economic characteristics, products and services, types of
customers, methods of distribution and regulatory environment.  These
segments are as follows: (i) our ONEOK Partners segment gathers, processes,
transports, stores and sells natural gas and gathers, treats, fractionates,
stores, distributes and markets NGLs; (ii) our Distribution segment delivers
natural gas to residential, commercial and industrial customers, and transports
natural gas; and (iii) our Energy Services segment markets natural gas to
wholesale and retail customers.  Our Distribution segment is comprised
of regulated public utilities, and portions of our ONEOK Partners segment are
also regulated.  Other and eliminations consists of the operating and
leasing

-106
- -


operations
of our headquarters building and related parking facility and other amounts
needed to reconcile our reportable segments to our consolidated financial
statements.

Accounting Policies

- The
accounting policies of the segments are described in Note
A.  Intersegment sales are recorded on the same basis as sales to
unaffiliated customers and are discussed further at Note R.  Net
margin is comprised of total revenues less cost of sales and
fuel.  Cost of sales and fuel includes commodity purchases, fuel, and
storage and transportation costs.

Customers

- The primary
customers for our ONEOK Partners segment include major and independent oil and
gas production companies, natural gas gathering and processing companies,
petrochemical, refining and NGL marketing companies, LDCs, power generating
companies, natural gas marketing companies, NGL gathering companies and propane
distributors.  Our Distribution segment provides natural gas to
residential, commercial, industrial, wholesale, public authority and
transportation customers.  Our Energy Services segment buys natural
gas from producers and other marketing companies and sells natural gas to LDCs,
municipalities, large industrials, power generators, retail aggregators and
other marketing companies, as well as residential and small
commercial/industrial companies.

In 2009,
2008 and 2007, we had no single external customer from which we received 10
percent or more of our consolidated gross revenues.

O.           STOCK-BASED
COMPENSATION

Equity
Compensation Plan

The
ONEOK, Inc. Equity Compensation Plan provides for the granting of stock-based
compensation, including incentive stock options, non-statutory stock options,
stock bonus awards, restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards,
performance stock awards and performance unit awards to eligible employees and
the granting of stock awards to non-employee directors.  We have
reserved a total of 5.0 million shares of common stock for issuance under the
plan.  In December 2008, we amended the Equity Compensation Plan to
allow for the deferral of awards granted in stock or cash, in accordance with
Internal Revenue Code section 409A requirements.  This deferral option
is applicable for certain awards granted in 2006 and later, and vesting after
2008.

Restricted Stock Incentive
Units

- Restricted stock incentive units may be granted to key employees
with ownership of the common stock underlying the incentive unit vesting over a
period determined by the Executive Compensation Committee (the
Committee).  Awards granted to date vest over a three-year
period.  Awards granted in 2009, 2008 and 2007 entitle the grantee to
receive shares of our common stock.  Restricted stock incentive unit
awards are measured at fair value as if they were vested and issued on the grant
date, reduced by expected dividend payments and adjusted for estimated
forfeitures.

No
dividends are paid on the restricted stock incentive
units.  Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis
over the vesting period of the award.

Performance Unit Awards

-

Performance unit awards
may be granted to key employees.  The shares of our common stock
underlying the performance units vest at the expiration of a period determined
by the Committee if certain performance criteria are met by
us.  Performance units granted to date vest at the expiration of a
three-year period.  Upon vesting, a holder of performance units is
entitled to receive a number of shares of our common stock equal to a percentage
(0 percent to 200 percent) of the performance units granted based on our total
shareholder return over the vesting period, compared with the total shareholder
return of a peer group of other energy companies over the same
period.  Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis
over the period of the award.

If paid,
the performance unit awards granted in 2009, 2008 and 2007 entitle the grantee
to receive the grant in shares of our common stock.  Our 2009, 2008
and 2007 performance unit awards are equity awards with a market-based
condition, which results in the compensation cost for these awards being
recognized over the requisite service period, provided that the requisite
service period is fulfilled, regardless of when, if ever, the market condition
is satisfied.  The fair value of these performance units was estimated
on the grant date based on a Monte Carlo model.

The compensation expense
on these awards will only be adjusted for changes in forfeitures.

Long-Term
Incentive Plan

The
ONEOK, Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan (the LTIP) provides for the granting of
stock awards similar to those described above with respect to the Equity
Compensation Plan.  We have reserved a total of approximately 7.8
million shares of common stock for issuance under the plan.  The
maximum number of shares for which options or other awards may be granted to any
employee during any year is 300,000.

Options

- Stock options may be
granted that are not exercisable until a fixed future date or in
installments.  All outstanding options issued to date have vested and
must be exercised no later than 10 years after grant date.  Options
issued to date become void upon involuntary termination of employment for just
cause or voluntary termination of employment other than
retirement.  In the event of retirement or involuntary termination
other than for just cause, the optionee may exercise the option within a period
determined by the Executive Compensation Committee (the Committee) and stated in
the option.  In the event of death, the option may be exercised by the
personal representative of the optionee within a period to be determined by the
Committee and stated in the option.

Stock
Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors

The
ONEOK, Inc. Stock Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors (the DSCP)
provides for the granting of stock options, stock bonus awards, including
performance unit awards, restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit
awards.  Under the DSCP, these awards may be granted by the Committee
at any time, until grants have been made for all shares authorized under the
DSCP.  We have reserved a total of 700,000 shares of common stock for
issuance under the DSCP.  The

-109
- -


maximum
number of shares of common stock which can be issued to a participant under the
DSCP during any year is 20,000.  No performance unit awards or
restricted stock awards have been made to non-employee directors under the
DSCP.

General

For all
awards outstanding, we used a forfeiture rate ranging from zero percent to 13
percent based on historical forfeitures under our share-based payment
plans.  We use a combination of issuances from treasury stock and
repurchases in the open market to satisfy our share-based payment
obligations.

Compensation
cost expensed for our share-based payment plans described below was $15.1
million, $13.1 million and $12.0 million during 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively, which is net of $9.5 million, $8.3 million and $7.5 million of tax
benefits, respectively.  No compensation cost was capitalized for
2009, 2008 and 2007.

Cash
received from the exercise of awards under all share-based payment arrangements
was $3.3 million, $3.8 million and $7.4 million for 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively.  The actual tax benefit realized for the anticipated tax
deductions of the exercise of share-based payment arrangements totaled $0.9
million, $1.4 million and $4.6 million for 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively.

Employee
Stock Purchase Plan

We have
reserved a total of 4.8 million shares of common stock for issuance under our
ONEOK, Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the ESPP).  Subject to
certain exclusions, all full-time employees are eligible to participate in the
ESPP.  Employees can choose to have up to 10 percent of their annual
base pay withheld to purchase our common stock, subject to terms and limitations
of the plan.  The Committee may allow contributions to be made by
other means, provided that in no event will contributions from all means exceed
10 percent of the employee’s annual base pay.  The purchase price of
the stock is 85 percent of the lower of its grant date or exercise date market
price.  Approximately 53 percent, 52 percent and 59 percent of
employees participated in the plan in 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively.  Under the plan, we sold 321,888 shares at $24.41 in
2009, 297,864 shares at $24.41 per share in 2008, and 217,369 shares at $36.85
per share in 2007.

Employee
Stock Award Program

Under our
Employee Stock Award Program, we issued, for no consideration, to all eligible
employees (all full-time employees and employees on short-term disability) one
share of our common stock when the per-share closing price of our common stock
on the NYSE was for the first time at or above $26 per share, and we have issued
and will continue to issue, for no consideration, one additional share of our
common stock to all eligible employees when the closing price on the NYSE is for
the first time at or above each one dollar increment above $26 per
share.  We have reserved a total of 300,000 shares of common stock for
issuance under this program.

There
were no shares issued to employees under this program in 2009 and
2008.  Shares issued to employees under this program totaled 44,099
for the year ended December 31, 2007.  Compensation expense related to
the Employee Stock Award Plan was $2.2 million in 2007.

Deferred Compensation Plan for
Non-Employee Directors

The
ONEOK, Inc. Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors
provides our directors, who are not our employees, the option to defer all or a
portion of their compensation for their service on our Board of
Directors.  Under the plan, directors may elect either a cash deferral
option or a phantom stock option.  Under the cash deferral option,
directors may defer the receipt of all or a portion of their annual retainer
and/or meeting fees, plus accrued interest.  Under the phantom stock
option, directors may defer all or a portion of their annual retainer and/or
meeting fees and receive such fees on a deferred basis in the form of shares of
common stock under our Long-Term Incentive Plan or Equity Compensation
Plan.  Shares are distributed to non-employee directors at the fair
market value of our common stock at the date of
distribution.

      - Represents 5.9 million common units and approximately 36.5 million Class
      B units, which are convertible, at our option, into common
      units.

In July
2009, ONEOK Partners completed an underwritten public offering of 5,486,690
common units, including the partial exercise by the underwriters of their
over-allotment option, units at $45.81 per common unit, generating net proceeds
of approximately $241.6 million  In conjunction with the public
offering and partial exercise by the underwriters of their over-allotment
option, ONEOK Partners GP contributed an aggregate of $5.1 million to ONEOK
Partners in order to maintain its 2 percent general partner
interest.

In
February 2010, ONEOK Partners completed an underwritten public offering of
5,500,900 common units

,
including the partial exercise by the underwriters of their over-allotment
option,

at $60.75 per common unit, generating net proceeds of
approximately $322.6 million.  In conjunction with the offering, ONEOK
Partners GP contributed $6.8 million in order to maintain its 2 percent general
partner interest.  ONEOK Partners used the proceeds from the sale of common
units and the general partner contribution to repay borrowings under the ONEOK
Partners Credit Agreement and for general partnership purposes.  As a
result of these transactions, we hold a 42.8 percent aggregate equity interest
in ONEOK Partners.

Cash Distributions

- Under the
ONEOK Partners’ partnership agreement, distributions are made to the partners
with respect to each calendar quarter in an amount equal to 100 percent of
available cash.  Available cash generally consists of all cash
receipts adjusted for cash disbursements and net changes to cash
reserves.  Available cash will generally be distributed 98 percent to
limited partners and 2 percent to the general partner.  The general
partner’s percentage interest in quarterly distributions is increased after
certain specified target levels are met.  Under the incentive
distribution provisions, the general partner receives:

·

      percent of amounts distributed in excess of $0.605 per
    unit;

·

      percent of amounts distributed in excess of $0.715 per unit;
      and

·

      percent of amounts distributed in excess of $0.935 per
    unit.

ONEOK
Partners’ income is allocated to the general and limited partners in accordance
with their respective partnership ownership percentages.  The effect
of any incremental income allocations for incentive distributions that are
allocated to the general partner is calculated after the income allocation for
the general partner’s partnership interest and before the income allocation to
the limited partners.

In 2009,
ONEOK Partners paid quarterly distributions to its limited partners of $1.08 per
unit in the first, second and third quarters and a $1.09 per unit in the fourth
quarter.

In
January 2010, a cash distribution from ONEOK Partners of $1.10 per unit
payable in the first quarter was declared.  On February 12, 2010, we
received the related incentive distribution of $23.4 million for the fourth
quarter of 2009, which is included in the table above.

For the
years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, cash distributions paid by ONEOK
Partners to us totaled $278.2 million, $251.7 million and $202.0 million,
respectively.

Relationship

- We consolidate
ONEOK Partners in our consolidated financial statements; however, we are
restricted from the assets and cash flows of ONEOK Partners except for our
distributions.  Distributions are declared quarterly by ONEOK
Partners’ general partner based on the terms of its partnership
agreement.  See Note N for more information on ONEOK Partners
results.

Affiliate Transactions

- We
have certain transactions with our ONEOK Partners affiliate and its
subsidiaries, which comprise our ONEOK Partners segment.

ONEOK
Partners sells natural gas from its natural gas gathering and processing
operations to our Energy Services segment.  In addition, a portion of
ONEOK Partners’ revenues from its natural gas pipelines business is from our
Energy Services and Distribution segments, which utilize ONEOK Partners’ natural
gas transportation and storage services.  ONEOK Partners also
purchases natural gas from our Energy Services segment for its natural gas
liquids operations and its gathering and processing operations.

ONEOK
Partners has certain contractual rights to the Bushton Plant through a
Processing and Services Agreement with us, which sets out the terms for
processing and related services we provide at the Bushton Plant through
2012.  ONEOK Partners has contracted for all of OBPI’s capacity at the
Bushton Plant.  In exchange, ONEOK Partners pays OBPI for all costs
and expenses of the Bushton Plant, including reimbursement of a portion of our
obligations under equipment leases covering the Bushton Plant.

We
provide a variety of services to our affiliates, including cash management and
financial services, administrative services provided by our employees and
management, insurance and office space leased in our headquarters building and
other field locations.  Where costs are specifically incurred on
behalf of an affiliate, the costs are billed directly to the affiliate by
us.  In other situations, the costs may be allocated to the affiliates
through a variety of methods, depending upon the nature of the expenses and the
activities of the affiliates.  For example, a service that applies
equally to all employees is allocated based upon the number of employees in each
affiliate.  However, an expense benefiting the consolidated company
but having no direct basis for allocation is allocated by the modified Distrigas
method, a method using a combination of ratios that include gross plant and
investment, earnings before interest and taxes and payroll
expense.  It is not practicable to determine what these general
overhead costs would be on a stand-alone basis.

.                      CONTROLS
AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We have
established disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by us, including our consolidated entities, in the
reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules
and forms.  Disclosure controls and procedures include, without
limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required
to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange
Act is accumulated and communicated to management.  Under the
supervision and with the participation of senior management, including our Chief
Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) and our Chief Financial Officer
(Principal Financial Officer), we evaluated our disclosure controls and
procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the
Exchange Act.  Based on this evaluation, our Principal Executive
Officer and our Principal Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2009.

Management’s
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule
13a-15(f).  Under the supervision and with the participation of our
management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial
Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control-Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission.  Because of inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness
to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.  Based on our evaluation under
that framework and applicable SEC rules, our management concluded that our
internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31,
2009.

Our
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, has been
audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public
accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein (Item
8).

Changes
in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting

We have
made no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in
Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended
December 31, 2009, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
