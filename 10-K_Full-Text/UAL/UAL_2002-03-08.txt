PART I

ITEM 1.  BUSINESS.

UAL Corporation ("UAL" or
the "Company") was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware
on December 30, 1968.  The world headquarters of the Company are located
at 1200 East Algonquin Road, Elk Grove Township, Illinois 60007. 
The Company's mailing address is P.O. Box 66919, Chicago, Illinois 60666. 
The telephone number for the Company is (847) 700-4000.

The Company is a holding
company and its principal subsidiary is United Air Lines, Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("United"), which is wholly owned.  United accounted for
most of the Company's revenues and expenses in 2001.  United is a
major commercial air transportation company, engaged in the transportation
of persons, property and mail throughout the U.S. and abroad.

Airline Operations

During 2001, United carried,
on average, more than 210,000 passengers per day and flew more than 108
billion revenue passenger miles.  United's network, supplemented with
strategic airline alliances, provides comprehensive transportation service
within its North America segment and to international destinations within
its Pacific, Atlantic, and Latin America segments.  Operating revenues
attributed to United's North America segment were $10.7 billion in 2001,
$13.1 billion in 2000 and $12.5 billion in 1999.  Operating revenues
attributed to United's international segments were $5.4 billion in 2001,
$6.2 billion in 2000 and $5.5 billion in 1999.

North America

.

United operates hubs in Chicago, Denver, Los Angeles, San Francisco and
Washington-Dulles.  United's North America operations accounted for
66.3% of United's revenues in 2001.

Pacific

.

Via its Tokyo hub, United provides passenger service between its U.S. gateway
cities (Chicago, Honolulu, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco and Seattle)
and the Asian cities of Bangkok, Beijing, Hong Kong, Seoul and Singapore. 
United also provides nonstop service between Hong Kong and each of Chicago
and San Francisco; between San Francisco and each of Osaka, Shanghai, Sydney
and Taipei; between Los Angeles and each of Auckland and Sydney; between
Chicago and Beijing; and between Sydney and each of Auckland and Melbourne.

In August 2001, United cancelled
nonstop service between Hong Kong and New York.

The air services agreement
between the U.S. and Japan provides an unlimited number of frequencies
to certain carriers, including United.  United also holds significant
traffic rights from beyond Japan.  These rights and the 2002 opening
of Tokyo's Narita airport's second runway will provide United with the
opportunity to add service from Japan to other Asian points as regulatory,
competitive and economic conditions warrant.

United's Pacific operations
accounted for 16.6% of United's operating revenues in 2001.

Atlantic

.

Washington-Dulles is United's primary gateway to Europe, serving Amsterdam,
Brussels, Dusseldorf, Frankfurt, London, Milan, Munich and Paris. 
Chicago is United's secondary gateway to Europe, with nonstop service to
Frankfurt, London and Paris.  Although United currently offers direct
service between Chicago and Dusseldorf, service will be discontinued and
transitioned to its daily nonstop service between Washington-Dulles and
Dusseldorf.  United also provides nonstop service between London and
each of Boston, Los Angeles, Newark, New York and San Francisco; between
Frankfurt and San Francisco; and between Paris and San Francisco.

In 2001, United's Atlantic
operations accounted for 12.9% of United's operating revenues.

Latin America

.

United's primary gateway to Latin America is Miami, providing service from
Miami to Buenos Aires, Caracas, Montevideo (one-stop), Rio de Janeiro,
Santiago and Sao Paolo.  United also provides service between Mexico
City and each of Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Washington, and San
Jose (Costa Rica); between Los Angeles and each of Guatemala City and San
Salvador; between Chicago and each of Aruba, San Juan, St. Thomas, and
Sao Paolo; between New York and each of Buenos Aires and San Juan; between
Washington and each of San Juan and St. Thomas; and between Guatemala City
and San Jose.  United intends to suspend its direct service between
Chicago and Buenos Aires, effective March 5, 2002.

In 2001, United's Latin America
operations accounted for 4.2% of United's revenues.

September 11

.

On September 11, 2001, two United aircraft were hijacked and destroyed
in terrorist attacks on The World Trade Center in New York City and in
a crash near Johnstown, Pennsylvania.  That same day, two American
Airlines aircraft were also hijacked and destroyed in terrorist attacks
on The World Trade Center and the Pentagon.  Due to the decline in
passenger air travel in the aftermath of the tragic events of September
11,
United reduced its departure schedule by approximately 31% (equates to
a 23% reduction in system-wide available seat miles), and redesigned its
flight schedule to offer more choices to customers during peak times of
day and fewer choices during the off-peak early morning and late evening
hours.  To accomplish this schedule change, United reduced daily utilization
of its aircraft and reduced frequencies in some markets.  United also
ceased operation of its United Shuttle

Ò

, which principally served the West Coast and Denver, as of October 31,
2001.  Some of these markets are now served by United mainline service,
while the rest are now served by United Express.  Additionally, United
Express also replaced United in some underperforming short-haul markets,
and certain underperforming long-haul markets were eliminated.  In
response to the decline in international air travel, United suspended nonstop
service between San Francisco and Seoul; between Hong Kong and each of
Los Angeles and Singapore; between Chicago and Amsterdam; between Denver
and Frankfurt; and between New York and Sao Paolo.  United also suspended
round the world service between Delhi and London and Delhi and Hong Kong.

United continues to monitor
passenger demand and economic performance in all its markets and adjusts
capacity accordingly.

United Cargo

®

.

United Cargo offers both domestic and international shipping through its
Small Package Delivery, T.D. Guaranteed, First Freight, International Freight,
UA 2-Day service, and a door-to-door small package delivery service - United
SameDay.  Freight accounts for most of United Cargo's shipments, with
mail making up the balance.

For the year 2001, United
Cargo generated over $700 million in freight and mail revenue, which represents
a 24% decrease versus 2000, driven mainly by the discontinuation of the
dedicated freighter operation, the softening economy and the impact of
September 11.  Following the events of September 11, traffic gradually
improved, but volumes remained below pre-September 11 levels in part due
to restrictions imposed by the Federal Aviation Administration ("FAA")
on passenger carriers transporting mail over sixteen ounces.

United Cargo opened new warehouse
facilities in Miami and Newark in 2001, and a new facility in Chicago in
January 2002.  United Cargo also opened a new facility in Los Angeles
on February 11, 2002.

United Cargo's premium international
time-definite service, T.D. Guaranteed, was recently expanded to offer
service in United's widebody domestic markets within the U.S.  United
believes this added widebody capacity combined with the stabilization of
United Cargo's recurring customer traffic and revenue initiatives should
lead to a more stable revenue environment in 2002.

In February 2002, United
Cargo introduced United SameDay Plus, which offers door-to-door delivery
of heavy freight.

Fuel

.

Changes in fuel prices are industry-wide occurrences that benefit or harm
United's competitors as well as United.  Fuel-hedging activities may
affect the degree to which fuel-price changes affect individual companies. 
To assure adequate supplies of fuel and to provide a measure of control
over fuel costs, United ships fuel on major pipelines and stores fuel close
to its major hub locations.

United's results of operations
are significantly affected by the price and availability of jet fuel. 
It is estimated that, absent hedging, every $.01 change in the average
annual price-per-gallon of jet fuel causes a change of approximately $28
million in United's annual fuel costs.  United's average price per
gallon of jet fuel in 2001 before taxes and hedges decreased by 8%, as
compared to the previous year.  Most of the decrease can be attributed
to the fourth quarter in which spot U.S. Gulf jet fuel prices experienced
a 41% decrease year-over-year due to the slowing U.S. economy and subsequent
lack of demand for jet fuel.

Insurance

.

United carries liability insurance of a type customary in the air transportation
industry, in amounts which it deems adequate, covering passenger liability,
public liability, property damage liability and physical damage insurance
on United's aircraft and property.  United's aircraft liability insurance
coverage for claims caused by acts of war, terrorism, sabotage, hijacking
and other similar perils was cancelled effective September 26, 2001. 
United was able to obtain replacement coverage on less favorable terms
for claims not involving aircraft passengers.  There can be no assurance,
however, that such insurance will continue to be available.  See "September
11 Terrorist Attacks" in

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations.

Other Government Matters

.

In
time of war or certain other national emergencies, the U.S. government
may require United to provide airlift services under the Civil Reserve
Air Fleet Program.  Should United be required to provide a substantial
amount of such services, its operations could be adversely impacted.

Marketing Strategy

Besides offering convenient
scheduling throughout its domestic and international segments, United seeks
to attract high yield customers and create customer preference by providing
a comprehensive network, an attractive frequent-flyer program and enhanced
product and service offerings.

Alliances

.

United has formed bilateral alliances with other airlines to provide its
customers more choices and to participate worldwide in markets that it
cannot serve directly for commercial or governmental reasons.  An
alliance is a collaborative marketing arrangement between carriers, which
can include joint frequent flyer participation; code-sharing of flight
operations; coordination of reservations, baggage handling, flight schedules;
and other resource sharing activities.  "Code-sharing" is an agreement
under which a carrier's flights can be marketed under the two-letter airline
designator code of another carrier.  Through an alliance, carriers
can provide their customers a seamless global travel network under their
own airline code.  United now participates in a multilateral alliance,
Star Alliance

Ô

.

Star Alliance is a global
integrated airline network, whose mission is to deliver a smooth travel
experience and offer rewards and recognition to passengers traveling across
its global network.  Collectively, based on first quarter 2002 scheduling,
Star Alliance carriers serve more than 727 destinations in over 127 countries
with 11,033 daily flights.  This puts Star Alliance ahead of the closest
competition, oneworld, with 550 destinations.  Star Alliance enables
its member carriers to more effectively compete with other worldwide alliances.
Founded in 1997, Star Alliance has grown to 15 carriers.  Besides
United, Star Alliance includes:  Air Canada, Air New Zealand, All
Nippon Airways, Ansett Australia, Austrian Airlines, bmi british midland,
Lauda Air, Lufthansa, Mexicana, SAS, Singapore Airways, Thai International
Airways, Tyrolean and Varig.  United currently holds bilateral immunity
with Air Canada and integrated antitrust immunity with Lufthansa, SAS,
and the Austrian Airlines Group.  United is currently pursuing the
addition of bmi british midland to its existing antitrust immunity with
Lufthansa, SAS and Austrian Airlines Group.

Ansett Australia ceased operations
in September 2001.  In March 2002, the Management Conference Board
of the Star Alliance recommended to the Chief Executives Board of the Star
Alliance to remove Ansett Australia from the Alliance.  The Chief
Executives Board is expected to act on the recommendation by mid-March
2002.

United has also formed independent
alliances with other air carriers.  Currently, United has agreements
with Aloha, BWIA West Indies Airways, Continental Connection (operated
by Gulfstream), Emirates, Saudi Arabian Airlines and Spanair Airlines. 
United continually evaluates the need for relationships with these and
other carriers and from time to time will change its alliance partners
as conditions warrant.

In addition, United has a
marketing program in North America known as United Express

®

,
under which independent regional carriers, utilizing turboprop equipment
and regional jets, feed United's major airports and international gateways. 
The carriers in the United Express program serve small and medium-sized
cities in the U.S., linking those cities to United's hubs.  United
Express carriers include Air Wisconsin Airlines, Atlantic Coast Airlines
and Sky West Airlines.

United also has a code-share
agreement with Great Lakes Aviation, a regional carrier.

UAL Loyalty Services,
Inc

.

In December 2001, UAL renamed United New Ventures, Inc.,
its wholly owned subsidiary, as UAL Loyalty Services, Inc. ("ULS"). 
ULS focuses on expanding the profitable, non-core marketing businesses
of UAL and building customer loyalty for United.  ULS operates in
four areas:  loyalty programs, travel distribution, direct-to-consumer
services and media assets.

ULS operates substantially
all United-branded travel distribution and customer loyalty e-commerce
activities, such as united.com.  It also owns and manages all of UAL's
interests in various e-commerce enterprises, such as Orbitz and Hotwire
(see Note 6 "Investments" in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

). 
In addition, as of January 1, 2002, ULS operates United's Mileage Plus
frequent flyer program; United Vacations, United's leisure vacation product;
Silver Wings Plus, a discounted travel program for individuals 55 and older;
Cruise4Miles, a program offering Mileage Plus miles for purchases of cruises;
and the Premier Group, a business-meeting planner.  In the first quarter
of 2002, the Company intends to complete the transfer of ownership of these
assets to ULS.

Although ULS is responsible
for member relationships, communications, and account management of Mileage
Plus, United continues to be responsible for the elite frequent flyer aspects
of the program, including the Premier, Premier Executive and Premier Executive
1K programs.  United also retains responsibility for managing the
relationship with Mileage Plus' airline partners.  Mileage Plus' relationships
with non-airline business partners are the sole responsibility of ULS.

In July 2001, ULS completed
a tender offer for all of the outstanding stock of MyPoints.com, which
is now a wholly owned subsidiary of ULS.  MyPoints operates an on-line
loyalty program under which registered consumers earn points by purchasing
goods or services through the MyPoints.com web site from participating
vendors.  The consumer can then redeem the points through the web
site for goods or services of participating vendors.  See Note 7 "Acquisitions"
in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

.

Mileage Plus

.

Mileage Plus was created to develop and retain passenger loyalty by offering
awards and services to frequent travelers.  Over 40 million members
have enrolled in Mileage Plus since it was started in 1981.  Mileage
Plus members earn mileage credit for flights on United, United Express,
the Star Alliance carriers and certain other airlines that participate
in the program.  Miles can also be earned by utilizing the goods and
services of non-airline program participants, such as hotels, car rental
companies, bank credit card issuers and a variety of other businesses. 
Mileage credits can be redeemed for free, discounted or upgrade travel
and non-travel awards.

Travel awards can be redeemed
at the "Standard" or "Saver" level for any unsold seat on any United flight
to every destination served by United.  Redemption at the "Saver"
award level, however, is restricted with capacity controlled inventory,
thereby limiting the use of Saver awards on certain flights.

When a travel award level
is attained, a liability is recorded for the incremental costs of providing
travel, based on expected redemptions.  United's incremental costs
include the additional costs of providing service to the award recipient,
such as fuel, meal, personnel and ticketing costs, for what would otherwise
be a vacant seat.  The incremental costs do not include any contribution
to overhead or profit.  For mileage sold to other program participants
prior to January 1, 2000, revenue was recognized when the miles were sold. 
As of January 1, 2000, a portion of revenue from the sale of mileage is
deferred and recognized when the transportation is provided.  See
Note 1(b) "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Change in Accounting
Principles" in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

.

At December 31, 2001, the
estimated number of outstanding awards was approximately 11.1 million,
as compared with 10.8 million at the end of the prior year.  United
estimates that 9.1 million of these awards will ultimately be redeemed
and, accordingly, has recorded a liability amounting to $644 million, which
includes the deferred revenue from the sale of miles to program participants. 
Based on historical data, the difference between the awards expected to
be redeemed and the total awards outstanding arises because: (1) some awards
will never be redeemed, (2) some will be redeemed for non-travel benefits,
and (3) some will be redeemed on partner carriers.

In 2001, 2.0 million Mileage
Plus travel awards were used on United.  This number represents the
number of awards for which travel was actually provided in 2001 and not
the number of seats that were allocated to award travel.  In 2000,
2.0 million awards were used, while 2.2 million awards were used in 1999. 
These awards represented 7.1% of United's total revenue passenger miles
in 2001, 7.2% in 2000, and 8.7% in 1999.  Passenger preference for
Saver awards, which have inventory controls, keeps displacement of revenue
passengers at a minimum.  Travel award seats flown on United represent
70% of the total awards issued, of which 78% are used for travel within
the U.S. and Canada.  In addition to the awards issued for travel
on United, approximately 13% of the total awards issued are used for travel
on partner airlines.

Economy Plus

®

.

During 2001, United began reconfiguring its fleet of three-cabin international
aircraft to create Economy Plus seating, which is a reconfiguration of
the first six to eleven rows of the United Economy cabins on aircraft serving
the North America market.  This reconfigured area provides four to
five additional inches of legroom for United's Premier

®

frequent-flyers and full-fare United Economy customers, many of whom often
travel in the United Economy cabin.  United became the first U.S.
airline to offer premium seating in the front of its economy cabin on both
its North America and international flights.  As part of this international
reconfiguration program, United also is enhancing United Business class
to offer customers an additional seven inches of legroom.

Distribution Channels

.

The overwhelming majority of United's airline inventory continues to be
distributed through the traditional channels of travel agencies and global
distribution systems ("GDS").  On October 1, 2001, United completed
the sale of its approximately 18% equity interest in Galileo International
to Cendant Corporation.  The completion of this transaction relieves
United of GDS participation obligations mandated by the Department of Transportation. 
This allows United the flexibility to select the GDS systems in which it
wishes to participate as well as to determine the level of participation
in each system.  United uses the Apollo reservation system, which
is hosted by Galileo International.  The hosting agreement with Galileo
continues through 2004.

Avolar

.

On
May 17, 2001, UAL formed United Biz Jet Holdings, Inc. (d/b/a "Avolar"),
a new business jet subsidiary consisting of Biz Jet Fractional, Inc., Biz
Jet Charter, Inc. and Biz Jet Services, Inc.  Avolar operates and
sells fractional ownership interests in premium business aircraft and provides
charter services, fleet management services and a domestic and international
shuttle product.

In May 2001, UAL's Board
of Directors authorized the investment of up to $250 million in Avolar. 
Following the events of September 11, UAL decided to investigate options
to reduce its future funding obligations, including a possible sale of
a majority of Avolar to third-party investors.  Avolar is now pursuing
a new business plan to enable it to realize its value without additional
investment from UAL or the involvement of private equity investors. 
In connection with this action, UAL intends to discontinue its financial
commitment to Avolar effective March 31.

Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

.

Industry Conditions

Operating Environment

.

The air travel business is subject to seasonal fluctuations.  United's
operations are often adversely impacted by winter weather and United's
first- and fourth-quarter results normally reflect reduced travel demand. 
Operating results are usually better in the second and third quarters. 
The events of September 11 distorted the normal seasonal relationships
in 2001 and may also distort the relationships in 2002.

Competition

.

The
airline industry is highly competitive.  In domestic markets, new
and existing carriers are free to initiate service on any route. 
United's domestic competitors include all of the other major U.S. airlines
as well as regional carriers, most of which have lower cost structures
than United.

In its international service,
United competes not only with U.S. carriers but also with foreign carriers,
including national flag carriers, which in some instances enjoy forms of
governmental support not available to U.S. carriers.  United's competition
on specified international routes is subject to varying degrees of governmental
regulations (see "Government Regulation").  United has advantages
over foreign air carriers in the U.S. because of its ability to generate
U.S. origin-destination traffic from its integrated domestic route systems,
and because foreign carriers are prohibited by U.S. law from carrying local
passengers between two points in the U.S.  United experiences comparable
restrictions in foreign countries.

In addition, U.S. carriers
are often constrained from carrying passengers to points beyond designated
international gateway cities due to limitations in air service agreements
or restrictions imposed unilaterally by foreign governments.  To compensate
for these structural limitations, U.S. and foreign carriers have entered
into alliances and marketing arrangements that allow the carriers to provide
traffic feed to each other's flights.  See "Marketing Strategy - Alliances."

Government Regulation

General

.

All
carriers engaged in air transportation in the U.S. are subject to regulation
by the U.S. Department of Transportation ("DOT").  The DOT has authority
to: issue certificates of public convenience and necessity for domestic
air transportation and, through the FAA, air-carrier operating certificates
and operations specifications; authorize the provision of foreign air transportation
by U.S. carriers and prohibit unjust discrimination.   It also
has the authority to: prescribe forms of accounts and require reports from
air carriers; regulate methods of competition, including the provision
and use of computerized reservation systems; and administer regulations
providing for consumer protection, including regulations governing the
accessibility of air transportation facilities for handicapped individuals. 
United holds certificates of public convenience and necessity, as well
as an air-carrier operating certificate, and therefore is subject to DOT
regulations.  The FAA also administers the U.S. air traffic control
system and oversees aviation safety issues.

United's operations require
licenses issued by the aviation authorities of the foreign countries that
United serves.  These authorities may from time to time impose forms
and degrees of regulation that United does not face in its domestic operations. 
United's ability to serve some countries and its expansion into certain
countries is restricted by the absence of aviation agreements between the
U.S. and the relevant governments or by the restrictive terms of existing
agreements.  In connection with its international services, United
is required to make regular filings with the DOT and in some cases to observe
rules establishing the tariffs charged and service provided.  In some
cases, fares and schedules also require the approval of the relevant foreign
governments.

Shifts in U.S. or foreign
government aviation policies can lead to the alteration or termination
of existing air service agreements between the U.S. and other countries. 
These shifts could diminish the value of United's international route authority
because changes in these agreements could curtail or terminate United's
international rights in the associated markets.

Airport and Airspace
Access

.

In the immediate aftermath of the September 11 terrorist
attacks, the FAA shut down U.S. airspace for three days, and United was
only able to operate a portion of its scheduled flights for several days
thereafter.  The shut down of airspace over Washington D.C. lasted
significantly longer and the federal government continues to restrict flights
to and from Ronald Reagan National Airport ("National").  The number
of flights United (and other carriers) is allowed to operate out of National
remains below pre-September 11 levels, and flights that are operated are
subject to stringent security measures.  The U.S. Secretary of Transportation
announced a plan in late February to restore the number of flights allowed
at National to pre-September 11 levels.  However, that plan will undergo
scrutiny by national security agencies before moving forward.

Plans for Chicago O'Hare
expansion continue to be an issue of political and legislative debate. 
A late 2001 political compromise makes expansion more likely in the future
and diminishes the chances of flight caps, since capacity constraints at
O'Hare would be eased by the expansion and reconfiguration of runways and
other facilities.  Slot controls, or limits on hourly take-off and
landings, are scheduled to be completely phased out by July 1, 2002 under
the provisions of legislation passed in 2000.

Safety

.

The FAA has regulatory jurisdiction over flight operations generally, including
equipment, ground facilities, maintenance, communications and other matters. 
United's aircraft and engines are maintained in accordance with the standards
and procedures recommended and approved by the manufacturers and the FAA.

From time to time, the FAA
issues airworthiness directives ("ADs") that require air carriers to undertake
inspections and to make modifications and improvements on aircraft, engines
and related components and parts.  The ADs sometimes cause United
to incur substantial, unplanned expense in parts and labor as well as in
aircraft out-of-service time when aircraft or engines are removed from
service prematurely in order to undergo mandated inspections or modifications. 
The issuance of any particular AD may have a greater or lesser impact on
United, compared to its competitors, depending upon the equipment covered
by the directive.  Civil and criminal sanctions may be assessed for
not complying with ADs.

The Air Transport Association
("ATA"), an industry organization to which United belongs, and the Department
of Defense ("DoD") have signed a memorandum of understanding establishing
procedures for auditing international code-share partners that carry DoD
personnel.  Based on the DOT/FAA Safety Program Guidelines issued
to all U.S. carriers, United has also established a safety review plan
for Star Alliance and code-share airlines.  Audits are conducted on
both prospective and existing code-share partners.  The FAA reviews
audit reports and makes code-share approval recommendations to the DOT.

Legislation

.

The Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act of 2001 (the
"Act") made $5 billion in federal grants and $10 billion in loan guarantees
available to the airline industry.  The legislation also provides
relief from increased insurance premiums, caps potential liability from
the September 11 terrorist attacks, limits liability for any future terrorist
events and creates a federal compensation fund for attack victims. 
United has received $652 million in grants thus far and may receive additional
funds under the grant portion of the Act.  Although United could also
access loan guarantees under the Act after fulfilling requirements of that
program, the Company would prefer to reach financial stability without
using the guaranteed loan from the government.

Separate legislation enacted
in November 2001, the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (the "Aviation
Act"), will have wide-ranging effects on United's operations.  The
Aviation Act makes the federal government responsible for virtually all
aspects of security that United has traditionally provided.  The Aviation
Act creates a new Transportation Security Agency ("TSA") which assumed
oversight of all aspects of aviation security, effective February 17, 2002. 
Notably, the Aviation Act requires that the security screener workforce
be composed entirely of federal employees by November 2002.  The TSA
has assumed carriers' contracts with screening vendors during the transition
period.  The Aviation Act also requires carriers to charge passengers
enplaning in the U.S. a security fee of $2.50 per enplanement, capped at
$5.00 per round trip and to remit that fee to the DOT.  The DOT is
authorized to assess an additional fee, equal to the amount paid by carriers
for security screening in the year 2000, directly on air carriers to compensate
for the costs of screening activities and property.  The Aviation
Act mandates numerous additional security measures, including mandating
that all checked baggage be screened by explosive detection systems by
December 31, 2002.  Interim measures to screen all checked baggage
for explosives were implemented on January 19, 2002.

International Rights

.

In late January 2002, the U.K. government withdrew from negotiations with
the U.S. government to reach agreement on an "open skies" aviation treaty. 
Adoption of an "open skies" agreement would have significantly changed
the competitive dynamic in the large U.S. and U.K. aviation market.

United and other international
slot holders benefited starting in late 2001 from a short-term waiver of
an international rule that ordinarily requires a carrier to forfeit any
slot that it uses less than 80% of the time in any season.  Separately,
the DOT waived through March 31, 2002 its requirement that U.S. carriers
in limited-entry international markets return to the DOT frequencies in
those markets that they do not use for more than 90 days.

The Commission of the European
Union ("EU") continues its attempts to modify the existing regulation that
governs slot allocation at EU airports.  The most recent proposal,
if accepted, would reinforce the bias in favor of EU airlines and would
dramatically alter the manner in which EU slots are held and allocated. 
The proposed changes threaten to redefine the issue of slot ownership and
impede the selling and trading of slots.

The EU continues its review
of the United/Lufthansa/SAS alliance in order to issue an exemption from
EU competition law.  It formally rejected a carrier-proposed compromise
and has sought additional minor concessions.  Approval may be delayed
until the European Court of Justice issues a ruling on the EU's pending
court case against several EU Member States for their aviation treaties
with the U.S.  The ruling will also pave the way for the EU to negotiate
aviation treaties on behalf of EU Member States with other non-EU countries.

Privacy Laws

.

An initiative of significant impact within the EU and elsewhere is the
introduction of privacy standards that apply to companies transmitting
private information from the EU to countries abroad.  To comply with
the privacy directives, the U.S. Commerce Department and the EU have agreed
to safe harbor principles.  Although the safe harbor principles are
voluntary at this point, United plans to comply with them.  The U.S.
Commerce Department and the EU continue to review the status of voluntary
compliance.

Canada, Argentina and Australia
have enacted new privacy laws covering the collection and disclosure of
personally identifiable information.  These laws may have an impact
on the way United collects and transmits personal identifiable information
in these jurisdictions.

Environmental Regulations

.

United operates a number of underground and above-ground storage tanks
throughout its system, which are used for the storage of fuels and deicing
fluids.  United has been identified as a Potentially Responsible Party
in some state and federal recovery actions involving soil and ground water
contamination.  Management believes, after considering a number of
factors, including (but not limited to) the views of legal counsel, the
nature of such contingencies and prior experience, that the ultimate disposition
of these contingencies is not likely to materially affect UAL's financial
condition, operating results or liquidity.

Employees - Labor Matters

As of December 31, 2001,
the Company and its subsidiaries had more than 84,000 employees, of which
approximately 80% are represented by various labor organizations. 
This number represents a significant reduction from the end of the previous
year, when the Company and its subsidiaries had approximately 102,000 employees. 
This reduction was a direct response to the adverse impact on air travel
resulting from the September 11 terrorist attacks and United furloughed
approximately 20,000 employees in the last quarter of 2001.  Since
that time, however, due to slightly increased customer demand, and an increase
to the April 2002 schedule, United plans to recall 1,200 flight attendants
to active status on April 1, 2002 and to furlough fewer pilots than previously
planned.

The employee groups, number
of employees, labor organization and current contract status for each of
United's major collective bargaining groups in the U.S., as of December
31, 2001 were as follows:


The collective bargaining
agreement between the Company and the AFA provides for mid-term wage adjustments.

Collective bargaining agreements
are negotiated under the Railway Labor Act, which governs labor relations
in the transportation industry, and typically do not contain an expiration
date.  Instead, they specify a date called the amendable date, by
which either party may notify the other of its desire to amend the agreement. 
Upon reaching the amendable date, the contract is considered "open for
amendment."  Prior to the amendable date, neither party is required
to agree to modifications to the bargaining agreement.  Nevertheless,
nothing prevents the parties from agreeing to start negotiations or to
modify the agreement in advance of the amendable date.

Contracts remain in effect
while new agreements are negotiated.  During the negotiating period,
both the Company and the negotiating union are required to maintain the
status quo.

On July 12, 2000, the Company's
contracts with the IAM became amendable.  The Company has been in
negotiations with both IAM District 141M (representing mechanics) and 141
(representing public contact, ramp & stores, food services, and securityemployees)
since December 1999 for new contracts.  Since September 2000, the
negotiations have been conducted with the assistance of the National Mediation
Board ("NMB").  Under the terms of the Railway Labor Act, United's
current agreements with the IAM remain in effect as negotiations continue.

On November 19, 2001, the
NMB released both parties in the mechanics negotiations from mediation
and offered both sides binding arbitration, which was accepted by United
but declined by the IAM, effectively beginning a 30-day "cooling-off period,"
which could have resulted in a strike in December.  Instead, on December
20, 2001, President Bush appointed a Presidential Emergency Board ("PEB")
as permitted by the Railway Labor Act.  The PEB was to study the issues
between the parties and recommend a solution.  The PEB also postponed
a possible strike for 60 days.  On January 20, 2002, the PEB presented
its recommendations to the Company and the IAM which included immediate
pay increases for United's mechanics, as well as payment of retroactive
wages to July 12, 2000.  United accepted the recommendations of the
PEB and the IAM submitted them to its membership for ratification. 
However, on February 12, the mechanics rejected the proposed recommendations
and authorized a strike.  United and the IAM reconvened negotiations
and reached a tentative agreement on February 18, 2002.  On March
5, 2002, the IAM ratified this tentative agreement, which contains improvements
over the PEB-recommended proposal, including payment of retroactive wages
in eight equal quarterly installments, including 6% interest, commencing
December 2002.  The new contract will not become amendable until July
12, 2005.

Mediated negotiations with IAM District 141 are continuing.

As part of the Company's
financial recovery plan, the Company is also working with the unions and
other employee groups to find further labor savings.

Corporate Governance and the ESOPs

Background

.

In July 1994, the stockholders of UAL approved a plan of recapitalization
that provided an approximately 55% equity and voting interest in UAL to
certain employees of United, in exchange for wage concessions and work-rule
changes.  The employees' equity interest was allocated to individual
employee accounts through the year 2000 under the Employee Stock Ownership
Plans ("ESOPs") created as part of the recapitalization.  The entire
ESOP voting interest is voted by the ESOP trustee at the direction of,
and on behalf of, the employees participating in the ESOPs.

As part of the recapitalization,
the Company's stockholders approved an elaborate governance structure,
which is contained principally in the Company's Restated Certificate of
Incorporation ("UAL Charter") and the ESOPs.  Among other matters,
the UAL Charter provides that the Company's Board of Directors is to consist
of five public directors, four independent directors and three employee
directors that are appointed by different classes of stockholders. 
See the Company's Proxy Statement for its Annual Meeting of Stockholders
for information concerning the processes for electing the directors and
for Board committee requirements.  A number of special stockholder
and Board voting requirements were also established, as summarized below.

For further background information
and a description of the ESOP preferred stocks, see Note 3 "Employee Stock
Ownership Plans and Recapitalization" and Note 15 "ESOP Preferred Stock"
in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

.

Special Voting

.

In specified circumstances ("Extraordinary Matters"), actions by UAL or
United require approval of either (a) 75% of the entire Board, including
at least one union director, or (b) 75% of the voting stock present at
a stockholder meeting.  "Extraordinary Matters" include specified
business transactions outside the ordinary course of business, significant
asset dispositions and most issuances of equity securities.  Most
issuances of equity securities are also subject to a first refusal agreement
in favor of employees participating in the ESOPs.

Other special voting requirements
apply to amendments to the UAL Charter and specified bylaws, repurchases
of common stock, stock sales to employee benefit plans, and business transactions
with labor.  The special voting rights referred to in the previous
paragraph will continue until "Sunset" (defined below), at which time the
corporate governance section will convert to a more traditional form, providing
for nine public directors and three employee directors.

In the case of a merger or
Control Transaction (defined below) that involves an Uninstructed Trustee
Action (defined below), any required stockholder approval must also include
at least a majority of the votes represented by all outstanding shares
of the Director Preferred Stocks (defined below), UAL common stock and
such other classes and series of stock that vote together with the common
stock as a single class ("Single Class Voting").

"

Sunset

."

The Voting Preferred Stock outstanding at any time commands voting power
for approximately 55% of the vote of all classes of capital stock in all
matters requiring a stockholder vote, other than the election of members
of the Board of Directors.  The Voting Preferred Stock will generally
continue to represent approximately 55% of the aggregate voting power until
Sunset, even though the common stock issuable upon conversion of the ESOP
stock may represent more or less than 55% of the fully diluted common stock
of UAL.  Sunset will occur when the common shares issuable upon conversion
of Class 1 and Class 2 ESOP convertible preferred stock, plus any common
equity (generally common stock issued or issuable at the time of the recapitalization)
held by any other Company sponsored employee benefit plan, plus any available
unissued ESOP shares held in the ESOPs, equal, in the aggregate, less than
20% of the common equity and available unissued ESOP shares of UAL. 
For purposes of measuring the Sunset, employee ownership was approximately
64.06% at December 31, 2001.

Control Transactions

.

A "Control Transaction" is a tender or exchange offer, or other opportunity
to dispose of or convert at least 3% of UAL common stock, Class 1 and Class
2 ESOP convertible preferred stock into common stock, and Voting Preferred
Stock, or any transaction or series of related transactions in which any
person or group acquires or seeks to acquire control of UAL or of all or
substantially all of the assets of UAL and its subsidiaries.  In a
Control Transaction, ESOP participants are entitled to instruct the ESOP
trustee as to whether to tender, sell, convert or otherwise dispose of
shares allocated to their accounts under the ESOP.  Shares held by
the Supplemental ESOP will be tendered or directed by the Supplemental
ESOP Committee.

If a Control Transaction
results in the sale or exchange of any shares held by the ESOPs, the proceeds
will be used to acquire, to the extent possible, shares of common stock
(or preferred stock that is convertible into common stock) that qualify
as "employer securities" as defined in Internal Revenue Code Section 409(l). 
If UAL shares do not qualify as "employer securities," then the shares
must be "employer securities" of a public company having a Moody's senior
long-term debt rating at least as good as that of UAL and United at that
time.  If these securities cannot be acquired, then UAL, ALPA and
the IAM will make appropriate arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the
unions to protect the interests of the participants.

Uninstructed Trustee
Actions

.

An uninstructed trustee action refers to situations
in which the ESOP trustee adopts a course of action without obtaining instructions
from the ESOP participants, or disregards their instructions, including
situations involving Control Transactions.  Under specific circumstances,
this action can cause the Voting Preferred Stocks to be converted into
UAL common stock, with the special voting rights of these shares transferring
to the Director Preferred Stocks (defined as Class Pilot MEC, IAM, and
SAM junior preferred stock) in the following approximate percentages: to
the holder of the Class Pilot MEC Preferred Stock, 46.23%; to the holder
of the Class IAM Preferred Stock, 37.13%; and to the holders of the Class
SAM Preferred Stock, 16.64%.  The Director Preferred Stocks will continue
to hold the Single Class Voting Rights until Sunset, or if Sunset occurs
because of, or within one year of, an uninstructed trustee action, July
12, 2010.

Specific circumstances that
give rise to a transfer of voting rights include:

(1) The ESOP trustee fails to solicit timely instructions or fails to act
in accordance with these instructions (see below for reasons),with respect
to the following:

(a) But for the transfer of voting rights, a stockholders vote would have
been sufficient to approve a merger or Control Transaction

involving UAL or United, or if no vote is required, the ESOP trustee enters
into a binding commitment in connection with a

Control Transaction; or

(b) the ESOP trustee disposes
of 10% or more of the common equity represented by the Class 1 and Class
2 ESOP Preferred

Stock (other than in connection with the usual distribution or diversification
under the ESOP).

(2)
In addition, one of the following circumstances must be present:

(a) the transaction would not have been approved if the trustee had solicited
and/or followed the instructions;

(b) no timely solicitation of instructions occurs, and the matter would
not have been approved had the ESOP trustee cast all its votes

against the matter; or

(c) the matter does not require a stockholder vote to approve the transaction.

An ESOP trustee's disregard
of instructions gives rise to an uninstructed trustee action only when
the failure to follow the instructions is attributable to (1) the trustee's
conclusion that its fiduciary responsibilities require the trustee to not
follow the instructions or (2) the ESOP provisions relating to soliciting
are unenforceable.

This section is intended
as a general summary and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the
UAL Charter, the Stockholders' Agreements, the First Refusal Agreement,
the ESOPs and the other exhibits to this Form 10-K.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES.

Flight Equipment

As of December 31, 2001,
United's operating aircraft fleet totaled 543 jet aircraft, of which 243
were owned and 300 were leased.  All of United's operating aircraft
fleet are in active use.  These aircraft are listed below:


United's aircraft
leases have initial terms of 10 to 26 years, and expiration dates range
from 2002 through 2020.  Under the terms of all leases, United has
the right to purchase the aircraft at the end of the lease term, in some
cases at fair market value and in others at fair market value or a percentage
of cost.

As of December 31, 2001,
127 of the 243 aircraft owned by United were encumbered under debt agreements. 
For additional information on accounting for these aircraft see Note 11
"Long-Term Debt" and Note 12 "Lease Obligations" in the

Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements

.

The following table sets
forth United's firm aircraft orders and expected delivery schedules as
of December 31, 2001.

Ground Facilities

United has entered into various
leases relating to its use of airport landing areas, gates, hangar sites,
terminal buildings and other airport facilities in most of the municipalities
it serves.  Major leases expire at Chicago O'Hare in 2018, Los Angeles
in 2021, San Francisco in 2011, and Washington-Dulles in 2014.  United
also has leased ticketing, sales and general office space in the downtown
and outlying areas of most of the larger cities in its system.  In
suburban Chicago, United owns a 106-acre complex consisting of more than
1,000,000 square feet of office space for its world headquarters, a computer
facility and a training center.  In December 2001, United entered
a mortgage on the training center in the amount of $12.3 million to collateralize
surety bonds related to the Company's self-insured workers' compensation
program.

United's Maintenance Operation
Center ("MOC") at San Francisco International Airport occupies 129 acres
of land, 3,000,000 square feet of floor space and 12 aircraft hangar docks
under a lease expiring in 2003, with an option to extend for 10 years. 
United's Indianapolis Maintenance Center, a major aircraft maintenance
and overhaul facility, is operated under a lease with the Indianapolis
Airport Authority that expires in 2031.  The Indianapolis Maintenance
Center occupies 300 acres of land, 1,690,000 square feet of floor space
and 12 aircraft hangar docks.  United also has a major facility at
the Oakland, California airport, dedicated to widebody airframe maintenance. 
The Oakland facility occupies 44 acres of land, 380,000 square feet of
floor space and has 4 aircraft hangar docks.

At Denver International Airport,
United operates under a lease and use agreement expiring in 2025, and occupies
52 gates and more than 1,000,000 square feet of exclusive or preferential
use terminal building space.  United's flight training center, located
in the City and County of Denver, can accommodate 36 flight simulators
and more than 90 computer-based training stations.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

Frank, et al. v. United; EEOC v. United

As previously reported in
our Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2001, a class action lawsuit
against United was filed February 7, 1992 in federal district court in
California, alleging that United's former flight attendant weight program,
in effect from 1989 to 1994, unlawfully discriminated against flight attendants
on the grounds of sex, age and other factors, and seeking monetary relief.
On April 29, 1994, the class was certified as to the sex and age claims.
Following extensive motion practice, on March 10, 1998, the district court
dismissed all the claims against United.  Following an appeal to the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, a three judge panel of the
Ninth Circuit, on June 21, 2000, overturned the ruling.  The court
ruled that the plaintiffs were entitled to judgment as a matter of law
on their claims for discrimination based on sex and that a trial was required
for determination on their claims for age discrimination.  In addition,
the appellate court reversed the dismissal of all individual class representative
claims of discrimination and the case was remanded to the district court
for further proceedings. United's petition for en banc review by an 11-judge
panel was denied on August 11, 2000.  On December 8, 2000, United
petitioned for a review of the Ninth Circuit decision by the U.S. Supreme
Court, but that petition was denied on March 5, 2001.  In accordance
with the appellate court ruling, the case will go back to the district
court for further proceedings with respect to the age discrimination claims
and for a determination of damages with respect to the sex discrimination
claims.  Recently the district court ruled out punitive damages as
a matter of law.

Hall d.b.a. Travel Specialists v. United

Following the reduction by
United (and other carriers) in November 1999 of base commission rates payable
to travel agents from 8% to 5%, a North Carolina travel agent filed a putative
class action lawsuit against United (and other carriers) in state court. 
The carriers removed the lawsuit to federal court in North Carolina. 
Thereafter, the plaintiff voluntarily dismissed and re-filed

the
lawsuit in federal court on June 21, 2000.  The new putative

class
action complaint alleged that United and the other carrier-defendants had
conspired to fix travel agent commissions in violation of the Sherman Act
and sought treble damages and injunctive relief.   The carriers
filed a motion to dismiss this suit, which the court denied.  On July
12, 2001, plaintiff moved to amend its complaint by joining five new travel
agency defendants, the Association of Retail Travel Agents ("ARTA"), and
eight new carrier defendants.  The plaintiff also sought to add claims
relating to the carriers'

reduction of travel agent base

commissions
from 10% to 8% in 1997 and the 1998 imposition of caps on commissions payable
on international air travel.  In November 2001, the court granted
the motion allowing the addition of the new parties and claims.  A
second amended complaint was filed on January 30, 2002 adding a claim related
to the 2001 reduction of domestic air travel commission caps.  Discovery
has commenced and the case is currently set for trial in September 2002.

Litigation Associated with September 11 Terrorism

As of December 31, 2001,
one lawsuit had been served on United in the U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of New York related to the September 11 terrorist attacks. 
That suit, entitled Ellen Mariani v. United Air Lines, Inc., Case Number
01 CIV 11628, is a wrongful death suit filed by the widow of one of the
58 passengers who were aboard United Flight 175 when terrorists hijacked
the aircraft and flew it into The World Trade Center, killing all aboard
and many more on the ground.  The complaint alleges that United breached
its duty of care to the passengers and that breach caused the hijacking
and subsequent death of the late Mr. Louis Mariani.  Under federal
law, liability on such claims will be limited to the amount of United's
insurance coverage.  United anticipates the filing of other lawsuits
related to the September 11 attacks in the future.

.)

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

This section contains various forward-looking statements
within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which
are identified with an asterisk (*).  Forward-looking statements represent
the Company's expectations and beliefs concerning future events, based
on information available to the Company on the date of the filing of this
Form 10K.  The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update
or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information,
future events or otherwise.  Factors that could significantly impact
the expected results referenced in the forward-looking statements are listed
in the last paragraph of the section, "Outlook for 2002."

September 11 Terrorist Attacks

On September 11, 2001, two
United aircraft were hijacked and destroyed in terrorist attacks on The
World Trade Center in New York City and in a crash near Johnstown, Pennsylvania. 
On the same day, two American Airlines aircraft were also hijacked and
used in terrorist attacks on The World Trade Center and the Pentagon. 
In addition to the loss of all passengers and crew on board the aircraft,
these attacks resulted in numerous deaths and injuries to persons on the
ground and massive property damage.  In the immediate aftermath of
the attacks, the FAA ordered all aircraft operating in the U.S. grounded
immediately.  This grounding effectively lasted for three days, and
the Company was able to operate only a portion of its scheduled flights
for several days thereafter.  Passenger traffic and yields on the
Company's flights declined significantly when flights were permitted to
resume, and the Company refunded significant numbers of tickets for the
period from September 11 to September 25.  Since that time, the Company
has experienced significantly reduced revenue and negative cash flows as
compared to its forecasts made prior to September 11, 2001.  Although
domestic and international load factors on the Company's flights are gradually
increasing to levels similar to what it experienced prior to September
11 (although on significantly less capacity), yields remain at unusually
low levels.

In a direct response to the
adverse impact on air travel as a result of the terrorist attacks, United
has reduced its capacity by 23% based on system-wide available seat miles
compared to levels prior to September 11.  This schedule reduction
allowed for the retirement of the entire B727-200 and B737-200 fleets,
effective November 1, 2001.  On September 19, United announced that
it would furlough approximately 20,000 employees.  Additionally, United
has converted six stations to United Express and announced the closing
of
five reservations offices in 2002.  During the fourth quarter 2001,
United restructured its aircraft delivery program with both Boeing and
Airbus Industrie to defer deliveries of new aircraft for 2002 and 2003
from the 67 originally planned to 24 aircraft.  United will only take
delivery of 24 of 49 aircraft scheduled for the year 2002 and none of the
18 aircraft scheduled for 2003.  This action reduced planned capital
spending by 50% for 2002 to $1.2 billion.  The remaining 43 aircraft
have been deferred into 2004 and beyond.  United's future schedule
will vary as the Company reacts to continuing changes in demand and yields,
as well as normal factors such as seasonality and fleet composition.

On September 22, 2001, the
President signed the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization
Act (the "Act").  The Act is intended to compensate victims of the
terrorist attacks as well as air carriers for losses incurred as a result
of such attacks.  Among other things, the Act provides:  (1)
for the payment of an aggregate of $5 billion to air carriers for losses
incurred as a result of the ground stop order issued on September 11 and
incremental losses incurred by air carriers through December 31, 2001 as
a direct result of the terrorist attacks; (2) that the liability of any
air carrier, including United, for all claims arising out of the terrorist
attacks will not be greater than the limits of the liability coverage maintained
by that carrier; (3) for the issuance of loan guarantees of up to an aggregate
of $10 billion in debt of air carriers; (4) for the authority of the Secretary
of Transportation to reimburse air carriers for the increase in insurance
premiums for coverage through October 1, 2002 and, at the discretion of
the Secretary of Transportation, to limit the liability of U.S. air carriers
for acts of terrorism committed during a 180-day period following the date
of the Act; (5) for a compensation program for victims and their relatives;
(6) for an extension of the due date for payment of excise and payroll
taxes by U.S. air carriers; and (7) that communities that had air service
prior to September 11 will continue to receive adequate air service.

The Company anticipates that
its liability from claims arising from the events of September 11, 2001
will be significant, after considering the liability protections provided
for by the Act; however, the Company expects that any amounts paid on such
claims will be borne by its insurance carriers as claims are resolved and,
in any event, the Company believes that, under the Act, its liability will
be limited to the amount of its insurance coverage.

United's war risk liability
insurance for losses resulting from war perils (terrorism, sabotage, hijacking
and other similar perils) was cancelled effective September 26, 2001. 
United obtained replacement coverage, although it is being charged significantly
higher premiums for this replacement coverage, and this new coverage is
in a substantially reduced amount for claims not involving aircraft passengers. 
The FAA is providing excess liability coverage for third party war risk
liability for losses to persons other than passengers up to two times the
airline's limit of liability available prior to September 11, 2001 for
renewable periods up to a year at a time.  United's coverage under
this FAA policy has been renewed through March 20, 2002, and is likely
to be renewed further, subject to the federal government's determination
that such coverage is necessary to the national interest.

In addition, United maintains
hull war risk insurance which is worldwide, excluding certain countries. 
This coverage is for war and associated perils, including hijacking and
confiscation.  United experienced a significantly higher premium for
reduced coverage due to the events of September 11.

As of December 31, 2001,
United had received $652 million in compensation under the Act.  This
amount is recorded as non-operating income in the

Statements of Consolidated
Operations

Results of Operations

Summary of Results -

During early 2001, the weakening
U.S. economy had a significant impact on the airline industry as corporations
reduced their business travel budgets and changed their travel behavior. 
During the first six months of the year, the industry experienced a significant
revenue decline as a result of the decrease in business traffic, which
impacted both unit revenues and yields, particularly in the domestic markets. 
Airline industry domestic unit revenues, as reported to the ATA, declined
by 12% to 13% in each of the months from May through August, respectively. 
United, due to its significant reliance on high-yield business traffic,
was disproportionately affected during this period.

In addition, United's revenues,
yield, revenue passenger miles and available passenger miles were significantly
impacted by the events of September 11 and the resulting reduction in the
Company's operations.  The Company estimates that the September 11
terrorist attacks negatively impacted the Company's revenues by approximately
$1.7 billion.

During 2000, the Company
experienced significant operational disruptions, as a result of labor-related
delays and cancellations, as well as weather and air traffic control limitations,
which adversely affected both revenue and expense performance.  The
Company attempted to mitigate the impact of these operational difficulties
by reducing capacity, particularly in the domestic markets, where most
of the problems were concentrated.  The Company estimated the revenue
shortfall arising from these disruptions and associated schedule reductions
and cancellations to be somewhere between $700 and $750 million for the
year.

UAL's loss from operations
was $(3.8) billion in 2001, compared to operating earnings of $654 million
in 2000.  UAL's net loss for 2001 was $(2.1) billion ($(39.90) per
share) before the cumulative effect of an accounting change, compared to
2000 net earnings before the cumulative effect of an accounting change
and an extraordinary loss on debt of $265 million ($1.89 per share, diluted).

During 2001, United recorded
a special charge of $834 million, net of tax, in operating expense and
$31 million, net of tax, in non-operating expense for amounts relating
to the September 11 terrorist attacks and the resulting impact on the Company's
schedule and operations.  In addition, through December 31, United
has recognized $652 million (pre- tax) in non-operating income as compensation
under the Act.  (See Note 2 "Special Charges Related to the September
11 Terrorist Attacks" in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

.)

Also during 2001, UAL recognized
a special charge of $74 million, net of tax, for costs associated with
a terminated merger with US Airways Group, Inc., including a $50 million
termination fee.  In addition, the Company recorded a gain of $166
million, net of tax, on the sale of certain investments, as further described
in Note 6 "Investments" in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

.

The 2000 earnings include
a special charge of $88 million, net of tax, relating to asset retirements,
losses on leased equipment and write-downs on non-operating equipment,
as well as an impairment loss of $38 million, net of tax, related to the
Company's equity investment in Priceline.com.  In addition, the 2000
earnings include an extraordinary loss of $6 million, net of tax, on early
extinguishment of debt and the cumulative effect of a change in accounting
principle of $209 million, net of tax.

The 1999 earnings include
an extraordinary loss of $3 million, net of tax, on early extinguishment
of debt and a gain of $468 million, net of tax, on the sale of certain
of the Company's investments, as further described in Note 6 "Investments"
in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

.

2001 Compared with 2000 -

Operating Revenues.

Operating
revenues decreased $3.2 billion (17%) and United's revenue per available
seat mile (unit revenue) decreased 11% to 9.76 cents.  Passenger revenues
decreased $3.1 billion (19%) due to an 8% decrease in revenue passenger
miles and an 11% decrease in yield to 11.74 cents.  United's available
seat miles across the system decreased 6% from 2000 which, combined with
the decrease in revenue passenger miles, resulted in a decrease to passenger
load factor of 1.5 points to 70.8%.  The following analysis by market
is based on information reported to the DOT:

Cargo revenues decreased
$227 million (24%) due to a 24% decrease in cargo ton miles largely as
a result of the September 11 terrorist attacks, as well as the discontinuation
of freighter operations in the fourth quarter 2000.  Other operating
revenues grew $157 million (11%) primarily due to a $161 million increase
in fuel sales to third parties.

Operating Expenses.

Operating
expenses decreased $78 million (0.4%) and United's cost per available seat
mile (unit cost) increased 6%, from 10.58 cents to 11.24 cents, excluding
special charges.  Salaries and related costs increased $203 million
(3%) due to routine annual salary increases for non-contract employees,
contractually-driven increases for employees represented by the Air Line
Pilots Association, International ("ALPA") and the estimated costs of contracts
with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers
("IAM"), which were partially offset by the reduction in force implemented
after September 11.  Commissions decreased $315 million (31%) as a
result of a decrease in commissionable revenues and a change to the commission
structure implemented in August 2001, which reduced the cap paid on commissions
issued in the U.S. for domestic travel from $50 for a round-trip ticket
($25 for a one-way ticket) to $20 and $10, respectively.  Aircraft
rent decreased $61 million (7%) as the retirement of older aircraft reduced
the number of aircraft under operating leases.  Landing fees and other
rent increased $50 million (5%) primarily due to increased rates at various
airports.  Depreciation and amortization increased $38 million (4%)
due to an increase in the number of owned aircraft.  Cost of sales
increased $219 million (21%) primarily due to costs associated with fuel
sales to third parties.

Other non-operating expense
amounted to $450 million in 2001 compared to $271 million in 2000, excluding
special charges, gains on sales and the airline stabilization grant. 
Interest expense increased $123 million (31%) as a result of new debt issuances. 
Equity in losses of affiliates increased $11 million (92%) primarily due
to losses recorded for the Company's investment in Orbitz.

2000 Compared with 1999 -

Operating Revenues.

Operating
revenues increased $1.3 billion (7%) and United's revenue per available
seat mile (unit revenue) increased 8% to 11.02 cents.  Passenger revenues
increased $1.1 billion (7%) primarily due to a 6% increase in yield to
13.25 cents.  United's revenue passenger miles increased 1%, while
available seat miles decreased 1%, resulting in a passenger load factor
increase of 1.3 points to 72.3%.  The decrease in available seat miles
reflects the Company's response to the operational difficulties experienced
in 2000 as well as the impact of Economy Plus.  The following analysis
by market is based on information reported to the DOT:

Cargo revenues increased
$25 million (3%) on increased freight ton miles of 3%, as freight yields
remained constant and mail yields increased 1%.  Other operating revenues
increased $152 million (11%) primarily due to increased fuel sales to third
parties and additional revenues from operating agreements with Galileo
International, Inc. ("Galileo"), offset by the decrease in other revenues
related to the change in accounting for Mileage Plus sale of miles to third
parties (see Note 1(b) "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Changes
in Accounting Principles" in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

).

Operating Expenses.

Operating expenses increased $2.1 billion (12%) and United's cost per available
seat mile increased 13% from 9.41 to 10.63 cents.  Salaries and related
costs increased $451 million (7%) due to a new salary program implemented
for non-contract employees, the impact of the new ALPA contract which became
amendable in April 2000 and was ratified in October 2000, and the estimated
costs of IAM contracts which became amendable in July 2000 and were ratified
in March 2002.  This increase was offset by a decrease in ESOP compensation
expense of approximately $600 million due to the end of the ESOP allocation
period.  Aircraft fuel increased $735 million (41%) due to a 40% increase
in the cost of fuel to 81.0 cents per gallon.  Commissions decreased
$114 million (10%) due to a change in the commission structure implemented
in the fourth quarter of 1999.  Purchased services increased $136
million (9%) due to increases in computer reservations fees and credit
card discount fees.  Depreciation and amortization increased $138
million (16%) due to an increase in the number of owned aircraft and losses
on disposition of aircraft and other equipment.  Cost of sales increased
$459 million (76%) primarily due to costs associated with fuel sales to
third parties.

Other Income and Expense

.

Other
non-operating expense amounted to $271 million in 2000 compared to $180
million in 1999, excluding gains on sales and non-operating special charges. 
Interest expense increased $40 million (11%) due to increased debt issuances
in 2000.  Interest income increased $33 million (49%) due to higher
investment balances.

Financial Recovery Plan*

-

During the fourth quarter
2001, the Company began implementing a financial recovery plan that includes
four planks:  reducing the size of the airline and cutting capital
and operating spending in line with that reduction, generating as much
revenue as possible from each flight, working with the unions and other
employee groups to find further labor savings and implementing a financing
plan to support the Company through the execution of the Financial Recovery
Plan.

Subsequent to the events
of September 11, United began the process of reducing spending by pulling
down the schedule, furloughing employees, closing stations and reservations
offices and deferring aircraft orders, as described above in "September
11 Terrorist Attacks."

Through these actions the
Company has dramatically reduced its operating cash outflows.  During
the month of October 2001, UAL's cash burn rate was approximately $15 million
per day; the Company's average cash burn for the entire fourth quarter
was approximately $10 million per day.  UAL continues to see improvements
in cash burn as revenue trends are improving and cost containment is ongoing.

As a result of recent aircraft
retirements and the addition of newer aircraft, United has one of the world's
youngest and most efficient operating fleets.  The retirements also
reduced the number of fleet types to five, which significantly improves
efficiency in maintenance, crew training and scheduling.  Planned
capital spending for 2002 has been reduced by 50% to $1.2 billion as a
result of the aircraft deferrals and cancelling non-essential capital projects. 
In addition, capital spending for 2003 has been reduced significantly due
to the fact that the Company will not take delivery of any aircraft in
2003.

In October 2001, management
had a series of informational meetings with the leadership of United's
six unions to give them a financial assessment and to provide further access
to the Company's operational and financial results.  On an ongoing
basis, United continues to answer their questions and work with the unions
to find creative solutions that move the Company toward financial stability. 
The Company believes that it must reduce labor costs, as well as other
operating costs, in order to stabilize United's financial situation in
the current industry environment and position United to participate in
an industry revenue recovery.  The settlement of open contracts as
discussed in the "Labor Agreements" section is an important step towards
achieving participation by all union groups in a program to reduce operating
costs.

While UAL is in the process
of developing a complete financing plan, the Company has identified various
possible sources of financing, including, but not limited to: (1) receipt
of the final installment of grant money under the Act; (2) receipt of $113
million held in trust under a services agreement with Galileo (see Note
6 "Investments" in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

);
(3) various types of secured debt financings, including committed back-stop
financing from aircraft manufacturers; (4) sale-leaseback transactions
of owned property, including aircraft and other equipment; (5) securitization
of future operating receipts; (6) unsecured borrowings and equity issuances;
and (7) federal loan guarantees as provided under the Act.  However,
there is no assurance that any or all of these financing sources will be
available at all times or at terms satisfactory to the Company.

Finally, the Company is exploring
various initiatives to increase revenue, including reviewing pricing strategies,
the management of inventory internally and profitable enhancements to service
and
product offerings.  For example, United has announced plans to add
an additional 127 daily departures in April over the current schedule.

These efforts have resulted
in a gradual improvement in unit revenue since the events of September
11, with year-over-year declines in unit revenue of 29%, 23% and 20%, respectively
for October, November and December 2001.  The Company expects unit
revenue for January 2002 to be only 15% to 17% below last year's levels.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Liquidity -

UAL's total of cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments was $2.6 billion at December 31,
2001, compared to $2.3 billion at December 31, 2000.  Operating activities
during the year used $160 million, including the effects of the grant received
from the federal government.

Property additions, including
aircraft, aircraft spare parts, facilities and ground equipment, amounted
to $2.0 billion, while property dispositions resulted in proceeds of $178
million.  In 2001, United took delivery of fifteen A319, eighteen
A320, two B767 and eight B777 aircraft.  All of these aircraft were
purchased.  One of the aircraft purchased was sold and then leased
back under an operating lease.  In addition, United acquired three
B737 and two B757 off lease during the year and retired its remaining DC10-30
fleet and all of its B727 and B737-200 fleets.

Financing activities included
the issuance of $1.5 billion in equipment trust certificates, as well as
principal payments under debt and capital lease obligations of $176 million
and $289 million, respectively.  Additionally, UAL issued $1.0 billion
in long-term debt during the period to finance the acquisition of aircraft. 
As of December 31, 2001, the Company has borrowed $133 million under a
separate short-term borrowing facility and pledged receivables of approximately
$145 million.  UAL may also from time to time repurchase on the open
market, in privately negotiated purchases or otherwise, its debt and equity
securities.

At December 31, 2001, United
guaranteed approximately $100 million of third-party debt.

Certain of United's surety
bonds for worker's compensation have been cancelled in various states where
United is self-insured.  As a result, United has been and may, in
the future, be required to post collateral in the form of cash deposits
or letters of credit.  Subsequent to December 31, 2001, United has
posted $187 million in deposits for various states where United is self-insured
for worker's compensation claims.

In addition, during
January, United paid $290 million in federal transportation taxes that
had been deferred as a result of September 11.  The Company also closed
on a private debt financing which raised approximately $250 million in
cash and sold its remaining investment in Cendant Corporation for approximately
$137 million (see Note 6 "Investments" in the

Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements

).

As of December 31, 2001,
UAL had a working capital deficit of $3.0 billion as compared to $1.7 billion
at December 31, 2000.  The Company has historically relied on working
capital to fund a significant portion of its ongoing operations. 
Historically, UAL has operated with a working capital deficit; however,
since September 11, 2001, the Company has not generated positive cash flow
from its operations.  Due to the lack of predictability of future
traffic, business mix and yields, the Company is unable to estimate when
it will again generate positive cash flow from operations to meet its operating
requirements, as well as short-term and long-term capital requirements.

Prior Years.

Operating activities in 2000 generated cash flows of $2.5 billion. 
Cash was used primarily to fund net additions to property and equipment
($2.2 billion) and to repurchase common stock ($81 million).  Financing
activities included the issuance of $2.4 billion in equipment trust certificates,
as well as principal payments under debt and capital lease obligations
of $441 million and $283 million, respectively.  Additionally, the
Company retired $116 million of long-term debt prior to maturity.

Operating activities in 1999
generated cash flows of $2.4 billion and the Company's sale of part of
its investments in Galileo and Equant provided $828 million in cash. 
Cash was used primarily to fund net additions to property and equipment
($2.2 billion) and to repurchase common stock ($261 million).  Financing
activities also included principal payments under debt and capital lease
obligations of $513 million and $248 million, respectively.

Capital Commitments -

The Company's business is
very capital intensive, requiring significant amounts of capital to fund
the acquisition of assets, particularly aircraft.  United may fund
the acquisition of aircraft through outright purchase, by issuing debt,
or by entering into capital or operating leases.  Similarly, the Company
often enters into long-term lease commitments with airports to ensure access
to terminal, cargo, maintenance and other similar facilities.  As
can be seen in the table below, these operating lease commitments (which
are sometimes referred to as "off-balance sheet debt") are significant.

Following is a summary of
the Company's material contractual cash obligations as of December 31,
2001:

See Note 11 "Long-Term Debt",
Note 12 "Lease Obligations" and Note 20 "Commitments, Contingent Liabilities
and Uncertainties" in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

for additional discussion of these items.

Capital Resources -

At December 31, 2001, UAL
and United had an effective shelf registration statement on file with the
Securities and Exchange Commission to offer up to $1.0 billion of securities,
including secured and unsecured debt, equipment trust and pass through
certificates or a combination thereof.  In addition, as of February
28, 2002, the Company has unencumbered aircraft and spare engines valued
at approximately $3.4 billion.  The Company is pursuing potential
opportunities, including refinancings and purchase of future aircraft deliveries,
to increase this pool of assets.

United also has in place
committed back-stop financing from its aircraft manufacturers for all aircraft
scheduled to be delivered in 2002.

During the month of January
2002, United closed on a $775 million private debt financing which refinanced
certain aircraft and raised approximately $250 million in additional cash. 
In addition, the Company sold its remaining investment in Cendant Corporation
for approximately $137 million (see Note 6 "Investments" in the

Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements

).

UAL's Series B preferred
stock and redeemable preferred securities were rated CCC+ by Standard and
Poor's ("S&P") and Ca by Moody's Investors Service Inc. ("Moody's"). 
United's senior unsecured debt was rated B- by S&P and Caa1 by Moody's. 
These ratings reflect a January downgrade by S&P.  The long-term
corporate credit ratings of United remain on S&P's CreditWatch with
negative implications.

The impact of the events
of September 11, 2001 on United and the sufficiency of its financial resources
to absorb that impact will depend on a number of factors, including: 
(1) the demand for air travel; (2) United's ability to reduce its operating
costs and conserve its financial resources, taking into account any increased
costs it will incur as a consequence of the attacks, including those referred
to below; (3) United's success in implementing its Financial Recovery Plan
described above (4) the higher costs associated with new airline security
directives and any other increased regulation of air carriers; (5) the
significantly higher costs of aircraft insurance coverage for future claims
caused by acts of war, terrorism, sabotage, hijacking and other similar
perils, and the extent to which such insurance will continue to be available;
(6) the ability of United to reduce costs to a level that takes into account
the size of its operation; (7) United's ability to raise financing in light
of the various factors referred to in this paragraph; (8) the price of
jet fuel; and (9) the extent of the benefits received by United under the
Act, taking into account any challenges to and interpretations or amendments
of the Act. *

At this point, due in part
to the lack of predictability of future traffic, business mix and yields,
United is unable to fully estimate the impact on it of the events of September
11, 2001 and their consequences and the sufficiency of its financial resources
to absorb that impact, including the mitigating effects of the Act and
the Company's aggressive actions to reduce its costs.  However, given
the magnitude of these unprecedented events and the possible subsequent
effects, United expects that the adverse impact to its financial condition,
its operations and its prospects will continue to be material.*

Other Information

Labor Agreements -

On July 12, 2000, the Company's
contracts with the IAM became amendable.  The Company has been in
negotiations with both IAM District 141M (representing mechanics) and 141
(representing public contact, ramp and stores, food services and security
employees) since December 1999 for new contracts.  Since September
2000, the negotiations have been conducted under the auspices of the National
Mediation Board ("NMB").  Under the terms of the Railway Labor Act,
United's current agreements with the IAM remain in effect as negotiations
continue.

On November 19, 2001, the
NMB released both parties in the mechanics negotiations from mediation
and offered both sides binding arbitration, which was accepted by United
but declined by the IAM, effectively beginning a 30-day "cooling-off period,"
which could have resulted in a strike in December 2001.  Instead,
on December 20, 2001, President Bush appointed a Presidential Emergency
Board ("PEB") as permitted by the Railway Labor Act, to study the issues
between the parties and recommend a solution, effectively postponing a
possible strike for 60 days.  On January 20, 2002, the PEB presented
its recommendations to the Company and the IAM which included immediate
pay increases of as much as 37% for United's mechanics, as well as providing
for payment of retroactive wages, of a lesser amount, to July 12, 2000. 
United accepted the recommendations of the PEB and they were submitted
to the IAM for ratification.  However, on February 12, the mechanics
rejected the recommendations and authorized a strike which could have occurred
as early as February 20 at 12:01 a.m.  On February 15, the two parties
reconvened to continue negotiations and on February 18, the Company and
the IAM announced that they had reached a new tentative agreement. 
On March 5, 2002, the IAM ratified the tentative agreement, which contains
some improvements over the PEB-recommended proposal, including payment
of retroactive wages in eight equal quarterly installments, including 6%
interest, commencing December 2002.

Mediated negotiations with
IAM District 141 are continuing.

Avolar -

In May 2001, UAL announced
the formation of United BizJet Holdings, Inc. (now known as "Avolar"),
a wholly owned subsidiary, to address the travel needs of premium customers
who may not use commercial aviation services.  Avolar operates and
sells fractional ownership interests in premium business aircraft and provides
charter services, fleet management services and a domestic and international
shuttle product.

In May 2001, UAL's Board
of Directors authorized the investment of up to $250 million in the subsidiary. 
Through January 2002, UAL has invested $102 million in Avolar, which includes
advance payments on aircraft purchases and the funding of operational expenses. 
Following the events of September 11, UAL decided to investigate options
to reduce its future funding obligations, including a possible sale of
a majority of Avolar to third-party investors.  Avolar is now pursuing
a new business plan to enable it to realize its value without additional
investment from UAL or the involvement of private equity investors. 
In connection with this action, UAL intends to discontinue its financial
commitment to Avolar effective March 31.  Avolar's business is still
in the startup phase of operations and the amounts invested but not yet
expensed could result in a significant write-off at UAL if this business
plan proves unsuccessful.*

As of December 31, 2001,
Avolar has agreements with Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation and Dassault
Falcon Jet to purchase 82 aircraft for $1.9 billion (after deducting advance
payments) to be delivered beginning in 2002, with options to purchase an
additional 142 aircraft.  Avolar has the right to cancel the purchase
of specific aircraft under the agreements subject to, among other things,
termination fees or other make-whole provisions.

Deferred Tax Assets -

UAL's consolidated
balance sheet at December 31, 2001 includes a net deferred tax asset of
$369 million, including $255 million of alternative minimum tax ("AMT")
credits which have an indefinite carryforward period, compared to a net
deferred tax liability of $1.0 billion at December 31, 2000.  Note
8 "Income Taxes" in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

describes the items included in the deferred tax assets and liabilities.

Management believes that
a majority of the deferred tax assets will be realized through reversals
of existing deferred tax liabilities with similar reversal patterns and
the balance will be realized as a result of generating future taxable income. 
UAL needs to generate approximately $4 billion in future taxable income
in order to realize the benefits of the remaining deferred tax assets. 
Between 1994 and 2000, UAL has generated approximately $5.7 billion in
taxable income.

While the book and tax loss
in 2001 was largely attributable to events beyond management's control,
including the events of September 11 and the recession in the U.S., UAL
has taken several steps to reduce costs and improve profitability, as described
in "Financial Recovery Plan" above.

UAL's ability to generate
sufficient amounts of taxable income from future operations is dependent
upon numerous factors, including general economic conditions, inflation,
fuel costs, the state of the industry and other factors beyond management's
control.  There can be no assurances that UAL will meet its expectations
of future taxable income.  However, based on the extended period over
which postretirement benefits will be recognized, the twenty-year federal
tax carryforward period, the Company's prior history of taxable income,
the utilization of all prior federal net operating loss carryforwards and
the indefinite carryforward period for AMT credits, management believes
it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be sufficient
to utilize the deferred tax assets at December 31, 2001.*

Foreign Operations -

United generates revenues
and incurs expenses in numerous foreign currencies.  These expenses
include aircraft leases, commissions, catering, personnel expense, advertising
and distribution costs, customer service expenses and aircraft maintenance. 
Changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact operating income through
changes in foreign currency-denominated operating revenues and expenses. 
Despite the adverse (favorable) effects a strengthening (weakening) foreign
currency may have on U.S. originating traffic, a strengthening (weakening)
of foreign currencies tends to increase (decrease) reported revenue and
operating income because United's foreign currency-denominated operating
revenue generally exceeds its foreign currency-denominated operating expense
for each currency.

With a worldwide network
and significant sales and marketing efforts in the U.S. as well as every
major economic region in the world, United is able to mitigate its exposure
to fluctuations in any single foreign currency.  The Company's biggest
net exposures are typically for Japanese yen, Hong Kong dollars, Australian
dollars and British pounds.  During 2001, yen-denominated operating
revenue net of yen-denominated operating expense was approximately 16 billion
yen (approximately $135 million), Hong Kong dollar-denominated operating
revenue net of Hong Kong dollar-denominated operating expense was approximately
1.1 billion Hong Kong dollars (approximately $135 million), British pound-denominated
operating revenue net of British pound-denominated operating expense was
approximately 85 million British pounds (approximately $123 million), and
Australian dollar-denominated operating revenue net of Australian dollar-denominated
operating expense was approximately 94 million Australian dollars (approximately
$48 million).

As the Company has limited
operations in Argentina, United's cash on deposit in Argentina was less
than $4 million at December 31, 2001.

To reduce the impact of exchange
rate fluctuations on United's financial results, the Company hedged some
of the risk of exchange rate volatility on its anticipated future foreign
currency revenues by purchasing put options (consisting of Japanese yen,
euro, Australian dollars and British pounds) and selling Hong Kong dollar
forwards.  To reduce hedging costs, the Company sells a correlation
option in the first four currencies referred to above.  United also
attempts to reduce its exposure to transaction gains and losses by converting
excess local currencies generated to U.S. dollars on a timely basis and
by entering into currency forward or exchange contracts.  The total
notional amount of outstanding currency options and forward exchange contracts,
and their respective fair market values as of December 31, 2001, are summarized
in

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

.

United's foreign operations
involve insignificant amounts of physical assets; however, the Company
does have sizable intangible assets related to acquisitions of Atlantic
and Latin America route authorities.  Operating authorities in international
markets are governed by bilateral aviation agreements between the U.S.
and foreign countries.  Changes in U.S. or foreign government aviation
policies can lead to the alteration or termination of existing air service
agreements that could adversely impact the value of United's international
route authority.  Significant changes in such policies could also
have a material impact on UAL's operating revenues and results of operations. 
During 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement
of Financial Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets"
("SFAS No. 142") which could impact the Company's accounting for these
assets.  For further details, see "New Accounting Pronouncements"
below.

Airport Rents and Landing Fees -

United is charged facility
rental and/or landing fees at every airport at which it operates. 
In recent years, many airports have increased or sought to increase rates
charged to airlines as a means of compensating for increasing demands upon
airport revenues.  Airlines have challenged certain of these increases
through litigation and in some cases have not been successful.  The
FAA and the DOT have instituted an administrative hearing process to judge
whether rate increases are legal and valid.  However, to the extent
the limitations on such charges are relaxed or the ability of airlines
to challenge such charges is restricted, the rates charged by airports
may increase substantially.  Management cannot predict either the
likelihood or the magnitude of any such increase.*

Environmental and Legal Contingencies -

United has been named as
a Potentially Responsible Party at certain Environmental Protection Agency
("EPA") cleanup sites which have been designated as Superfund Sites. 
United's alleged proportionate contributions at the sites are minimal;
however, at sites where the EPA has commenced litigation, potential liability
is joint and several.  Additionally, United has participated and is
participating in remediation actions at certain other sites, primarily
airports.  The estimated cost of these actions is accrued when it
is determined that it is probable that United is liable.  Environmental
regulations and remediation processes are subject to future change, and
determining the actual cost of remediation will require further investigation
and remediation experience.  Therefore, the ultimate disposition cannot
be determined at this time.  However, while such cost may vary from
United's current estimate, United believes the difference between its accrued
reserve and the ultimate liability will not be material.*

UAL has certain other contingencies
resulting from this and other litigation and claims incident to the ordinary
course of business.  Management believes, after considering a number
of factors, including (but not limited to) the views of legal counsel,
the nature of such contingencies and prior experience, that the ultimate
disposition of these contingencies is not likely to materially affect UAL's
financial condition, operating results or liquidity.*

Critical Accounting Policies

-

Critical accounting policies
are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties
and potentially result in materially different results under different
assumptions and conditions.  UAL has prepared the accompanying financial
statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles,
which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes. 
Actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions
or conditions.  The Company has identified the following critical
accounting policies utilized in the preparation of these financial statements.

Revenue Recognition.

As discussed in Note 1(d) "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies -
Airline Revenues" in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

, 
passenger ticket sales are recorded as operating revenues when the transportation
is furnished.  The value of unused passenger tickets is included in
advance ticket sales as a liability on the balance sheet.  United
performs periodic evaluations of this liability and any adjustments, which
can be significant, are included in the results of operations for the periods
in which the evaluations are completed.  These adjustments result
from differences between the Company's estimation of certain revenue transactions
and the related sales price, and are impacted by various factors, including
a complex pricing structure and interline agreements throughout the industry,
which effect the timing of revenue recognition.

Accounting for
Long-Lived Assets.

The Company has approximately $17 billion
in operating property and equipment at December 31, 2001.  In addition
to the original cost of these assets, their recorded value is impacted
by a number of policy elections made by the Company, including the estimation
of useful lives, salvage values and in 2001, impairment charges. 
See Note 1(h) "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Operating Property
and Equipment" and Note 2 "Special Charges Related to the September 11
Terrorist Attacks" in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

for additional information regarding United's policies on accounting for
long-lived assets.

Frequent Flyer
Accounting.

The Company utilizes a number of estimates in
accounting for its Mileage Plus frequent flyer program which are consistent
with industry practices.  Additional information regarding the Mileage
Plus frequent flyer program is included in

Item 1. Business

and
in Note 1(b) "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Changes in Accounting
Principles" and Note 1(i) "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies -
Mileage Plus Awards" in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

. 
In addition, the Emerging Issues Task Force of the FASB is currently reviewing
the accounting for both multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements and volume-based
sales incentive offers, but has not yet reached a consensus that would
apply to programs such as the Mileage Plus program.  The issuance
of new accounting standards could have a significant impact on the Company's
frequent flyer liability in the year of change as well as future years.

Pensions and Other
Postretirement Benefits.

The Company's pension and other
postretirement benefit costs are calculated using various actuarial assumptions
and methodologies as prescribed under Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 87, "Employers' Accounting for Pensions" and Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement
Benefits Other than Pensions."  The Company's assumptions, which include
the selection of the discount rate, the expected return on plan assets
and the expected health care cost trend rate, are identified in Note 18
"Retirement and Postretirement Plans" in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements

.  The discount rate is based on the Company's review
of high quality corporate bond rates and the change in these rates during
the year.  The expected return on plan assets and health care cost
trend rate are based on evaluation of the Company's historical trends and
experience taking into consideration current and expected market conditions. 
In addition, the Company's future pension and other postretirement benefit
costs and liabilities will be impacted by the new labor agreements with
the IAM.

Valuation Allowance
for Deferred Tax Assets.

At December 31, 2001, the Company
had a net deferred tax asset of $369 million, which the Company has determined
is more likely than not to be realized.  A valuation allowance of
$6 million was calculated for those state net operating losses with carryforward
periods of seven years or less, using assumptions and methodologies as
prescribed under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting
for Income Taxes" and as described in "Deferred Tax Assets" above. 
See also Note 8 "Income Taxes" in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements

for additional information.

New Accounting Pronouncements -

In June 2001, the FASB issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 "Business Combinations"
("SFAS No. 141") and SFAS No. 142.  SFAS No. 141 is effective for
combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 and requires the use of the
purchase method in accounting for business combinations.  SFAS No.
142 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001 and
requires companies to test all goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible
assets for impairment and to cease amortization of such assets.  The
Company intends to adopt SFAS No. 142 beginning in the first quarter 2002
and currently estimates discontinuing approximately $17 million in amortization
expense in 2002.  In accordance with SFAS No. 142, the Company will
perform an evaluation of its intangibles in the first quarter after adoption.

In June 2001, the FASB issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143 "Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations" ("SFAS No. 143"), which addresses the accounting
and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived
assets and associated asset retirement costs.  Under SFAS No. 143,
the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation must be
recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate
of fair value can be made.  In addition, the associated asset retirement
costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived
asset.  SFAS No. 143 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
June 15, 2002.  The Company has not yet quantified the impact of SFAS
No. 143 on the Company's financial statements.

In August 2001, the FASB
issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144 "Accounting
for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets" ("SFAS No. 144"),
which addresses the accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal
of long-lived assets.  SFAS No. 144 supersedes Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived
Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of" ("SFAS No. 121") but
retains SFAS No. 121's fundamental provisions for recognition/measurement
of impairment of long-lived assets to be held and used and measurement
of long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale.  SFAS No. 144 is effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001.  The Company does
not expect SFAS No. 144 to have a material impact on the Company's financial
statements upon adoption.

Outlook for 2002*-

While starting to see some
positive revenue trends, the Company expects to report a significant loss
in the first quarter of 2002.  Capacity for the first quarter is expected
to be down 19% and unit costs, excluding United's fuel subsidiary, are
expected to increase 7% year-over-year.  First quarter fuel price
is projected to be down 24% year-over-year.

The Company expects January
2002 passenger unit revenue to be 15% to 17% below last year.  United's
booked load factor for February is ahead of last year, while March is about
the same as last year.

Information included in the
above "Outlook" paragraphs, as well as certain statements made throughout
the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations that are identified with an asterisk (*)  is forward-looking
and involves risks and uncertainties that could result in actual results
differing materially from expected results.  Forward-looking statements
represent the Company's expectations and beliefs concerning future events,
based on information available to the Company on the date of this filing. 
Some factors that could significantly impact net earnings, revenues, expenses,
unit costs, fuel, load factor and capacity include, without limitation,
the adverse impact of the September 11 terrorist attacks on the economy
in general; the demand for air travel; the ability to reduce operating
costs and conserve financial resources; the higher costs associated with
new airline security directives and any other increased regulation of air
carriers; the significantly higher costs of aircraft insurance coverage
for future claims caused by acts of war, terrorism, sabotage, hijacking
and other similar perils, and the extent to which such insurance will continue
to be available; the ability to raise and the cost of financing in light
of the September 11 events; the price of jet fuel; the airline pricing
environment; industry capacity decisions; competitors' route decisions;
the success of the Company's cost-reduction efforts; the success of the
Company's implementation of the Financial Recovery Plan; the results of
union contract negotiations and wage rate reduction discussions and their
impact on labor costs and operations; the willingness of customers to travel;
actions of the U.S., foreign and local governments; foreign currency exchange
rate fluctuations; the economic environment of the airline industry and
the economic environment in general.

Investors should not place
undue reliance on the forward-looking information contained herein, which
speaks only as of the date of this filing.  UAL disclaims any intent
or obligation to update or alter any of the forward-looking statements
whether in response to new information, unforeseen events, changed circumstances
or otherwise.

ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET
RISK

Interest Rate Risk -

United's exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates
relates primarily to its debt obligations and short-term investments. 
United does not use derivative financial instruments in its investments
portfolio.  United's policy is to manage interest rate risk through
a combination of fixed and floating rate debt and entering into swap agreements,
depending upon market conditions.  A portion of the borrowings are
denominated in foreign currencies which exposes the Company to risks associated
with changes in foreign exchange rates.  To hedge against some of
this risk, the Company has placed foreign currency deposits (primarily
for Japanese yen, French francs, German marks and euros) to meet foreign
currency lease obligations designated in the respective currencies. 
Since unrealized mark-to-market gains or losses on the foreign currency
deposits are offset by the losses or gains on the foreign currency obligations,
the Company reduces its overall exposure to foreign currency exchange rate
volatility.  The fair value of these deposits is determined based
on the present value of future cash flows using an appropriate swap rate. 
The fair value of long-term debt is based on the quoted market prices for
the same or similar issues or the present value of future cash flows using
a U.S. Treasury rate that matches the remaining life of the instrument,
adjusted by a credit spread.

Foreign Currency Risk
- -

United has established a foreign currency hedging program using currency
forwards and options (purchasing put options and selling correlation options)
to hedge exposure to the Japanese yen, Hong Kong dollar, British pound,
Australian dollar and the euro.  The goal of the hedging program is
to effectively manage risk associated with fluctuations in the value of
the foreign currency, thereby making financial results more stable and
predictable.  United does not use currency forwards or currency options
for trading purposes.

Price Risk (Aircraft Fuel)
- -

When market conditions indicate risk reduction is achievable, United
enters into fuel option contracts to reduce its price risk exposure to
jet fuel.  The option contracts are designed to provide protection
against sharp increases in the price of aircraft fuel. As market conditions
change, so may United's hedging program.  In addition, to a limited
extent, United trades short-term heating oil futures and option contracts,
which are not significant.


Estimated fair values represent the
amount United would pay/receive on December 31, 2001 to terminate the contracts.

ITEM 8.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To the Stockholders and

Board of Directors, UAL Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying statements of consolidated financial
position of UAL Corporation (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiary companies
as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the related statements of consolidated
operations, consolidated cash flows and consolidated stockholders' equity
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001. 
These financial statements and the schedule referred to below are the responsibility
of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States.  Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures
in the financial statements.  An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. 
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of UAL
Corporation and subsidiary companies as of December 31, 2001 and 2000,
and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2001, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States.

As explained in Note 1(b) of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,
effective January 1, 2001, the Company changed its accounting principles
for the measurement of redeemable preferred ESOP stock as a result of the
adoption of Topic D-98 "Classification and Measurement of Redeemable Securities"
and effective January 1, 2000, the Company changed certain of its accounting
principles for revenue recognition as a result of the adoption of Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 101 "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements."

Our audits were made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic
financial statements taken as a whole.  The schedule referenced in
Item 14(a) 2 herein is presented for purposes of complying with the Securities
and Exchange Commission's rules and is not part of the basic financial
statements.  This schedule has been subjected to the auditing procedures
applied in the audit of the basic financial statements and, in our opinion,
fairly states in all material respects the financial data required to be
set forth therein in relation to the basic financial statements taken as
a whole.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(1)  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

(a)  Basis of
Presentation

-

UAL Corporation ("UAL") is a holding company whose
principal subsidiary is United Air Lines, Inc. ("United").  The consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of UAL and all of its majority-owned
affiliates (collectively "the Company").  All significant intercompany
transactions are eliminated.  Certain prior-year financial statement
items have been reclassified to conform to the current year's presentation.

(b) Changes in Accounting
Principles

- During 2001, the Emerging Issues Task Force issued
Topic D-98 "Classification and Measurement of Redeemable Securities" ("Topic
D-98").  Topic D-98 states that redeemable preferred stock with redemption
features outside of the control of the issuer should be classified outside
of permanent equity; additionally, for stock that will become redeemable
at some future date and its redemption amount is variable (such as at market
value), changes in the redemption value should be recognized immediately
as they occur and the carrying value of the security be adjusted at the
end of each reporting period.

UAL's preferred stock committed
to the Supplemental ESOP is redeemable preferred stock with redemption
features outside of UAL's control, as employees can elect to receive from
the ESOP trustee, their shares in cash upon termination of employment. 
The Supplemental ESOP preferred stock is classified outside of permanent
equity.  Topic D-98 requires that the Supplemental ESOP preferred
stock be recorded at fair market value at each balance sheet date and also
requires retroactive application.  Accordingly, UAL has restated the
carrying amount of the preferred stock to reflect market value at December
31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 with a corresponding change to additional paid
in capital.  The restatements are as follows:

Effective January 1, 2001,
UAL adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("SFAS No. 133"), as
amended.  The adoption of SFAS No. 133 resulted in a cumulative charge
of $8 million, net of tax, to 2001 earnings.  This primarily related
to the changes in fair values of certain equity warrants that were not
designated as qualifying hedging instruments.  (See Note 1(f) "Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies - Derivative Financial Instruments.")

Effective January 1, 2000,
the Company changed its method of accounting for the sale of mileage to
participating non-airline partners in its Mileage Plus program, in accordance
with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, "Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements."  Under the new accounting method, a portion of revenue
from the sale of mileage (previously recognized in other revenue) is deferred
and recognized as passenger revenue when the transportation is provided. 
Accordingly, UAL recorded a charge of $209 million, net of tax, for the
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle to reflect the application
of the accounting method to prior years.  This change resulted in
a reduction to revenues of approximately $38 million for 2000 and would
have reduced 1999 revenues by $45 million.

The pro forma effect of the
accounting change on net income and earnings per share as previously reported
for 1999 and prior years is as follows:

(c)  Use of Estimates

- -

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those
estimates.  See following footnotes for discussion of significant
estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements.

(d)  Airline Revenues

- -

Passenger fares and cargo revenues are recorded as operating revenues
when the transportation is furnished.  The value of unused passenger
tickets is included in current liabilities.

(e)  Cash and
Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments

-

Cash in excess of
operating requirements is invested in short-term, highly liquid, income-producing
investments.  Investments with a maturity of three months or less
on their acquisition date are classified as cash and cash equivalents. 
Other investments are classified as short-term investments.

From time to time, United
lends certain of its securities classified as cash and cash equivalents
and short-term investments to third parties.  United requires collateral
in an amount exceeding the value of the securities and is obligated to
reacquire the securities at the end of the contract.  United accounts
for these transactions as secured borrowings rather than sales and does
not remove the securities from the balance sheet.  At December 31,
2001, United was obligated to repurchase $2 million of securities lent
to third parties.

At December 31, 2001 and
2000, $526 million and $598 million, respectively, of investments in debt
securities included in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments
were classified as available-for-sale, and $2.0 billion and $1.7 billion,
respectively, were classified as held-to-maturity.  Investments in
debt securities classified as available-for-sale are stated at fair value
based on the quoted market prices for the securities, which does not differ
significantly from their cost basis.  Investments classified as held-to-maturity
are stated at cost which approximates market due to their short-term maturities. 
The gains or losses from sales of available-for-sale securities are included
in interest income for each respective year.

(f)  Derivative
Financial Instruments

-

Hedges of Future Cash
Flows

Foreign Currency

- -

United enters into forwards and currency swaps to reduce exposure
to currency fluctuations on Japanese yen-, euro- and French franc-denominated
capital lease obligations.  The cash flows of the forwards and swaps
mirror those of the capital leases.  These forwards and swaps have
been designated as cash flow hedges of the foreign currency denominated
lease payments.  For these forwards and swaps, United excludes changes
in fair value resulting from changes in the forward points in its assessment
of effectiveness.  Any gains or losses realized upon early termination
of these forwards and swaps are recorded (net of tax) as a component of
other comprehensive income and recognized in income as the hedged transaction
impacts earnings.

The Company hedges some of
the risks of exchange rate volatility on its anticipated future Japanese
yen, euro, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar and British pound revenues
by purchasing put options and on Hong Kong dollar revenues by entering
into forward contracts.  These options and forwards have a duration
of less than one year and the amounts are synchronized with the expected
cash receipts.  Accordingly, the put options and forwards have been
designated as cash flow hedges of the anticipated cash receipts. 
Changes in the fair value of purchased put option contracts, to the extent
they are effective, are recorded in other comprehensive income (net of
tax) and then recognized as a component of passenger revenue when the underlying
hedged revenue is recorded.  United excludes, in its assessment of
effectiveness, changes in the fair value of these instruments that are
a result of changes in their time value.

Aircraft Fuel

-
United uses crude oil and heating oil forwards and options to hedge a portion
of its price risk related to aircraft fuel purchases.  These contracts
have maturity dates of less than two years and have been designated as
cash flow hedges of anticipated jet fuel purchases.  These contracts
are recorded at fair value with the changes in fair value, to the extent
they are effective, recorded in other comprehensive income (net of tax),
until the underlying hedged fuel is consumed.  The Company determines
the ineffective portion of the fuel forwards and options as the excess
of the fair value of the hedge contracts compared to the change in expected
cash outflows for the hedged jet fuel.  United excludes, in its assessment
of effectiveness, changes in the fair value of these instruments that are
a result of changes in their time value.

Interest Rate -

United
is a party to a series of interest rate swaps that convert floating-rate
operating leases to fixed-rate leases.  United has designated these
swaps as cash flow hedges of the floating-rate leases and has recorded
these contracts at fair value with the effective portion recorded as a
component of other comprehensive income (net of tax).

The ineffectiveness resulting
from the changes in fair value of aircraft fuel and interest rate hedge
positions was immaterial.  There was no ineffectiveness resulting
from the changes in fair value of foreign currency hedge positions reported
in earnings.  Amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness
amounted to approximately $3 million before income taxes and were recorded
in "Miscellaneous, net."

The following is a reconciliation
of current period changes (net of tax) of the portion of stockholders'
equity relating to derivatives that qualify as cash flow hedges:

Of this amount, $32 million
in losses is expected to be recorded into earnings within the next twelve
months.  At December 31, 2001, the term of derivative instruments
hedging variability in cash flows, except those related to payment of variable
interest on existing financial instruments, was seventeen years.

Other Derivative Instruments Not Designated as Hedges

Equity Warrants

-
The Company may also invest in or receive warrants to purchase securities
of other companies as strategic investments.  Changes in the fair
value of warrants that are not designated as hedge instruments are included
in "Miscellaneous, net."

Foreign Currency -

From
time to time, United enters into Japanese yen forward exchange contracts
to minimize gains and losses on the revaluation of short-term yen-denominated
liabilities.  The yen forwards, typically having short-term maturities,
are not designated hedges under SFAS No. 133 and are marked to fair value
through the income statement at the end of each accounting period. 
The unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses generally offset the losses
and gains recorded on the yen liabilities.

To reduce hedging costs,
the Company sells a correlation option denominated in Japanese yen, euros,
Canadian dollars, Australian dollars and British pounds.  These correlation
options are not designated as a hedge and the changes in the fair market
value of the correlation options are included in "Miscellaneous, net."

(g)  Aircraft
Fuel, Spare Parts and Supplies

-

Aircraft fuel and maintenance
and operating supplies are stated at average cost.  Flight equipment
spare parts are stated at average cost less an obsolescence allowance.

(h)  Operating
Property and Equipment

-

Owned operating property and equipment
is stated at cost.  Property under capital leases, and the related
obligation for future lease payments, are initially recorded at an amount
equal to the then present value of those lease payments.

Depreciation and amortization
of owned depreciable assets is based on the straight-line method over their
estimated service lives.  Leasehold improvements are amortized over
the remaining period of the lease or the estimated service life of the
related asset, whichever is less.  Aircraft are depreciated to estimated
salvage values, generally over lives of 4 to 30 years; buildings are depreciated
over lives of 25 to 45 years; and other property and equipment are depreciated
over lives of 3 to 15 years.

Properties under capital
leases are amortized on the straight-line method over the life of the lease,
or in the case of certain aircraft, over their estimated service lives. 
Lease terms are 10 to 30 years for aircraft and flight simulators and 25
years for buildings.  Amortization of capital leases is included in
depreciation and amortization expense.

Maintenance and repairs,
including the cost of minor replacements, are charged to maintenance expense
accounts.  Costs of additions to and renewals of units of property
are charged to property and equipment accounts.

(i)  Mileage Plus
Awards

-

United accrues the estimated incremental cost of providing
free travel awards earned under its Mileage Plus frequent flyer program
when such award levels are reached.  United, through its wholly owned
subsidiary, Mileage Plus Holdings, Inc., sells mileage credits to participating
partners in the Mileage Plus program.

(j)  Deferred
Gains

-

Gains on aircraft sale and leaseback transactions are deferred
and amortized over the lives of the leases as a reduction of rental expense.

(k)  United Express

- - United has marketing agreements under which independent regional carriers,
flying under the United Express name, feed United's mainline flying. 
United pays these carriers on a fee-per-departure basis and includes the
revenues derived from the carriers in passenger revenue, net of expenses. 
In addition, United has call options that are exercisable under certain
conditions, on 22 regional jets owned or leased by these carriers.

(l)  Advertising

-

Advertising costs, which are included in other operating expenses, are
expensed as incurred.  Advertising expense was $217 million, $269
million and $232 million for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and
1999, respectively.

(m)  Intangibles

- -

Intangibles consist primarily of route acquisition costs and intangible
pension assets (see Note 18 "Retirement and Postretirement Plans"). 
Route acquisition costs are amortized over 40 years.  During 2001,
the FASB issued SFAS No. 142 which the Company intends to adopt in January
2002.  See

Other Information,

"New Accounting Pronouncements"
in

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations

.

(n)  Measurement
of Impairments

- In accordance with SFAS No. 121, the Company records
impairment losses on long-lived assets used in operations when events and
circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted
cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the
carrying value of those assets.  In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS
No. 144, which supersedes SFAS No. 121.  See

(2)  Special Charges Related to the September 11 Terrorist
Attacks

On September 11, 2001, two
United aircraft were hijacked and destroyed in terrorist attacks on The
World Trade Center in New York City and in a crash near Johnstown, Pennsylvania. 
On the same day, two American Airlines aircraft were also hijacked and
used in terrorist attacks on The World Trade Center and the Pentagon. 
In addition to the loss of all passengers and crew on board the aircraft,
these attacks resulted in numerous deaths and injuries to persons on the
ground and massive property damage.  In the immediate aftermath of
the attacks, the FAA ordered all aircraft operating in the U.S. grounded
immediately.  This grounding effectively lasted for three days, and
the Company was able to operate only a portion of its scheduled flights
for several days thereafter.  When flights were permitted to resume,
passenger traffic and yields were significantly lower than prior to the
attacks.

In a direct response to the
adverse impact on air travel as a result of the September 11 terrorist
attacks, United reduced capacity by as much as 23%, which allowed for the
retirement of the entire B727-200 and B737-200 fleets.  In addition,
on September 19, United announced that it would begin the process of furloughing
approximately
20,000 employees.  Since that time, however, due to slightly increased
customer demand, and an increase to the April 2002 schedule, United plans
to recall 1,200 flight attendants to active status on April 1, 2002 and
to furlough fewer pilots than previously planned.

During the third quarter,
United recorded a special charge of $1.3 billion in operating expense and
$49 million in non-operating expense for amounts relating to the September
11 terrorist attacks and the resulting impact on the Company's schedule
and operations.  In addition, as of December 31, 2001, United had
received $652 million in compensation under the Air Transportation Safety
and System Stabilization Act (the "Act").  For further information,
see "September 11 Terrorist Attacks" in

Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

.

The special charge is made
up of the following:

As a result of the grounding
of the B727-200 and B737-200 fleets, the Company recorded a charge of $271
million, reflecting the write-down of the fleets to fair value.

Due to the changes being
implemented to United's operations, the Company has reviewed its fleet
for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 121.  (See Note 1(n) "Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies - Measurement of Impairments.") 
Management has determined that the estimated net undiscounted future cash
flows generated by its B737-500 and B747-400 fleets will be less than their
carrying value.  Management estimated the undiscounted future cash
flows utilizing models used by the Company in making fleet and scheduling
decisions.  These models were based upon projections of passenger
yield, fuel costs, labor costs and other relevant factors in the markets
where these aircraft will operate.  The owned aircraft in each of
these fleets were written down to their fair market values, as estimated
by management using published sources, third-party appraisals and bids
received from third parties.  Accordingly, the special charge includes
an impairment charge of $517 million for these aircraft fleets resulting
from the anticipated decrease in future cash flows.

Also included in the special
charge is $107 million relating to the write-off of capital projects no
longer being pursued.  Additionally, United has recorded a non-operating
special charge of $48 million relating to the write-down of residual values
on certain non-operating equipment leased to others.

As a result of recording
the above special charges related to aircraft and capital projects, depreciation
and amortization expense will decrease by approximately $80 million in
2002.

The Company has begun the
process of furloughing approximately 20,000 employees across all work groups
(pilots, flight attendants, mechanics, ramp service, customer service and
management and salaried employees).  In connection with the furloughs,
United accrued severance costs of approximately $217 million, including
a one-time curtailment charge relating to the accelerated recognition of
unrecognized prior service costs for certain of the Company's pension plans.

The special charge also includes
$181 million for amounts due under executory contracts with third parties,
including aircraft manufacturers, software vendors, food suppliers and
governmental authorities.

Since the announcement of
the reduction in force, approximately 19,000 employees have been furloughed,
separated, elected special leave of absence, or retired.  Of this
amount, approximately 4,200 employees are on special leave with full benefits
for up to two years.

United had accrued $134 million
related to the reduction in force and $181 million related to early termination
fees at September 30, 2001.  During the fourth quarter, United paid
$47 million in severance-related costs and $10 million in early termination
fees, bringing the accruals for the reduction in force and early termination
fees to $87 million and $171 million, respectively, at December 31, 2001.

(3)  Employee Stock Ownership Plans and Recapitalization

On July 12, 1994, the stockholders
of UAL approved a plan of recapitalization to provide an approximately
55% equity interest in UAL to certain employees of United in exchange for
wage concessions and work-rule changes.  The employees' equity interest
was allocated to individual employees through the year 2000 under ESOPs
which were created as a part of the recapitalization.

The ESOPs cover employees
represented by ALPA, the IAM and U.S. management and salaried employees
and include a "Leveraged ESOP," a "Non-Leveraged ESOP" and a "Supplemental
ESOP."  Both the Leveraged ESOP and the Non-Leveraged ESOP are tax-qualified
plans while the Supplemental ESOP is not a tax-qualified plan.

The equity interests were
delivered to employees through two classes of preferred stock (Class 1
and Class 2 ESOP Preferred Stock, collectively "ESOP Preferred Stock"),
and the voting interests were delivered through three separate classes
of preferred stocks (Class P, M and S Voting Preferred Stock, collectively,
"Voting Preferred Stock").  The Class 1 ESOP Preferred Stock was delivered
to an ESOP trust in seven separate sales under the Leveraged ESOP, the
last of which occurred on January 5, 2000.  Based on Internal Revenue
Code Limitations, shares of the Class 2 ESOP Preferred Stock were either
contributed to the Non-Leveraged ESOP or allocated as "book entry" shares
to the Supplemental ESOP annually through the year 2000.  The classes
of preferred stock are described more fully in Note 15 "ESOP Preferred
Stock."

Shares of ESOP Preferred
Stock were legally released or allocated to employee accounts as of year-end. 
The final allocation of shares occurred in March 2001 as follows: 
669,966 shares of Class 1 ESOP Preferred Stock, 167,523 shares of Class
2 ESOP Preferred Stock and 834,726 shares of Voting Preferred Stock were
allocated to employee accounts, and another 20,007 shares of Class 2 ESOP
Preferred Stock were allocated in the form of "book entry" shares, effective
December 31, 2000.  In addition, during 2001, 152,620 shares of Class
2 ESOP Preferred Stock previously allocated in book entry form were issued
and either contributed to the qualified plan or converted and sold on behalf
of terminating employees.

For the Class 2 ESOP Preferred
Stock committed to be contributed to employees under the Supplemental ESOP,
employees can elect to receive their "book entry" shares in cash upon termination
of employment.  At December 31, 2001, there were 1,430,536 book entry
shares outstanding under the Supplemental ESOP.  The estimated fair
value of such shares at December 31, 2001 and 2000 is reflected in the

Statements
of Consolidated Financial Position

as discussed in Note 1(b) "Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies - Changes in Accounting Principles."

(4)  Other Income (Expense) - Miscellaneous

Included in Other income
(expense) - "Miscellaneous, net" was $(21) million, $(22) million and $4
million of foreign exchange gains (losses) in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

(5)  Per Share Amounts

Basic earnings per share
were computed by dividing net income before extraordinary item and cumulative
effect by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding
during the year and potential participating ESOP preferred shares in periods
where such shares are dilutive using the if-converted method.  In
addition, diluted earnings per share amounts include potential common shares,
including common shares issuable upon conversion of ESOP shares committed
to be released.

At December 31, 2001, stock
options to purchase 10,744,224 shares of common stock were outstanding,
but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share,
because the exercise price of these options was greater than the average
market price of the common shares.  In addition, 61,052,600 shares
of convertible ESOP preferred stock were not included in the computation
of diluted earnings per share, as the result would be antidilutive.

(6)  Investments

At December 31, 2000, United
owned 15,940,000 shares (18%) in Galileo, a leading provider of electronic
global distribution services for the travel industry.  On October
1, 2001, Cendant Corporation ("Cendant") acquired all of the outstanding
common stock of Galileo for a combination of stock and cash.  Accordingly,
United tendered all of its shares in Galileo for net proceeds of $65 million
and 21,168,320 shares in Cendant, resulting in a gain of $155 million,
net of tax.  Subsequent to the acquisition by Cendant and prior to
December 31, United sold 14 million shares of Cendant common stock for
net proceeds of $194 million, resulting in a gain of $11 million, net of
tax.  During January 2002, United sold its remaining investment in
Cendant for net proceeds of $137 million, resulting in a gain of approximately
$29 million, net of tax.

At December 31, 2001, United
had $113 million in trust under a prior services agreement with Galileo. 
The revenues from the agreement were earned and recorded in 1999, 2000
and 2001 and the payout of the trust will occur in July 2002.

In June 1999, United sold
17,500,000 common shares of Galileo in a secondary offering for $766 million,
resulting in a gain of $428 million, net of tax.

At December 31, 2000, United
owned 1,391,791 depositary certificates in Equant, a provider of international
data network services to multinational businesses and a single source for
global desktop communications.  On June 29, 2001, France Telecom acquired
all of the outstanding shares of Equant in an exchange of one France Telecom
share for every 2.2 Equant shares.  At December 31, 2001, the estimated
fair value of United's investment in France Telecom was approximately $25
million.

In December 1999, United
sold 709,000 shares of common stock in Equant in a secondary offering by
Equant for $62 million, resulting in a gain of $40 million, net of tax.

During 2000 and 2001, UAL
Loyalty Services ("ULS"), a wholly owned subsidiary of UAL, has invested
approximately $51 million in Orbitz, an Internet travel web site. 
UAL Loyalty Services owns approximately 22% of Orbitz and accounts for
this investment using the equity method of accounting.

During 1998 and 1999, United
invested approximately $51 million in GetThere.com (a leading provider
of Internet-based travel planning products tailored to individual, corporate,
travel supplier and travel agency customers) resulting in a 28% minority
interest consisting of common stock, warrants and options.  United
accounted for its investment in GetThere.com using the equity method of
accounting.  On October 6, 2000, Sabre Holdings Corporation acquired
all of the outstanding common stock of GetThere.com for $17.75 per share. 
Accordingly, after converting its options and warrants, United tendered
all of its shares for net proceeds of $147 million, resulting in a gain
of approximately $69 million, net of tax.

During 2000, United recorded
an impairment loss of $38 million, net of tax, related to its warrants
held in Priceline.com.

(7)  Acquisitions

On July 18, 2001, ULS successfully
completed its cash tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding common
stock of MyPoints.com for $2.60 per share.  MyPoints.com is a leading
Internet direct marketing and membership services company, known for its
database-driven loyalty infrastructure.  The merger is expected to
provide more effective communication with users of united.com and Mileage
Plus members, as well as allow greater reach to an expanded audience of
potential customers.  Including the costs related to vested management
stock options, outstanding warrants and transaction-related expenditures,
the aggregate cost of the acquisition was approximately $118 million. 
The preliminary purchase price allocation has assigned approximately $32
million to goodwill and intangible assets, pending final determination
of certain acquired balances.  This transaction is being accounted
for under the purchase method, in accordance with SFAS No. 141.

(8)  Income Taxes

In 2001, UAL incurred both
a regular and an AMT loss.  The carryback of the regular tax loss
and the AMT loss to 1999 will produce both federal and state refunds and
reduce AMT credits.  The primary differences between UAL's regular
tax loss and AMT loss are the depreciation adjustments and preferences.

The provision for income
taxes is summarized as follows:

The income tax provision
differed from amounts computed at the statutory federal income tax rate,
as follows:

Temporary differences and
carryforwards that give rise to a significant portion of deferred tax assets
and liabilities for 2001 and 2000 are as follows:

The Company has determined,
based on its history of operating earnings and expectations of future taxable
income, that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets at
December 31, 2001 will be realized.

At December 31, 2001, UAL
and its subsidiaries had $255 million of federal AMT credits and $1.2 billion
of federal and state net operating losses which may be carried forward
to reduce the tax liabilities of future years.  State net operating
losses were reduced by a valuation allowance for those states with carryforward
periods of seven years or less, for which it is more likely than not that
expiration will occur before utilization.

(9) Other Comprehensive Income

The following table presents
the tax effect of those items included in other comprehensive income:

Unrealized gains (losses)
on securities primarily represent gains (losses) on the Company's investments
in Galileo, Cendant and France Telecom as discussed in Note 6 "Investments."

(10) Short-Term Borrowings

At December 31, 2001, United
had outstanding $133 million in short-term borrowings, bearing an average
interest rate of 2.80%.  Receivables amounting to $145 million were
pledged by United to secure repayment of such outstanding borrowings.

(11)  Long-Term Debt

A summary of long-term debt,
including current maturities, as of December 31 is as follows (interest
rates are as of December 31, 2001):

See

Item 7A.  Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

for disclosures regarding
the fair values of debt.

In addition to scheduled
principal payments, in 2000 and 1999 the Company repaid $116 million and
$23 million, respectively, in principal amount of debentures prior to maturity. 
The debentures were scheduled to mature at various times through 2021. 
Extraordinary losses of $6 million and $3 million, respectively, net of
tax benefits of $4 million and $2 million, respectively, was recorded reflecting
amounts paid in excess of the debt carrying value.

The Company, through a special-purpose
financing entity that is consolidated, issued commercial paper which was
originally classified as long-term debt.  The proceeds from the commercial
paper were used to refinance certain equipment certificates supporting
leveraged lease transactions.  During 2001, the Company terminated
this transaction using proceeds from an interim bank facility to pay off
the commercial paper.  Subsequent to December 31, 2001, the Company
refinanced the interim bank facility to long-term and now classifies the
debt as a long-term obligation in the Company's statement of financial
position.

In July 2000, the Company
issued $921 million in enhanced equipment trust certificates ("EETCs")
to refinance certain owned aircraft and aircraft under operating leases. 
Net proceeds after refinancing the operating leases was $622 million. 
In December 2000, the Company issued an additional $1.5 billion in EETCs
to refinance certain owned aircraft and in August 2001, the Company issued
$1.5 billion in EETCs to finance certain owned aircraft.  Also during
2001, the Company issued $1.0 billion in long-term debt to finance the
acquisition of aircraft.

At December 31, 2001, United
had recorded $493 million in special facilities revenue bonds to finance
the acquisition and construction of certain facilities at Los Angeles,
San Francisco, Miami and Chicago.  United guarantees the payment of
these bonds under various payment and loan agreements.  The bond proceeds
are restricted to expenditures on the facilities and unspent amounts are
classified as other assets in the balance sheet.

At December 31, 2001, United
had outstanding a total of $2.7 billion of debt at variable rates from
2.30% to 6.35% based on specified spreads over LIBOR.

Maturities of long-term debt
for each of the four years after 2002 are:  2003 - $296 million; 2004
- - $927 million; 2005 - $330 million; and 2006 - $320 million.  Various
assets, principally aircraft, having an aggregate book value of $5.5 billion
at December 31, 2001, were pledged as security under various loan agreements.

(12)  Lease Obligations

The Company leases aircraft,
airport passenger terminal space, aircraft hangars and related maintenance
facilities, cargo terminals, other airport facilities, real estate, office
and computer equipment and vehicles.

Future minimum lease payments
as of December 31, 2001, under capital leases (substantially all of which
are for aircraft) and operating leases having initial or remaining noncancelable
lease terms of more than one year are as follows:

As of December 31, 2001,
United leased 300 aircraft, 69 of which were under capital leases. 
These leases have terms of 10 to 26 years, and expiration dates range from
2002 through 2020.  Under the terms of all leases, United has the
right to purchase the aircraft at the end of the lease term, in some cases
at fair market value and in others at fair market value or a percentage
of cost.  The present value of United's future minimum lease payments
under operating leases for aircraft and non-aircraft was $6.6 billion and
$4.4 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2001.

In connection with the financing
of certain aircraft accounted for as capital leases, United had on deposit
at December 31, 2001 an aggregate 41 billion yen ($314 million), 667 million
German marks ($304 million), 71 million French francs ($10 million), 30
million euro ($26 million) and $13 million in certain banks and had pledged
an irrevocable security interest in such deposits to certain of the aircraft
lessors.  These deposits will be used to pay off an equivalent amount
of recorded capital lease obligations.

Amounts charged to rent expense,
net of minor amounts of sublease rentals, were $1.4 billion in 2001, $1.5
billion in 2000 and $1.4 billion in 1999.  Included in 2001 rental
expense was $6

million in contingent rentals, resulting from changes
in interest rates for operating leases under which the rent payments are
based on variable interest rates.

(13)  Company-Obligated Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred
Securities of a Subsidiary Trust

In December 1996, UAL Corporation
Capital Trust I (the "Trust") issued $75 million of its 13 1/4% Trust Originated
Preferred Securities (the "Preferred Securities") in exchange for 2,999,304
depositary shares, each representing 1/1000 of one share of Series B 12
1/4% preferred stock (see Note 14 "Serial Preferred Stock").  Concurrent
with the issuance of the Preferred Securities and the related purchase
by UAL of the Trust's common securities, the Company issued to the Trust
$77 million aggregate principal amount of its 13 1/4% Junior Subordinated
Debentures (the "Debentures") due 2026.  The Debentures are and will
be the sole assets of the Trust.  The interest and other payment dates
on the Debentures correspond to the distribution and other payment dates
on the Preferred Securities.  Upon maturity or redemption of the Debentures,
the Preferred Securities will be mandatorily redeemed.  The Debentures
are redeemable at UAL's option, in whole or in part, on or after July 12,
2004, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount to be
redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. 
Upon the repayment of the Debentures, the proceeds thereof will be applied
to redeem the Preferred Securities.

There is a full and unconditional
guarantee by UAL of the Trust's obligations under the securities issued
by the Trust.  However, the Company's obligations are subordinate
and junior in right of payment to certain other of its indebtedness. 
UAL has the right to defer payments of interest on the Debentures by extending
the interest payment period, at any time, for up to 20 consecutive quarters. 
If interest payments on the Debentures are so deferred, distributions on
the Preferred Securities will also be deferred.  During any deferral,
distributions will continue to accrue with interest thereon.  In addition,
during any such deferral, UAL may not declare or pay any dividend or other
distribution on, or redeem or purchase, any of its capital stock.

The fair value of the Preferred
Securities at December 31, 2001 and 2000 was $57 million and $85 million,
respectively.

(14)  Serial Preferred Stock

At December 31, 2001, UAL
had outstanding 3,203,177 depositary shares, each representing 1/1000 of
one share of Series B 12 1/4% preferred stock, with a liquidation preference
of $25 per depositary share ($25,000 per Series B preferred share) and
a stated capital of $0.01 per Series B preferred share.  Under its
terms, any portion of the Series B preferred stock or the depositary shares
is redeemable for cash after July 11, 2004, at UAL's option, at the equivalent
of $25 per depositary share, plus accrued dividends.  The Series B
preferred stock is not convertible into any other securities, has no stated
maturity and is not subject to mandatory redemption.

The Series B preferred stock
ranks senior to all other preferred and common stock outstanding, except
the Preferred Securities, as to receipt of dividends and amounts distributed
upon liquidation.  The Series B preferred stock has voting rights
only to the extent required by law and with respect to charter amendments
that adversely affect the preferred stock or the creation or issuance of
any security ranking senior to the preferred stock.  Additionally,
if dividends are not paid for six cumulative quarters, the Series B preferred
stockholders are entitled to elect two additional members to the UAL Board
of Directors until all dividends are paid in full.  Pursuant to UAL's
restated certificate of incorporation, UAL is authorized to issue a total
of 50,000 shares of Series B preferred stock.

UAL is authorized to issue
up to 15,986,584 additional shares of serial preferred stock.

(15)  ESOP Preferred Stock

The following activity related
to UAL's outstanding ESOP preferred stocks (see Note 3 for a description
of the ESOPs):

An aggregate of 17,675,345
shares of Class 1 and Class 2 ESOP Preferred Stock was issued to employees
under the ESOPs.  Each share of ESOP Preferred Stock is convertible
into four shares of UAL common stock.  Shares typically are converted
to common as employees retire or otherwise leave the Company.  The
stock has a par value of $0.01 per share and is nonvoting.  The Class
1 and Class 2 ESOP Preferred Stocks have a liquidation value of $126.96
per share.  The Class 1 ESOP Preferred Stock provided a fixed annual
dividend of $8.8872 per share, which ceased on March 31, 2000; the Class
2 does not pay a fixed dividend.

Class P, M and S Voting Preferred
Stocks were established to provide the voting power to the employee groups
participating in the ESOPs.  Additional Voting Preferred Stock was
issued as shares of the Class 1 and Class 2 ESOP Preferred Stock were allocated
to employees.  In the aggregate, 17,675,345 shares of Voting Preferred
Stock were issued through the year 2000.  The Voting Preferred Stock
outstanding at any time commands voting power for approximately 55% of
the vote of all classes of capital stock in all matters requiring a stockholder
vote, other than for the election of members of the Board of Directors. 
The Voting Preferred Stock has a par value and liquidation preference of
$0.01 per share.  The stock is not entitled to receive any dividends
and is convertible into .0004 shares of UAL common stock.

Class Pilot MEC, IAM, SAM
and I junior preferred stock (collectively "Director Preferred Stocks")
were established to effectuate the election of one or more members to UAL's
Board of Directors.  One share each of Class Pilot MEC and Class IAM
junior preferred stock is authorized and issued.  The Company is authorized
to issue ten shares each of Class SAM and Class I junior preferred stock. 
There are three shares of Class SAM and four shares of Class I issued. 
Each of the Director Preferred Stocks has a par value and liquidation preference
of $0.01 per share.  The stock is not entitled to receive any dividends
and Class I will be redeemed automatically upon the transfer of the shares
to any person not elected to the Board of Directors or upon the occurrence
of the "Sunset."  (See "Corporate Governance and the ESOPs" in

Item
1.  Business

.)

(16) Common Stockholders' Equity

Changes in the number of
shares of UAL common stock outstanding during the years ended December
31 were as follows

:

During 2000 and 1999, the
Company repurchased 1,258,263 and 3,754,802 shares of common stock, respectively,
at a total purchase price of $81 million and $261 million, respectively.

(17) Stock Options and Awards

The Company has granted options
to purchase common stock to various officers and employees.  The option
price for all stock options is at least 100% of the fair market value of
UAL common stock at the date of grant.  Options generally vest and
become exercisable in four equal, annual installments beginning one year
after the date of grant, and generally expire in ten years.

The Company has also awarded
shares of restricted stock to officers and key employees.  These shares
generally vest over a five-year period and are subject to certain transfer
restrictions and forfeiture under certain circumstances prior to vesting. 
Unearned compensation, representing the fair market value of the stock
at the measurement date for the award, is amortized to salaries and related
costs over the vesting period.  During 2000 and 1999, respectively,
23,000 and 75,000 shares of restricted stock were issued from treasury. 
No shares were issued in 2001.  As of December 31, 2001, 93,400 shares
were restricted and unvested.  Additionally, 266,423 shares were reserved
for future awards under the plan.

Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" ("SFAS No.
123") establishes a fair value based method of accounting for stock options. 
The Company has elected to continue using the intrinsic value method of
accounting prescribed in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees," as permitted by SFAS No. 123.  Had
compensation cost for awards been determined based on the fair value at
the grant dates consistent with the method of SFAS No. 123, the Company's
net income and earnings per share would have instead been reported as the
pro forma amounts indicated below:

The weighted-average grant
date fair value of restricted shares issued was $51.83 for shares issued
in 2000 and $69.51 for shares issued in 1999.  The fair value of each
option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model with the following assumptions:

The Black-Scholes option
valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded
options which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. 
In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective
assumptions including expected stock price volatility.  Because the
Company's stock options have characteristics significantly different from
those of traded options and because changes in the subjective input assumptions
can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management's opinion,
the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure
of the fair value of its stock options.

During 2001, the Company
issued stock options to Mr. Creighton as of his employment date, in lieu
of other compensation.  These stock options were granted in October
2001 and vest ratably over six months from the date of grant.  Accordingly,
the assumptions used to calculate the fair value of these options were
as follows:  risk-free interest rate of 4.5%, dividend yield of 0%,
volatility of 46.0% and an expected life of four years.  These options
are included in the tables below.

Stock option activity for
the past three years was as follows:

The following information
related to stock options outstanding as of December 31, 2001:

(18) Retirement and Postretirement Plans

The Company has various retirement
plans, both defined benefit and defined contribution, which cover substantially
all employees.  The Company also provides certain health care benefits,
primarily in the U.S., to retirees and eligible dependents, as well as
certain life insurance benefits to retirees.  The Company has reserved
the right, subject to collective bargaining agreements, to modify or terminate
the health care and life insurance benefits for both current and future
retirees.

The following table sets
forth the reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the benefit
obligation and plan assets, the funded status and the amounts recognized
in the statement of financial position for the defined benefit and other
postretirement plans as of December 31:

The assumed health care cost
trend rate for gross claims paid was 8.0% for 2002 decreasing to an ultimate
rate of 4.5% in 2006.  The rate used for 2001 was 4.5%.

The net periodic benefit
cost included the following components:

Total pension expense for
all retirement plans (including defined contribution plans) was $629 million
in 2001, $302 million in 2000 and $285 million in 1999.

The projected benefit obligation,
accumulated benefit obligation, and fair value of plan assets for the plans
with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were $10.1
billion, $8.9 billion and $7.6 billion, respectively, as of December 31,
2001 and $1.0 billion, $632 million and $61 million, respectively, as of
December 31, 2000.

Assumed health care cost
trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health
care plan.  A one-percentage-point change in assumed health care trend
rate would have the following effects:

Changes in interest rates
or rates of inflation may impact the assumptions used in the valuation
of pension obligations and postretirement obligations including discount
rates and rates of increase in compensation, resulting in increases or
decreases in United's pension and postretirement liabilities and pension
and postretirement costs.

(19)  Financial Instruments and Risk Management

See

Item 7A. Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

("Item 7A") for a discussion
of the Company's foreign currency and fuel price risk management activities,
and the fair value of all significant financial instruments.

Credit Exposures of Derivatives

The Company's theoretical
risk in the derivative financial instruments described in Item 7A is the
cost of replacing the contracts at current market rates in the event of
default by any of the counterparties.  However, the Company does not
anticipate such default as counterparties are selected based on credit
ratings and the relative market positions with each counterparty are monitored.

Financial Guarantees

Special facility revenue
bonds have been issued by certain municipalities to build or improve airport
and maintenance facilities leased by United.  Under the lease agreements,
United is required to make rental payments in amounts sufficient to pay
the maturing principal and interest payments on the bonds.  At December
31, 2001, $1.2 billion principal amount of such bonds was outstanding. 
As of December 31, 2001, UAL and United had jointly guaranteed $35 million
of such bonds and United had guaranteed $1.2 billion of such bonds, including
accrued interest.  The payments required to satisfy these obligations
are included in the future minimum lease payments disclosed in Note 12
"Lease Obligations."

At December 31, 2001, United
guaranteed approximately $100 million of third-party debt.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

The Company does not believe
it is subject to any significant concentration of credit risk.  Most
of the Company's receivables result from sales of tickets to individuals
through geographically dispersed travel agents, including on-line agencies,
Company outlets, corporate travel departments or other airlines, often
through the use of major credit cards.  These receivables are short
term, generally being settled shortly after the sale.

(20)  Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Uncertainties

The Company has certain contingencies
resulting from litigation and claims (including environmental issues) incident
to the ordinary course of business.  Management believes, after considering
a number of factors, including (but not limited to) the views of legal
counsel, the nature of contingencies to which the Company is subject and
its prior experience, that the ultimate disposition of these contingencies
is not expected to materially affect UAL's consolidated financial position
or results of operations.  UAL records liabilities for legal and environmental
claims against it in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 
These amounts are recorded based on the Company's assessments of the likelihood
of their eventual settlements.  The amounts of these liabilities could
increase or decrease in the near term, based on revisions to estimates
relating to the various claims.

At December 31, 2001, commitments
for the purchase of property and equipment, principally aircraft, approximated
$2.8 billion, after deducting advance payments.  An estimated $1.2
billion will be spent in 2002, $0.1 billion in 2003, $0.5 billion in 2004
and $1.0 in 2005 and thereafter.  The major commitments are for the
purchase of A319, A320 and B777 aircraft, which are scheduled to be delivered
through 2007.  These commitments take into account the previously
announced deferral of future aircraft deliveries for 2002 and 2003 from
the originally planned 67 aircraft to 24 aircraft.

In connection with the construction
of the Indianapolis Maintenance Center, United agreed to spend an aggregate
$800 million on capital investments by the year 2001 and employ at least
7,500 individuals by the year 2004.  In the event such targets are
not reached, United may be required to make certain payments to the city
of Indianapolis and state of Indiana.  As a result of the events of
September 11 and the subsequent reduction in the Company's operations and
capital spending, United became obligated to refund approximately $32 million
to the state and local governments during the second quarter of 2002. 
This amount is included in "Other Accrued Liabilities" on the

Statement
of Consolidated Financial Position

at December 31, 2001.

Approximately 80% of United's
employees are represented by various labor organizations.  The contracts
with ALPA and the AFA become amendable in 2004 and 2006, respectively.

(21)  Segment Information

United has a global route
network designed to transport passengers and cargo between destinations
in North America, the Pacific, the Atlantic and Latin America.  These
regions constitute United's four reportable segments.  The accounting
policies for each of these segments are the same as those described in
Note 1 "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies," except that segment
financial information has been prepared using a management approach which
is consistent with how the Company's management internally disaggregates
financial information for the purpose of making internal operating decisions. 
UAL evaluates performance based on United's earnings before income taxes,
special charges and gains on sales.  Revenues are attributed to each
reportable segment based on the allocation guidelines provided by the DOT,
which classifies flights between the U.S. and foreign destinations as part
of each respective region.  A reconciliation of the total amounts
reported by reportable segments to the applicable amounts in the financial
statements follows:

UAL's operations involve
an insignificant level of dedicated revenue producing assets by reportable
segment.  The overwhelming majority of UAL's revenue producing assets
can be deployed in any of the four reportable segments.  UAL has significant
intangible assets related to the acquisition of its Atlantic and Latin
America route authorities.  During 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No.
142 which could impact the Company's accounting for these assets.

(23) Selected Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited)

The sum of quarterly earnings
per share amounts is not the same as annual earnings per share amounts
because of changing numbers of shares outstanding.

with a terminated merger with US Airways Group, Inc.

During the third quarter

and $49 million in non-operating expense for amounts relating to the September
11 terrorist attacks.  Additionally, in the third and fourth quarters
of 2001, UAL recognized $391 million and $261 million, respectively, in
compensation under the Act as non-operating income.  (See Note 2 "Special
Charges Related to the September 11 Terrorist Attacks.")

During the fourth quarter
of 2001, United recognized a gain of $261 million on the sale of its investments
in Galileo and Cendant.  (See Note 6 "Investments.")

During the third quarter
of 2000, UAL recorded an investment impairment of $61 million related to
its warrants in Priceline.com.  Additionally, in the fourth quarter
2000, UAL recognized a pre-tax gain of $109 million on the sale of its
investment in GetThere.com.  (See Note 6 "Investments.")
