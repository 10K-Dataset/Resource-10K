ITEM 1.  BUSINESS.
- ------   --------

     UAL Corporation ("UAL" or the "Company") was incorporated under
the laws of the State of Delaware on December 30, 1968.  The world
headquarters of the Company are located at 1200 East Algonquin Road,
Elk Grove Township, Illinois  60007.  The Company's mailing address
is P.O. Box 66919, Chicago, Illinois 60666.  The telephone number for
the Company is (847) 700-4000.

     The Company is a holding company and its principal subsidiary is
United Air Lines, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("United"), which is
wholly-owned.  United accounted for virtually all of the Company's
revenues and expenses in 1996.  United is a major commercial air
transportation company.

Airline Operations
- ------------------

     United has been engaged in the air transportation of persons,
property and mail since 1934, and certain of its predecessors began
operations as early as 1926.  United, which serves the United States,
29 foreign countries and two territories, is the world's largest
airline as measured by revenue passenger miles flown.  At the end of
1996, United served 139 airports.  During 1996, United averaged 2,198
departures daily, flew a total of 117 billion revenue passenger
miles, and carried an average of 224,000 passengers per day.

     United provides its domestic and international service
principally through a system of hub airports at major cities.  Each
hub provides United flights to a network of spoke destinations as
well as flights to the other United hubs.  This arrangement permits
travelers to fly from point of origin to more destinations without
changing carriers.  United has a global network of hubs primarily
designed to fly travelers between North America and the Pacific,
Latin America and Europe.  North American hubs include Chicago,
Denver, Washington, D.C., San Francisco and Los Angeles.  United also
operates a major hub operation at Tokyo.

     During the last several years, United has strengthened the
revenue generating capability of its hub airports by (1) adding new
spokes (routes to new cities), (2) adding frequencies on existing
segments, and (3) entering into marketing agreements with smaller
U.S. air carriers which serve less populated destinations, and with
foreign carriers to better serve existing markets as well as provide
service to destinations that United could not serve itself for
economic or regulatory reasons.  See "Alliances and Marketing
Arrangements."

     Since October 1994, United has operated a service, "Shuttle by
United", designed to compete with low cost carriers on routes under
750 miles.  While Shuttle by United is concentrated on the West
Coast, it has expanded to cover service between Denver and Las Vegas
and between Denver and Phoenix in February 1997.  As of February
1997, Shuttle by United was operating daily 452 flights on 23 routes
between 20 cities in the western U.S.  Shuttle by United is
strategically important to United by providing critical feed traffic
and market presence in the western U.S.

     Pacific.  Asian traffic is currently served from six U.S. cities
via United's Tokyo hub to Bangkok, Beijing, Hong Kong, Seoul,
Shanghai and Singapore.  In addition, United provides nonstop flights
from San Francisco to Hong Kong, Osaka, Seoul and Taipei; from Los
Angeles to Hong Kong and Osaka; and from Honolulu and Guam to Osaka.
Additionally, United provides service from Osaka to Seoul.  United
holds significant traffic rights "beyond" Japan and as capacity at
Japan's two major airports, Narita and Kansai, increases, United
hopes to add service from Japan to other Asian points.  During 1996
United began new service from Kansai to Seoul.

     South Pacific traffic to Sydney is served from Los Angeles and
San Francisco, while traffic to Auckland and Melbourne is served from
Los Angeles.  Based on reports filed with the Department of
Transportation, in 1996, United was the leading U.S. carrier in the
Pacific in revenue passenger miles and available seat miles.  During
1996, United's Pacific division accounted for 21% of United's
revenues.

     Europe.  Service between the U.S. and Europe is provided by:
flights from six U.S. cities to London with connecting service at
London to Amsterdam and New Delhi; flights from three U.S. cities to
Paris; nonstop service from Washington Dulles to Amsterdam, Brussels,
Frankfurt, Milan and Zurich; and nonstop service from Chicago to
Dusseldorf and Frankfurt.  United plans to initiate a second nonstop
flight between Chicago and London Heathrow in April 1997 operating
from April to the end of October.

     Latin America.  Service between the U.S. and Latin America is
provided by flights to twelve Latin American cities in ten countries
from a number of cities in the U.S.  Seven Latin American cities are
served nonstop from Miami, three nonstop flights from Los Angeles,
three from New York-Kennedy, and one each from Chicago-O'Hare and
Washington Dulles.  United plans to initiate nonstop service from
Chicago to Sao Paulo, Brazil in November 1997.

     Operating revenues attributed to United's foreign operations,
including service between the U.S. and foreign destinations, were
approximately $5.6 billion in 1996, $5.3 billion in 1995 and $4.9
billion in 1994.

     Alliances and Marketing Arrangements.  United, in cooperation
with other airlines, has formed alliances that seek to increase the
customer's choice of destinations and simplify the travel experience.
Alliances include "code share" flights which are operated by one
airline, but are listed with special flight code numbers as a flight
of each airline.  Alliances with international carriers have allowed
United to participate in markets that it is unable to serve on-line
for commercial or governmental reasons and to add new on-line United
destinations and frequencies.  Through joint frequent flyer
participation, code sharing of operations, reservations, baggage
handling, flight schedules and other enhanced customer service
coordination, the alliance carriers' goal is to provide each of their
customers a seamless global travel network.

     United's principal global alliance partner is Germany's flag
carrier, Lufthansa.  Through Lufthansa, United has dramatically
increased its trans-Atlantic operations to Europe and beyond,
including Eastern Europe and states of the former Soviet Union.
United and Lufthansa received antitrust immunity on May 20, 1996 from
the U.S. Department of Transportation, allowing the carriers to
expand and enhance their level of cooperation.

     United also implemented a code-share alliance in 1996 with the
Scandinavian flag carrier, SAS.  United, Lufthansa and SAS received
integrated antitrust immunity for their three-way alliance on
November 1, 1996.  Other major alliance partners include Air Canada,
Ansett (which operates in both Australia and New Zealand) and British
Midland.  After the U.S. and Thailand entered into a new bilateral
agreement, United and Thai Airways International began planning for
the implementation of the code-sharing provisions of their
comprehensive marketing arrangement; that agreement has been approved
in part; final approval is pending before the U.S. Department of
Transportation.  Also, United has entered into similar alliance
arrangements with Air New Zealand and Mexicana which are expected to
be implemented in 1997.  United's other alliance partners include
Aloha Airlines, Gulfstream International Airlines, Inc., TW Express,
ALM Antillean Airlines, Emirates, Saudi Arabian Airlines, Cayman
Airways, Aeromar and Aeromexico.

     In addition, United has a marketing program in North America,
known as the United Express program, under which six independent
regional carriers, utilizing mainly turboprop equipment, feed United
hubs and international gateways.  Currently, the carriers in the
United Express program provide service on United to 179 airports.

     Cargo Service.  United's cargo operations accounted for
approximately 5% of the Company's operating revenues in 1996.  In
1997, United entered the Asian and trans-Pacific cargo markets by 
introducing all cargo service between the U.S. and Asia operating 
DC-10-30F aircraft.  United began operating two DC-10-30F aircraft 
in March 1997 serving Chicago, Los Angeles, Anchorage, Osaka, Manila 
and Taipei; and in September 1997 United plans to operate another 
two aircraft which will expand service to New York, San Francisco 
and Tokyo.

     Mileage Plus Program.  United established the Mileage Plus
frequent flyer program to retain and develop passenger loyalty by
offering awards to frequent travelers for their business.  Mileage
Plus members earn mileage credit for flights on United, Shuttle by
United, United Express and certain other participating airlines, or
by utilizing services of other program participants, including
hotels, car rental companies and bank credit card issuers.  United
sells mileage credits to the other companies participating in the
program.  Mileage credits can be redeemed for free, discounted or
upgraded travel on United and other participating airlines, or for
other travel industry awards.  The program contains certain
restrictive provisions including expiration dates and blackout dates
and capacity controlled bookings, which substantially limit the use
of the awards on certain flights.

     Under the Mileage Plus program, award travel is priced at two
levels, Saver Awards which have restrictions and Standard Awards
which, for a higher mileage redemption level, carry no restrictions.
Saver Awards and Standard Awards require 25,000 and 40,000 miles,
respectively, for economy class travel within the continental United
States.  Effective for travel January 1998 and beyond, United
announced a requirement of a Saturday night stay and 14 day advance
purchase for Saver Award travel.  In addition, flight miles earned on
paid Air Canada, Lufthansa, SAS and Thai Airways International
flights will be credited toward Mileage Plus Premier status starting
in 1997.

     When an award level is attained, a liability is recorded for the
incremental costs of accrued credits under the Mileage Plus program
based on the expected redemptions.  United's incremental costs
include the costs of providing service for an otherwise vacant seat
including fuel, meals, certain incremental personnel and ticketing
costs.  The incremental costs do not include any contribution to
overhead or profit.

     At December 31, 1996 and 1995, it was estimated that the total
number of outstanding awards was approximately 6.1 million and 6.0
million, respectively.  United estimated that 4.7 million and 4.6
million, respectively, of such awards could be expected to be
redeemed and, accordingly, had recorded a liability amounting to $195
million and $195 million, respectively, at December 31, 1996 and
1995.  The difference between the awards expected to be redeemed and
the total awards outstanding is the estimate, based on historical
data, of awards (1) which will never be redeemed, (2) which will be
redeemed for other than free trips, or (3) which will be redeemed on
partner carriers.

     The number of awards used on United were 1.5 million, 1.8
million and 1.9 million for the years 1996, 1995 and 1994,
respectively.  Such awards represented 7%, 8.2% and 9.1% of United's
total revenue passenger miles for each period, respectively.  With
these percentages, seat availability and restrictions on the use of
free travel awards, the displacement, if any, of revenue passengers
by users of Mileage Plus awards is minimal.

Industry Conditions
- -------------------

     Seasonal and Other Factors.  The Company's results of operations
for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of those for an
entire year, because the air travel business is subject to seasonal
fluctuations.  United's first and fourth quarter results normally are
affected by reduced travel demand in the fall and winter, and
United's operations are often affected adversely by winter weather.
In the past, these fluctuations have generally resulted in better
operating results for United and, thus, the Company, in the second
and third quarters.

     The results of operations in the air travel business
historically fluctuate in response to general economic conditions.
In addition, the airline business is characterized by a high degree
of operating leverage.  As a result, the economic environment and
small fluctuations in United's yield (passenger revenue per revenue
passenger mile) and cost per available seat mile can have a
significant impact on operating results.  The Company anticipates
that seasonal factors and general economic conditions, in addition to
industrywide fare levels, capacity growth, labor and fuel costs,
competition from other airlines, taxes, U.S. and international
government policies and other factors, will continue to impact its
operating results.

     Competition and Fares.  The airline industry is highly
competitive.  In domestic markets, new and existing carriers are free
to initiate service on any route.  United faces competition from
other carriers on virtually every route it serves.  In United's
domestic markets, these competitors include all of the other major
U.S. airlines as well as smaller carriers, some of which have lower
cost structures than United.  United's response in some markets to
these lower cost structures has been the consummation of the employee
stock ownership transaction which took place on July 12, 1994 and
allowed United to lower its labor costs and introduce Shuttle by
United, a short-haul, high frequency operation.

     United's marketing strategy is driven by four principal factors:
schedule convenience, customer satisfaction, frequent flyer program
and price.  United seeks to attract travelers through convenient
scheduling, high quality service, a frequent flyer program designed
to reward and recognize customer loyalty and competitive pricing.
From time to time, excess aircraft capacity and other factors such as
the cash needs of financially distressed carriers induce airlines to
engage in "fare wars."  Such factors can have a material adverse
impact on the Company's revenues.  The Company maintains yield and
inventory management programs designed to manage the number of seats
offered in various fare categories in order to enhance the
effectiveness of fare promotions and maximize revenue production on
each flight.

     In its international service, United competes not only with U.S.
carriers but also with national flag carriers of foreign countries,
which in certain instances enjoy forms of governmental support which
are not available to U.S. carriers.  Competition on certain
international routes is subject to varying degrees of governmental
regulations (see "Government Regulation").  United has advantages
over foreign air carriers in its ability to generate U.S.-origin-
destination traffic from its integrated domestic route systems, and
because foreign carriers are prohibited by law from carrying local
passengers between two points in the United States.  On the other
hand, U.S. carriers in many cases are constrained from carrying
passengers to points beyond designated international gateway cities
due to limitations in air service agreements or restrictions imposed
unilaterally by foreign governments.  To compensate for these
structural limitations, U.S. and foreign carriers have entered into
alliances and marketing arrangements which allow the carriers to
provide feed to each other's flights.  (See "Alliances and Marketing
Arrangements").

     Computer Reservations Systems.  Travel agents account for a
substantial percentage of United's sales.  The use of electronic
distribution systems has been a key factor in the marketing and
distribution of airlines' products.

     United, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, owns 38% of Galileo
International Partnership ("Galileo"), formerly known as Covia, and
77% of Apollo Travel Services Partnership ("ATS").  These two general
partnerships own and market computer reservation system ("CRS")
products and services.  Galileo owns the Apollo and Galileo CRSs and
markets CRS services worldwide through a system of national
distribution companies.  ATS markets Apollo CRS products and services
to travel agencies in the United States, Mexico and the Caribbean.

     Competition among CRS vendors is intense, and services similar
to those offered by ATS and Galileo are marketed by several air
carriers and other concerns, both in the United States and worldwide.
In the European and Pacific CRS market, various consortia of foreign
carriers have formed CRSs to be marketed in countries in which the
owning carriers have a substantial presence.

Government Regulation
- ---------------------  

     General.  All carriers engaged in air transportation in the
United States are subject to regulation by the Department of
Transportation ("DOT") and the Federal Aviation Administration
("FAA") under federal aviation laws.  The DOT has authority to
regulate certain economic and consumer protection aspects of air
transportation.  It is empowered to issue certificates of public
convenience and necessity for domestic air transportation upon a
carrier's showing of fitness; to authorize the provision of foreign
air transportation by U.S. carriers; to prohibit unjust
discrimination; to prescribe forms of accounts and require reports
from air carriers; to regulate methods of competition, including the
provision and use of computerized reservation systems; and to
administer regulations providing for consumer protection, including
regulations governing the accessibility of air transportation
facilities for handicapped individuals.  United's operations require
certificates of public convenience and necessity issued by the DOT
(or specific exemptions therefrom), and an air carrier operating
certificate and related operations specifications issued by the FAA.

     United's operations also require licenses issued by the aviation
authorities of the foreign countries United serves.  Foreign aviation
authorities may from time to time impose a greater degree of economic
regulation than exists with respect to United's domestic operations.

     In connection with its international services, United is
required to file with the DOT and observe tariffs establishing the
fares charged and the rules governing the transportation provided.
In certain cases, fares and schedules require the approval of the
relevant foreign governments.  In addition, United's operating
authorities in international markets are governed by the aviation
agreements between the United States and foreign countries.  United's
ability to serve some foreign markets and its expansion in many
foreign markets is presently restricted by lack of aviation
agreements allowing such service or, in some cases, by the
restrictive terms of such agreements.

     Shifts in United States or foreign government aviation policies
can lead to the alteration or termination of existing air service
agreements that the U.S. has with other governments, which could
diminish the value of United's international route authority.  While
such events are generally the subject of inter-governmental
negotiations, there are no assurances that United's operating rights
under the bilateral aviation agreements and DOT-issued certificates
of public convenience and necessity can be preserved in such cases.

     Airport Access.  United's operations at Chicago-O'Hare
International Airport, JFK International, New York LaGuardia and
Washington National, are limited by the "high density traffic rule"
administered by the FAA.  Under this rule, take-off and landing
rights ("slots") required for the conduct of domestic flight
operations may be bought, sold or traded.  Under the high density
rule, carriers are required to relinquish slots to the FAA for
reallocation if they fail to meet certain minimum use standards.

     United currently holds a sufficient number and distribution of
slots at airports subject to the high density rule to support its
operations, although its ability to expand could be constrained if
sufficient additional slots were not available on satisfactory terms.
If an alternative to the current system were to be proposed and
adopted, no assurance can be given that such an alternative would
preserve United's investment in slots already acquired or that slots
adequate for future operations would be available.

     United currently has a sufficient number of leased gates and
other airport facilities at the cities it serves to meet its and near
term needs.  From time to time, expansion by United at certain
airports may be constrained by insufficient availability of gates on
attractive terms.  United's ability to expand its international
operations in the Pacific, Europe and Latin America is subject to
restrictions at many of the airports in these regions, including
noise curfews, slot controls and absence of adequate airport
facilities.

     Safety.  The FAA has regulatory jurisdiction over flight
operations generally, including equipment, ground facilities,
maintenance, communications and other matters.  In order to ensure
compliance with its operational and safety standards, the FAA
requires air carriers to obtain operating, airworthiness and other
certificates.  United's aircraft and engines are maintained in
accordance with the standards and procedures recommended and approved
by the manufacturers and the FAA.

     From time to time, the FAA issues airworthiness directives
("ADs") which require air carriers to undertake inspections and to
make unscheduled modifications and improvements on aircraft, engines
and related components and parts.  The ADs sometimes cause United to
incur substantial, unplanned expense and occasionally aircraft or
engines must be removed from service prematurely in order to undergo
mandated inspections or modifications on an accelerated basis.  The
issuance of any particular AD may have a greater or lesser impact on
United compared to its competitors depending upon the equipment
covered by the directive.

     Both the DOT and the FAA have authority to institute
administrative and judicial proceedings to enforce federal aviation
laws and their own regulations, rules and orders.  Both civil and
criminal sanctions may be assessed for violations.

     Environmental Regulations.  The Airport Noise and Capacity Act
of 1990 ("ANCA") requires the phase-out by December 31, 1999 of
Stage 2 aircraft operations, subject to certain waivers.  The FAA
has issued final regulations which require carriers to modify or
reduce the number of Stage 2 aircraft operated by 25% by December
31, 1994, 50% by December 31, 1996, 75% by December 31, 1998 and
100% by December 31, 1999.  Alternatively, a carrier could satisfy
compliance requirements by operating a fleet that is at least 55%
Stage 3 by December 31, 1994, 65% Stage 3 by December 31, 1996, 75%
Stage 3 by December 31, 1998 and 100% Stage 3 by December 31, 1999.
At December 31, 1996, United operated 427 Stage 3 aircraft
representing 72% of United's total operating fleet, and thus is in
compliance with these regulations.

     The ANCA generally recognizes the rights of operators of
airports with noise problems to implement local noise abatement
procedures so long as such procedures do not interfere unreasonably
with interstate or foreign commerce or the national air
transportation system.  ANCA generally requires FAA approval of local
noise restrictions on Stage 3 aircraft first effective after October
1990, and establishes a regulatory notice and review process for
local restrictions on Stage 2 aircraft first proposed after October
1990.  While United has had sufficient scheduling flexibility to
accommodate local noise restrictions imposed to the present, United's
operations could be adversely affected if locally-imposed regulations
become more restrictive or widespread.

     The Environmental Protection Agency regulates operations,
including air carrier operations, which affect the quality of air in
the United States.  United has made all necessary modifications to
its operating fleet to meet emission standards issued by the
Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA").

     Federal and state environmental laws require that underground
storage tanks (USTs) be upgraded to new construction standards and
equipped with leak detection by December 22, 1998.  These
requirements are phased into effect based on the age, construction
and use of existing tanks.  United operates a number of underground
and above ground storage tanks throughout its system, primarily used
for the storage of fuels and deicing fluids.  A program for the
removal or upgrading of USTs and remediation of any related
contamination has been ongoing since 1987.  Compliance with these
federal and state UST regulations is not expected to have a material
adverse effect on United's financial condition.

     United has been identified by the EPA as a potentially
responsible party with respect to Superfund and Resource Conservation
and Recovery Act sites involving soil and groundwater contamination at
the Bay Area Drum Site in San Francisco, California, the Chemsol, Inc.
Site in Piscataway, New Jersey, the Petrochem/Ekotek Site in Salt Lake
City, Utah, the Monterey Park Site at Monterey Park, California, the
West Contra Costa Sanitary Landfill Site in Richmond, California, and
the Douglasville Site in Berks County, Pennsylvania.  Because of the
limited nature of the volume of pollutants allegedly contributed by
United to the above sites, the outcome of these matters is not
expected to have a material adverse effect on United's financial
condition.  In addition, United is aware of soil and groundwater
contamination present on its leaseholds at several U.S. airports.
United is investigating these sites, assessing its obligations under
applicable environmental regulations and lease agreements and, where
appropriate, remediating these sites.  Remediation of these sites, for
which United may be responsible, is not expected to have a material
adverse effect on United's financial condition.

     Other Government Matters.  Besides the DOT and the FAA, other
federal agencies with jurisdiction over certain aspects of United's
operations are the Department of Justice (Antitrust Division and
Immigration and Naturalization Service), the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission, the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration, the Department of Labor (Office of Federal Contract
Compliance Programs of the Employment Standards Administration), the
National Mediation Board, the National Transportation Safety Board,
the Treasury Department (U.S. Customs Service), the Federal
Communications Commission (use of radio facilities by aircraft), and
the United States Postal Service (carriage of domestic and
international mail).  In connection with its service to cities in
other countries, United is subject to varying degrees of regulation
by foreign governments.

     In time of war or during an unlimited national emergency or
civil defense emergency declared by the President or the Congress of
the United States, or in a situation short of this if approved by the
Director of the Office of Emergency Preparedness, the Commander in
Chief, the Department of the Air Force Air Mobility Command ("AMC")
or any official designated by the President to coordinate all civil
and defense mobilization activities, United may be required to
provide airlift services to the AMC under the Civil Reserve Air Fleet
Program.  As of February 1, 1997, up to 26 B747 and 13 DC-10 aircraft
in United's fleet could be subject to these requirements.


Fuel
- ----

     United's results of operations are significantly affected by the
price and availability of jet fuel.  Based on 1996 fuel consumption,
every $.01 change in the average annual price-per-gallon of jet fuel
caused a change of approximately $29 million in United's annual fuel
costs.  The table below shows United's fuel expenses, fuel
consumption, average price per gallon and fuel as a percent of total
operating expenses for annual periods from 1992 through 1996:

                        1996     1995     1994     1993      1992

  operating expenses     14%      12%      12%      13%       14%


     United's average fuel cost per gallon in 1996 was 21.3% higher
than in 1995.  Changes in fuel prices are industry-wide occurrences
that benefit or harm United's competitors as well as United although
fuel hedging activities may affect the degree to which fuel price 
changes affect individual companies.  Lower fuel prices may be offset 
by increased price competition and lower revenues for all air carriers,
including United.  There can be no assurance that United will be able
to increase its fares in response to any increases in fuel prices in
the future.

     United purchases its fuel under supply contracts with U.S. and
international oil companies.  To assure adequate supplies of fuel and
provide a measure of control over fuel costs, United ships fuel on
major pipelines and stores fuel close to its major hub locations.
Although United has not experienced any problem with fuel
availability in the past few years and does not anticipate any in the
near future,  it is impossible to predict the future availability of
jet fuel.  If there were major reductions in the availability of jet
fuel, United's business would be adversely affected.

Insurance
- ---------

     United carries liability insurance of a type customary in the
air transportation industry, in amounts which it deems adequate,
covering passenger liability, public liability and property damage
liability.  The amount recoverable by United under aircraft hull
insurance covering all damage to its aircraft is not subject to any
deductible amount in the event of a total loss.

Employees - Labor Matters
- -------------------------

     UAL is the world's largest majority employee-owned company.  At
December 31, 1996, the Company and its subsidiaries had approximately
87,628 employees, of which approximately 85,921 were employed by
United (approximately twelve percent of whom are part-time employees)
and 1,707 were employed by United's subsidiaries.  Approximately 60%
of United's employees were represented by various labor
organizations.

     The employee groups, number of employees, labor organization and
current contract status for each of United's major collective
bargaining groups as of December 31, 1996 are as follows:

       *  However, certain provisions become amendable at a later date.

     United's relations with these labor organizations are governed
by the Railway Labor Act.  Under this Act, collective bargaining
agreements between United and these organizations become amendable
upon the expiration of their stated term.  If either party wishes to
modify the terms of any such agreement, it must notify the other
party before the contract becomes amendable.  After receipt of such
notice, the parties must meet for direct negotiations and, if no
agreement is reached, either party may request that a mediator be
appointed.  If no agreement is reached, the National Mediation Board
(the "NMB") may determine, at any time, that an impasse exists and
may proffer arbitration.

     Either party may decline to submit to arbitration.  If
arbitration is rejected, a 30-day "cooling off" period commences,
following which the labor organization may strike and the airline may
resort to "self-help," including the imposition of its proposed
amendments and the hiring of replacement workers.  However, if the
NMB determines that a dispute threatens substantially to interrupt
interstate commerce and notifies the President, the President can
delay a strike for a limited time by creating an emergency board to
investigate the dispute and report to the President.

adjustment and other labor agreement negotiations, see "Other
Information - Labor Agreements and Wage Adjustments" of Item 7,

       and expiration dates range from 1998 through 2020.  Under the
       terms of leases for 289 of the aircraft in the operating fleet,
       United has the right to purchase the aircraft at the end of the

     As of December 31, 1996, 61 of the 266 aircraft owned by United
were encumbered under debt agreements.

     In 1996 United took delivery of 21 new aircraft, seven A320-
200s, two B747-400s, four B757-200s and eight B777-200s.  United also
retired fifteen aircraft, seven B737-200s, three B747-100s and five
DC10-10s.

     As of December 31, 1996, United had 24 A319-100s, 14 A320-200s,
20 B777-200s, 21 B747-400s and six B757-200s on order which are

Ground Facilities
- -----------------

     In the vicinity of O'Hare, United owns a 106 acre complex
consisting of over one million square feet of office space for its
world headquarters, a computer facility and a training center.

     United's Maintenance Operation Center ("MOC") at San Francisco
International Airport occupies 129 acres of land, three million
square feet of floor space and 12 aircraft hangar docks under lease
expiring in 2003, with an option to extend for ten years.  Heavy
maintenance of aircraft and component maintenance for most of
United's fleet occurs at the MOC.  United has a major facility at the
Oakland, California airport which is dedicated to airframe
maintenance.  United also has line aircraft maintenance facilities at
64 domestic and international locations.

     United's Indianapolis Maintenance Center ("IMC") operates under
a lease with the Indianapolis Airport Authority which expires in
2031.  IMC is a major aircraft maintenance and overhaul facility and
is being used for maintenance of Boeing 737 and 757 aircraft.  United
is expanding its operations at IMC to maintain its fleets of Boeing
767 aircraft at the facility in the future.

     United operates under a lease and use agreement expiring in 2025
at Denver International Airport and occupies 44 gates and over one
million square feet of exclusive or preferential use terminal
building space.  United's flight training center located at the
former Stapleton International Airport was purchased by United from
the City and County of Denver in January, 1997.  This flight training
center presently consists of four buildings with a total of more than
300,000 square feet located on 22 acres of land.  An additional
building is currently under construction by United and, when
completed, the training center will accommodate 36 flight simulators
and over 90 computer-based training stations, as well as cockpit
procedures trainers, autoflight system trainers and emergency
evacuation trainers.

     United has entered into various leases relating to its use of
airport landing areas, gates, hangar sites, terminal buildings and
other airport facilities in most of the municipalities it serves.
Major leases expire at Chicago O'Hare in 2018, San Francisco in 2011,
Washington Dulles in 2014 and Los Angeles in 2021.  In many cases
United has constructed, at its expense, the buildings it occupies on
its leased properties.  In general, buildings and fixtures
constructed by United on leased land are the property of the lessor
upon the expiration of such leases. United also has leased and
improved ticketing, sales and general office space in the downtown
and outlying areas of most of the larger cities in its system.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.
         -----------------

     The Company is involved from time to time in legal proceedings
incidental to the ordinary course of its business.  Such proceedings
include claims brought by and against the Company or its subsidiaries
including claims seeking substantial compensatory and punitive
damages.  Such claims arise from routine commercial disputes as well
as incidents resulting in bodily injury and damage to property.  The
Company believes that the potential liabilities in all of the bodily
injury and property damage actions are adequately insured and none of
the other actions are expected to have any material adverse effect on
the Company or its subsidiaries.

1.  Travel Agency Commission Litigation -- United and six other
airlines were sued in various courts around the nation by travel
agents and the American Society of Travel Agents claiming as a class
action that the carriers acted collusively in violation of federal
antitrust laws when they imposed a cap on ticket sales commissions
payable to travel agencies by the carriers.  The cases were
consolidated before the federal court in Minneapolis.  As relief, the
plaintiffs sought an order declaring the carriers' commission cap
action to be illegal and the recovery of damages (trebled) to the
agencies resulting from that action.  On September 3, 1996, the
remaining parties (one defendant had settled earlier in the case)
agreed to settle the case by defendants' payment of money in return
for the plaintiffs' dismissal with prejudice of this lawsuit and a
full release.  United's share of the settlement is $19.5 million.
The caps on ticket sales commissions were unaffected by this
settlement.  The court approved the final settlement on January 28,
1997.

2.  Summers et al. v. State Street Bank and Trust Company et al. --
On April 14, 1995, plaintiffs filed a class action complaint against
State Street Bank and Trust Company ("State Street"), the UAL
Corporation Employee Stock Ownership Plan and the UAL Corporation
Supplemental ESOP (together, the "Plans") in the United States
District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.  The complaint
was brought on behalf of a putative class of all persons who are, or
were as of July 12, 1994, participants or beneficiaries of the Plans.
Plaintiffs alleged that State Street breached various fiduciary
duties under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
("ERISA") in connection with the 1994 purchase of UAL preferred stock
by the Plans.  The Plans were nominal defendants; no relief was
sought from them.  The complaint sought a declaration that State
Street violated ERISA, restoration to the Plans by State Street of
the amount of an alleged "overpayment" for stock, and other relief.
United is obligated, subject to certain exceptions, to indemnify
State Street for part or all of an adverse judgment and State
Street's defense costs.  The defendants filed a motion to dismiss the
complaint in its entirety on July 12, 1995.  On March 29, 1996 the
judge granted defendants' motion to dismiss in its entirety.  On
April 15, 1996 the defendants filed with the court a motion for
attorneys' fees and costs under ERISA.  Thereafter, plaintiffs filed
a notice of appeal of the judge's decision in favor of State Street
and an opposition to defendants' motion for attorneys' fees and
costs.  The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit
upheld the judge's decision in favor of State Street.  State Street's
motion to recover its attorneys' fees is pending before the district
court.

3.   GEC-Marconi Claim -- On April 4, 1996 United filed suit in the
Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, Law Division, against GEC-
Marconi Inflight Systems Overseas, Ltd. ("GMIS"), its Boeing 777
inseat video vendor, claiming breach of contract for GMIS's failure
to deliver the contracted product in the specified time frame, and
seeking monetary and injunctive relief.  United also named in the
suit GEC-Marconi Inflight Systems, Inc. ("GMIS, Inc."), its 777 video
maintenance provider, seeking declaratory relief on the maintenance
contract.  On July 19, 1996 GMIS and GMIS, Inc. filed a counterclaim
against United seeking in excess of $240 million for various alleged
breaches of contract by United, plus consequential damages and
attorney's fees and costs, relating to the same product purchase
agreement (which, in addition, included a Boeing 747 and 767 retrofit
order that United terminated on April 4, 1996) and maintenance
service agreement which form the basis of United's complaint, as well
as an alleged June 1996 "agreement" that had been the subject of
negotiations between the parties but was never signed by United
regarding interim arrangements between the parties.  GMIS and GMIS,
Inc. also seek injunctive relief to enforce the alleged "agreement"
and prevent United from obtaining substitute goods from other
vendors.  On August 1, GMIS and GMIS, Inc. filed an emergency motion
on the claims for injunctive relief.  On August 28, the judge denied
GMIS' and GMIS, Inc.'s motion for a preliminary injunction.  On
October 28, 1996 GMIS filed a Petition for Replevin seeking to
recover certain spare parts and consigned inventory currently in
United's possession.  On November 26, 1996, the court denied GMIS's
petition upon United's motion.  On December 23, 1996, United filed an
amended complaint, and GMIS filed an amended counterclaim on December
31, 1996.  The parties have exchanged preliminary discovery
documents.

4.   Fry v. UAL Corp. -- On February 21, 1990, a purported class
action complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the
Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division.   This complaint was
brought by several UAL stockholders, purportedly on behalf of all of
UAL stockholders who sold puts or common stock from October 29, 1987
through December 8, 1987.  The complaint alleged that UAL committed
common law fraud and violated Section 10(b) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder and the
Illinois Deceptive Trade Practices Act by falsely announcing that it
intended to distribute proceeds of sales of non-core businesses as a
special dividend, when in fact it was negotiating a cash tender offer
for the buyback of shares.  Plaintiffs claimed $160 million in
damages, plus attorneys' fees, fees and costs of plaintiff's
accountants and experts and other costs and disbursements.  UAL's
motion for summary judgment was granted on August 11, 1995, and that
decision was affirmed by the Seventh Circuit on May 23, 1996.  On
October 9, 1996, plaintiffs filed a petition for certiorari with the
U.S. Supreme Court.  The Court denied the petition on November 12,
1996.

     United may be affected by legal proceedings brought by owners of
property located near certain airports.  Plaintiffs generally seek to
enjoin certain aircraft operations and/or to obtain damages against
airport operators and air carriers as a result of alleged aircraft
noise or air pollution.  Any liability or injunctive relief imposed
against airport operations or air carriers could result in higher
costs to United and other air carriers.

     The ultimate disposition of the matters discussed in this Item
3, and other claims affecting the Company, are not expected to have a
material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition or
results of operations.

ITEM 5.  MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED
- ------   -------------------------------------------------
         STOCKHOLDER MATTERS.
         -------------------

     The Company's Common Stock, $.01 par value (the "Common Stock"),
is traded principally on the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE")
under the symbol UAL, and is also listed on the Chicago Stock
Exchange and the Pacific Stock Exchange.  The following sets forth
for the periods indicated the high and low sales prices per share of
the Company's Common Stock on the NYSE Composite Tape.

COMMON STOCK:
                          High                Low

     On May 6, 1996 UAL's Common Stock split four-for-one in the form
of a 300% stock dividend to holders of record at the close of
business on that date.  The per share prices above have been adjusted
for the stock split.

     No dividends have been declared on the Company's common stock
during the past five years.  The payment of any future dividends on
the Common Stock and the amount thereof will be determined by the
Board of Directors of the Company in light of earnings, the financial
condition of the Company and other relevant factors.  At March 1,
1997, based on reports by the Company's transfer agent for the Common
Stock, there were 12,976 common stockholders of record.  In addition,
there were 3,878 holders of record of the Company's old common stock,
$5 par value, who have not tendered their stock certificates as a result
of the employee stock ownership transaction.



Item 6.   Selected Financial Data
- ---------------------------------


Item 7.   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
          Condition and Results of Operations
- -----------------------------------------------------------
     This section contains forward-looking statements which
     are identified with an asterisk (*).  Factors that
     could significantly impact the expected results implied
     in the forward-looking statements are listed in the
     last paragraph of the section, "Outlook for 1997."
                              
      On July 12, 1994, the shareholders of UAL Corporation
("UAL") approved a plan of recapitalization that provides an
approximately 55% equity and voting interest in UAL to
certain employees of United Air Lines, Inc. ("United") in
exchange for wage concessions and work-rule changes.  The
employees' equity interest is being allocated to individual
employee accounts through the year 2000 under Employee Stock
Ownership Plans ("ESOPs") which were created as part of the
recapitalization.  Since the ESOP shares are being allocated
over time, the current ownership interest held by employees
is substantially less than 55%.  The entire ESOP voting
interest is currently exercisable, which generally will be
voted by the ESOP trustee at the direction of, and on behalf
of, the employees participating in the ESOPs.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Liquidity -
      UAL's total of cash and cash equivalents and short-
term investments was $697 million at December 31, 1996,
compared to $1.143 billion at December 31, 1995.  Operating
activities during the year generated $2.453 billion.  Cash
was used primarily to repay long-term debt and to fund net
additions to property and equipment.  In addition to the
early extinguishment of $641 million in principal amount of
various debt securities, UAL made mandatory repayments of
long-term debt totaling $150 million and payments under
capital lease obligations of $112 million during the year.
Financing activities also included payments of $324 million
for conversions of all of UAL's outstanding 6 3/8%
convertible debentures, $84 million for repurchases of UAL's
Series B preferred stock and deposits of an equivalent $110
million in Japanese yen with certain banks in connection
with the financing of certain capital lease transactions.

      In 1996, United took delivery of seven A320, eight
B777, four B757 and two B747 aircraft.  Thirteen of these
aircraft were purchased, three were acquired under operating
leases and five were acquired under capital leases.
Property additions, including aircraft, aircraft spare
parts, facilities and ground equipment, amounted to $1.538
billion, while property dispositions resulted in proceeds of
$55 million.

      Included in cash and cash equivalents at December 31,
1996 were $30 million of securities held by third parties
under securities lending agreements, as well as collateral
in the amount of 102% of the value of the securities lent.
United is obligated to reacquire the securities from the
borrower at the end of the contract.

      As of December 31, 1996, UAL had a working capital
deficit of $2.321 billion as compared to $1.390 billion at
December 31, 1995.  Historically, UAL has operated with a
working capital deficit and, as in the past, UAL expects to
meet all of its obligations as they become due.  In
addition, UAL may from time to time repurchase on the open
market, in privately negotiated purchases or otherwise,
debentures or preferred stock as part of its efforts to
reduce its obligations and improve its balance sheet.

      United has an agreement with a syndicate of banks for
a $750 million revolving credit facility expiring in 2002.
Interest on drawn amounts under the facility is calculated
at floating rates based on the London interbank offered rate
("LIBOR") plus a margin which is subject to adjustment based
on certain changes in the credit ratings of United's long-
term senior unsecured debt.  Among other restrictions, the
credit facility contains a covenant which restricts United's
ability to grant liens on or otherwise encumber certain
identified assets with a market value of approximately $1.1
billion.

      During the second quarter, United reduced the maximum
available borrowings under a separate short-term borrowing
facility from $270 million to $227 million.  This agreement
has been extended through February 1998.

      Prior Years.  Operating activities in 1995 generated
cash flows of $1.624 billion.  Cash was used primarily to
repay long-term debt, reacquire preferred stock, reduce
short-term borrowings and fund net additions to property and
equipment.  In addition to the early extinguishment of $750
million in principal amount of various debt securities, UAL
made mandatory repayments of long-term debt totaling $102
million.  Payments under capital lease obligations amounted
to $80 million during the year and short-term borrowings
were reduced by $269 million.  In addition, UAL spent $131
million to repurchase Series B preferred stock to be held in
treasury.  Property additions, including the acquisition of
39 previously leased aircraft, amounted to $1.111 billion.
Property dispositions resulted in proceeds of $578 million.

      Operating activities in 1994 generated cash flows of
$1.334 billion, which was offset by the distribution of $2.1
billion to holders of old UAL common stock under the
recapitalization.  This distribution was partially funded by
net proceeds of $735 million on the issuance of debentures
and $400 million on the issuance of Series B preferred
stock.  Subsequent to issuance, UAL spent $87 million to
repurchase Series B preferred stock to be held in treasury.
Other financing activities included principal payments under
debt and capital lease obligations of $305 million and $87
million, respectively, and a $46 million reduction of short-
term borrowings.  Property additions, including the
acquisition of two B747 aircraft and aircraft spare parts,
amounted to $636 million.  Property dispositions resulted in
proceeds of $432 million.

Capital Commitments -
      At December 31, 1996, commitments for the purchase of
property and equipment, principally aircraft, approximated
$6.9 billion, after deducting advance payments.  An
estimated $2.9 billion is due to be spent in 1997, $1.9
billion in 1998, $1.0 billion in 1999 and $1.1 billion in
2000 and thereafter.  The above amounts reflect firm orders
for 21 B747, 6 B757, 20 B777, 14 A320 and 24 A319 aircraft
to be delivered through 2002.  However, these amounts do not
include a recent order for an additional three A320 and four
A319 aircraft.  Under the Company's current fleet plan, the
above aircraft will principally be used to replace older
aircraft which will be retired.  As a result, the Company
expects only modest growth in its passenger fleet through
2002.

      During the third quarter, United renegotiated its
financing arrangements with Airbus Industrie and
International Aero Engines for the acquisition of A320-200
aircraft.  In connection therewith, United relinquished its
right to return such aircraft upon eleven months' notice.
As a result, the Company's capital commitments include the
14 A320s still to be delivered through 1998, and the
Company's future minimum lease payment disclosures now
include the A320s already delivered under operating lease.
This increase in future minimum lease payments of
approximately $1.9 billion has no impact on the reported
monthly rent expense for these aircraft.

      Consistent with UAL's strategic plan and the Company's
focus on attracting more high yield passengers, the Board of
Directors has authorized an investment of approximately $400
million in United's on-board product, including new aircraft
seats and other cabin improvements.  This amount, which is
expected to be spent during the next three years, is not
reflected in the above commitments.

      In connection with the construction of the
Indianapolis Maintenance Center, United agreed to spend an
aggregate $800 million on capital investments by the year
2001 and employ at least 7,500 individuals by the year 2004.
In the event such targets are not reached, United may be
required to make certain payments to the city of
Indianapolis and state of Indiana.



Capital Resources -
      Funds necessary to finance aircraft acquisitions are
expected to be obtained from internally generated funds,
irrevocable external financing arrangements or other
external sources.

      At December 31, 1996, up to $631 million of securities
could be issued under an effective shelf registration
statement UAL and United have on file with the Securities
and Exchange Commission.  Securities that can be issued
under the shelf include secured and unsecured debt,
equipment trust and pass through certificates, equity or a
combination thereof.  UAL's ability to issue equity
securities is limited by its restated certificate of
incorporation.

      At December 31, 1996, United's senior unsecured debt
was rated BB by Standard and Poor's ("S & P") and Baa3 by
Moody's Investors Service Inc. ("Moody's").  UAL's Series B
preferred stock and redeemable preferred securities were
rated B+ by S & P and Ba3 by Moody's.  In November 1996, S &
P revised its ratings outlook for both UAL and United's
securities from stable to positive.

      In April 1996, the stockholders of UAL Corporation
approved an increase in the number of authorized shares of
common stock from 100 million to 200 million shares, in
connection with a four-for-one split of the corporation's
common stock in the form of a 300% stock dividend effective
at the close of business on May 6, 1996.  All share and per
share data have been restated to give effect to this stock
split.

Results of Operations

      The results of operations in the airline business
historically fluctuate in response to general economic
conditions.  This is because small fluctuations in yield
(passenger revenue per revenue passenger mile) and cost per
available seat mile can have a significant effect on
operating results.  UAL anticipates industrywide fare
levels, capacity growth, low-cost competition, general
economic conditions, labor and fuel costs, taxes, U.S. and
international governmental policies and other factors will
continue to affect its operating results.

      The July 1994 employee investment transaction and
recapitalization resulted in non-cash compensation charges
for stock periodically committed to be released to employees
during the term of the ESOPs.  The amount of the non-cash
compensation expense in the future cannot be predicted,
because it is based on the future market value of UAL's
common stock.  Further, it is anticipated that tax
provisions (credits) in future periods could be impacted by
permanent differences between tax deductions and book
expenses related to the ESOPs.

Summary of Results -
      UAL's earnings from operations were $1.123 billion in
1996, compared to operating earnings of $829 million in
1995.  UAL's net earnings in 1996 were $533 million ($5.16
per share, primary; $5.04 per share, fully diluted),
compared to net earnings of $349 million in 1995 ($5.00 per
share, primary; $4.78 per share, fully diluted).  These
earnings include extraordinary losses of $67 million and $29
million, after tax, on early extinguishment of debt, in 1996
and 1995, respectively.

      The per share amounts for 1996 and 1995 include the
effects on equity of repurchases of Series B preferred stock
and, for 1996, include the effects on equity of the exchange
of mandatorily redeemable preferred securities for Series B
preferred stock.  For 1995, the per share amounts also
include the effects on equity of the exchange of convertible
debentures for Series A convertible preferred stock.  These
transactions had no effect on earnings; however, the effects
on equity are included as an adjustment to earnings
attributable to common shareholders in the computation of
earnings per share.  Excluding the preferred stock
transactions, UAL's 1996 earnings per share were $6.55,
primary, and $6.39, fully diluted; 1995 earnings per share
were $5.14, primary, and $4.90, fully diluted.

      Management believes that a more complete understanding
of UAL's results can be gained by viewing them on a pro
forma, "fully distributed" basis.  This approach considers
all ESOP shares which will ultimately be distributed to
employees throughout the ESOP period (rather than just the
shares committed to be released) to be immediately
outstanding and thus fully distributed.  Consistent with
this method, the ESOP compensation expense is excluded from
fully distributed net earnings, and ESOP convertible
preferred stock dividends are not deducted from earnings
attributable to common stockholders.  A comparison of
results reported on a fully distributed basis to results
reported under generally accepted accounting principles
(GAAP) is as follows:


1996 Compared with 1995 -

      Operating Revenues.  Operating revenues increased
$1.419 billion (10%).  United's revenue per available seat
mile increased 7% to 10.02 cents.  Passenger revenues
increased $1.238 billion (9%) due to a 4% increase in
United's revenue passenger miles and a 5% increase in yield
to 12.35 cents.  The following analysis by market is based
on information reported to the U.S. Department of
Transportation ("DOT"):

      Yield increases in the domestic (7%), Atlantic (7%)
and Latin American (4%) markets were partially offset by a
4% decrease in Pacific yield.  Domestic yield increased as a
result of a larger proportion of high yield business traffic
and fare levels influenced by the expiration of the Federal
passenger excise tax from January through August.  (See
"Outlook for 1997").  A weaker Japanese yen versus the
dollar had a significant negative impact on 1996 Pacific
yield.  (See "Foreign Operations").  Both domestic and
international revenue passenger miles increased by 4%.
Available seat miles increased 3% for the system, reflecting
increases of 4% in the Pacific and Latin American and 3% in
domestic markets.  Atlantic available seat miles remained
unchanged.  As a result, system passenger load factor
increased 1.2 points to 71.7%.

      Cargo revenues increased $16 million (2%).  Freight
ton miles increased 6% and mail ton miles increased 5%.  A
6% lower freight yield was only partially offset by a 3%
higher mail yield for an overall decrease in cargo yield of
3%.

      Other operating revenues increased $165 million (17%)
due to increases in frequent flyer program partner related
revenues, contract maintenance and fuel sales to third
parties.

      Operating Expenses.  Operating expenses increased
$1.125 billion (8%).  United's cost per available seat mile
increased 5% from 8.87 cents to 9.32 cents.  ESOP
compensation expense increased $181 million (36%),
reflecting a higher average common stock price in 1996.
Aircraft fuel increased $402 million (24%) due to a 2%
increase in consumption and a 21% increase in the average
price per gallon of fuel from 59.5 cents to 72.2 cents.
Without the increases in ESOP compensation expense and
aircraft fuel, United's cost per available seat mile would
have increased 2%.  Salaries and related costs increased
$193 million (4%) due principally to increased staffing in
certain customer-oriented positions.  Other expenses
increased $166 million (9%) due principally to costs
associated with sales to third parties of fuel, contract
maintenance and other work.  Purchased services increased
$125 million (12%) due principally to volume-related
increases in computer reservations fees, credit card
discounts and communication charges.  Aircraft maintenance
increased $42 million (10%) due to increased purchased
maintenance, as well as the timing of maintenance cycles.
Depreciation and amortization increased $35 million (5%) due
principally to a $30 million charge to reduce the carrying
value of aircraft seats that will be replaced under a plan
to improve the Company's onboard product.  Commissions were
flat year over year despite an increase in commissionable
revenues due to lower average commission rates.  These lower
rates were partially attributable to the full year effects
of a new travel agent commission plan introduced in 1995.
Aircraft rent decreased $57 million (6%) due to the
acquisition of 39 aircraft off-lease in the second half of
1995.

      Other Income and Expense.  Other expense amounted to
$153 million in 1996 compared to $208 million in 1995.
Interest capitalized, primarily on aircraft advance
payments, increased $35 million (83%).  Interest expense
decreased $104 million (26%) due to the prepayment of long-
term debt in 1995 and 1996 and the conversion of convertible
debentures in the second quarter of 1996.  Interest income
decreased $41 million (42%) due to lower investment
balances.  Equity in earnings of affiliates increased $16
million (33%) due to higher earnings from the Galileo
International Partnership resulting from increased booking
revenues.  Included in other expense for 1996 is a $20
million charge for the settlement of litigation related to
the travel agency commission cap implemented by the Company
in 1995.  In addition, 1995 included a $41 million pre-tax
gain on disposition of aircraft owned by Air Wisconsin,
Inc., a subsidiary of UAL.

1995 Compared with 1994 -

      Operating Revenues.  Operating revenues increased $993
million (7%).  United's revenue per available seat mile
increased 3% to 9.39 cents.  Passenger revenues increased
$932 million (8%) due primarily to a 3% increase in United's
revenue passenger miles and a 4% increase in yield to 11.79
cents.  The following analysis by market is based on
information reported to the DOT:

      Yield increases in the domestic (4%), Pacific (5%) and
Atlantic (9%) markets were offset by a 5% decrease in Latin
America yield.  Both domestic and international revenue
passenger miles increased by 3%.  Available seat miles
increased 4% systemwide, as increases of 8% and 4% on
Pacific and domestic routes, respectively, were partially
offset by a decrease of 3% in the Atlantic.  As a result,
United's system passenger load factor decreased 0.7 points
to 70.5%.

      Cargo revenues increased $72 million (11%).  Freight
ton miles increased 6% and mail ton miles increased 19%.  A
3% higher freight yield was offset by a lower mail yield for
an overall increase in cargo yield of 2%.  Other operating
revenues include a $43 million (30%) increase in Mileage
Plus partner related revenues, offset by a $50 million (24%)
decrease in fuel sales to third parties.

      Operating Expenses.  Operating expenses increased $685
million (5%).  United's cost per available seat mile also
increased 1% from 8.79 cents to 8.87 cents, which includes
the non-cash ESOP compensation expense.  Without this
expense, United's cost per available seat mile would have
been 8.55 cents versus 8.64 cents in 1994.  ESOP
compensation expense increased $322 million, reflecting a
higher average common stock price in 1995 combined with a
shorter expense period in 1994, as the recapitalization took
place on July 12, 1994.  Landing fees and other rent
increased $181 million (29%) due to increased facilities
rent, primarily due to new facilities at Denver, and
increased landing fees as the number of systemwide
departures increased 7%.  Aircraft rent increased $76
million (8%) as a result of new A320 and B777 aircraft on
operating leases.  Purchased services increased $115 million
(12%) due principally to volume-related increases in
computer reservations fees and credit card discounts.  An
increase of $95 million (6%) in aircraft fuel reflects a
capacity related increase in United's consumption of 5% and
an increase in United's average price per gallon to 59.5
cents from 58.8 cents.  The increase in average price per
gallon reflected a charge of approximately $20 million
resulting from the new federal fuel tax that took effect
October 1, 1995.  Commissions increased $45 million (3%) due
principally to increased commissionable revenues partially
offset by the effects of a new travel agents commission
payment plan.

      Salaries and related costs decreased $153 million (3%)
primarily due to the full-year effect of savings resulting
from wage and benefit reductions for employees participating
in the ESOPs and to $48 million of one-time ESOP related
costs recorded in 1994, partially offset by higher average
wage rates for other employee groups and increased staffing
in certain customer-oriented positions.  Other operating
expenses decreased $82 million (7%) due mainly to lower fuel
sales.

      Other Income and Expense.  Other expense amounted to
$208 million in 1995 compared to $350 million in 1994.
Interest expense increased $27 million (7%) due to the
issuance of $600 million principal amount of 6 3/8%
convertible subordinated debentures in exchange for Series A
preferred stock.  Interest income increased $13 million
(15%) due to higher average interest rates earned on
investments.  Equity in earnings of affiliates increased $28
million as a result of increased earnings at Galileo.
Included in "Miscellaneous, net" in 1995 were foreign
exchange losses of $20 million, a $60 million gain on
property dispositions and a $23 million charge for minority
interests in Apollo Travel Services Partnership ("ATS").
"Miscellaneous, net" in 1994 included charges of  $121
million for fees and costs incurred in connection with the
recapitalization, a $22 million charge for minority
interests in ATS and foreign exchange gains of $15 million.

      Income Tax Provision.  The income tax provision for
1994 was significantly impacted by the nondeductibility of
certain recapitalization costs.

Other Information

Labor Agreements and Wage Adjustments -
      The 1994 recapitalization resulted in new labor
agreements for certain employee groups and a new corporate
governance structure, which was designed to achieve balance
between the various employee-owner groups and public
shareholders.  The new labor agreements and governance
structure could inhibit management's ability to alter
strategy in a volatile, competitive industry by restricting
certain operating and financing activities, including the
sale of assets and the issuance of equity securities and the
ability to furlough employees.   UAL's ability to react to
competition may be hampered further by the fixed long-term
nature of these various agreements.  The labor agreements
with employees represented by the Air Line Pilots
Association, International ("ALPA") and the International
Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers ("IAM")
become amendable in the year 2000, the end of the ESOP
period.

      The various agreements supporting the July 1994
recapitalization provide that employees represented by ALPA
and the IAM, and non-union United States salaried and
management employees ("SAM Employees") may receive mid-term
wage increases beginning in 1997.  The Company recently
announced that it had reached tentative agreements with both
the ALPA and the IAM concerning mid-term wage adjustments.
Included in the agreements are a 5% increase for each union
group in July 1997 and a second 5% increase in July 1998.
Further, the agreement with ALPA calls for a corresponding
5% increase in both 1997 and 1998 to "book rates" (book
rates are used to compute certain other employee benefits),
and the agreement with the IAM also provides for lump sum
payments for all IAM employees and increases in hourly
license premium and skill pay for mechanics.    Although not
finalized, management has indicated it expects the SAM
Employees to receive an increase patterned after the IAM
tentative agreement.  Assuming such an increase for SAM
Employees, the cost to the Company in 1997 for all of these
wage and benefit adjustments will be approximately $120
million.  These costs are included in the Company's outlook
for 1997 (See "Outlook for 1997").

      In early 1997, management articulated a broader plan
for addressing employee compensation at the end of the ESOP
period, known as Vision 2000.  The goal of Vision 2000 is to
put employee compensation costs (including the effects of
base pay, benefits and work rules) on a competitive level
with peer group compensation elsewhere in the industry at
the conclusion of the ESOP period, and the establishment of
a universal variable pay plan so that all employees can
benefit when the Company prospers.*  Within this framework
the Company agreed to further changes in wages and benefits
as part of the tentative agreements reached with ALPA and
the IAM.  These agreements also provide for restoration of
wage rates for the two groups to levels that existed prior
to the recapitalization in July 1994, as well as restoration
of the Company's contribution to the pilots defined
contribution plan from its current rate of 1% to its pre-
ESOP rate of 9%.    The restoration of these wages and
benefits would become effective at the conclusion of the
ESOP period.  The ultimate cost to the Company of Vision
2000, particularly given that peer group compensation is
subject to change between now and the year 2000, is not
determinable, however these costs are expected to be
competitive within the industry.

      The tentative agreements reached with ALPA and the IAM
are subject to ratification by both groups of employees.
Employees covered under IAM's "all other agreement" had
previously agreed to a mid-term wage adjustment calling for
wage increases of 3% in each of 1997 and 1998 and 2% in each
of 1999 and 2000 with eligibility for lump-sum profit
sharing payments in 1998 and 1999 of up to 2%, depending on
the Company's performance in 1997 and 1998, respectively.
This group will have an opportunity to ratify the provisions
of the new agreement as a substitute for their current
negotiated arrangement.

      United's contract with the Association of Flight
Attendants ("AFA") became amendable March 1, 1996.  On April
9, 1996, United announced that the flight attendants had
rejected a previously announced tentative agreement.  United
and the AFA are involved in traditional negotiations under
the Railway Labor Act, which historically have taken several
years to complete.  While negotiations continue, the terms
of United's current flight attendant agreement will remain
in effect.

Foreign Operations -
      United generates revenues and incurs expenses in
numerous foreign currencies.  These expenses include
aircraft leases, commissions, catering, personnel costs,
reservation and ticket office services, customer service
expenses and aircraft maintenance.  Changes in foreign
currency exchange rates impact operating income through
changes in foreign currency-denominated operating revenues
and expenses.  Despite the adverse (favorable) effects a
strengthening (weakening) foreign currency will have on U.S.
originating traffic, a strengthening (weakening) of foreign
currencies tends to increase (decrease) reported revenue and
operating income because United's foreign currency-
denominated operating revenue generally exceeds its foreign
currency-denominated operating expense for each currency.
United's biggest net exposures are typically for Japanese
yen, Hong Kong dollars and Australian dollars.  During 1996,
yen-denominated operating revenue net of yen-denominated
operating expense was approximately 61 billion yen
(approximately $560 million), Hong Kong dollar-denominated
operating revenue net of Hong Kong dollar-denominated
operating expense was approximately 1,727 million Hong Kong
dollars (approximately $223 million) and Australian dollar-
denominated operating revenue net of Australian dollar-
denominated operating expense was approximately 193 million
Australian dollars (approximately $152 million).

      Other non-operating income (expense) is also affected
by transaction gains and losses resulting from exchange rate
fluctuations.  The foreign exchange gains and losses
recorded by United result from the impact of exchange rate
changes on translation of foreign currency-denominated
assets and liabilities.  To the extent that yen-denominated
liability balances are predictable, United currently
attempts to minimize transaction gains and losses by
investing in yen-denominated time deposits or entering into
yen forwards to offset the impact of rate changes.  (See
"Risk Management").  In addition, United has entered into
foreign currency swap and forward contracts to reduce
exposure to currency fluctuations in connection with other
long-term yen-denominated obligations.

      United's foreign operations involve insignificant
amounts of physical assets; however, there are sizable
intangible assets related to acquisitions of foreign route
authorities.  Operating authorities in international markets
are governed by bilateral aviation agreements between the
United States and foreign countries.  Changes in U.S. or
foreign government aviation policies can lead to the
alteration or termination of existing air service agreements
that could adversely impact the value of United's
international route authority.  Significant changes in such
policies could also have a material impact on UAL's
operating revenues and results of operations.

Risk Management -
      United mitigates its exposure to fluctuations in any
single foreign currency by carrying passengers and cargo in
both directions between the U.S. and almost every major
economic region in the world.  Also, United reduces its
exposure to transaction gains and losses by converting
excess local currencies generated to U.S. dollars.  Further,
the Company has attempted to minimize some of its exposure
to jet fuel price changes by utilizing fixed price contracts
with suppliers for up to 10% of its annual consumption
needs.  With the exception of these efforts, historically
the Company has done little to actively manage the impact of
these risks on expected future cash flows from operations.

      In 1997, United intends to become more active in
hedging its risks related to foreign currency fluctuations
and movements in jet fuel prices through the use of various
derivative financial instruments including, but not limited
to, options, forwards, swaps and futures contracts.  The
Company's Risk Tolerance Committee, a group of senior
officers of the Company, is responsible for setting
acceptable levels of risk and reviewing risk management
activities, subject to oversight by the Board of Director's
Audit Committee.  United's goal is not to speculate in these
areas, but rather to make its financial results more stable
and predictable.

Deferred Tax Assets -
      UAL's consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 1996
includes a net deferred tax asset of $359 million, compared
to $474 million at December 31, 1995.  The net deferred tax
asset is composed of approximately $1.928 billion of
deferred tax assets and $1.569 billion of deferred tax
liabilities.  The deferred tax assets include, among other
things, $644 million related to obligations for
postretirement and other employee benefits, $428 million
related to gains on sales and leasebacks, $231 million
related to alternative minimum tax ("AMT") credit
carryforwards and $11 million of federal and state net
operating loss ("NOL") carryforwards.  The AMT credit
carryforwards do not expire; the federal NOL carryforwards
will expire in 2007 if not utilized prior to that time.

      Management believes that a majority of the deferred
tax assets will be realized through reversals of existing
deferred tax liabilities with similar reversal patterns and
the balance will be realized as a result of generating
future taxable income.

      UAL's ability to generate sufficient amounts of
taxable income from future operations is dependent upon
numerous factors, including general economic conditions,
inflation, fuel costs, the state of the industry and other
factors beyond management's control.  There can be no
assurances that UAL will meet its expectation of future
taxable income.  However, based on the extended period over
which postretirement benefits will be recognized, and the
indefinite carryforward period for AMT credits, management
believes it is more likely than not that future taxable
income will be sufficient to utilize the deferred tax assets
at December 31, 1996.

Safety and Security Measures -
          During 1996, President Clinton formed a special
commission to review aviation safety and airport security.
In February 1997, the commission issued its final report
calling for increased safety and security measures and
improvements in the air traffic control infrastructure.
Although the extent of specific programs and their related
implementation schedules are still not clear, further
increases in government-mandated security measures may have
an adverse affect on the Company's results of operations
and financial condition depending upon such factors as the
ability of United to pass through any new Federal taxes,
surcharges or additional operating expenses to customers.
Any effective increase in the cost of air transportation
may dampen passenger and cargo traffic levels and have a
dilutive effect on yield.

Airport Rents and Landing Fees -
      United is charged facility rental and landing fees at
virtually every airport at which it operates.  In recent
years, many airports have increased or sought to increase
rates charged to airlines as a means of compensating for
increasing demands upon airport revenues.  Airlines have
challenged certain of these increases through litigation and
in some cases have not been successful.  The Federal
Aviation Administration ("FAA") and the DOT have instituted
an administrative hearing process to judge whether rate
increases are legal and valid.  However, to the extent the
limitations on such charges are relaxed or the ability of
airlines to challenge such charges is restricted, the rates
charged by airports may increase substantially.  Management
cannot predict the magnitude of any such increase.

Environmental and Legal Contingencies -
      United has been named as a Potentially Responsible
Party at certain Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA")
cleanup sites which have been designated as Superfund Sites.
United's alleged proportionate contributions at the sites
are minimal; however, at sites where the EPA has commenced
litigation, potential liability is joint and several.
Additionally, United has participated and is participating
in remediation actions at certain other sites, primarily
airports.  The estimated cost of these actions is accrued
when it is determined that it is probable that United is
liable.  Such accruals have not been material.
Environmental regulations and remediation processes are
subject to future change, and determining the actual cost of
remediation will require further investigation and
remediation experience.  Therefore, the ultimate cost cannot
be determined at this time.  However, while such cost may
vary from United's current estimate, United believes the
difference between its accrued reserve and the ultimate
liability will not be material.

      UAL has certain other contingencies resulting from
this and other litigation and claims incident to the
ordinary course of business.  Management believes, after
considering a number of factors, including (but not limited
to) the views of legal counsel, the nature of such
contingencies and prior experience, that the ultimate
disposition of these contingencies is not likely to
materially affect UAL's financial condition, operating
results or liquidity.*

Outlook for 1997 -
      Real Gross Domestic Product in the U.S. is expected to
continue to grow moderately at a rate of 2.0% to 2.5%.  U.S.
domestic airline industry capacity growth is expected to
grow 2% to 3% in 1997, a slight decrease from its 1996
growth rate.  The growth rate of small, low-cost carriers is
expected to be lower in 1997 than 1996.

      The Company anticipates continued strong performance
in 1997.  Available seat miles are expected to increase
3.5%, with revenue per available seat mile up approximately
3%.  Costs per available seat mile excluding ESOP charges
are expected to increase approximately 2%.  This unit cost
forecast reflects lower fuel prices in 1997 than in 1996.
It also assumes a mid-term wage adjustment, for all employee
groups participating in the ESOP (see "Labor Agreements and
Wage Adjustments").

      For the first quarter, United expects total system
revenue per available seat mile to increase by 6% to 7%
versus the same period last year, on 3.5% higher capacity.
System load factor should approximate 70%.  Costs per
available seat mile excluding ESOP charges are expected to
increase 4% (excluding fuel also the expected increase is 2%
to 3%) over the first quarter of 1996.

      United expects the Federal passenger excise tax, which
expired again on December 31, 1996 to be reinstated in March
1997.  While the authority to collect this tax is scheduled
to expire once again at the end of the third quarter, the
Company expects a replacement funding mechanism, either
reinstatement of the current tax or a substitute user-based
fee system, to go into effect at the end of this period.
However, the Company is unable to determine what effect, if
any, reinstatement of the tax will have on the domestic
pricing environment.

      In 1997, United expects to introduce a dedicated fleet
of four DC10-30 cargo freighters to its cargo operations.
All of the aircraft are currently in the Company's passenger
fleet, and after being converted to freighters, two will be
brought into the cargo operations during the first quarter
and two during the third quarter.  As a result, cargo
revenues and to a lesser extent the related costs are
expected to increase significantly in 1997.  For the first
quarter, cargo revenues are expected to be 8% to 9% higher
than the first quarter of 1996.

      United expects to take delivery of  31 aircraft in
1997, consisting of 4 A319s, 5 A320s, 6 B747s, 2 B757s and
14 B777s and retire 23 aircraft from its existing passenger
fleet.

      The information included in the above outlook section,
as well as certain statements made throughout the
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations that are identified by an asterisk
(*), is forward-looking and involves risks and uncertainties
that could result in actual results differing materially
from expected results.  It is not reasonably possible to
itemize all of the many factors and specific events that
could affect the outlook of an airline operating in the
global economy.  Some factors that could significantly
impact expected capacity, load factors, yields, revenues,
expenses, unit costs, capital spending, cash flows and
margins include the airline pricing environment, willingness
of customers to travel, fuel cost, low-fare carrier
expansion, capacity decisions of other carriers, cost of
safety and security measures, actions of the U.S. and foreign
governments, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations,
inflation, the economic environment of the airline industry,
the general economic environment, the price of UAL common
stock and other factors discussed herein.  With respect to
the forward-looking statement set forth in the
"Environmental and Legal Contingencies" section, some of the
factors that could affect the ultimate disposition of these
contingencies are changes in applicable laws, the
development of facts in individual cases, settlement
opportunities and the actions of plaintiffs, judges and
juries.  With respect to the forward-looking statements set
forth in the "Labor Agreements and Wage Adjustments"
section, some of the factors that could affect the ability
of the Company to achieve its goals are the ratification of
the mid-term wage agreements, wage rates of peer groups at
the Company's competitors, compensation levels in the
industry and the status of the Company's relationships with
the union groups.


                              
Item 8.  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
- ----------------------------------------------------  




          REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
                              
                              

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors,
     UAL Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying statement of consolidated
financial position of UAL Corporation (a Delaware
corporation) and subsidiary companies as of December 31,
1996 and 1995, and the related statements of consolidated
operations, consolidated cash flows and consolidated
shareholders' equity for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 1996.  These financial statements
and the schedule referred to below are the responsibility of
the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements based on our
audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally
accepted auditing standards.  Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements.  An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide
a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of UAL Corporation and subsidiary
companies as of December 31, 1996 and 1995, and the results
of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 1996, in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

Our audits were made for the purpose of forming an opinion
on the basic financial statements taken as a whole.  The
schedule referenced in Item 14 (a) (2) herein is presented
for purposes of complying with the Securities and Exchange
Commission's rules and is not part of the basic financial
statements.  This schedule has been subjected to the
auditing procedures applied in the audit of the basic
financial statements and, in our opinion, fairly states in
all material respects the financial data required to be set
forth therein in relation to the basic financial statements
taken as a whole.

         Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(1)  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
- -----------------------------------------------
     (a)  Basis of Presentation - UAL Corporation ("UAL") is a holding 
company whose principal subsidiary is United Air Lines, Inc. ("United"). 
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of UAL and 
all of its majority-owned affiliates (collectively "the Company").  All 
significant intercompany transactions are eliminated.  Investments in
affiliates are carried on the equity basis.

     (b)  Use of Estimates - The preparation of financial statements in 
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires 
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported 
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported 
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual 
results could differ from those estimates.

     (c)  Airline Revenues - Passenger fares and cargo revenues are 
recorded as operating revenues when the transportation is furnished.  
The value of unused passenger tickets is included in current liabilities.

     (d)  Foreign Currency Transactions - Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are converted at exchange rates in 
effect at the balance sheet date.  The resulting foreign exchange gains 
and losses are charged or credited directly to income.  United has entered 
into foreign currency swap and forward contracts to reduce certain exposure
to currency fluctuations.  Foreign currency gains and losses on the 
contracts are included in income currently, offsetting the foreign 
currency losses and gains on the obligations.

     (e)  Cash and Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments - Cash 
in excess of operating requirements is invested in short-term, highly 
liquid, income-producing investments.  Investments with a maturity of 
three months or less on their acquisition date are classified as cash 
and cash equivalents.  Other investments are classified as short-term 
investments.  The proceeds from sales of available-for-sale securities 
are included in interest income for each respective year.

     From time to time, United lends certain of its securities 
classified as cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments to 
third parties.  United requires collateral in an amount exceeding the 
value of the securities and is obligated to reacquire the securities at 
the end of the contract.  United accounts for these transactions as 
secured lendings rather than sales, and so does not remove the
securities from the balance sheet.

     (f)  Aircraft Fuel, Spare Parts and Supplies - Aircraft fuel and 
maintenance and operating supplies are stated at average cost.  Flight 
equipment spare parts are stated at average cost less an obsolescence 
allowance.

     (g)  Operating Property and Equipment - Owned operating property 
and equipment is stated at cost.  Property under capital leases, and the 
related obligation for future minimum lease payments, are initially 
recorded at an amount equal to the then present value of those lease 
payments.

     Depreciation and amortization of owned depreciable assets is based 
on the straight-line method over their estimated service lives.  
Leasehold improvements are amortized over the remaining period of the 
lease or the estimated service life of the related asset, whichever is 
less.  Aircraft are depreciated to estimated salvage values, generally 
over lives of 10 to 30 years; buildings are depreciated over lives of 25
to 45 years; and other property and equipment are depreciated over lives 
of 3 to 15 years.

     Properties under capital leases are amortized on the straight-line 
method over the life of the lease, or in the case of certain aircraft, 
over their estimated service lives.  Lease terms are 10 to 30 years for 
aircraft and flight simulators and 25 years for buildings.  Amortization 
of capital leases is included in depreciation and amortization
expense.

     Maintenance and repairs, including the cost of minor replacements, 
are charged to maintenance expense accounts.  Costs of additions to and 
renewals of units of property are charged to property and equipment 
accounts.

     (h)  Intangibles - Intangibles consist primarily of route 
acquisition costs and intangible pension assets (see Note 15).  Route 
acquisition costs are amortized over 40 years.

     (i)  Mileage Plus Awards - United accrues the estimated
incremental cost of providing free travel awards earned under its 
Mileage Plus frequent flyer program (including awards earned from 
mileage credits sold) when such award levels are reached.  United, 
through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Mileage Plus Holdings, Inc., 
sells mileage credits to participating partners in the Mileage Plus 
program.  The resulting revenue is recorded in other operating revenues 
during the period in which the credits are sold.

     (j)  Deferred Gains - Gains on aircraft sale and leaseback 
transactions are deferred and amortized over the lives of the leases 
as a reduction of rental expense.

(2)  Employee Stock Ownership Plans and Recapitalization
- --------------------------------------------------------
     On July 12, 1994, the shareholders of UAL approved a plan of 
recapitalization to provide an approximately 55% equity interest in 
UAL to certain employees of United in exchange for wage concessions 
and work-rule changes.  The employees' equity interest is being 
allocated to individual employees through the year 2000 under Employee 
Stock Ownership Plans ("ESOPs") which were created as a part of the 
recapitalization.  Pursuant to the terms of the plan of recapitalization, 
holders of old UAL common stock received approximately $2.1 billion in
cash and the remaining 45% of the equity in the form of new common stock.

     The ESOPs established as part of the recapitalization cover the 
pilots, U.S. management and salaried employees and U.S. union ground 
employees.  The ESOPs include a "Leveraged ESOP", a "Non-Leveraged ESOP" 
and a "Supplemental ESOP."  Both the Leveraged ESOP and the 
Non-Leveraged ESOP are tax qualified plans while the Supplemental ESOP 
is not a tax qualified plan.  The purpose of having the three ESOPs is 
to deliver the agreed-upon shares to employees in a manner which
utilizes the tax incentives available to tax qualified ESOPs to the 
greatest degree possible.  Accordingly, shares are delivered to 
employees primarily through the Leveraged ESOP, secondly, through the 
Non-Leveraged ESOP, and lastly, through the Supplemental ESOP.

     The equity interests are being delivered to employees through 
two classes of preferred stock (Class 1 and Class 2 ESOP Preferred 
Stock, collectively "ESOP Preferred Stock"), and the voting interests 
are being delivered through three separate classes of preferred stocks 
(Class P, M and S Voting Preferred Stock,  collectively "Voting 
Preferred Stock").  The Class 1 ESOP Preferred Stock is being delivered 
to an ESOP trust in seven separate sales through January 1, 2000 under
the Leveraged ESOP, three of which have already taken place.  Based on 
Internal Revenue Code limitations, shares of the Class 2 ESOP Preferred 
Stock are either contributed to the Non-Leveraged ESOP or allocated as 
"book entry" shares to the Supplemental ESOP, annually through the year 
2000.  The classes of preferred stock are described more fully in Note
12, ESOP Preferred Stock.

     The Leveraged ESOP and Non-Leveraged ESOP are being accounted for 
under AICPA Statement of Position 93-6, "Employers' Accounting for 
Employee Stock Ownership Plans" ("SOP").  For the Leveraged ESOP, as 
shares of Class 1 ESOP Preferred Stock are sold to an ESOP trust, the 
Company reports the issuance as a credit to additional capital invested 
and a corresponding charge to unearned ESOP preferred stock.  Shares
are committed to be released to employees on a pro rata basis through 
April 12, 2000.  ESOP compensation expense is recorded for the average 
fair value of the shares committed to be released during the period 
with a corresponding credit to unearned ESOP preferred stock for the 
cost of the shares.  Any difference between the fair value of the 
shares and the cost of the shares is charged or credited to additional 
capital invested.  For the Non-Leveraged ESOP, the Class 2 ESOP
Preferred Stock is recorded as additional capital invested as the 
shares are committed to be contributed, with the offsetting entry to 
ESOP compensation expense.  The ESOP compensation expense is based on 
the average fair value of the shares committed to be contributed, in 
accordance with the SOP.  The Supplemental ESOP is being accounted for 
under Accounting Principles Board Opinion 25, "Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees."

     Shares of ESOP Preferred Stock are legally released or allocated 
to employee accounts as of year-end.  Dividends on the ESOP Preferred 
Stock are also paid at the end of the year.  Dividends on unallocated 
shares are used by the ESOP to pay down the loan from UAL and are not 
considered dividends for financial reporting purposes.  Dividends on 
allocated shares are satisfied by releasing shares from the ESOP's 
suspense account to the employee accounts and are charged to equity.

     ESOP compensation expense was $685 million and $504 million in 
1996 and 1995, respectively.  During 1994, the Company recorded $182 
million of ESOP compensation expense for the period July 13 through 
December 31, 1994.  During 1996, 2,402,310 shares of Class 1 ESOP 
Preferred Stock, 359,577 shares of Class 2 ESOP Preferred Stock and 
2,735,905 shares of Voting Preferred Stock were allocated to employee 
accounts, and another 312,086 shares of Class 2 ESOP Preferred Stock
were allocated in the form of "book entry" shares, effective
December 31, 1995.  Another 21,970 shares of Class 2 ESOP preferred 
stock previously allocated in book entry form were issued and either 
contributed to the qualified plan or converted and sold on behalf of 
terminating employees.  At December 31, 1996, the year-end allocation 
of Class 1 ESOP Preferred Stock to employee accounts had not yet been
completed.  There were 2,345,749 shares of Class 1 ESOP Preferred Stock 
committed to be released and 1,127,292 shares held in suspense by the 
ESOP as of December 31, 1996.  For the Class 2 ESOP Preferred Stock, 
728,224 shares were committed to be contributed to employees at 
December 31, 1996.  The fair value of the unearned ESOP shares recorded 
on the balance sheet at December 31, 1996 and 1995 was $309 million and 
$230 million, respectively.

     For the Class 2 ESOP Preferred Stock committed to be contributed 
to employees under the Supplemental ESOP, employees can elect to 
receive their "book entry" shares in cash upon termination of 
employment.  The estimated fair value of such shares at December 31, 
1996 was $206 million.

(3)  Other Income (Expense) - Miscellaneous
- -------------------------------------------
      Other income (expense) - "miscellaneous, net" consisted of the 
following:


     (1)  As a result of the Company's adoption of Statement of Financial 
          Accounting Standards No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of 
          Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of," 
          net gains on disposition property or rights for 1996, which 
          amounted to $11 million, are included in operating expenses as 
          a component of depreciation and amortization.

(4)  Affiliates
- ---------------
     United owns 38% of the Galileo International Partnership
("Galileo") through a wholly-owned subsidiary.  United's investment 
in Galileo, which owns the Apollo and Galileo computer reservations 
systems, is carried on the equity basis.  Included in the Company's 
accumulated deficit is approximately $147 million of undistributed 
earnings of Galileo and its predecessor companies.

     Under operating agreements with Galileo, United purchases
computer reservations services from Galileo and provides marketing, 
sales and communication services to Galileo.  Revenues derived from 
the sale of services to Galileo amounted to approximately $249 
million in 1996, $238 million in 1995 and $233 million in 1994.  The 
cost to United of services purchased from Galileo amounted to 
approximately $114 million in 1996, $104 million in 1995 and $94 
million in 1994.

     United also owns 77% of the Apollo Travel Services Partnership 
("ATS"), whose accounts are consolidated.  ATS markets the Apollo 
computer reservations system to travel agencies in the United States, 
Mexico and the Caribbean.  Below is a summary of ATS' contribution to 
the Company's consolidated results, net of intercompany eliminations and
minority interests:




(5)  Per Share Amounts
- ----------------------
     Earnings per share are presented on both a primary and a
fully diluted basis.  Primary earnings per share were computed
based on weighted average common shares and common equivalents
outstanding, including ESOP shares committed to be released.
In addition, fully diluted per share amounts assume the 
conversion of convertible debentures (for periods not actually
converted) and elimination of related interest.


       (1) In April 1995, UAL issued convertible subordinated
       debentures in exchange for Series A preferred stock and
       recorded a non-cash increase of $45 million in additional 
       capital invested representing the excess of the carrying
       value of the preferred stock exchanged over the fair
       value of the debentures.  In December 1996, a UAL-controlled 
       trust issued trust-originated preferred securities in
       exchange for shares of Series B preferred stock and recorded
       a non-cash decrease of $27 million in additional capital 
       invested representing the excess of the fair value of the
       new securities over the carrying value of Series B.  Also,
       during the last three years, the Company repurchased shares 
       of its Series B preferred stock, resulting in increases to
       additional capital invested representing the excess of 
       amounts paid to reacquire the preferred stock over the 
       liquidation preference of such stock.  These transactions
       had no effect on earnings; however, their net impact on
       UAL's equity is included in the computation of earnings
       per share.

       (2) Common stock equivalents are not included in 1994 as
       they are anti-dilutive.

     In April 1996, the stockholders of UAL Corporation approved an 
increase in the number of authorized shares of common stock from 
100 million to 200 million shares, in connection with a four-for-one 
split of the corporation's common stock in the form of a 300% stock 
dividend effective at the close of business on May 6, 1996.  All 
share and per share data have been restated to give effect to this 
stock split.

     In addition, in connection with the July 1994 recapitalization, 
each old common share was exchanged for one-half share of new common 
stock.  As required under generally accepted accounting principles 
for transactions of this type, the historical weighted average 
shares outstanding were not restated except as mentioned above for 
the 1996 stock split.  Further, the 1995 and 1996 periods include 
the average number of ESOP preferred shares considered outstanding 
during each respective period.  Thus, direct comparisons between 
earnings per share amounts are not meaningful.

(6)  Income Taxes
- -----------------
     In 1996, the regular tax liability of the Company
exceeded the alternative minimum tax ("AMT") liability resulting
in a utilization of AMT credits.  The federal income tax
liability is the greater of the tax computed using the regular
tax system or the tax under the AMT system.  However, if the
regular tax liability exceeds the AMT liability and AMT
credits are available, the AMT credits are used to reduce the
net tax liability to the amount of the AMT liability.  During
1996, UAL utilized $34 million of AMT credits.

     The provision for income taxes is summarized as follows:

     The income tax provision differed from amounts computed
at the statutory federal income tax rate, as follows:

     Temporary differences and carryforwards which give rise
to a significant portion of deferred tax assets and liabilities 
for 1996 and 1995 are as follows:


     At December 31, 1996, UAL and its subsidiaries had $231
million of federal AMT credit carryforwards available for an
indefinite period, $4 million of general business credit
carryforwards which expire between 2003 and 2007, $5 million
of foreign tax credit carryforwards expiring between 2000 and
2001, $8 million of state tax benefit from net operating loss
carryforwards expiring between 1999 and 2011 and $3 million of
federal tax benefit from net operating loss carryforwards
expiring in 2007.

     UAL's ability to generate sufficient amounts of taxable
income from future operations is dependent upon numerous
factors, including general economic conditions, inflation,
fuel costs, the state of the industry and other factors beyond
management's control.  There can be no assurances that UAL
will meet its expectation of future taxable income.  However,
based on the extended period over which postretirement
benefits will be recognized, and the indefinite carryforward
period for AMT credits, management believes it is more likely
than not that future taxable income will be sufficient to
utilize the deferred tax assets at December 31, 1996.

(7)  Short-Term Borrowings
- --------------------------
     United has an agreement with a syndicate of banks for a
$750 million revolving credit facility expiring in 2002.
Interest on drawn amounts under the facility is calculated at
floating rates based on the London interbank offered rate
("LIBOR") plus a margin which is subject to adjustment based
on certain changes in the credit ratings of United's long-term
senior unsecured debt.  Among other restrictions, the credit
facility contains a covenant which restricts United's ability
to grant liens on or otherwise encumber certain identified
assets with a market value of approximately $1.1 billion.

     During the second quarter of 1996, United reduced the
maximum available amount of borrowings under a separate short-
term borrowing facility from $270 million to $227 million.
This agreement has been extended through February 1998.

(8)  Long-Term Debt
- -------------------
     A summary of long-term debt, including current
maturities, as of December 31 is as follows (interest rates
are as of December 31, 1996):


     In addition to scheduled principal payments, in 1996 and
1995 the Company repaid $149 million and $228 million,
respectively, in principal amount of secured notes and $492
million and $327 million, respectively, in principal amount of
debentures prior to maturity.  These obligations were
scheduled to mature at various times from 2000 through 2021.
Extraordinary losses of $67 million and $29 million,
respectively, net of tax benefits of $40 million and $18
million, respectively, were recorded, reflecting amounts paid
in excess of the debt carrying value.

     In April 1995, UAL issued $600 million aggregate principal 
amount of 6 3/8% convertible subordinated debentures, due 2025, 
for all outstanding shares of its Series A convertible preferred 
stock.  On March 20, 1996, UAL issued a redemption notice for all 
outstanding 6 3/8% convertible subordinated debentures.  Prior to 
the May 1 redemption date, debenture holders elected to convert all 
of their outstanding debentures into an aggregate of $324 million 
in cash and 7,623,092 shares of common stock.  These conversions 
resulted in a net reduction to long-term debt of $545 million and an
increase of $218 million in additional capital invested.

     At December 31, 1996, there was outstanding $16 million in 
convertible debentures, which are obligations of Air Wis Services, 
Inc. ("Air Wis"), a wholly owned subsidiary of UAL.  The debentures 
are convertible into shares of UAL common stock at the conversion 
price of $87.13.  During 1996 and 1995, Air Wis reacquired $8 million 
and $5 million, respectively, of these debentures, resulting in 
insignificant gains.

     At December 31, 1996, United had outstanding a total of
$197 million of long-term debt bearing interest at rates 85 to
128 basis points over LIBOR.  In connection with certain of
these debt financings, United has entered interest rate swap
agreements to effectively fix interest rates at December 31,
1996 at 8.554% on $33 million of notional amount (see Note
17).

     Maturities of long-term debt for each of the four years
after 1997 are:  1998 - $78 million; 1999 - $47 million; 2000
- - $51 million; and 2001 - $43 million.  Various assets,
principally aircraft, having an aggregate book value of $865
million at December 31, 1996, were pledged as security under
various loan agreements.

     At December 31, 1996, UAL and United had an effective
shelf registration statement on file with the Securities and
Exchange Commission to offer up to $631 million of securities,
including secured and unsecured debt, equipment trust and pass
through certificates, equity or a combination thereof.  UAL's
ability to issue equity securities is limited by its restated
certificate of incorporation.

(9)  Lease Obligations
- ----------------------
     The Company leases aircraft, airport passenger terminal
space, aircraft hangars and related maintenance facilities,
cargo terminals, other airport facilities, real estate, office
and computer equipment and vehicles.

     Future minimum lease payments as of December 31, 1996,
under capital leases (substantially all of which are for
aircraft) and operating leases having initial or remaining
noncancelable lease terms of more than one year are as
follows:


     As of December 31, 1996, United leased 298 aircraft, 54 of 
which were under capital leases.  These leases have terms of 4 to 
26 years, and expiration dates range from 1997 through 2020.

     In connection with the financing of certain aircraft accounted 
for as capital leases, United had on deposit at December 31, 1996 
an aggregate 19 billion yen ($168 million) in certain banks and had 
pledged an irrevocable security interest in such deposits to the 
aircraft lessors.  These deposits will be used to pay off an 
equivalent amount of recorded capital lease obligations.

     Amounts charged to rent expense, net of minor amounts of
sublease rentals, were $1.424 billion in 1996, $1.439 billion
in 1995, and $1.222 billion in 1994.  Included in 1996 rent
expense was $15 million in contingent rentals, resulting from
changes in interest rates for operating leases under which the
rent payments are based on variable interest rates.  In
connection with certain of these leases, United has entered
into interest rate swap agreements (see Note 17).

(10)  Company-Obligated Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred
Securities of a Subsidiary Trust
- --------------------------------------------------------
     In December 1996, UAL Corporation Capital Trust I (the
"Trust") issued $75 million of its 13 1/4% Trust Originated
Preferred Securities (the "Preferred Securities") in exchange
for 2,999,304 depositary shares of the Company, each
representing 1/1000 of one share of Series B 12 1/4% preferred
stock (see Note 11).  Concurrent with the issuance of the
Preferred Securities and the related purchase by UAL of the
Trust's common securities, the Company issued to the Trust $77
million aggregate principal amount of its 13 1/4% Junior
Subordinated Debentures (the "Debentures") due 2026.  The
Debentures are and will be the sole assets of the Trust.  The
interest and other payment dates on the Debentures correspond
to the distribution and other payment dates on the Preferred
Securities.  Upon maturity or redemption of the Debentures,
the Preferred Securities will be mandatorily redeemed.  The
Debentures are redeemable at UAL's option, in whole or in
part, on or after July 12, 2004, at a redemption price equal
to 100% of the principal amount to be redeemed, plus accrued
and unpaid interest to the redemption date.  Upon the
repayment of the Debentures, whether at maturity, upon
redemption or otherwise, the proceeds thereof will be applied
to redeem the Preferred Securities.

     There is a full and unconditional guarantee by UAL of the
Trust's obligations under the securities issued by the Trust.
However, the Company's obligations are subordinate and junior
in right of payment to certain other of its indebtedness.  UAL
has the right to defer payments of interest on the Debentures
by extending the interest payment period, at any time, for up
to 20 consecutive quarters.  If interest payments on the
Debentures are so deferred, distributions on the Preferred
Securities will also be deferred.  During any deferral,
distributions will continue to accrue with interest thereon.
In addition, during any such deferral, UAL may not declare or
pay any dividend or other distribution on, or redeem or
purchase, any of its capital stock.

     The transaction resulted in a reduction of approximately
$102 million to paid in capital as the fair value of the
Preferred Securities issued exceeded the carrying value ($75
million) of the exchanged Series B preferred stock.  The
difference between the assigned value of the Preferred
Securities and their redemption value ($27 million) will be
amortized against distributions on the Preferred Securities
over their term.

(11)  Serial Preferred Stock
- ----------------------------
     In connection with the July 1994 recapitalization, UAL
issued 16,416,000 depositary shares, each representing 1/1000
of one share of Series B 12 1/4% preferred stock, resulting in
net proceeds of $400 million, which was recorded as additional
capital invested.  The shares issued had an aggregate
liquidation preference of $410 million, or $25 per depositary
share ($25,000 per Series B preferred share), and a stated
capital of $164 ($0.01 per Series B preferred share).  Under
its terms, any portion of the Series B preferred stock or the
depositary shares is redeemable for cash after July 11, 2004,
at UAL's option, at the equivalent of $25 per depositary
share, plus accrued dividends.  The Series B preferred stock
is not convertible into any other securities, has no stated
maturity and is not subject to mandatory redemption.

     The Series B preferred stock ranks senior to all other
preferred and common stocks, except the Preferred Securities,
as to receipt of dividends and amounts distributed upon
liquidation.  The Series B preferred stock has voting rights
only to the extent required by law and with respect to charter
amendments that adversely affect the preferred stock or the
creation or issuance of any security ranking senior to the
preferred stock.  Additionally, if dividends are not paid for
six cumulative quarters, the Series B preferred stockholders
are entitled to elect two additional members to the UAL Board
of Directors until all dividends are paid in full.  Pursuant
to UAL's restated certificate of incorporation, UAL is
authorized to issue a total of 50,000 shares of Series B
preferred stock.

     As discussed in Note 10, in December 1996, UAL Corporation 
Capital Trust I, a Delaware statutory business trust controlled 
by UAL, exchanged mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of 
the subsidiary trust for 2,999,304 depositary shares of Series B 
preferred stock of UAL.

     Series B preferred stock issued and outstanding consisted
of the following (dollars in millions):


     UAL is authorized to issue up to 15,986,584 additional
shares of serial preferred stock.  The repurchased shares are
held in treasury by UAL.

(12)  ESOP Preferred Stock
- --------------------------
     The following activity relates to UAL's outstanding ESOP
preferred stocks (see Note 2 for a description of the ESOPs):


     An aggregate of 17,675,345 shares of Class 1 and Class 2
ESOP Preferred Stock will be issued to employees under the
ESOPs.  Each share of ESOP Preferred Stock is convertible into
four shares of UAL common stock and shares are converted to
common as employees retire or otherwise leave the Company.
The stock has a par value of $0.01 per share and is nonvoting.
The Class 1 ESOP Preferred Stock has a liquidation value of
$126.96 per share plus all accrued and unpaid dividends; the
Class 2 does not have a liquidation value.  The Class 1 ESOP
Preferred Stock provides a fixed annual dividend of $8.8872
per share, which ceases on March 31, 2000; the Class 2 does
not pay a fixed dividend.

     Class P, M and S Voting Preferred Stocks were established
to provide the voting power to the employee groups
participating in the ESOPs.  Additional Voting Preferred Stock
is issued as shares of the Class 1 and Class 2 ESOP Preferred
Stock are allocated to employees.  In the aggregate,
17,675,345 shares of Voting Preferred Stock will be issued
through the year 2000.  The Voting Preferred Stock at any time
outstanding commands voting power for approximately 55% of the
vote of all classes of capital stock in all matters requiring
a stockholder vote, other than for the election of members of
the Board of Directors.  The Voting Preferred Stock will
generally continue to represent approximately 55% of the
aggregate voting power until the "Sunset."  The "Sunset" will
occur when the common shares issuable upon conversion of the
outstanding Class 1 and Class 2 ESOP Preferred Stock, plus any
common equity (generally common stock issued or issuable at
the time of the recapitalization) and available unissued ESOP
shares held in the ESOPs or any other employee benefit plans
sponsored by the Company for the benefit of its employees,
represent, in the aggregate less than 20% of the common equity
and available unissued ESOP shares of the Company.  For
purposes of defining the "Sunset" employee ownership is
approximately 62% at December 31, 1996.  The Voting Preferred
Stock has a par value and liquidation preference of $0.01 per
share.  The stock is not entitled to receive any dividends and
is convertible into .0004 shares of UAL common stock.

     Class Pilot MEC, IAM, SAM and I junior preferred stock
(collectively "Director Preferred Stocks") were established to
effectuate the election of one or more members to UAL's Board
of Directors.  One share each of Class Pilot MEC and Class IAM
junior preferred stock is authorized and issued.  The Company
is authorized to issue ten shares each of Class SAM and Class
I junior preferred stocks.  There are three shares of Class
SAM and four shares of Class I issued.  Each of the Director
Preferred Stocks has a par value and liquidation preference of
$0.01 per share.  The stock is not entitled to receive any
dividends and Class I will be redeemed automatically upon the
transfer of the shares to any person not elected to the Board
of Directors or upon the occurrence of the "Sunset."

(13)  Common Shareholders' Equity
- ---------------------------------
     Changes in the number of shares of UAL common stock
outstanding during the years ended December 31 were as
follows:


     At December 31, 1996 and 1995, UAL held 701,616 and
477,233 shares, respectively, of common stock in treasury.

(14)  Stock Options and Awards
- ------------------------------
     The Company has granted options to purchase common stock
to various officers and employees.  The option price for all
stock options is at least 100% of the fair market value of UAL
common stock at the date of grant.  Options generally vest and
become exercisable in four equal, annual installments
beginning one year after the date of grant, and generally
expire in ten years.

     As a result of the 1994 recapitalization, all outstanding
options became fully vested at the time of the transaction and
the holders of such options became eligible to utilize the
cashless exercise features of stock options.  Under a cashless
exercise, the Company withholds, at the election of the
optionee, from shares that would otherwise be issued upon
exercise, that number of shares having a fair market value
equal to the exercise price and/or related income taxes.  For
outstanding options eligible for cashless exercise, changes in
the market price of the stock are charged to earnings
currently.  The expense recorded for such eligible options was
$15 million for 1996, $27 million in 1995, and $15 million in
1994.

     Stock options which were outstanding at the time of the
recapitalization are exercisable for shares of old common
stock, each of which is in turn converted into two shares of
new common stock and $84.81 in cash upon exercise.  Subsequent
to the recapitalization, the Company granted stock options
which are exercisable for shares of new common stock.

     The Company has also awarded shares of restricted stock
to officers and key employees.  These shares generally vest
over a five-year period and are subject to certain transfer
restrictions and forfeiture under certain circumstances prior
to vesting.  Unearned compensation, representing the fair
market value of the stock at the measurement date for the
award, is amortized to salaries and related costs over the
vesting period.  As a result of the 1994 recapitalization, all
outstanding nonvested shares of restricted stock became vested
at the time of the transaction and $12 million of compensation
expense was recorded for the remaining balance of unearned
compensation attributable to the outstanding shares at that
time.

     In 1994, subsequent to the recapitalization, 451,068
restricted shares of new common stock were issued from
treasury, and in 1995, an additional 892,852 restricted shares
were issued from treasury. As of December 31, 1996, 619,120
shares were restricted and still nonvested.  Additionally,
353,200 shares were reserved for future awards under the plan.
In 1996, 1995 and 1994, 70,488, 43,000 and 39,200 shares,
respectively, were forfeited and returned to treasury stock.

     In October 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
("SFAS") No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation."
SFAS No. 123 establishes a fair value based method of
accounting for stock options.  The Company has elected to
continue using the intrinsic value based method of accounting
prescribed in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
"Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," as permitted by
SFAS No. 123.  If the fair-value based method accounting
provisions of SFAS No. 123 had been adopted as of the
beginning of 1995, the effect on 1995 and 1996 net earnings
would have been immaterial.  The effects on 1995 and 1996 may
not be representative of the effects SFAS No. 123 may have in
future years, because no grants prior to January 1, 1995 have
been considered.

     Stock option activity for the past three years was as
follows:





     The following information relates to stock options outstanding as 
of December 31, 1996:


(15)  Retirement Plans
- ----------------------
     The Company has various retirement plans which cover
substantially all employees.  Defined benefit plans covering certain 
employees (primarily union ground employees) provide a stated 
benefit for specified periods of service, while defined benefit 
plans for other employees provide benefits based on employees' 
years of service and average compensation for a specified period 
of time before retirement.  The Company's goal is to fully fund 
the estimated present value of its accumulated benefit obligation 
under the plans.  The Company also provides several defined 
contribution plans which cover substantially all U.S. employees 
who have completed one year of service.  For certain groups of 
employees (primarily pilots, salaried employees hired after 
February 1, 1994 and employees of Mileage Plus, Inc.), the Company 
contributes an annual amount on behalf of each participant, 
calculated as a percentage of the participants' earnings or a 
percentage of the participants' contributions.

     The following table sets forth the defined benefit plans'
funded status and amounts recognized in the statements of
financial position as of December 31:


     Total pension expense for all retirement plans (including
defined contribution plans) was $252 million in 1996, $193 million in 
1995, and $350 million in 1994.

     Plan assets are invested primarily in governmental and
corporate debt instruments and corporate equity securities.

     The net periodic pension cost of defined benefit plans included 
the following components:


     Changes in interest rates or rates of inflation may
impact the assumptions used in the valuation of pension
obligations, including discount rates and rates of increase in
compensation, resulting in increases or decreases in United's
pension liability and net periodic pension cost.

(16)  Other Employee Benefits
- -----------------------------
     The Company provides certain health care benefits,
primarily in the U.S., to retirees and eligible dependents.
Benefits are generally funded from Company assets on a current
basis, although amounts sufficient to pay claims incurred, but
not yet paid, are held in trust at year-end.  Certain plan
benefits are subject to co-payments, deductibles and other
limits described in the plans and the benefits are reduced
once a retiree becomes eligible for Medicare.  The Company
also provides certain life insurance benefits to retirees.
The assets to fund retiree life insurance benefits are being
held in a deposit trust administration fund with a major
insurance company.  The Company has reserved the right,
subject to collective bargaining agreements, to modify or
terminate the health care and life insurance benefits for both
current and future retirees.

     Information on the plans' funded status, on an aggregate
basis at December 31,
follows:


     Net postretirement benefit costs included the following
components:
                                                        

     The assumed health care cost trend rates were 7.4% and 8.5% for 
1996 and 1995, respectively, declining annually to a rate of 4% by 
the year 2001 and remaining level thereafter.  The effect of a 1% 
increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate would increase 
the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at December 31, 
1996, by $79 million and the aggregate of the service and interest 
cost components of net postretirement benefit cost for 1996 by $10 
million.

     The Company adopted SFAS No. 112, "Employers' Accounting
for Postemployment Benefits," effective January 1, 1994.  SFAS
No. 112 requires recognition of the liability for postemployment 
benefits during the period of employment.  Such benefits include 
company paid continuation of group life insurance and medical and 
dental coverage for certain employees after employment but before 
retirement.  The effect of adopting SFAS No. 112 was a cumulative 
charge for recognition of the transition liability of $42 million, 
before tax benefits of $16 million.  The ongoing expenses related to
postemployment benefits will vary based on actual claims experience.

     Changes in interest rates or rates of inflation may impact 
the assumptions used in the valuation of postretirement and 
postemployment obligations, including discount rates, resulting 
in increases or decreases in United's liability and net periodic cost.

(17)  Financial Instruments and Risk Management
- -----------------------------------------------
     During 1996, the Company attempted to manage its exposure
to interest rates, foreign exchange rates and jet fuel prices
through certain operational decisions and the limited use of
various derivative financial instruments. Except for minor
investments in certain futures and options contracts to assist
in opportunistic purchases of jet fuel, the Company used
derivative financial instruments only for the purpose of
hedging existing commitments or obligations, not for hedging
expected future operating cash flows or for generating trading
profits.  In 1997, the Company expects to more actively hedge
the risks associated with foreign exchange rates and jet fuel
prices on expected future operating cash flows through a
greater use of derivative financial instruments.

Credit Exposures of Derivatives
     The Company's theoretical risk in the derivative
financial instruments described below is the cost of replacing
the contracts at current market rates in the event of default
by any of the counterparties.  However, the Company does not
anticipate such default as counterparties are selected based
on credit ratings and the relative market positions with each
counterparty are monitored.  Furthermore, the risk of such
default is mitigated by provisions in the contracts which
require either party to post increasing amounts of collateral
as the value of the contract moves against them, subject to
certain thresholds, or through the use of mutual put options
where contracts are terminated at certain predefined
intervals.  Counterparty credit risk is further minimized by
settlements throughout the duration of the contract.

Interest Rate Risk Management
     United has entered into interest rate swap agreements in
order to manage the interest rate exposure associated with
certain variable rate debt and leases.   The swap agreements
have remaining terms averaging 14 years, corresponding to the
terms of the related debt or lease obligations.   Under the
agreements, United makes payments to counterparties at fixed
rates and in return receives payments based on variable rates
indexed to LIBOR.  At December 31, 1996, a notional amount of
$53 million of interest rate swap agreements effectively fixed
interest rates between 8.55% and 8.65% on such obligations.
The notional amounts of the swaps do not represent amounts
exchanged between the parties and, therefore, are not a
measure of the Company's exposure resulting from its use of
the swaps.  Rather, the amounts exchanged are based on
interest rates applied to the notional amounts.  The fair
values to United of interest rate swap agreements at December
31, 1996 and 1995 were $(4) million and $(46) million,
respectively, taking into account interest rates in effect at
the time.

Foreign Exchange Risk Management
     A strengthening (weakening) of foreign currencies versus
the U.S. dollar tends to increase (decrease) reported revenue
and operating income because United's foreign currency-
denominated operating revenue generally exceeds its foreign
currency-denominated operating expense for each currency.
United attempts to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in
any single currency by carrying passengers and cargo in both
directions between the U.S. and almost every major economic
region in the world.  In addition, United reduces its exposure
to foreign exchange fluctuations by converting excess local
currencies generated into U.S. dollars.  As a result of rate
fluctuations, United is also exposed to transaction gains and
losses which it attempts to manage as follows:

     United is party to foreign currency swap and forward
contracts to reduce exposure to currency fluctuations in
connection with 15.3 billion of Japanese yen-denominated debt
and lease obligations.  The swap contract effectively fixes
future lease principal payments at an indirect yen exchange
rate of 95.63.  At December 31, 1996, the swap contract had a
notional amount of $84 million, which will reduce periodically
through 2004 as payments are made under the leases.  The fair
value of the currency swap contract to United at December 31,
1996 was approximately $1.8 million based on the change in the
yen to dollar exchange rate and interest rates in the U.S. and
Japan.  The forward contracts effectively fix future debt
payments at an indirect exchange rate of 116.14.  At December
31, 1996, the forward contracts had a notional amount of $67
million, which will reduce periodically through 2001, as
payments are made under the debt agreements.  The fair value
of the currency forward contract to United at December 31,
1996 was approximately $(1.9) million.

     United incurs certain other identifiable Japanese yen-
denominated liabilities as a result of operations
(commissions) and financing activities (accrued rent on
aircraft operating leases and interest on capital leases).
United minimizes transaction gains and losses by investing in
yen-denominated time deposits and by entering into yen forward
contracts to offset the impact of rate changes.  At December
31, 1996, these forward contracts had a notional amount of $54
million and a fair value to United of $(1.4) million.

Fuel Price Risk Management
     United enters into contracts from time to time, with
certain fuel suppliers to purchase fuel at a fixed average
price over a given period of time, typically one year, to
protect against increases in jet fuel prices.  At December 31,
1996, the level of 1997 fuel needs contracted at fixed average
prices was insignificant.

     At December 31, 1996, the fair values of futures
contracts used for opportunistic purchases of jet fuel were
insignificant.

Balance Sheet Financial Instruments:  Fair Values
     At December 31, 1996 and 1995, $418 million and $606
million, respectively, of investments in debt securities
included in cash and cash equivalents and short-term
investments were classified as available-for-sale, and $232
million and $530 million, respectively, were classified as
held-to-maturity.  Investments in debt securities classified
as available-for-sale are stated at fair value based on the
quoted market prices for the securities, which does not differ
significantly from their cost basis.  Investments classified
as held-to-maturity are stated at cost which approximates
market due to their short-term maturities.

     The fair value of long-term debt, including debt due
within one year, is primarily based on the quoted market
prices for the same or similar issues or on the then current
rates offered for debt with similar terms and maturities.  The
fair value of long-term debt, including debt due within one
year, at December 31, 1996 and 1995 was $2.041 billion and
$3.435 billion, respectively, compared with carrying values of
$1.835 billion and $3.077 billion.

Financial Guarantees
     Special facility revenue bonds have been issued by
certain municipalities to build or improve airport and
maintenance facilities leased by United.  Under the lease
agreements, United is required to make rental payments in
amounts sufficient to pay the maturing principal and interest
payments on the bonds.  At December 31, 1996, $1.060 billion
principal amount of such bonds was outstanding.  As of
December 31, 1996, UAL and United had jointly guaranteed $35
million of such bonds and United had guaranteed $1.041 billion
of such bonds, including accrued interest.

     Transfers of the tax benefits of accelerated depreciation
and investment tax credits associated with the acquisition of
certain equipment have been made previously by United to
various tax lessors through tax lease transactions.  Proceeds
from tax benefit transfers were recognized as income in the
year the lease transactions were consummated.  The subject
equipment is being depreciated for book purposes.  United has
agreed to indemnify (guaranteed in some cases by UAL) the tax
lessors against loss of such benefits in certain circumstances
and has agreed to indemnify others for loss of tax benefits in
limited circumstances for certain used aircraft purchased by
United subject to previous tax lease transactions.  Certain
tax lessors have required that letters of credit be issued in
their favor by financial institutions as security for United's
indemnity obligations under the leases.  The outstanding
balance of such letters of credit totaled $49 million at
December 31, 1996.  At that date, United had granted mortgages
on aircraft and engines having a total book value of $187
million as security for indemnity obligations under tax leases
and letters of credit.

Concentration of Credit Risk
     The Company does not believe it is subject to any
significant concentration of credit risk.  Most of the
Company's receivables result from sales of tickets to
individuals through geographically dispersed travel agents,
company outlets or other airlines, often through the use of
major credit cards.  These receivables are short term,
generally being settled shortly after the sale.

(18)  Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Uncertainties
- -----------------------------------------------------------
     The Company has certain contingencies resulting from
litigation and claims (including environmental issues)
incident to the ordinary course of business.  Management
believes, after considering a number of factors, including
(but not limited to) the views of legal counsel, the nature of
contingencies to which the Company is subject and its prior
experience, that the ultimate disposition of these
contingencies is not expected to materially affect UAL's
consolidated financial position or results of operations.  UAL
records liabilities for legal and environmental claims against
it in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles.  These amounts are recorded based on the Company's
assessments of the likelihood of their eventual settlements.
The amounts of these liabilities could increase in the near
term, based on revisions to estimates relating to the various
claims.

      At December 31, 1996, commitments for the purchase of
property and equipment, principally aircraft, approximated
$6.9 billion, after deducting advance payments.  An estimated
$2.9 billion is due to be spent in 1997, $1.9 billion in 1998,
$1.0 billion in 1999 and $1.1 billion in 2000 and thereafter.
The above amounts reflect firm orders for 21 B747, 6 B757, 20
B777, 14 A320 and 24 A319 aircraft to be delivered through
2002.  However, these amounts do not include a recent order
for an additional three A320 and four A319 aircraft.  Under
the Company's current fleet plan, the above aircraft will
principally be used to replace older aircraft which will be
retired.  As a result, the Company expects only modest growth
in its passenger fleet through 2002.

      Consistent with UAL's strategic plan and the Company's
focus on attracting more high yield passengers, the Board of
Directors has authorized an investment of approximately $400
million in United's onboard product, including new aircraft
seats and other cabin improvements.  This amount, which is
expected to be spent in the next three years, is not reflected
in the above commitments.

     In connection with the construction of the Indianapolis
Maintenance Center, United agreed to spend an aggregate $800
million on capital investments by the year 2001 and employ at
least 7,500 individuals by the year 2004.  In the event such
targets are not reached, United may be required to make
certain payments to the city of Indianapolis and state of
Indiana.

     Approximately 60% of United's employees are represented
by various labor organizations.  In connection with the 1994
employee investment transaction, members of the Air Line
Pilots' Association and the International Association of
Machinists and Aerospace Workers entered into labor contracts
with United which become amendable in 2000.

      United's contract with the Association of Flight
Attendants ("AFA") became amendable March 1, 1996.  On April
9, 1996, United announced that the flight attendants had
rejected a previously announced tentative agreement.  United
and the AFA are involved in traditional negotiations under the
Railway Labor Act, which historically have taken several years
to complete.  While negotiations continue, the terms of
United's current flight attendant agreement will remain in
effect.

(19) Foreign Operations
- -----------------------
     Operating authorities in international markets are
governed by bilateral aviation agreements between the U.S. and
foreign countries.  Under generally accepted accounting
principles, ("GAAP"), foreign operations are defined as
operations that exist outside the U.S.   United derives an
insignificant amount of its operating revenues and operating
income from such operations.  However, the Company's results
are significantly impacted by revenues produced from
international flights between the U.S. and foreign
destinations.  Based on allocation guidelines provided by the
U.S. Department of Transportation ("DOT"), which classifies
flights between the U.S. and foreign destinations as part of
each respective foreign entity, and thus, differs from the
definition of foreign operations under GAAP, United reported
the following results by geographic entity to the DOT for each
of the last three years:


     Additionally, United has sizable intangible assets related to 
acquisitions of foreign route authorities.  Changes in U.S. or 
foreign government aviation policies can lead to the alteration or 
termination of existing air service agreements that could diminish 
the value of United's international route authority.

     The sum of quarterly earnings per share amounts is not the same 
as annual earnings per share amounts because of changing numbers of 
shares outstanding.
