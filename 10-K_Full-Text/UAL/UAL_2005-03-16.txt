UAL Corporation and Subsidiary Companies Report on Form 10-K

For the Year Ended December 31, 2004

PART I

ITEM 1.  BUSINESS.

UAL Corporation (together
with its consolidated subsidiaries, "we," "our," "us," "UAL" or the "Company")
was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on December 30,
1968. Our world headquarters is located at 1200 East Algonquin Road, Elk
Grove Township, Illinois 60007. Our mailing address is P.O. Box 66919,
Chicago, Illinois 60666 (telephone number (847) 700-4000).

UAL is a holding company
and its principal, wholly owned subsidiary is United Air Lines, Inc., a
Delaware corporation ("United"). United's operations, which consist primarily
of the transportation of persons, property and mail throughout the U.S.
and abroad, accounted for most of UAL's revenues and expenses in 2004.
United is one of the largest scheduled passenger airlines in the world
with over 1,500 daily departures to more than 120 destinations in 26 countries
and two U.S. territories. Through United's unsurpassed global route network,
we serve virtually every major market around the world, either directly
or through the Star Alliance

Ã”

, which is
the world's largest airline network. In addition to the Star Alliance,
we provide regional service into our domestic hubs through marketing relationships
with United Express regional carriers. In 2004, we launched a new low-fare
service, called Ted, designed to serve select leisure markets in a way
that allows us to be more competitive with other low-fare carriers.

Our web address is

www.united.com

.
Through our website, our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission
("SEC"), including annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form
10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports,
are accessible (free of charge) as soon as reasonably practicable after

Bankruptcy Considerations

The following discussion
provides general background information regarding our Chapter 11 cases,
and is not intended to be an exhaustive summary. Detailed information pertaining
to our bankruptcy filings may be obtained through the website

www.pd-ual.com

.

On December 9, 2002 ("Petition
Date"), UAL, United and 26 direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries
filed voluntary petitions to reorganize their businesses under Chapter
11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy
Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division (the "Bankruptcy
Court"). The Bankruptcy Court is jointly administering these cases as "In
re UAL Corporation, et al., Case No. 02-B-48191."

As required by the Bankruptcy
Code, the United States Trustee for the Northern District of Illinois appointed
on December 13, 2002 an official committee of unsecured creditors (the
"Creditors' Committee"). The Creditors' Committee and its legal representatives
have a right to be heard on all matters that come before the Bankruptcy
Court concerning our reorganization. There can be no assurance that the
Creditors' Committee will support our positions or our plan of reorganization,
and any disagreements between the Creditors' Committee and us could protract
the Chapter 11 process, hinder our ability to operate during the Chapter
11 process, and delay our emergence from Chapter 11.

With the exception of our
non-filing subsidiaries, we continue to operate our businesses as "debtors-in-possession"
under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy
Procedure and applicable court orders. In general, as debtors-in-possession,
we are authorized under Chapter 11 to continue to operate as an ongoing
business, but may not engage in transactions outside the ordinary course
of business without the prior approval of the Bankruptcy Court.

All vendors are being paid
for all goods furnished and services provided after the Petition Date in
the ordinary course of business. However, under Section 362 of the Bankruptcy
Code, actions to collect most of our pre-petition liabilities are automatically
stayed, among other things, except for liabilities relating to certain
qualifying aircraft, aircraft engines and other aircraft-related equipment
that are leased or subject to a security interest or conditional sale contract.
Under Section 1110 of the Bankruptcy Code, actions to collect such aircraft-related
pre-petition liabilities are automatically stayed for 60 days after the
Petition Date (the stay of such actions in our case ended on February 7,
2003), except under two conditions: (a) the debtor may extend the 60-day
period by agreement with the relevant financier and with court approval;
or (b) the debtor may agree to perform all of the obligations under the
applicable lease or financing and cure any defaults as required under the
Bankruptcy Code. If neither of these conditions is met, the lessor or financier
may demand the return of the aircraft and enforce any of its contractual
rights or remedies to sell, lease or otherwise retain or dispose of such
property.

We have negotiated with our
aircraft lessors and lenders to restructure existing financings to reduce
aircraft ownership costs to better reflect current market rates, and we
have reached agreements in principle to restructure transactions with respect
to a majority of our financed aircraft. However, the need for further cost
reductions due to difficult changes in the airline industry, substantially
higher fuel prices and the continuing weak revenue environment, has required
us to re-examine these agreements and to seek to renegotiate certain of
those financings. To the extent we are unable to restructure any financings
that we believe are unaffordable under our revised business plan, we may
face the possibility that one or more lessors or lenders may seek to repossess
aircraft. We also will need to finalize those agreements in principle,
and to the extent we are unable to do so, we may likewise face the possibility
of repossessions. In either case, the loss of a significant number of aircraft
could result in a material adverse effect on our financial and operational
performance.

We are currently in discussions
with a large group of mostly public-market financiers to renegotiate an
agreement in principle for a group of aircraft reached in the summer of
2004 from which we subsequently withdrew due to the need for further cost
reductions. While we believe we can ultimately reach a mutually acceptable
restructuring for the continued use of these aircraft at affordable rates,
the financiers have demanded the return of certain aircraft and there can
be no assurance that these aircraft will be available for our continued
use. To date, repossession of these aircraft has been enjoined by the Bankruptcy
Court, but to the extent the Bankruptcy Court, or another court of competent
jurisdiction, permits the repossession of these or other aircraft, our
financial and operational performance could be adversely affected.

We have also rejected or
abandoned certain surplus aircraft to adjust our fleet size and composition
to more closely match market demand. In addition, as part of ongoing negotiations
with financiers, we have converted many long-term financing arrangements
into short-term operating leases and, in several instances, re-acquired
previously rejected aircraft as circumstances warranted.

Under Section 365 of the
Bankruptcy Code, we may assume, assume and assign, or reject certain executory
contracts and unexpired leases, including leases of real property, subject
to the approval of the Bankruptcy Court and certain other conditions. By
order of the Bankruptcy Court, our Section 365 rights to assume, assume
and assign, or reject unexpired leases of non-residential real estate expire
on the earlier of the date of termination of our exclusive period to file
a plan of reorganization (currently, April 30, 2005) or the date of the
conclusion of a disclosure statement hearing in connection with a proposed
plan of reorganization.

In general, if we reject
an executory contract or unexpired lease, it is treated as a pre-petition
breach of the lease or contract in question and, subject to certain exceptions,
relieves us of performing any future obligations. However, such a rejection
entitles the lessor or contract counterparty to a pre-petition general
unsecured claim for damages caused by such deemed breach and accordingly,
the counterparty may file a claim against us for such damages. As a result,
liabilities subject to compromise are likely to change in the future as
a result of damage claims created by our rejection of various aircraft,
executory contracts and unexpired leases. Generally, if we assume an aircraft
financing agreement, executory contract or unexpired lease we are required
to cure existing defaults under such contract or lease. We expect that
the future assumption of certain executory contracts and unexpired leases
may convert liabilities currently shown as subject to compromise to liabilities
not subject to compromise.

Since the Petition Date,
we have focused on transforming the Company to compete effectively in a
fundamentally changed and difficult industry. For the first nineteen months
of the restructuring, we worked to emerge from Chapter 11 protection with
exit financing guaranteed by the Air Transportation Stabilization Board
(the "ATSB"). During this time, we achieved average annual cash savings
from all stakeholders of $5 billion annually, including savings from aircraft
financiers, employees and retirees. In addition, we made substantial progress
in restructuring United by not only achieving a lower labor and non-labor
cost structure, but also by delivering superior levels of operating performance
and customer satisfaction. Despite these accomplishments and the concessions
made by United's stakeholders, in June 2004 the ATSB denied our application
for a federal loan guarantee.

Following the ATSB's final
denial, it became clear that the additional time needed to restructure
further and obtain non-guaranteed exit financing would require us to remain
in Chapter 11 longer than originally anticipated. In an effort to attract
non-guaranteed exit financing, we undertook a comprehensive reevaluation
of our business plan in order to identify all opportunities for further
cost savings and revenue improvement. As part of this process, we worked
in conjunction with certain members of, and advisors to, the Creditors'
Committee to analyze key aspects of our business plan and reorganization.
Given the continued harsh business realities currently facing the airline
industry, we identified approximately $2 billion in additional annual labor
and non-labor cash savings that we believed would be needed to obtain non-guaranteed
exit financing. The Company expects to realize the full $2 billion in cash
savings in fiscal year 2007.

During the fourth quarter
2004, we advised the Bankruptcy Court that the systemic changes in the
industry and the continued harsh financial environment made termination
and replacement of our defined benefit pension plans necessary, and that
in addition to pension relief, our updated business plan would require
further average annual labor savings from our union and non-union employees.
In November 2004, we commenced the process available to us under Section
1113 of the Bankruptcy Code to modify our collective bargaining agreements
("CBAs") in an effort to achieve $725 million in average annual labor savings
of the $2 billion target and to eliminate any requirement in our CBAs to
maintain a defined benefit pension plan. For information on labor savings,
see "Labor Restructuring" in

Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations

.

To successfully emerge from
Chapter 11, in addition to obtaining non-guaranteed exit financing, the
Bankruptcy Court must confirm a plan of reorganization, the filing of which
will depend on the timing and outcome of numerous ongoing matters in the
Chapter 11 process. We expect to file a plan of reorganization that provides
for UAL's emergence from bankruptcy later in 2005, but there can be no
assurance that the Bankruptcy Court will confirm a plan of reorganization
or that any such plan will be implemented successfully.

The reorganization plan will
determine the rights and claims of various creditors and security holders.
At this time, it is not possible to predict accurately the effect of the
Chapter 11 reorganization process on our business, nor can we make any
predictions concerning how each of these claims will be valued in the bankruptcy
proceedings. We believe that UAL's presently outstanding equity securities
will have no value and will be canceled under any plan of reorganization
that we propose. For this reason, we urge that caution be exercised with
respect to existing and future investments in any UAL security.

Operations

Segments.

We operate our businesses through five reporting segments:  North
America, the Pacific, the Atlantic, and Latin America (each of which is
operated by United) and UAL Loyalty Services, Inc. ("ULS"). Financial information
on UAL's operating segments can be found in Note 18, "Segment Information"
in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

.

During 2004, United carried
approximately 71 million mainline revenue passengers and flew approximately
115 billion mainline revenue passenger miles. (UAL operating statistics
do not include the operations of United Express regional carriers, since
these entities are independent carriers.) United's network provides comprehensive
transportation service within its North American segment and to international
destinations within its Pacific, Atlantic and Latin American segments.

Operating revenues attributed
to United's North America segment were $10.5 billion in 2004, $10.0 billion
in 2003 and $10.4 billion in 2002. Operating revenues attributed to United's
international segments were $5.1 billion in 2004, $4.2 billion in 2003
and $4.7 billion in 2002.

North America

. 
As of December 31, 2004, United mainline operations served 86 destinationsthroughout
North America and operated hubs in Chicago, Denver, Los Angeles, San Francisco
and Washington, D.C. In 2004, United's North America operations, including
United Express, accounted for 64% of UAL's operating revenues.

In 2004, we added two additional
United Express partners, Chautauqua Airlines and Shuttle America, to our
regional carrier network which includes Skywest Airlines, Air Wisconsin
Airlines Corporation, Trans States Airlines and Mesa Airlines. In August
2004, we terminated our partnership with Atlantic Coast Airlines.

In February 2004, United
launched the first phase of Ted in Denver with service to Reno, Las Vegas,
Phoenix, New Orleans, Fort Lauderdale, Tampa Bay, Orlando and Ontario (California).
Today, Ted provides service from United's hubs covering 13 destinations
in the U.S. and 2 in Mexico. Ted operates over 200 daily departures with
a fleet of 47 Airbus A320 aircraft. On March 3, 2005, the Company announced
that it plans to expand its Ted fleet of aircraft from 47 to 56 aircraft
by converting nine mainline Airbus A320 aircraft to the Ted configuration.
The new Ted aircraft will provide additional service out of Ted's hubs
in Denver, Washington Dulles and Chicago to markets in Florida, Mexico
and the Caribbean. Beginning April 3, 2005, Ted will start service from
Chicago's Midway airport with flights to both Denver and Washington Dulles.

Pacific

.  United
serves the Pacific from its U.S. gateway cities of Chicago, Honolulu, Los
Angeles, New York, San Francisco and Seattle. United provides nonstop service
to Beijing, Hong Kong, Osaka, Seoul, Shanghai, Sydney and Tokyo. United
also provides direct service to Bangkok, Ho Chi Minh City, Melbourne (Australia),
Singapore and Taipei. Effective March 26, 2005, we plan to provide daily
nonstop service between San Francisco and Nagoya, Japan. In 2004, United's
Pacific operations accounted for 16% of UAL's operating revenues.

Atlantic

.  Washington,
D.C. is United's primary gateway to Europe, serving Amsterdam, Brussels,
Frankfurt, London, Munich, Zurich and Paris. Chicago is United's secondary
gateway to Europe, with nonstop service to and from Amsterdam, Frankfurt,
London and Paris. United also provides nonstop service between San Francisco
and each of Paris, London and Frankfurt; and between London and each of
Los Angeles and New York. United provides seasonal service between Chicago
and Bermuda. Beginning in June 2005, United also plans to begin service
between Chicago and Munich. In 2004, United's Atlantic operations accounted
for 12% of UAL's operating revenues.

Latin America

. 
United serves Latin America from its five hubs and provides nonstop service
to Aruba, Buenos Aires, Cancun, Cozumel, Guatemala City, Mexico City, Montego
Bay, Puerto Vallarta, Punta Cana, San Jose (Costa Rica), San Jose del Cabo,
San Juan (Puerto Rico), San Salvador, Sao Paulo, St. Maarten, St. Thomas
(U.S Virgin Islands) and Zihuatanejo/Ixtapa. United also provides direct
service to Rio de Janeiro (via Sao Paulo) and Montevideo (via Buenos Aires).
In 2004, United's Latin America operations accounted for almost 3% of UAL's
operating revenues.

UAL Loyalty Services,
Inc

.  ULS accounted for 5% of UAL's 2004 operating revenues. ULS
focuses on expanding the non-core marketing businesses of UAL and building
customer loyalty for United. ULS operates in four areas: loyalty programs,
e-commerce, travel clubs and media assets.

ULS operates substantially
all United-branded travel distribution and customer loyalty e-commerce
activities, such as united.com. In addition, ULS owns and operates the
Mileage Plus frequent flyer program, and is responsible for certain aspects
of the program, including member relationships, communications and account
management, while United continues to be responsible for other aspects
of the program, including the Elite Premier, Premier Executive and Premier
Executive 1K loyalty programs, as well as establishment of award mileage
redemption requirements and airline-related loyalty recognition policies.
United retains responsibility for managing relationships with Mileage Plus'
airline partners, while ULS manages relationships with non-airline business
partners, such as the Mileage Plus Visa Card, hotels, car rental companies
and dining programs. ULS also owns and operates certain other United-branded
customer programs as well as the MyPoints.com online loyalty program, under
which registered consumers earn points for goods and services purchased
from participating vendors.

United Cargo.

United Cargo offers both domestic and international shipping through a
variety of services including Small Package Delivery, T.D. Guaranteed,
First Freight, International Freight and Global SP. Freight accounts for
approximately 77% of United Cargo's shipments, with mail accounting for
the remaining 23%. During 2004, United Cargo accounted for 4% of UAL's
revenues by generating $704 million in freight and mail revenue, a 12%
increase versus 2003. Although United Cargo is not a separate reporting
segment, cargo revenues are allocated to the North America, Pacific, Atlantic
and Latin America reporting segments of United. The majority of United
Cargo revenues are earned in the international segments of the Company's
operations.

Fuel.

Fuel is our second largest cost behind labor. Our fuel costs and consumption
for the years 2004, 2003 and 2002 are as follows:

The price and availability
of jet fuel significantly affect our operations. A significant rise in
crude oil prices was the primary reason for our fuel expense increasing
$871 million in 2004 over our 2003 fuel costs. Due to the highly competitive
nature of the airline industry, our ability to pass on increased fuel costs
to our customers in the form of higher ticket prices has been limited.

To ensure adequate
supplies of fuel and to provide a measure of control over fuel costs, we
arrange to have fuel shipped on major pipelines and stored close to our
major hub locations. Although we currently do not anticipate a significant
reduction in the availability of jet fuel, a number of factors make predicting
fuel prices and fuel availability difficult, including increased world
demand due to the improving global economy, geopolitical uncertainties
in oil-producing nations, threats of terrorism directed at oil supply infrastructure,
and changes in relative demand for other petroleum products that may impact
the quantity and price of jet fuel produced from period to period.

Insurance.

We carry hull and liability insurance of a type customary in the air transportation
industry, in amounts which we deem adequate, covering passenger liability,
public liability and damage to our aircraft and other physical property.
Since the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, our premiums have increased
significantly.

After September 11, 2001,
commercial insurers cancelled our liability insurance for losses resulting
from war and associated perils (terrorism, sabotage, hijacking and other
similar events), but we obtained replacement coverage through the federal
government. The Homeland Security Act, which became effective in February
2003, mandated the Federal Aviation Administration ("FAA") to provide third-party,
passenger and hull war-risk insurance to commercial air carriers through
August 31, 2003, and permitted such coverage to be extended to December
31, 2004. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2005 signed into law on
December 8, 2004, extends this war-risk insurance coverage to commercial
air carriers through August 31, 2005, and permits such coverage to be extended
until December 31, 2005, if the federal government determines that such
an extension is in the national interest. Should the government discontinue
this coverage, obtaining comparable coverage from commercial underwriters
could result in substantially higher premiums and more restrictive terms,
if it is available at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate war risk
insurance, our business would be materially and adversely affected.

Also, we maintain other types
of insurance such as property, directors and officers, cargo, automobile
and the like, with limits and deductibles that are standard within the
industry. These premiums have also risen substantially since September
11, 2001.

Alliances.

We have entered into a number of bilateral and multilateral alliances with
other airlines to provide our customers more travel choices and to participate
in markets worldwide that we do not serve directly. These collaborative
marketing arrangements typically include one or more of the following features:
joint frequent flyer program participation; code sharing of flight operations
(whereby one carrier's flights can be marketed under the two-letter airline
designator code of another carrier); coordination of reservations, baggage
handling and flight schedules; and other resource-sharing activities.

The most significant of these
is the Star Alliance, a global integrated airline network co-founded by
United in 1997. As of December 31, 2004, Star Alliance carriers served
approximately 780 destinations in over 130 countries with over 13,000 daily
flights. Current Star Alliance partners, in addition to United, are Air
Canada, Air New Zealand, All Nippon Airways, Asiana, the Austrian Airlines
Group (which includes Austrian Airlines, Lauda Air and Austrian Arrows,
formerly Tyrolean), bmi, LOT Polish Airlines, Lufthansa, SAS, Singapore
Airways, Spanair, Thai International Airways, US Airways and Varig. Mexicana
withdrew from the Star Alliance effective March 31, 2004. Effective the
same day, the United-Mexicana code share agreement was terminated.

Star Alliance announced that during
2005, TAP Air Portugal and South African Airways will join the alliance
as full members and that Blue1 (owned by SAS), Adria Airways (Slovenia's
national carrier) and Croatia Airways (Croatia's national carrier) will
join as regional Star Alliance members.

In addition to these marketing
relationships, United currently has independent marketing agreements with
other air carriers, including Air China, Air Dolomiti, Aloha, BWIA West
Indies Airways, Continental Connection (operated by Gulfstream), Fair Inc.,
dba "ANA Connection," Great Lakes Airlines (a regional carrier), and Virgin
Blue.

Mileage Plus.

Our Mileage Plus frequent flyer program encourages customer loyalty by
offering awards and services to frequent travelers. There are more than
45 million members enrolled in Mileage Plus, who earn mileage credit for
flights on United, United Express, Ted, the Star Alliance and certain other
airlines that participate in the program. Miles also can be earned by purchasing
the goods and services of our non-airline partners, such as hotels, car
rental companies, and credit card issuers. Mileage credits can be redeemed
for free, discounted or upgraded travel and non-travel awards. For a detailed
description of the accounting treatment of Mileage Plus awards, see "Critical
Accounting Policies" in

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations

.

Distribution Channels.

The majority of our airline inventory continues to be distributed through
the traditional channels of travel agencies and global distribution systems.
The growing use of electronic ticket distribution systems, including electronic
tickets and the Internet, however, provides us with an opportunity to lower
our ticket distribution costs. To capitalize on these cost-saving opportunities,
we continue to expand the capabilities of our website, united.com, and
encourage our customers to make their bookings on united.com.

Industry Conditions

Seasonality.

The air travel business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. Our operations
can be adversely impacted by severe weather and our first- and fourth-quarter
results normally reflect reduced travel demand. Historically, results of
operations are better in the second and third quarters. From 2001 through
2003, however, the typical seasonal relationships were distorted by the
events of September 11, 2001, the fear of terrorism, the Iraq war, fluctuations
in fuel prices, and general economic conditions. The Company experienced
a more typical seasonal pattern of financial results in 2004.

Domestic

Competition.

The domestic airline industry is highly competitive and volatile. In domestic
markets, new and existing carriers deemed fit by the Department of Transportation
("DOT") are free to initiate service between any two points in the U.S.
Our domestic competitors are primarily the other U.S. airlines, a number
of whom are low-cost carriers ("LCCs") with significantly lower cost structures
than ours, and, to a lesser extent, other forms of transportation.

United faces significantly
more domestic competition now than it did in the past. This increase is
largely attributable to the growth of LCCs, whose share of domestic passengers
is now over 30 percent. Accordingly, about 75 percent of United's domestic
revenue is now exposed to LCCs, which is double the percentage from a decade
ago. We anticipate that competition from LCCs and other U.S. airlines will
continue to intensify in the future.

Domestic pricing decisions
are largely affected by the need to meet competition from other U.S. airlines.
Fare discounting by competitors has historically had a negative effect
on our financial results because we generally find it necessary to match
competitors' fares to maintain passenger traffic. Periodic attempts by
United and other network airlines to raise fares have often failed due
to lack of competitive matching by LCCs. Because of vastly different cost
structures, low-ticket prices that generate a profit for an LCC usually
have a negative effect on our financial results. The introduction of Ted
by United in early 2004 is designed to provide United with a lower-cost
operation in selected leisure markets, under which United can be more economically
competitive with its LCC rivals.

International Competition

.

In our international networks, we compete not only with U.S. airlines,
but also with foreign carriers. Our competition on specified international
routes is subject to varying degrees of governmental regulations. See "Industry
Regulation" below. As the U.S. is the largest market for air travel worldwide,
our ability to generate U.S. originating traffic from our integrated domestic
route systems provides us with an advantage over non-U.S. carriers. Foreign
carriers are prohibited by U.S. law from carrying local passengers between
two points in the U.S. and we experience comparable restrictions in foreign
countries. In addition, U.S. carriers are often constrained from carrying
passengers to points beyond designated international gateway cities due
to limitations in air service agreements or restrictions imposed unilaterally
by foreign governments. To compensate for these structural limitations,
U.S. and foreign carriers have entered into alliances and marketing arrangements
that allow the carriers to feed traffic to each other's flights. See "Alliances"
above.

Industry Regulation

Domestic Regulation.

General

. All carriers
engaged in air transportation in the United States are subject to regulation
by the DOT. Among its responsibilities, the DOT has authority to issue
certificates of public convenience and necessity for domestic air transportation
(no air carrier, unless exempted, may provide air transportation without
a DOT certificate of public convenience and necessity), grants international
route authorities, approves international code share agreements, regulates
methods of competition and enforces certain consumer protection regulations,
such as those dealing with advertising, denied boarding compensation and
baggage liability. We operate under a certificate of public convenience
and necessity issued by the DOT. This certificate may be altered, amended,
modified or suspended by the DOT if public convenience and necessity so
require, or may be revoked for intentional failure to comply with the terms
and conditions of the certificate.

Airlines also are regulated
by the FAA, a division of the DOT, primarily in the areas of flight operations,
maintenance and other safety and technical matters. The FAA has authority
to issue air carrier operating certificates and aircraft airworthiness
certificates, prescribe maintenance procedures, and regulate pilot and
other employee training, among other responsibilities. From time to time,
the FAA issues rules that require air carriers to take certain actions,
such as the inspection or modification of aircraft and other equipment,
that may cause us to incur substantial, unplanned expenses. We are also
subject to inquiries by these and other U.S. and international regulatory
bodies. We do not believe that any such existing inquiries will have a
material affect on our business.

The airline industry is also
subject to various other federal, state and local laws and regulations.
The Department of Homeland Security has jurisdiction over virtually all
aspects of civil aviation security. See "

Legislation

" below. The
Department of Justice has jurisdiction over certain airline competition
matters. The U.S. Postal Service has authority over certain aspects of
the transportation of mail. Labor relations in the airline industry are
generally governed by the Railway Labor Act. Future regulatory and legal
compliance developments in the U.S. and abroad could materially and adversely
affect operations and increase operating costs for the airline industry,
including the Company.

Airport Access

. Access
to landing and take-off rights, or "slots," at three major U.S. airports
and certain foreign airports served by United are subject to government
regulation. The FAA has designated John F. Kennedy International Airport
("Kennedy") and LaGuardia Airport ("LaGuardia") in New York and Ronald
Reagan Washington National Airport in Washington, D.C. as "high density
traffic airports" and has limited the number of departure and arrival slots
at those airports. Slot restrictions at O'Hare International Airport in
Chicago ("O'Hare") were eliminated in July 2002 and are slated to be eliminated
at Kennedy and LaGuardia by 2007. From time to time, the elimination of
slot restrictions has impacted our operational performance and reliability.

To address congestion concerns
and delays at O'Hare, United and American Airlines reached agreements with
the FAA in January 2004 to reduce each of their flight schedules at O'Hare.
We reduced our flight schedule at O'Hare beginning February 2004 between
the peak hours of 1:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m. In addition, effective March
2004, we again depeaked our flight schedule by 5%. Subsequently, United,
American Airlines and certain other carriers complied with the FAA's request
to further depeak afternoon operations at O'Hare resulting in a slight
reduction in operations overall beginning in November 2004. On February
10, 2005, the FAA issued an order to show cause why the current operating
restrictions at O'Hare should not remain in place through October 2005.
We expect a formal rulemaking process to address O'Hare congestion to begin
later this year.

Legislation

. Since
September 11, 2001, aviation security has been and continues to be a subject
of frequent legislative action, requiring changes to our security processes
and increasing the economic cost of security procedures on the Company.
The Aviation and Transportation Security Act (the "Aviation Security Act"),
enacted in November 2001, has had wide-ranging effects on our operations.
The Aviation Security Act made the federal government responsible for virtually
all aspects of civil aviation security, creating a new Transportation Security
Administration ("TSA"), which is a part of the Department of Homeland Security
pursuant to the Homeland Security Act of 2002. Under the Aviation Security
Act, substantially all security screeners at airports are now federal employees
and significant other aspects of airline and airport security are now overseen
by the TSA. Pursuant to the Aviation Security Act, funding for airline
and airport security is provided in part by a passenger security fee of
$2.50 per flight segment (capped at $10.00 per round trip), which is collected
by the air carriers from passengers and remitted to the government. In
addition, air carriers are required to submit to the government an additional
security fee equal to the amount the air carrier paid for security screening
of passengers and property in 2000. It is expected that aviation security
laws and processes will continue to be under review and subject to change
by the federal government in the future.

International Regulation.

General

. International
air transportation is subject to extensive government regulation. In connection
with our international services, we are regulated by both the U.S. government
and the governments of the foreign countries we serve. In addition, the
availability of international routes to U.S. carriers is regulated by treaties
and related aviation agreements between the U.S. and foreign governments,
and in some cases, fares and schedules require the approval of the DOT
and/or the relevant foreign governments.

Airport Access

. Historically,
access to foreign markets has been tightly controlled through bilateral
agreements between the U.S. and each foreign country involved. These agreements
regulate the number of markets served, the number of carriers allowed to
serve each market, and the frequency of carriers' flights. Since the early
1990s, the U.S. has pursued a policy of "open skies" (meaning all carriers
have access to the destination), under which the U.S. government has negotiated
a number of bilateral agreements allowing unrestricted access to foreign
markets. Additionally, all of the airports that United serves in Europe
and Asia maintain slot controls, and many of these are restrictive due
to congestion at these airports. London Heathrow, Frankfurt and Tokyo Narita
are among the most restrictive due to capacity limitations, and United
has significant operations at these locations.

Further, our ability to serve
some countries and expand into certain others is limited by the absence
altogether of aviation agreements between the U.S. and the relevant governments.
Shifts in U.S. or foreign government aviation policies can lead to the
alteration or termination of air service agreements between the U.S. and
other countries. Depending on the nature of the change, the value of our
route authorities may be enhanced or diminished.

In June 2004, the United
States and the People's Republic of China agreed to implement various amendments
to the existing air services agreement, providing an opportunity for some
new U.S. China air service for U.S. and Chinese carriers. Subsequently,
United obtained rights to operate seven new frequencies, which it is using
to operate daily nonstop Chicago-Shanghai roundtrip service, effective
October 31, 2004.

In 2004, the United States
and the European Commission attempted to negotiate a single air services
agreement to replace the existing bilateral agreements between the United
States and the European Union ("EU") member states. The negotiations were
not successful and further discussions between the parties are expected
in 2005. The European Commission has called upon the EU member states to
renounce their air services agreements with the United States because they
allegedly do not comply with EU law. To date, no EU member state has indicated
a willingness to renounce its air services agreement with the U.S. If EU
member states do renounce such agreements, the status of our existing antitrust
immunity with our European partners would be in doubt because the immunity
is based upon an open skies agreement between the United States and the
applicable EU member state.

In late 2004, the European
Commission commenced a consultation process that seeks stakeholder input
on the introduction of market-based mechanisms for slot allocation at EU
airports. The Commission proposes to introduce a highly regulated form
of secondary slot trading. The availability of such slots is not assured
and the inability of the Company to obtain or retain needed slots could
inhibit its efforts to compete in certain international markets.

Environmental Regulation.

The airline industry is subject
to increasingly stringent federal, state, local, and foreign environmental
laws and regulations concerning emissions to the air, discharges to surface
and subsurface waters, safe drinking water, and the management of hazardous
substances, oils, and waste materials. Our industry is also subject to
other environmental laws and regulations, including those that require
us to remediate soil or groundwater to meet certain objectives. It is our
policy to comply with all environmental laws and regulations, which can
require significant expenditures. Under the federal Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act (commonly known as "Superfund")
and similar environmental cleanup laws, generators of waste materials,
and owners or facility operators, can be subject to liability for investigation
and remediation costs at facilities that have been identified as requiring
response actions. We also conduct voluntary remediation actions. Such cleanup
obligations can arise from, among other circumstances, the operation of
fueling facilities, and primarily involve airport sites. Future costs associated
with these activities are not expected to have a material adverse affect
on our business.

From time to time we become
aware of United's potential non-compliance with environmental regulations,
which have either been identified by the Company (through our internal
environmental compliance auditing program) or through notice from a governmental
entity. In some instances, these matters could potentially become the subject
of an administrative or judicial proceeding and could potentially involve
monetary sanctions. We do not expect these matters, individually or collectively,
to have a material adverse affect on our business.

Employees

As of December 31, 2004,
the Company and its subsidiaries had approximately 61,000 active employees,
of whom approximately 80% are represented by various U.S. labor organizations.

As of December 31, 2004,
the employee groups, number of employees and labor organization for each
of United's collective bargaining groups were as follows:

(1)  Air Line Pilots Association ("ALPA"); Association
of Flight Attendants - Communication Workers of America ("AFA"); Aircraft
Mechanics Fraternal Association ("AMFA"); International Association of
Machinists and Aerospace Workers ("IAM"); Professional Airline Flight Control
Association ("PAFCA"); Transport Workers Union ("TWU"); and International
Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers ("IFPTE")

(2)  Amendable dates are as of the filing date of this
annual report.

Collective bargaining
agreements are negotiated under the Railway Labor Act, which governs labor
relations in the transportation industry, and such agreements typically
do not contain an expiration date. Instead, they specify an amendable date,
upon which the contract is considered "open for amendment." Prior to the
amendable date, neither party is required to agree to modifications to
the bargaining agreement. Nevertheless, nothing prevents the parties from
agreeing to start negotiations or to modify the agreement in advance of
the amendable date. Contracts remain in effect while new agreements are
negotiated. During the negotiating period, both the Company and the negotiating
union are required to maintain the status quo.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES.

Flight Equipment

As of December 31, 2004,
United's operating aircraft fleet totaled 497 jet aircraft, of which 237
were owned and 260 were leased. United has announced plans to reduce the
operating fleet to 455 aircraft in the first half of 2005. Details of the
operating fleet as of December 31, 2004 are provided in the following table:

As of December 31, 2004,
all 237 of the aircraft owned by us were encumbered under debt agreements.
For additional information on accounting for aircraft financings see Note
9, "Long-Term Debt" and Note 10, "Lease Obligations" in the

Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements

.

Ground Facilities

We have entered into various
leases relating to our use of airport landing areas, gates, hangar sites,
terminal buildings and other airport facilities in most of the municipalities
we serve. These leases are subject to assumption or rejection under the
Chapter 11 process. As of December 31, 2004, we have assumed leases in
Washington (Dulles and Reagan), Denver (terminal lease only) and San Francisco.
Major leases expire at San Francisco in 2011 and 2013, Washington-Dulles
in 2014, Chicago O'Hare in 2018, Los Angeles in 2021 and Denver in 2025.

We own a 93.5-acre complex
in suburban Chicago consisting of more than 1 million square feet of office
space for our world headquarters, a computer facility and a training center.
We also own a flight training center, located in Denver, which can accommodate
36 flight simulators and more than 90 computer-based training stations.
We own a limited number of other properties, including a reservations facility
and an office building in Denver and a crew hotel in Honolulu. All of these
facilities are mortgaged.

Our Maintenance Operation
Center at San Francisco International Airport occupies 130 acres of land,
2.9 million square feet of floor space and 9 aircraft hangar bays under
a lease expiring in 2013.

Our off-airport leased properties
have included a number of ticketing, sales and general office facilities
in the downtown and outlying areas of most of the larger cities within
the United system. As part of our restructuring and cost containment efforts,
we have closed, terminated or rejected all of our domestic city ticket
office leases. We continue to lease and operate a number of administrative,
reservations, sales and other support facilities worldwide.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

In re: UAL Corporation, et. al.

As discussed above,
on the Petition Date, the Company, United and 26 other direct and indirect
wholly owned subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for reorganization
under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the Bankruptcy Court. The Chapter
11 Cases are being jointly administered under the caption "In re UAL Corporation,
et al., Case No. 02-B-48191." As debtors-in-possession, we are authorized
under Chapter 11 to continue to operate as an ongoing business, but may
not engage in transactions outside the ordinary course of business without
the prior approval of the Bankruptcy Court. As of the Petition Date, virtually
all pending litigation (including some of the actions described below)
is stayed, and absent further order of the Bankruptcy Court, no party,
subject to certain exceptions, may take any action to recover on pre-petition
claims against us. In addition, we may reject pre-petition executory contracts
and unexpired lease obligations, and parties affected by these rejections
may file claims with the Bankruptcy Court. At this time, it is not possible
to predict the outcome of the Chapter 11 process or its effect on our business.

Summers v. UAL Corporation ESOP, et. al.

The UAL Corporation Employee
Stock Ownership Plan ("ESOP") and the ESOP Committee were sued in the U.S.
District Court for the Northern District of Illinois ("the District Court")
on February 28, 2003 by certain ESOP participants seeking monetary damages
in a purported class action that alleges that the ESOP Committee breached
its fiduciary duty by not selling UAL stock held by the ESOP commencing
as of July 19, 2001. The complaint cites numerous events and disclosures
that allegedly should have alerted the ESOP Committee to the need to sell
the shares. The ESOP Committee appointed State Street Bank and Trust Company
("State Street") in September 2002 to act as fiduciary, and State Street
started selling the shares in September 2002 when the stock was trading
between $1 and $5 per share. Members of the purported class have also filed
claims against the Company in the Chapter 11 proceeding asserting that
the Company also is liable for the failure to sell the ESOP shares. The
Company has $10 million in fiduciary insurance in place to cover some portion
of any liability and has a pre-petition obligation to indemnify the ESOP
Committee members beyond that coverage, which indemnification obligation
may or may not be assumed as part of our plan of reorganization. The parties
have entered into a stipulation under which the plaintiffs have agreed
to proceed only against the insurance proceeds. The plaintiffs have also
added State Street as a defendant. State Street has a pre-petition indemnification
claim against the Company under its Investment Manager Agreement as Trustee
of the ESOP and has filed a contingent indemnity claim in the Bankruptcy
Court. On February 17, 2005, the District Court certified this matter to
proceed as a class action on behalf of all participants in the ESOP. It
is not possible to quantify the potential exposure to the Company at this
time.

Hall d.b.a. Travel Specialists v. United

Six travel agencies filed
an antitrust class action suit against United and other air carriers in
federal court in North Carolina following the reduction by the air carrier
defendants of commission rates payable to travel agents in 1997, 1998,
2001 and 2002 in alleged violation of the Sherman Act. The agencies asked
for the matter to be treated as a class action and sought treble damages
for lost commissions and other injunctive relief. The total amount claimed,
assuming liability, is approximately $13 billion. United's share of this
amount was not separately alleged by plaintiffs. Upon UAL's Chapter 11
filing, this case was stayed as against United. On October 30, 2003, the
trial court entered judgment on behalf of the carrier defendants and dismissed
all of the plaintiffs' claims. On December 9, 2004, an appellate court
affirmed the trial court's ruling dismissing all claims. Plaintiffs have
asked the appellate court to reconsider its decision.

United was named in several
similar lawsuits filed in the U.S. and Canada, involving commission rates
payable to travel agencies. Most of these cases have either been stayed
or dismissed. We do not expect the outcome of Hall and the related cases
to have any material affect upon UAL's consolidated financial position
or results of operations.

Litigation Associated with September 11 Terrorism

Approximately 125 lawsuits
against United are pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern
District of New York related to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.
The suits allege a variety of liabilities, including wrongful death, injury
or property damage, and claim that United and others breached their duty
of care to the passengers and to the ground victims. Identical actions
have also been filed against American Airlines and other defendants. Under
the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act of 2001 ("the
Act"), United's liability on such claims will be limited to the amount
of United's insurance coverage in place as of the day of the attacks. In
addition, approximately 98% of families of the victims of the September
11 terrorist attacks have opted to seek relief from a fund created under
federal law to provide an alternative to litigation and as a consequence
will not be seeking compensation from United. United has stipulated that
the automatic stay under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code applicable to the lawsuits
filed against United, and covered up to the amount of United's insurance
coverage, can be modified so that these claims may proceed.

ITEM 4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

None.

PART II

ITEM 5.  MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER
MATTERS.

Our common stock, $.01 par
value, ("Common Stock") has historically and principally traded on the
New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE"), under the symbol UAL. However, as a result
of the delisting of our securities, the last day of trading on the NYSE
was April 2, 2003. UAL securities have traded on the over-the-counter market
(OTCBB) since then under the symbol UALAQ.OB.

The following table sets
forth the ranges of high and low sales prices per share of our Common Stock.

We suspended the payment
of cash dividends on the Common Stock in 2002 and we do not anticipate
paying any dividends on the Common Stock in the future.

We believe that UAL's presently
outstanding equity securities will have no value and will be canceled under
any plan of reorganization that we propose. For this reason, we urge that
caution be exercised with respect to existing and future investments in
any UAL security.

On March 1, 2005, based on
reports by the Company's transfer agent for the Common Stock, there were
66,566 common stockholders of record.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

Overview

Over the past several years,
the Company and the airline industry have been faced with severe business
challenges and fundamental changes in the airline industry that have produced
material adverse impacts on our results of operations, financial position
and liquidity. We reported operating losses of $0.9 billion, $1.4 billion
and $2.8 billion for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively; and we reported net losses of $1.7 billion, $2.8 billion
and $3.2 billion for the same respective periods. Our ongoing losses and
increasing leverage, coupled with our inability to obtain suitable sources
of new financing and the initial rejection of our application for a loan
guarantee by the ATSB in late 2002, resulted in the December 9, 2002 filing
of voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United
States Bankruptcy Code for UAL, United and 26 direct and indirect wholly
owned subsidiaries of the Company.

Several significant events
and trends have adversely impacted our operating revenues since 2000. General
economic conditions in the United States began to weaken in 2001, and slower
economic growth adversely impacted airline revenues for several years thereafter.
The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, significantly reduced consumer
demand for air travel well into 2002 due to ongoing consumer concerns about
further terrorist activities. Enhanced airport security measures were enacted
into law shortly after the terrorist attacks, which increased airport inconvenience
and produced some negative customer reaction. Our revenues were also adversely
affected by the enactment of federal taxes on ticket sales to fund those
new security measures, which reduced our net revenues from ticket sales,
since such taxes could not easily be passed on to customers in the form
of higher ticket prices. The outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
in early 2003 further reduced demand for air travel for a time, particularly
for air carriers like us with significant operations in Asia. The growth
of low-cost carriers in the United States has placed further downward pressures
on revenues by forcing us to compete with discounted fares offered by low-cost
airlines in a growing percentage of the markets we serve. The growth of
such low-cost carriers has also added new capacity into the domestic U.S.
aviation system, which has further aggravated the imbalance between air
transportation supply and demand. These and other adverse factors caused
United mainline passenger revenue per revenue passenger mile to decline
from 13.3 cents in 2000 (the last year we reported an operating profit)
to 10.8 cents in 2004. We have been able to increase mainline load factors
over the same time period to partially compensate for lower ticket prices.
In addition, we have replaced some mainline flying by United with the operation
of smaller aircraft by United Express regional carriers; these revenues
have increased by 50% between 2002 and 2004.

During the same time period,
our operating expenses have fluctuated as we sought to restructure our
obligations in bankruptcy, adjust our mainline and regional carrier operating
capacity to match marketplace demand, and cope with historically high jet
fuel prices throughout this period. United mainline operating cost per
available seat mile increased from 10.6 cents in 2000 to 12.0 cents in
2001, and then declined to 10.2 cents by 2004. In spite of significant
accomplishments in restructuring our operating expenses, including significant
contributions from employees and creditors through the bankruptcy process,
high fuel costs have had a significant adverse affect on unit operating
costs, particularly in 2003 and 2004.

In the summer of 2004, we
identified a further $2 billion in required future annual cash savings
(to be fully realized in fiscal year 2007) that we believe are necessary
to qualify for non-guaranteed financing and to emerge from reorganization
later in 2005. We are using all means available to us in the bankruptcy
process to implement changes to our CBAs to enable us to achieve approximately
$725 million in average annual labor savings toward the $2 billion goal.
We are seeking operational savings and the termination and replacement
of defined benefit pension plans to achieve the remainder of the $2 billion
savings target.

Chapter 11 Restructuring Efforts

The following sections describe
details of restructuring efforts underway by the Company in the areas of
labor agreements, defined benefit pension plans, business improvement initiatives,
aircraft financings, municipal bond obligations, future operating fleet
redeployment and reductions, and the ongoing bankruptcy claims resolution
process. See Note 1, "Voluntary Reorganization Under Chapter 11" in the

Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements

for further information on the
reorganization process.

Labor Restructuring.

In March and April 2003, United employees represented by various unions
ratified tentative agreements between the Company and their unions to amend
the then-existing CBAs. These agreements, when combined with compensation
savings from the non-represented salaried and management employee group,
were expected to reduce our average annual labor costs by approximately
$2.5 billion per year through 2009, as compared to expected costs under
terms of the previous CBAs. We then devoted the next fourteen months of
our restructuring to implementing a business plan to secure an ATSB loan
guarantee on terms that would have allowed us to emerge from bankruptcy
with these revised CBAs (and existing pension plans) intact.

In June 2004, however, the
ATSB issued a final denial for our application for a federal loan guarantee,
resulting in a need for the Company to qualify for non-guaranteed exit
financing. This new requirement, coupled with recent extraordinary increases
in fuel prices and continuing weak revenue environment, made it necessary
for us to revisit our proposed cost structure, particularly our expected
labor costs, which remain our single largest operating expense. During
the fourth quarter 2004, we advised the Bankruptcy Court that the continuing
harsh financial environment across the industry, and for the Company, made
termination and replacement of our defined benefit pension plans necessary
and that, in addition, our updated business plan would require approximately
$725 million in further average annual labor savings from our union and
non-represented employees. In November 2004, we commenced the process available
to us under Section 1113 of the Bankruptcy Code to modify our CBAs in an
effort to achieve the necessary labor cost reductions from our union employees,
and to eliminate any CBA requirement to maintain a defined benefit pension
plan.

Effective January 1, 2005,
the Company reduced the compensation of its non-represented salaried and
management employees and announced changes to benefits and productivity
for this group. The combination of lower salaries, benefit changes and
workforce reductions are expected to provide the Company with approximately
$112 million of the targeted $725 million in average annual savings.

On January 31, 2005, the
Bankruptcy Court approved amended CBAs between the Company and AFA, ALPA,
PAFCA and TWU (all of whom had ratified such amendments) that are expected
to provide approximately $130 million, $181 million, $2.8 million and $0.2
million, respectively, in average annual savings through 2009 from changes
in salaries, work rules and benefits. Together with savings expected from
salaried and management employees, all expected savings realized to date
for labor groups represents approximately 60% of the $725 million target.

The ALPA, PAFCA and TWU contracts
also include contingent commitments to issue, respectively, $550 million,
$0.4 million and $24,000 in convertible notes upon the emergence of the
Company from bankruptcy in the event the groups' defined benefit pension
plans are terminated. These groups have agreed to eliminate any CBA requirement
to maintain, and not to oppose efforts by the Company to terminate, their
respective defined benefit pension plans.

The AFA, ALPA, PAFCA, and
TWU agreements each contain termination rights for the respective union.
Among other things, all provide that the unions can terminate the agreement
(upon two days notice and a failure of the Company to cure within twenty
days) if the Company fails to obtain specified levels of average annual
savings from all other union groups and the Company's salaried and management
employees. Additionally, the PAFCA and TWU agreements each provide that
the Company can terminate the agreements if a court of competent jurisdiction
enters a final order that the Company is not entitled to terminate the
defined benefit pension plans covering that employee group.

We have been unable to reach
ratified agreements on amended CBAs with the employees represented by IAM
and AMFA. As such, on January 6, 2005, the Bankruptcy Court approved the
Company's 1113(e) motion seeking interim savings from IAM. The Bankruptcy
Court's order, effective through April 11, 2005, requires a temporary pay
rate reduction for IAM-represented employees of 11.5% and provides that
these employees will receive 70% of the pay they would normally have received
for sick days taken.

Likewise, on January 31,
2005, the Bankruptcy Court approved the Company's 1113(e) motion seeking
interim savings from AMFA. The Bankruptcy Court's order, effective through
May 31, 2005, requires a temporary pay rate reduction for AMFA-represented
employees of 9.8% and that these employees receive 75% of the pay they
would normally have received for sick days taken, up to the first 15 days.

These interim cost savings
ordered by the Bankruptcy Court will provide the Company with additional
time to attempt to resolve the longer-term cost savings it needs from both
IAM and AMFA and to work together to resolve pension issues. If the Company
cannot reach ratifiable long-term agreements with both IAM and AMFA, as
well as an agreement with AFA on pension matters, the Company will proceed
to a trial under Section 1113(c) of the Bankruptcy Code, scheduled to begin
on May 11, 2005 in the Bankruptcy Court.

The Company has agreed to
provide each union employee group a portion of the equity, securities or
other consideration provided to general unsecured creditors under any plan
of reorganization proposed or supported by the Company. Each union employee
group is to receive a distribution based on the value of cost savings provided
by that group.

Pensions.

Our
projected minimum pension funding obligation between 2005 and 2010 is approximately
$4.9 billion for our defined benefit pension plans, even after giving consideration
to the temporary pension funding relief provided by the Pension Funding
Equity Act of 2004. Effective July 2004, the Company ceased making contributions
to its qualified defined benefit pension plans to preserve its liquidity
and does not anticipate making further contributions; however, the Company
is current on its pension premium payments to the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation ("PBGC") as of February 28, 2005. We believe that in order
to obtain non-guaranteed exit financing, and successfully reorganize and
emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, it is necessary to terminate
and replace our defined benefit pension plans. We are currently working
with all employee groups to explore all issues and possibilities with respect
to the future disposition of pension plans. If consensual agreement is
not reached, the issue of pension termination also will be before the Bankruptcy
Court at the trial scheduled to begin on May 11, 2005.

On
November 30, 2004, Independent Fiduciary Services, Inc., the independent
fiduciary appointed by the Company for its pension plans, filed a motion
in the Bankruptcy Court requesting the allowance of a $288 million to $993
million administrative claim against the Company for unpaid minimum funding
contributions with respect to the following defined benefit pension plans
maintained by the Company: the Flight Attendant Plan; the Union Ground
Plan; and the Management, Administrative, and Public Contact Plan. This
matter is currently pending before the Bankruptcy Court. See "Claims Resolution
Process" below for further details.

On December 30, 2004, the
PBGC filed a complaint against the Company in the U.S. District Court for
the Northern District of Illinois (the "District Court") to seek the involuntary
termination of the defined benefit pension plan of United's pilots. The
PBGC is seeking to assume pension responsibility for the Company's active
and retired pilots, with benefit accruals terminated effective December
30, 2004. The Company's motion to refer the PBGC's involuntary termination
action to the Bankruptcy Court was granted by the District Court on January
27, 2005. The PBGC has indicated that it may appeal the District Court's
decision. The Company is evaluating its legal and other options. The Company
recorded a $152 million curtailment charge in the fourth quarter of 2004
relating to the PBGC's involuntary termination action.

Similarly, on March 11, 2005,
the PBGC filed a complaint against the Company in the U.S. District Court
for the Eastern District of Virginia to seek the involuntary termination
of the defined benefit pension plan of United's mechanics and related employees
represented by AMFA; United's ramp and stores, food services, and security
officer employees represented by IAM; and a small number of retired flight
dispatchers. The PBGC is seeking to assume pension responsibility with
benefits accruals terminated effective March 11, 2005. The Company is studying
the PBGC's actions and evaluating its legal and other options.

Historically, the Company
has maintained a nonqualified supplemental retirement plan for management
employees who have benefits under the tax-qualified pension plan that cannot
be paid due to Internal Revenue Code ("IRC") limits on compensation or
benefits. In June 2003, we terminated all participation and benefit payments
under the nonqualified plan for those participants who had terminated employment
with the Company prior to December 9, 2002. Effective February 28, 2005,
we terminated the nonqualified supplemental plan for all remaining participants.

Business Improvement
Initiatives

.

As part of the Company's goal
to achieve $2 billion in annual cash savings by fiscal year 2007, certain
initiatives have been identified to more efficiently operate our business.
For example, the Company expects to lower its cost of operations for aircraft
maintenance and airports through more efficient use of labor and non-labor
resources in those divisions. The cost of product distribution is also
expected to be reduced by providing our customers with a better choice
of low-cost means to reserve and purchase airline seats. The Company also
expects to reduce costs through call center automation, outsourcing and
renegotiation of United Express ground handling and air contracts. The
Company did achieve significant savings in 2003 and 2004 in business improvement
initiatives like these towards accomplishing the $5 billion in cash savings
already realized, and it expects to achieve similar types of savings toward
the new goal of $2 billion in cash savings in future years.

Section 1110 Aircraft
Restructuring.

All vendors are being paid for all goods furnished
and services provided after the Petition Date in the ordinary course of
business. However, under Section 362 of the Bankruptcy Code, actions to
collect most of our pre-petition liabilities are automatically stayed,
among other things, except for liabilities relating to certain qualifying
aircraft, aircraft engines and other aircraft-related equipment that are
leased or subject to a security interest or conditional sale contract.
Under Section 1110 of the Bankruptcy Code, actions to collect such aircraft-related
pre-petition liabilities are automatically stayed for 60 days after the
Petition Date (the stay of such actions in our case ended on February 7,
2003), except under two conditions: (a) the debtor may extend the 60-day
period by agreement with the relevant financier and with court approval;
or (b) the debtor may agree to perform all of the obligations under the
applicable lease or financing and cure any defaults as required under the
Bankruptcy Code. If neither of these conditions is met, the lessor or financier
may demand the return of the aircraft and enforce any of its contractual
rights or remedies to sell, lease or otherwise retain or dispose of such
property.

We have negotiated with our
aircraft lessors and lenders to restructure existing financings to reduce
aircraft ownership costs to better reflect current market rates, and we
have reached agreements in principle to restructure transactions with respect
to a majority of our financed aircraft. However, the need for further cost
reductions due to difficult changes in the airline industry, substantially
higher fuel prices and the continuing weak revenue environment, has required
us to re-examine these agreements and to seek to renegotiate certain of
those financings. To the extent we are unable to restructure any financings
that we believe are unaffordable under our revised business plan, we may
face the possibility that one or more lessors or lenders may seek to repossess
aircraft. We also will need to finalize those agreements in principle,
and to the extent we are unable to do so, we may likewise face the possibility
of repossessions. In either case, the loss of a significant number of aircraft
could result in a material adverse effect on our financial and operational
performance.

We are currently in discussions
with a large group of mostly public-market financiers to renegotiate an
agreement in principle for a group of aircraft reached in the summer of
2004 from which we subsequently withdrew due to the need for further cost
reductions. While we believe we can ultimately reach a mutually acceptable
restructuring for the continued use of these aircraft at affordable rates,
the financiers have demanded the return of certain aircraft and there can
be no assurance that these aircraft will be available for our continued
use. To date, repossession of these aircraft has been enjoined by the Bankruptcy
Court, but to the extent the Bankruptcy Court, or another court of competent
jurisdiction, permits the repossession of these or other aircraft, our
financial and operational performance could be adversely affected.

We have also rejected or
abandoned certain surplus aircraft to adjust our fleet size and composition
to more closely match market demand, and are continuing this process to
achieve a reduced fleet of 455 aircraft in the first half of 2005. In addition,
as part of ongoing negotiations with financiers, we have converted many
long-term financing arrangements into short-term operating leases and,
in several instances, re-acquired previously rejected aircraft as circumstances
warranted.

Redeployment and Reduction
of Fleet.

On October 6, 2004, the Company announced a plan
to expand its international route network, redeploying aircraft to more
profitable routes and reducing the overall size of its mainline fleet.
These actions are part of the Company's ongoing strategy to adjust fleet
size and route mix to current market conditions, which continue to be intensely
competitive. Fundamental changes in our industry demand that we take aggressive
steps now to implement this plan to ensure that we remain competitive.
In the first half of 2005, the Company expects to:

Reallocate aircraft to more profitable routes, expanding and strengthening
the international network, which will account for over 40 percent of United's
global capacity, while shifting some additional domestic flying to United
Express.

Reduce United's mainline fleet to 455 aircraft - 42 fewer aircraft than
United flew in December 2004 and a reduction of 112 aircraft (or nearly
20 percent) of the fleet since December 2002.

These changes are expected to
result in international ASMs increasing by 14 percent, with United mainline
domestic ASMs declining by 12 percent, for a total systemwide ASM decline
of 3 percent in 2005 as compared to 2004.

In addition, the Ted fleet
of aircraft will grow from 47 to 56 aircraft. The Company plans to expand
its Ted fleet by converting nine mainline A320 aircraft to the Ted configuration.

Municipal Bond Obligations.

As a result of our bankruptcy filing, we are not permitted to make payments
on unsecured pre-petition debt. We have been advised that our special facility
revenue bonds ("municipal bonds") may be unsecured (or in certain instances,
partially secured) pre-petition debt. At December 31, 2004, we had approximately
$1.7 billion outstanding in municipal bonds that were issued on behalf
of United to finance the construction of improvements at airport-related
facilities.

During 2003, we filed complaints
for declaratory judgment and corresponding motions for temporary restraining
orders concerning United's municipal bond obligations (which represent
approximately $509 million in principal) for facilities at the Denver International
Airport ("DEN"), the New York City - John F. Kennedy International Airport
("JFK"), the San Francisco International Airport ("SFO"), and the Los Angeles
International Airport ("LAX"). In each case, we sought clarification of
our obligations to pay principal and interest under the applicable municipal
bonds, and the protection of our rights concerning related airport lease
agreements at the applicable airports. In addition, we filed a complaint
for declaratory judgment for all seven municipal bond issues (which represents
approximately $601 million in principal) relating to our facilities at
Chicago O'Hare International Airport ("O'Hare"), seeking, among other things,
a declaration that a certain cross-default provision in the O'Hare airport
lease is unenforceable.

We have received a favorable
ruling for JFK, and adverse rulings for DEN, SFO and LAX. The Company has
appealed each of these adverse rulings and expects that the defendants
will appeal the ruling in the JFK matter. The outcome of these matters
is uncertain and, therefore, the ultimate treatment of these municipal
bond obligations in reorganization is uncertain.

On February 15, 2005, the
Bankruptcy Court approved an agreement resolving the disputes between the
parties to the O'Hare proceeding that in effect reduces the Company's indebtedness
related to these bond issues from approximately $601 million to $150 million
(the "O'Hare Settlement Agreement"). The City of Chicago, a party to these
adversary proceedings, is not a party to the O'Hare Settlement Agreement.

For further details, see
Note 16 "Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Uncertainties" in the

Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Claims Resolution Process.

As permitted under the bankruptcy process, our creditors have filed proofs
of claim with the Bankruptcy Court and we expect new claims to be filed
in the future. Approximately 44,000 proofs of claim (including late-filed
claims) have been filed so far with the Bankruptcy Court requesting payments
from United. Through the claims resolution process we have identified many
claims which we believe should be disallowed by the Bankruptcy Court, for
a number of reasons such as our identification of claims that are duplicative,
have been amended or superseded by later filed claims, are without merit,
or are otherwise overstated. We have filed omnibus objections to many of
these claims and will continue to file additional objections. As of December
31, 2004, approximately 31,000 of the total claims have either been withdrawn
by the claimants or disallowed by the Bankruptcy Court.

As of December 31, 2004,
approximately 13,000 proofs of claim totaling $57 billion remain filed
with the Bankruptcy Court. The remaining amount of the proofs of claim
filed continues to far exceed our estimate of ultimate liability. Differences
in amount between claims filed by creditors and liabilities shown in our
records continue to be investigated and resolved in connection with our
claims resolution process. While we have made significant progress to date,
we expect this process to continue for some time and believe that further
resolution of claims will enable us to determine with more precision the
likely range of creditor distributions under a proposed plan of reorganization.
We have recorded liability amounts for the claims that can be reasonably
estimated and which we believe are probable of being allowed by the Bankruptcy
Court and we have classified these as liabilities subject to compromise
in the attached

Statements of Consolidated Financial Position

.

We will continue to evaluate
existing and new claims filed and will make adjustments, as appropriate.
To date, such adjustments have been material and we anticipate that future
adjustments will be material as well. At this time, the ultimate number
and allowed amount of such claims cannot be determined, due primarily to
the uncertainties of the Chapter 11 process, and the in-progress state
of our investigation and resolution of submitted claims.

Results of Operations

The air travel business is
subject to seasonal fluctuations. Our operations can be impacted by adverse
weather and our first- and fourth-quarter results normally reflect reduced
travel demand. Historically, results of operations are better in the second
and third quarters. From 2001 through 2003, however, the typical seasonal
relationships were distorted by the events of September 11, 2001, the fear
of terrorism, the Iraq war, fluctuations in fuel prices, and general economic
conditions. The Company experienced a more typical seasonal pattern of
financial results in 2004.

Summary of Results.

UAL's
loss from operations was $(0.9) billion in 2004, compared to $(1.4) billion
in 2003 and $(2.8) billion in 2002. UAL's net loss for 2004 was $(1.7)
billion, or $(15.25) per share, compared to $(2.8) billion, or $(27.36)
per share in 2003 and $(3.2) billion, or $(53.55) per share in 2002.

The 2004 results included
a favorable adjustment to passenger mainline revenue of $60 million, an
operating charge of $47 million related to our Mileage Plus frequent flyer
program and non-operating special items of $5 million. Additionally, non-operating
expense includes $158 million in gains from the sale of investments as
well as $611 million in reorganization expenses related to our bankruptcy
filing.

The 2003 results include
operating special items of $178 million (including curtailment charges
of $152 million) and non-operating special items of $251 million. Additionally,
non-operating expense includes $300 million in government compensation
and $158 million in gains from the sale of investments, as well as $1.2
billion in reorganization expenses related to our bankruptcy filing.

The 2002 results include
operating special items of $149 million. Additionally, non-operating expense
includes $130 million in government compensation and $46 million in gains
from the sale of investments, as well as $10 million in reorganization
costs.

Certain items are described
more fully in Note 1, "Voluntary Reorganization Under Chapter 11," Note
3, "Special Items," and Note 7 "Investments" in the

As of third quarter 2004,
all of our United Express regional carrier revenues and expenses are presented
gross on our financial statements. Prior periods have been reclassified
to conform to this presentation. See Note 2(i), "Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies - United Express" in the

2004 Compared with 2003

-

Operating Revenues.

Consolidated operating revenues increased by 10%, or $1.5 billion, in 2004
as compared to 2003, and United's mainline revenue per available seat mile
increased 1% from 9.57 cents to 9.70 cents. Mainline passenger revenues
increased 10%, or $1.2 billion, primarily due to a 10% increase in revenue
passenger miles. United's system available seat miles increased 6% and
passenger load factor increased 2.7 points to 79.2%. The following analysis
by market is based on information reported to the DOT for United:

Cargo revenues increased
by 12%, or $74 million, in 2004 as compared to 2003 due to a 5% increase
in cargo ton miles and a 6% increase in cargo yields. Other operating revenues
decreased 12%, or $175 million, primarily due to a decrease of $295 million
in United Airlines Fuel Corporation ("UAFC") fuel sales to third parties,
partially offset by increases in third party maintenance revenues and ULS
revenues.

Operating Expenses.

Consolidated operating expenses increased 6%, or $957 million, in 2004
as compared to 2003 and United's mainline cost per available seat mile
decreased 3% from 10.46 cents to 10.16 cents.

(a)  Increased primarily as a result of a 33%
increase in the average cost of fuel (including tax and hedge impact) and
a 7% increase in consumption.

(b)  Increased primarily due to increased capacity
flown by our regional carriers.

(c)  Increased as a result of increased levels
of outsourcing of cargo handling and aircraft cleaning; higher credit card
discount fees and computer reservation system fees associated with higher
passenger revenues; and increased professional fees.

(d)  Increased due to higher levels of maintenance
activity, including contracted maintenance and maintenance materials.

(e)  Decreased primarily due to lower third-party
fuel sales by UAFC.

(f)   Decreased due to restructuring of
aircraft lease obligations and fleet reductions.

(g)  Increased due to higher commissionable
passenger revenues.

Other income (expense).

Other non-operating expense amounted to $424 million in 2004 compared to
$478 million in 2003, excluding special items, reorganization items, gains
on sales and government compensation. Interest expense decreased 15%, or
$78 million, primarily due to a lower number of mortgaged aircraft and
lower fees and interest associated with our debtor-in-possession secured
financing ("DIP Financing"). Interest income decreased 55%, or $30 million,
primarily due to interest income on IRS tax refunds received in 2003 offset
partially by higher amounts of interest earned on restricted cash in 2004.

2003 Compared with 2002

-

Operating Revenues.

Consolidated operating revenues decreased 6%, or $894 million, in 2003
as compared to 2002 and United's mainline revenue per available seat mile
increased 1% from 9.52 cents to 9.57 cents. Mainline passenger revenues
decreased 7%, or $810 million, due to a 5% decrease in revenue passenger
miles and a 2% decrease in yield. United's system available seat miles
decreased 8%; however, passenger load factor increased 3.0 points to 76.5%.
The following analysis by market is based on information reported to the
DOT for United:

Cargo revenues decreased
6%, or $43 million, in 2004 as compared to 2003 due to a 17% decrease in
cargo ton miles partially offset by a 13% increase in cargo yield. Other
operating revenues decreased 17%, or $289 million, primarily due to a $209
million decrease in UAFC fuel sales to third parties, as well as decreases
in third-party maintenance revenues and ULS revenues.

Operating Expenses.

Consolidated operating expenses decreased 13%, or $2.4 billion, in 2003
as compared to 2002 and United's mainline cost per available seat mile
decreased 8% from 11.32 cents to 10.46 cents.

(a)  Decreased primarily as the result of lower
capacity and new labor agreements for all employee groups that both lowered
wage and benefit levels and enabled significant enhanced productivity levels.
The 2003 amount also includes a one-time benefit of $102 million for the
reversal of a contractual payment to certain employees and changes in vacation
accruals as a result of new lower pay rates for all union groups, and a
curtailment charge of $152 million.

(b)  Increased primarily due to increased capacity
flown by our regional carriers.

(c)  Decreased due to lower third-party fuel
sales by UAFC.

(d)  Decreased due to the restructuring and
rejections of aircraft financings under Section 1110.

(e)  Decreased primarily due to a decrease
in commissionable revenues.

(f)   Decreased primarily due to volume-driven
decreases in crew layover expenses and food and beverage costs.

Other income (expense).

Other non-operating expense amounted to $478 million in 2003 compared to
$527 million in 2002, excluding special items, reorganization items, gains
on sales and government compensation. Interest expense decreased 11%, or
$63 million, as we discontinued recording interest expense on all unsecured
pre-petition debt. Interest capitalized decreased 88%, or $22 million,
as we discontinued capitalizing interest on advance payments for aircraft
pending discussions with the aircraft manufacturers regarding the status
of future deliveries.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The matters described
in "Liquidity and Capital Resources," to the extent that they relate to
future events or expectations, may be significantly affected by the Chapter
11 reorganization process. Those proceedings involve, or may result in,
various restrictions on the Company's activities, limitations on financing,
and may require Bankruptcy Court and Creditors' Committee approval for
various matters, and may create uncertainty as to ongoing relationships
with vendors, suppliers, customers and others with whom we may conduct
or seek to conduct business.

Generally, under the Bankruptcy
Code most of a debtor's liabilities must be satisfied in full before the
debtor's stockholders can receive any distribution on account of such shares.
The rights and claims of our various creditors and security holders will
be determined by the confirmed plan of reorganization. It is likely that
pre-petition unsecured claims against the Company will be substantially
impaired in connection with our reorganization. At this time we can make
no prediction concerning how each of these claims will be valued in the
bankruptcy proceedings. We believe that UAL's presently outstanding equity
securities will have no value and it is expected that those securities
will be canceled under any plan of reorganization that we propose.

Liquidity

.

UAL's total of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, including
restricted cash, was $2.2 billion at December 31, 2004, compared to $2.4
billion at December 31, 2003.

As of December 31, 2004,
we had $877 million in restricted cash, an increase of $198 million as
compared to December 31, 2003. Restricted cash primarily represents cash
collateral to secure workers' compensation obligations, security deposits
for airport leases and reserves with institutions that process our credit
card ticket sales. Prior to 2003, we met many of these obligations (which
were smaller in amount) through surety bonds or secured letters of credit;
however, such facilities are currently largely unavailable to us. As a
result, we may be required to post significant additional cash collateral
to meet such obligations in the future.

The Company's agreement with
a bank for MasterCard and Visa processing currently does not provide the
bank with the right to withhold any significant cash deposit to secure
the bank's potential obligations to card holders in the event the Company
does not provide the promised transportation services. This five-year agreement
expires on January 16, 2006. The Company is currently negotiating the terms
of a replacement agreement. In the event that the Company does not successfully
negotiate a replacement agreement on similar terms to the current agreement,
it is possible that the Company will be required to provide a significant
cash deposit to secure future processing of MasterCard and Visa charges
for the Company's ticket sales.

Operating Activities.

For the year ended December 31, 2004, we generated cash flow from operations
of $99 million, a significant decline of $902 million from operating cash
flows generated in 2003. Operations used cash of $1.1 billion in 2002.
The significant improvement in operating cash flow in 2003 was partly due
to the receipt of $365 million in income tax refunds and $314 million in
government compensation, together with other working capital changes.

In October 2003, United and
one of its subsidiaries, UAFC, entered into an agreement with a third party
to supply approximately 50% of the fuel required by United and UAFC and
assume some of their supply, infrastructure and third-party sale agreements.
The third party acquires fuel on behalf of United and UAFC, transports
it and maintains minimum inventory levels at specified locations for subsequent
sale to them. Under this arrangement, the Company generated approximately
$105 million of additional working capital during 2004 by reducing working
capital requirements for fuel inventory and accounts receivable.

We contributed $127 million
towards our pension funding obligations in 2004 and $6 million in 2003,
but made no cash contributions in 2002. Instead, we met our minimum required
contribution in 2002 by using a portion of our credit balance (the cumulative
difference between the prior year's minimum required contributions and
actual contributions). We currently anticipate that we will not make any
further cash pension contributions, and believe that it will be necessary
for the Company to terminate and replace its defined benefit pension plans
to obtain non-guaranteed exit financing and successfully emerge from bankruptcy.
Detailed information regarding our pension plans is included in Note 15,
"Retirement and Postretirement Plans" in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements

.

Investing Activities.

Cash used in investing activities was $322 million in 2004 compared to
cash generated from investing activities of $271 million in 2003 and $71
million in 2002. The change from 2003 to 2004 primarily reflects fewer
short-term investment conversions to cash, increased property additions
(including aircraft and aircraft spare parts), fewer proceeds from aircraft
sales and increased credit card holdbacks. During 2004, we re-acquired
two B737, one B757 and one B777 aircraft (all of which were previously
rejected). In addition, four B767 aircraft were transferred to non-operating
status, and we rejected (and/or returned to the lessor) 27 B737, two B747,
two B767 and four B777 aircraft under Section 1110 of the Bankruptcy Code.

Additionally, during 2004,
we received $218 million from the sales of our investments in Orbitz and
Air Canada. In 2003 and 2002, we received $150 million and $137 million,
respectively, related to the sale of our investments in Hotwire, Orbitz
and Cendant.

Financing Activities.

Cash flows used in financing activities were $46 million in 2004 and $336
million in 2003, compared to cash flows generated from financing activities
of $266 million in 2002. During 2004, we made principal payments under
debt and capital lease obligations of $180 million and $244 million, respectively.
These amounts represent payments made under Section 1110 elections for
aircraft obligations, which are currently classified as liabilities subject
to compromise.

During 2004, we made $313
million in principal payments on the DIP Financing. In addition, we renegotiated
and expanded our DIP Financing availability, allowing us to borrow an additional
$513 million.

During 2003, the sale of
two B747 aircraft and certain equity investments enabled us to pay down
a portion of the DIP Financing, allowing for additional amounts to be drawn
during the year. This activity resulted in a net reduction to our obligations
under the DIP Financing of $37 million.

At December 31, 2004, we
had a total of $863 million in debt outstanding under the DIP Financing
and $37 million in letters of credit. For further details, see Note 1,
"Voluntary Reorganization Under Chapter 11 - DIP Financing" in the

Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements

.

Capital Commitments
and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements.

Our business is very
capital intensive, requiring significant amounts of capital to fund the
acquisition of assets, particularly aircraft. In the past, we have funded
the acquisition of aircraft through outright purchase, by issuing debt,
by entering into capital or operating leases, or through vendor financings.
We also often enter into long-term lease commitments with airports to ensure
access to terminal, cargo, maintenance and other required facilities. As
can be seen in the table below, these operating lease commitments (which
are sometimes referred to as "off-balance sheet arrangements") are significant.

Following is a summary of
our material contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2004:

Although we are not generally
permitted to make any payments on pre-petition debt as a result of the
bankruptcy filing, we have reached agreements with certain aircraft financiers
under Section 1110 of the Bankruptcy Code and received approval from the
Bankruptcy Court to continue to make payments on certain aircraft debt
and lease obligations. The amounts included in the above table represent
only those obligations for which we have finalized an agreement; however,
these numbers are still subject to change until such time as the plan of
reorganization is approved and we emerge from bankruptcy. In addition,
we may still assume, assume and assign or reject certain executory contracts
and unexpired leases pursuant to the Bankruptcy Code. As a result, we anticipate
that other lease obligations as currently quantified in the preceding table
will continue to change.

At December 31, 2004, our
qualified and non-qualified future cash pension obligations approximated
$4.9 billion for the period of 2005 through 2010. Our future cash pension
obligations under existing plan provisions would be $1.3 billion in 2005,
$2.7 billion in 2006 and 2007, $0.8 billion in 2008 and 2009 and $0.1 billion
in 2010. Due to uncertainties regarding significant assumptions, such as
interest rates and asset returns, involved in estimating future required
contributions to our defined benefit pension plans, we are not able to
reasonably estimate our future required contributions beyond 2010. Effective
July 2004, the Company ceased making contributions to its qualified defined
benefit pension plans to preserve its liquidity and does not anticipate
making further contributions. The Company believes that in order to obtain
non-guaranteed exit financing, and successfully reorganize and emerge from
Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, it will be necessary to terminate and
replace its defined benefit pension plans. On December 30, 2004 and March
11, 2005, the PBGC filed complaints against the Company to seek the involuntary
termination of the defined benefit pension plan for certain employee groups. 
These estimated amounts of future cash obligations provided above do not
assume termination of any defined benefit pension plan nor do they take
into consideration any cash obligations that may arise from any replacement
plans. Due to significant uncertainties surrounding the future disposition
of the Company's defined benefit pension plans, related estimated cash
obligations have been omitted from the table of material contractual cash
obligations above.  See "Chapter 11 Restructuring Efforts - Pensions"
above for further details.

At December 31, 2004, our
future cash postretirement benefit payments approximated $0.9 billion for
the period of 2005 through 2010. Due to uncertainties regarding significant
assumptions involved in estimating future benefit payments under our postretirement
obligations (such as health care cost trend rates), we are not able to
reasonably estimate our future required cash flows beyond 2010.

At December 31, 2004,
future commitments for the purchase of property and equipment, principally
aircraft, approximated $1.8 billion, after deducting advance payments.
Our current commitments are primarily for the purchase of A319, A320 and
B777 aircraft. However, since September 11, 2001, we have reached agreements
with the aircraft manufacturers enabling us to delay delivery of future
orders. Since flexibility with our fleet plan is critical to our overall
restructuring, we continue to hold discussions regarding future deliveries
and it is likely that the amount and timing of these obligations will change,
and could potentially be eliminated in their entirety. The disposition
of $161 million of advance payments made by the Company to the manufacturers
is also uncertain and will be subject to the ultimate outcome of these
discussions. In March 2005, United reached an agreement with respect to
the undelivered B777 aircraft, eliminating this obligation and allowing
United to use a significant portion of the approximately $45 million in
associated advance payments for other purposes. However, since that agreement
remains subject to Bankruptcy Court approval, we have not excluded those
commitments from the obligations above.

See Note 9, "Long-Term Debt,"
Note 10, "Lease Obligations," Note 15, "Retirement and Postretirement Plans"
and Note 16, "Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Uncertainties" in
the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

for additional discussion
of these items.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

- - An off-balance sheet arrangement is any transaction, agreement or other
contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which
a company has (1) made guarantees, (2) a retained or a contingent interest
in transferred assets, (3) an obligation under derivative instruments classified
as equity or (4) any obligation arising out of a material variable interest
in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market
risk or credit risk support to the Company, or that engages in leasing,
hedging or research and development arrangements with the Company. The
Company has off-balance sheet arrangements related to (1) and (4) above
as noted below.

Certain municipalities issued
municipal bonds on behalf of United to finance the construction of improvements
at airport-related facilities. The Company leases facilities at airports
where municipal bonds funded at least some of the construction of airport-related
projects. However, as a result of our bankruptcy filing, we are not permitted
to make payments on unsecured pre-petition debt. We have been advised that
our municipal bonds may be unsecured (or in certain instances, partially
secured) pre-petition debt. At December 31, 2004, $1.2 billion in principal
of such bonds was outstanding but not recorded in the

Statements of
Consolidated Financial Position

in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles ("GAAP"). The Company has determined that these bonds
are pre-petition obligations and accordingly has reclassified certain accrued
and unpaid rent pertaining to these off-balance sheet arrangements to liabilities
subject to compromise. As of December 31, 2004, UAL and United had jointly
guaranteed $60 million of such bonds and United had guaranteed $1.2 billion
of such bonds, including accrued interest. For further details, see "Municipal
Bond Obligations" above and Note 16 "Commitments, Contingent Liabilities
and Uncertainties" in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

.

We have various financing
arrangements for aircraft in which the lessors are trusts established specifically
to purchase, finance and lease aircraft to us. These leasing entities meet
the criteria for variable interest entities; however, we are not considered
the primary beneficiary of the leasing entities since the lease terms are
consistent with market terms at the inception of the lease and do not include
a residual value guarantee, fixed-price purchase option or similar feature
that obligates us to absorb decreases in value or entitles us to participate
in increases in the value of the aircraft. These financing arrangements
include 114 aircraft operating leases that contain a fair market value
purchase option. These leases are subject to, and would become effective
upon, the assumption of the leases by United in association with confirmation
of a plan of reorganization. In addition, the Company has

84operating
leases that have either fixed price or fair market value purchase options,
the majority of which the Company expects to renegotiate as permitted under
Section 1110. United does not guarantee the residual value of these leased
aircraft.

In addition, the Company
has operating leases, primarily for aircraft (including the aircraft noted
above), with total future minimum lease payments of $14.5 billion as of
December 31, 2004. For detailed information, see Note 10, "Lease Obligations"
in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

.

Capital Resources.

J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, Citicorp USA, Inc., The CIT Group/Business Credit,
Inc. and General Electric Capital Corporation provide our DIP Financing,
a $1.0 billion financing facility of which only $900 million is available
due to a $100 million holdback for collateral maintenance and liquidation
expenses. The DIP Financing consists of a revolving credit and letter of
credit facility of $200 million and a term loan of $800 million, which
matures on September 30, 2005. At December 31, 2004, we had outstanding
borrowings of $863 million and issued letters of credit totaling $37 million.
Therefore, we currently do not have any additional access to capital under
the DIP Financing. We believe that the existing DIP Financing is adequate
to provide for our projected future liquidity needs through our emergence
from bankruptcy.

With the historically high
fuel prices and continuing weak revenue environment, we have continued
to restructure our costs to achieve a business plan that will permit the
Company to qualify for non-guaranteed exit financing for our projected
future liquidity needs upon emergence from bankruptcy. This non-guaranteed
exit financing, together with other available cash and cash flows from
future operations, is expected to provide us with adequate levels of liquidity
necessary for our ongoing operations and to service our restructured fixed
obligations. We expect that in order for the Company to qualify for non-guaranteed
exit financing, we will be required to conform to financial covenants,
and that such financing would be approved as part of an overall plan of
reorganization. However, the Company cannot guarantee that such financing
will be obtained, or that a plan of reorganization will be approved or
implemented successfully.

Other Information

Price Competition.

United's domestic competitors have initiated fundamental changes to their
fare structures to compete with low-cost carriers with significant fare
adjustments continuing to occur in early 2005. Fare discounting by competitors
has historically had a negative effect on our financial results because
we are generally required to match competitors' fares to maintain passenger
traffic. Because of vastly different cost structures, low ticket prices
that generate a profit for a low-cost carrier usually have a negative effect
on our financial results. We are unable to accurately predict the financial
impact of existing and future competitive fare adjustments on our financial
results.

Foreign Operations.

We
generate revenues and incur expenses in numerous foreign currencies. Such
expenses include aircraft leases, commissions, catering, personnel expense,
advertising and distribution costs, customer service expenses and aircraft
maintenance. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact our results
of operations through changes in the dollar value of foreign currency-denominated
operating revenues and expenses.

Despite the adverse effects
a strengthening foreign currency may have on U.S. originating traffic,
a strengthening of foreign currencies tends to increase reported revenue
and operating income because our foreign currency-denominated operating
revenue generally exceeds our foreign currency-denominated operating expense
for each currency. Likewise, despite the favorable effects a weakening
foreign currency may have on U.S. originating traffic, a weakening of foreign
currencies tends to decrease reported revenue and operating income.

Our biggest net foreign currency
exposures are typically for the Australian dollar, British pound, Canadian
dollar, Chinese renminbi, Hong Kong dollar and Japanese yen. The table
below sets forth our exposure to various currencies for 2004:

Our foreign operations involve
insignificant amounts of dedicated physical assets; however, we do have
sizable intangible assets related to our previous acquisitions of Atlantic
and Latin American route authorities. Because operating authorities in
international markets are governed by bilateral aviation agreements between
the U.S. and foreign countries, changes in U.S. or foreign government aviation
policies can lead to the alteration or termination of existing air service
agreements that could adversely impact the value of our international route
authorities. Significant changes in such policies could also have a material
impact on our operating revenues and results of operations.

Environmental and Legal
Contingencies.

United has been named as a Potentially Responsible
Party at certain Environmental Protection Agency or State Environmental
Protection Agency ("EPA or State EPA") cleanup sites that have been designated
as Superfund Sites. Our alleged proportionate contributions at the sites
are minimal; however, at sites where the EPA or State EPA has commenced
litigation or administrative proceedings, potential liability is joint
and several. Additionally, we have participated and are participating in
remediation actions at certain other sites, primarily airports. We accrue
the estimated cost of these actions when we have determined that it is
probable that we are liable. Environmental regulations and remediation
processes are subject to future change, and determining the actual cost
of remediation often requires further investigation and additional progress
of the remediation. Therefore, the ultimate disposition cannot be exactly
predicted. However, while such ultimate cost may vary from our current
estimate, we believe the difference between the accrued reserve and the
ultimate liability will not be material.

UAL has certain other contingencies
resulting from the above environmental actions and other litigation and
claims incident to the ordinary course of business. Management believes,
after considering a number of factors, including (but not limited to) the
views of legal counsel, the nature of such contingencies and prior experience,
that the ultimate disposition of these contingencies is not likely to materially
affect the Company's financial condition, operating results or liquidity.

The Company anticipates that
its liability from claims arising from the events of September 11, 2001
will be significant; however, we believe that, under the Act, our liability
will be limited to our insurance coverage. We have not incurred any material
environmental obligations relating to the events of September 11, 2001.

As a result of our Chapter
11 filing, as of the Petition Date virtually all pending litigation is
stayed, and absent further order of the Bankruptcy Court, no party, subject
to certain exceptions, may take any action, again subject to certain exceptions,
to recover on pre-petition claims against the Company.

Critical Accounting
Policies.

Critical accounting policies are defined as those
that are affected by significant judgments and uncertainties and potentially
could result in materially different accounting under different assumptions
and conditions. We have prepared the accompanying financial statements
in conformity with GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements
and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates
under different assumptions or conditions. We have identified the following
critical accounting policies that impact the preparation of these financial
statements.

Accounting for Long-Lived
Assets.

We have approximately $14.2 billion in net book value of
operating property and equipment at December 31, 2004. In addition to the
original cost of these assets, their recorded value is impacted by a number
of accounting policy elections, including the estimation of useful lives
and residual values and, when necessary, the recognition of asset impairment
charges.

We record aircraft at acquisition
cost. Depreciable life is determined through economic analysis, such as
reviewing existing fleet plans, and comparing estimated lives to other
airlines that operate similar fleets. Older generation aircraft are assigned
lives of 25 years that is generally consistent with the experience of United
and the practice of other airlines. As aircraft technology has improved,
useful life has increased and we have estimated the lives of "new generation"
aircraft to be 30 years. Residual values are estimated based on our historical
experience with regards to the sale of both aircraft and spare parts, and
are established in conjunction with the estimated useful lives of the related
fleets. Residual values are based on current dollars when the aircraft
are acquired and typically reflect asset values that have not reached the
end of their physical life. Both depreciable lives and residual values
are revised periodically to recognize changes in our fleet plan and other
relevant information.

Our policy is to recognize
an impairment charge when an asset's carrying value exceeds its net undiscounted
future cash flows and its fair market value. The amount of the charge is
the difference between the asset's book value and fair market value (sometimes
estimated using third-party appraisals). Typically, we estimate the undiscounted
future cash flows for our various aircraft with financial models used by
the Company to make fleet and scheduling decisions. These models utilize
our projections of passenger yield, fuel costs, labor costs and other relevant
factors specific to the markets where the aircraft will operate.

In 2003, this process resulted
in the recognition of an impairment charge of $26 million for the early
retirement of the B767-200 aircraft fleet. (See Note 3, "Special Items"
in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

.)

See Note 2(f), "Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies - Operating Property and Equipment" in
the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

for additional information
regarding United's policies on accounting for long-lived assets.

Frequent Flyer Accounting.

United's Mileage Plus frequent flyer program awards miles to passengers
who fly on United, Ted, United Express, the Star Alliance carriers and
certain other airlines that participate in the program. Additionally, United
sells mileage credits to participating airline partners in the Mileage
Plus program and ULS sells mileage credits to non-airline business partners.
In either case, the outstanding miles may be redeemed for travel on any
airline that participates in the program (in which case, United pays a
designated amount to the transporting carrier). The Company has an obligation
to provide this future travel; therefore, we recognize a liability and
corresponding expense for mileage earned by passengers who flew on United,
Ted, United Express, Star Alliance partners, or one of the Mileage Plus
airline partners. For miles earned by members through non-airline business
partners, a portion of revenue from the sale of mileage is deferred and
recognized when the transportation is provided.

At December 31, 2004, our
estimated outstanding number of awards to be issued against earned and
outstanding mileage credits was approximately 10.2 million, as compared
with 9.7 million at the end of the prior year. We currently estimate that
approximately 8.4 million of these awards will ultimately be redeemed and,
accordingly, have recorded a liability of $840 million, which includes
the deferred revenue from the sale of miles to non-airline business partners.
We utilize a number of estimates in accounting for the Mileage Plus program
that require management judgment.

Members may not reach the
threshold necessary for a free ticket award and outstanding miles may not
always be redeemed for free travel. Therefore, based on historical data
and other information, we estimate how many miles will never be used for
an award and exclude those miles from our estimate of the Company's liability.
We also estimate the number of miles that will be used per award which
can vary depending upon member choices from alternatives. If actual miles
used are more or less than previously estimated, we must subsequently adjust
the liability and corresponding expense.

When a travel award level
is attained by a Mileage Plus member, we record a liability for the estimated
incremental cost to United of providing the related future travel, based
on expected redemption. For award redemptions on United, United's incremental
costs are estimated to include variable items such as fuel, meals, insurance
and ticketing costs, for what would otherwise be a vacant seat. The estimate
of incremental costs does not include any indirect costs or contribution
to overhead or profit. A change to these cost estimates could have a significant
impact on our liability in the year of change as well as in future years,
since underlying variable cost factors (such as the price of fuel) can
vary significantly from period to period.

In 2004, 1.7 million Mileage
Plus travel awards were used on United as compared to 2.0 million in each
of 2003 and 2002. This number represents the number of awards for which
travel was actually provided and not the number of seats that were allocated
to award travel. These awards represented 7.4% of United's total revenue
passenger miles in 2004, 9.0% in 2003 and 7.8% in 2002. Passenger preference
for Saver awards, which have stringent seat inventory level limitations,
keeps the potential displacement of revenue passengers by award travel
at an acceptable level. Total miles redeemed for travel on United in 2004,
including travel awards and class-of-service upgrades, represented 77%
of the total miles redeemed, of which 71% were used for travel within the
U.S. and Canada.

In addition to the awards
issued for travel on United, approximately 23% of the total miles redeemed
in 2004 were used for travel on partner airlines. In these cases, United
estimates its liability based upon agreements with partner airlines that
specify reimbursement rates. Costs to United for awards issued on partner
airlines are generally much higher than incremental costs of awards issued
for travel on United. Therefore, a change in customer preference from United
to a partner airline can significantly affect the estimated cost of mileage
credits.

Pension Accounting.

The Company accounts for pension benefits using SFAS No. 87, "

Employers'
Accounting for Pensions

" ("SFAS No. 87"). Under SFAS No. 87, pension
expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees' approximate service
periods and is generally calculated independently of funding decisions
or requirements. Detailed information regarding our pension plans is included
in Note 15, "Retirement and Postretirement Plans" in the

Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements

. Our anticipated future funding requirements are
discussed in "Chapter 11 Restructuring Efforts" above.

The calculation of pension
expense and pension obligations requires the use of a number of assumptions,
including the assumed discount rate and the expected return on plan assets.
The fair value of plan assets increased from $7.0 billion at December 31,
2003 to $7.2 billion at December 31, 2004. Higher benefit obligations resulting
from increased retirements and declining discount rates have increased
the difference between the plans' fair value and accumulated benefit obligations
from $5.7 billion at December 31, 2003 to $6.0 billion at December 31,
2004.

We utilized a weighted-average
discount rate of 5.84% at December 31, 2004, compared to 6.25% at December
31, 2003 and 6.75% at December 31, 2002. The discount rates were based
on the Rate: Link approach for 2004 and

Moody's Aa bond index yield
model for 2003 and 2002, adjusted according to the timing of expected cash
flows for our future pension obligations. Duration is a commonly used measure
of interest rate risk that either assumes that yield changes do not change
the expected cash flows ("modified duration") or assumes that expected
cash flows may change given the fact that the yield changes ("effective
duration"). Since United's pension obligations are generally not satisfied
in a single lump sum distribution, management, with assistance from our
actuary, used the modified duration methodology to determine an acceptable
discount rate by matching the expected cash outflows of our pension obligations
against available bonds with appropriate maturities.

We assumed an expected rate
of return on plan assets of 9.0% at December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. The
expected return on plan assets is based on an evaluation of the historical
behavior of the broad financial markets and the Company's investment portfolio,
taking into consideration input from the plans' investment consultant and
actuary regarding expected long-term market conditions and investment management
performance. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based
on a target allocation of assets to the following fund types: 60% equities,
35% fixed income and 5% other with approximate expected long-term rates
of return of 10%, 7.5% and 15%, respectively.

We believe that the long-term
asset allocation on average will approximate the targeted allocation and
we regularly review the actual asset allocation to periodically rebalance
the investments to the targeted allocation when appropriate. Pension expense
is reduced by the expected return on plan assets, which is measured by
assuming the market-related value of plan assets increases at the expected
rate of return. The market-related value is a calculated value that phases
in differences between the expected rate of return and the actual return
over a period of five years.

Actuarial gains or losses
are triggered by changes in assumptions or experience that differ from
the original assumptions. Under SFAS No. 87, those gains and losses are
not required to be recognized currently as pension expense, but instead
may be deferred. If the unrecognized net gain or loss exceeds 10% of the
greater of the projected benefit obligations and the market-related value
of plan assets, the amount outside the 10% corridor is subject to amortization
over the average remaining service life of the covered active employees.
At December 31, 2004, we had unrecognized actuarial losses of $4.0 billion,
which will be amortized into future years' pension expense. Additionally,
we had unrecognized prior service costs from past benefit improvements
of $636 million, which will be amortized as a component of pension expense
over the average remaining service of the covered active employees.

Valuation Allowance
for Deferred Tax Assets.

We initially recorded a tax valuation
allowance against our deferred tax assets in the third quarter of 2002.
In recording the valuation allowance, management considered whether it
was more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets would
be realized. This analysis included consideration of scheduled reversals
of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, carryback
potential and tax planning strategies, in accordance with SFAS No. 109,
"

Accounting for Income Taxes

." At December 31, 2004, our valuation
allowance totaled $2.8 billion. See also Note 6, "Income Taxes" in the

Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements

for additional information.

Policies" in the

Outlook

United expects first-quarter
system mainline capacity to be down about 2% year-over-year. System mainline
capacity for 2005 is expected to be about 3% lower than 2004. The Company
projects fuel price, including taxes and expected hedge impact, for the
first quarter to average $1.44 per gallon. The Company has 32% of its expected
fuel consumption for the first quarter hedged at an average of $1.38 per
gallon, including taxes.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Interest Rate Risk -

United's exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates
relates primarily to its debt obligations (including capital leases) and
short-term investments. We do not use derivative financial instruments
in our investment portfolio. Our policy is to manage interest rate risk
through a combination of fixed and floating rate debt and entering into
swap agreements, depending upon market conditions. A portion of our borrowings
is denominated in foreign currencies that expose us to risks associated
with changes in foreign exchange rates. To hedge against some of this risk,
we have placed foreign currency deposits (primarily for euros) to meet
foreign currency lease obligations designated in the respective currencies.
Since unrealized mark-to-market gains or losses on the foreign currency
deposits are offset by the losses or gains on the foreign currency obligations,
we reduce our overall exposure to foreign currency exchange rate volatility.
The fair value of these deposits is determined based on the present value
of future cash flows using an appropriate swap rate. The fair value of
long-term debt is based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar
issues or the present value of future cash flows using a U.S. Treasury
rate that matches the remaining life of the instrument, adjusted by a credit
spread.


Estimated fair values represent
the amount United would pay/receive on December 31, 2004 or December 31,
2003 to terminate the contracts.

Price Risk (Aircraft Fuel)

- - When market conditions indicate risk reduction is achievable, United
enters into fuel option contracts to reduce its price risk exposure to
jet fuel. The option contracts are designed to provide protection against
sharp increases in the price of aircraft fuel. As market conditions change,
so may United's hedging program. During the second quarter of 2004, we
began hedging future aircraft fuel purchases for 2004 and beyond.


Estimated fair values represent
the amount United would pay/receive on December 31, 2004 to terminate the
contracts.

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

UAL Corporation

Elk Grove Township, Illinois

We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial
position of UAL Corporation (Debtor-in-Possession) and subsidiaries as
of December 31, 2004 and 2003 and the related consolidated statements of
operations, stockholders' deficit, and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2004. Our audits also included the
financial statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 15. These consolidated
financial statements and the financial statement schedules are the responsibility
of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on these financial statements and financial statement schedules based on
our audit.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of UAL Corporation (Debtor-in-Possession)
and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2004 in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the financial
statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated
financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material
respects, the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 1, the Company filed for reorganization under Chapter
11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. The accompanying financial statements
do not purport to reflect or provide for the consequences of the bankruptcy
proceedings. In particular, such financial statements do not purport to
show (a) as to assets, their realizable value on a liquidation basis or
their availability to satisfy liabilities; (b) as to prepetition liabilities,
the amounts that may be allowed for claims or contingencies, or the status
and priority thereof; (c) as to stockholder accounts, the effect of any
changes that may be made in the capitalization of the Company; or (d) as
to operations, the effect of any changes that may be made in its business.

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that
the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1, as
a result of the bankruptcy filing, realization of assets and satisfaction
of liabilities, without substantial adjustments and/or changes in ownership,
are subject to uncertainty and raise substantial doubt about the Company's
ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plan concerning these
matters is also discussed in Note 1. The financial statements do not include
adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of
the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December
31, 2004, based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission and our report dated March 15, 2005 expressed an unqualified
opinion on management's assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's
internal control over financial reporting and an unqualified opinion on
the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(1) Voluntary Reorganization Under Chapter 11

Bankruptcy Considerations.

On December 9, 2002 ("Petition Date"), UAL, United and 26 direct and indirect
wholly owned subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions to reorganize their
businesses under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the
United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern
Division (the "Bankruptcy Court"). The Bankruptcy Court is jointly administering
these cases as "In re UAL Corporation, et al., Case No. 02-B-48191." The
consolidated financial statements shown here include certain subsidiaries
that did not file to reorganize under Chapter 11. The assets and liabilities
of these subsidiaries are not considered material to the consolidated financial
statements.

As required by the Bankruptcy
Code, the United States Trustee for the Northern District of Illinois appointed
on December 13, 2002 an official committee of unsecured creditors (the
"Creditors' Committee"). The Creditors' Committee and its legal representatives
have a right to be heard on all matters that come before the Bankruptcy
Court concerning our reorganization. There can be no assurance that the
Creditors' Committee will support our positions or our plan of reorganization,
and any disagreements between the Creditors' Committee and us could protract
the Chapter 11 process, hinder our ability to operate during the Chapter
11 process, and delay our emergence from Chapter 11.

With the exception of our
non-filing subsidiaries, we continue to operate our businesses as "debtors-in-possession"
under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy
Procedure and applicable court orders. In general, as debtors-in-possession,
we are authorized under Chapter 11 to continue to operate as an ongoing
business, but may not engage in transactions outside the ordinary course
of business without the prior approval of the Bankruptcy Court.

All vendors are being paid
for all goods furnished and services provided after the Petition Date in
the ordinary course of business. However, under Section 362 of the Bankruptcy
Code, actions to collect most of our pre-petition liabilities are automatically
stayed, among other things, except for liabilities relating to certain
qualifying aircraft, aircraft engines and other aircraft-related equipment
that are leased or subject to a security interest or conditional sale contract.
Under Section 1110 of the Bankruptcy Code, actions to collect such aircraft-related
pre-petition liabilities are automatically stayed for 60 days after the
Petition Date (the stay of such actions in our case ended on February 7,
2003), except under two conditions: (a) the debtor may extend the 60-day
period by agreement with the relevant financier and with court approval;
or (b) the debtor may agree to perform all of the obligations under the
applicable lease or financing and cure any defaults as required under the
Bankruptcy Code. If neither of these conditions is met, the lessor or financier
may demand the return of the aircraft and enforce any of its contractual
rights or remedies to sell, lease or otherwise retain or dispose of such
property.

We have negotiated with our
aircraft lessors and lenders to restructure existing financings to reduce
aircraft ownership costs to better reflect current market rates, and we
have reached agreements in principle to restructure transactions with respect
to a majority of our financed aircraft. However, the need for further cost
reductions due to difficult changes in the airline industry, substantially
higher fuel prices and the continuing weak revenue environment, has required
us to re-examine these agreements and to seek to renegotiate certain of
those financings. To the extent we are unable to restructure any financings
that we believe are unaffordable under our revised business plan, we may
face the possibility that one or more lessors or lenders may seek to repossess
aircraft. We also will need to finalize those agreements in principle,
and to the extent we are unable to do so, we may likewise face the possibility
of repossessions. In either case, the loss of a significant number of aircraft
could result in a material adverse affect on our financial and operational
performance.

We are currently in discussions
with a large group of mostly public-market financiers to renegotiate an
agreement in principle for a group of aircraft reached in the summer of
2004 from which we subsequently withdrew due to the need for further cost
reductions. While we believe we can ultimately reach a mutually acceptable
restructuring for the continued use of these aircraft at affordable rates,
the financiers have demanded the return of certain aircraft and there can
be no assurance that these aircraft will be available for our continued
use. To date, repossession of these aircraft has been enjoined by the Bankruptcy
Court, but to the extent the Bankruptcy Court, or another court of competent
jurisdiction, permits the repossession of these or other aircraft, our
financial and operational performance could be adversely affected.

We have also rejected or
abandoned certain surplus aircraft to adjust our fleet size and composition
to more closely match market demand. In addition, as part of ongoing negotiations
with financiers, we have converted many long-term financing arrangements
into short-term operating leases and, in several instances, re-acquired
previously rejected aircraft as circumstances warranted.

Under Section 365 of the
Bankruptcy Code, we may assume, assume and assign, or reject certain executory
contracts and unexpired leases, including leases of real property, subject
to the approval of the Bankruptcy Court and certain other conditions. By
order of the Bankruptcy Court, our Section 365 rights to assume, assume
and assign, or reject unexpired leases of non-residential real estate expire
on the earlier of the date of termination of our exclusive period to file
a plan of reorganization (currently, April 30, 2005) or the date of the
conclusion of a disclosure statement hearing in connection with a proposed
plan of reorganization.

In general, if we reject
an executory contract or unexpired lease, it is treated as a pre-petition
breach of the lease or contract in question and, subject to certain exceptions,
relieves us of performing any future obligations. However, such a rejection
entitles the lessor or contract counterparty to a pre-petition general
unsecured claim for damages caused by such deemed breach and accordingly,
the counterparty may file a claim against us for such damages. As a result,
liabilities subject to compromise are likely to change in the future as
a result of damage claims created by our rejection of various aircraft,
executory contracts and unexpired leases. Generally, if we assume an aircraft
financing agreement, executory contract or unexpired lease we are required
to cure existing defaults under such contract or lease. We expect that
the future assumption of certain executory contracts and unexpired leases
may convert liabilities currently shown as subject to compromise to liabilities
not subject to compromise.

To successfully emerge from
Chapter 11, in addition to obtaining non-guaranteed exit financing, the
Bankruptcy Court must confirm a plan of reorganization, the filing of which
will depend on the timing and outcome of numerous ongoing matters in the
Chapter 11 process. We expect to file a plan of reorganization that provides
for UAL's emergence from bankruptcy later in 2005, but there can be no
assurance that the Bankruptcy Court will confirm a plan of reorganization
or that any such plan will be implemented successfully.

The reorganization plan will
determine the rights and claims of various creditors and security holders.
At this time, it is not possible to predict accurately the effect of the
Chapter 11 reorganization process on our business, nor can we make any
predictions concerning how each of these claims will be valued in the bankruptcy
proceedings. We believe that UAL's presently outstanding equity securities
will have no value and will be canceled under any plan of reorganization
that we propose. For this reason, we urge that caution be exercised with
respect to existing and future investments in any UAL security.

Financial Statement
Presentation

.

We have prepared the accompanying consolidated financial
statements in accordance with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants'
Statement of Position 90-7 ("SOP 90-7"), "

Financial Reporting by Entities
in Reorganization Under the Bankruptcy Code

," and on a going-concern
basis, which assumes continuity of operations, realization of assets and
satisfaction of liabilities in the ordinary course of business.

SOP 90-7 requires that the
financial statements for periods subsequent to a Chapter 11 filing separate
transactions and events that are directly associated with the reorganization
from the ongoing operations of the business. Accordingly, all transactions
(including, but not limited to all professional fees, realized gains and
losses and provisions for losses) directly associated with the reorganization
and restructuring of the business are reported separately in the financial
statements. As of December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, we had recognized the
following reorganization expenses in our financial statements:

Aircraft rejection charges
are non-cash costs that include our estimate of claims resulting from United's
rejection of certain aircraft leases and return of aircraft as part of
the bankruptcy process.

During 2003, we renegotiated
certain off-balance sheet leases subject to Section 1110 of the Bankruptcy
Code. Under the terms of the revised leases, we surrendered our investment
in the junior portion of the original lease debt to the original equity
participant. As a result, our investment in the corresponding lease certificates
was reduced to zero, resulting in a $223 million non-cash charge in reorganization
items.

As we restructure aircraft
financings as permitted by Section 1110 of the Bankruptcy Code, our policy
is to reflect the revised lease rates in aircraft rent once we have signed
definitive term sheets for the financing.

During 2004, we recognized
a pension curtailment charge of $152 million associated with a motion filed
by the PBGC to involuntarily terminate (on December 30, 2004) the Company's
defined benefit pension plan for covered members of ALPA. Based upon the
involuntary nature of the termination of the defined benefit pension plan
and its direct relationship to the Company's reorganization, the 2004 curtailment
charge is classified as a reorganization expense.

The

Statements of Consolidated
Financial Position

distinguish pre-petition liabilities subject to
compromise from both those pre-petition liabilities that are not subject
to compromise and from post-petition liabilities. Liabilities subject to
compromise are reported at the amounts expected to be allowed by the Bankruptcy
Court, even if they may be settled for lesser amounts. For further details,
see Note 8, "Liabilities Subject to Compromise".

In addition, as a result
of the Chapter 11 filing, the realization of assets and satisfaction of
liabilities, without substantial adjustments and/or changes in ownership,
are subject to uncertainty. While operating as debtors-in-possession under
the protection of Chapter 11 and subject to approval of the Bankruptcy
Court and the terms of the applicable DIP Financing covenants, or otherwise
as permitted in the ordinary course of business, we may sell or otherwise
dispose of assets (including aircraft) and liquidate or settle liabilities
for some amounts other than those reflected in the consolidated financial
statements. Further, the forthcoming plan of reorganization could materially
change the amounts and classifications in the historical consolidated financial
statements.

Pursuant to the Bankruptcy
Code, we have filed schedules with the Bankruptcy Court identifying our
assets and liabilities as of the Petition Date, while our creditors have
been able to file proofs of claim with the Bankruptcy Court and we expect
new claims to be filed in the future. Approximately 44,000 proofs of claim
(including late-filed claims) have been filed so far with the Bankruptcy
Court requesting payments from United. Through the claims resolution process
we have identified many claims which we believe should be disallowed by
the Bankruptcy Court, for a number of reasons such as our identification
of claims that are duplicative, have been amended or superseded by later
filed claims, are without merit, or are otherwise overstated. We have filed
omnibus objections to many of these claims and will continue to file additional
objections. As of December 31, 2004, approximately 31,000 of the total
claims have either been withdrawn by the claimants or disallowed by the
Bankruptcy Court.

As of December 31, 2004,
approximately 13,000 proofs of claim totaling $57 billion remain filed
with the Bankruptcy Court. The remaining amount of the proofs of claim
filed continues to far exceed our estimate of ultimate liability. Differences
in amount between claims filed by creditors and liabilities shown in our
records continue to be investigated and resolved in connection with our
claims resolution process. While we have made significant progress to date,
we expect this process to continue for some time and believe that further
resolution of claims will enable us to determine with more precision the
likely range of creditor distributions under a proposed plan of reorganization.
We have recorded liability amounts for the claims that can be reasonably
estimated and which we believe are probable of being allowed by the Bankruptcy
Court and we have classified these as liabilities subject to compromise
in the attached

Statements of Consolidated Financial Position

.

We will continue to evaluate
existing and new claims filed and will make adjustments, as appropriate.
To date, such adjustments have been material and we anticipate that future
adjustments will be material as well. At this time, the ultimate number
and allowed amount of such claims cannot be determined, due primarily to
the uncertainties of the Chapter 11 process, and the in-progress state
of our investigation and resolution of submitted claims.

DIP Financing.

In
connection with UAL's Chapter 11 case, the Company arranged DIP Financing.
The initial DIP Financing consisted of two facilities, a $300 million facility
provided by Bank One N.A., which was repaid in full as of December 31,
2004, and a $1.2 billion revolving credit and letter of credit facility.
Subsequently, we reached agreements to modify terms of the DIP Financing.
As of December 31, 2004, the DIP Financing consisted of a $1.0 billion
facility of which $900 million was available due to a $100 million holdback
for collateral maintenance and liquidation expenses. The facility included
a revolving credit and letter of credit facility of $200 million and a
term loan of $800 million, which was scheduled to mature on June 30, 2005.
We had the option of borrowing under the DIP Financing at an interest rate
of the prime rate plus 4% or LIBOR plus 5% (with a LIBOR floor of 3%) and
fees. As of December 31, 2004, we had outstanding borrowings of $863 million
at a rate of 8%. In addition, as of the end of 2004, letters of credit
were issued under the DIP Financing in the amount of $37 million. We were
required to maintain a minimum unrestricted cash balance of $750 million.

The terms of the DIP Financing
include covenants that require us to satisfy ongoing monthly financial
requirements, including minimum EBITDAR thresholds and limitations on capital
expenditures. Failure to comply with these covenants would constitute a
default of the DIP Financing, which would allow the lenders to accelerate
the loan. For the months of October, November and December of 2004, we
obtained a waiver from the providers of the DIP Financing for the default
provisions regarding our EBITDAR covenant.

The terms of the DIP Financing
also contain financial covenants that do not permit us to make payments
inconsistent with our business plan, unless the lenders otherwise consent
based on approval of a modified business plan. To preserve the Company's
liquidity, our business plan does not provide for contributions to our
defined benefit pension plans.

Effective February
22, 2005, we reached an agreement with the DIP Financing lenders to modify
certain terms of the DIP Financing. The modified DIP Financing extends
the maturity date to September 30, 2005, amends the interest rates to prime
rate plus 3.5% or LIBOR plus 4.5%, modifies and extends the minimum EBITDAR
covenants through August 31, 2005, allows for a future reduction in the
minimum unrestricted cash balance from $750 million to $600 million if
certain EBITDAR milestones are met and provides a waiver for the default
provisions regarding our EBITDAR covenant for the month of January 2005.

Borrowing availability is
determined by a formula based on a percentage of eligible assets. The eligible
assets consist of certain previously unencumbered aircraft, spare engines,
spare parts inventory, certain flight simulators and quick engine change
kits. The underlying value of such assets may fluctuate periodically due
to prevailing market conditions and fluctuations in value may have an impact
on the borrowing availability under the DIP Financing. Availability may
be further limited by additional reserves imposed by the lending banks
in their commercially reasonable discretion.

The DIP Financing is guaranteed
by UAL and United and all filing subsidiaries and is secured by first priority
liens on all unencumbered present and future assets and by junior liens
on all other assets, other than certain specified assets, including assets
which are subject to financing agreements that are entitled to the benefits
of Section 1110 and to the extent such financing agreements prohibit such
junior liens.

(2) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

(a) Basis of Presentation

-
UAL is a holding company whose principal subsidiary is United. The consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of UAL and all of our majority-owned
affiliates. We sometimes collectively refer to UAL Corporation, together
with our consolidated subsidiaries, as "we," "UAL" or the "Company." All
significant intercompany transactions are eliminated. Certain prior year
amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year's presentation.
See (i) "United Express" below for details.

(b) Use of Estimates

-

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying
notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

(c) Airline Revenues

-

We record passenger fares and cargo revenues as operating revenues when
the transportation is provided. The value of unused passenger tickets is
included in current liabilities as advance ticket sales. We periodically
evaluate the balance in advance ticket sales and record any adjustments,
which can be material, in the period the evaluation is completed. In addition,
we have code-sharing agreements with other airlines under which one carrier's
flights can be marketed under the two-letter airline designator code of
another carrier. Revenues earned under these arrangements are allocated
between the code share partners based on existing contractual agreements
and airline industry standard prorate formulas and are recognized as passenger
revenue when the transportation is provided.

(d) Cash and Cash Equivalents
and Short-Term Investments

-

Cash in excess of operating
requirements is invested in short-term, highly liquid, income-producing
investments. Investments with a maturity of three months or less on their
acquisition date are classified as cash and cash equivalents. Other investments
are classified as short-term investments.

At December 31, 2004 and
2003, we had $10 million and $140 million, respectively, of investments
in debt securities that were classified as available-for-sale, and $1.1
billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, that were classified as held-to-maturity.
Investments in debt securities classified as available-for-sale are stated
at fair value, based on the quoted market prices for the securities, which
does not differ significantly from their cost basis. Investments classified
as held-to-maturity are stated at cost, which approximates market due to
their short-term maturities. The gains or losses from sales of available-for-sale
securities are included in interest income for each respective year.

We had $877 million and $679
million classified as short-term restricted cash at December 31, 2004 and
2003, respectively, representing security for worker compensation obligations,
security deposits for airport leases and reserves with institutions that
process our credit card ticket sales.

(e) Aircraft Fuel,
Spare Parts and Supplies

-

Aircraft fuel and maintenance
and operating supplies are stated at average cost. Flight equipment spare
parts are stated at average cost less an obsolescence allowance.

(f) Operating Property
and Equipment

-

Owned operating property and equipment are
stated at cost. Property under capital leases, and the related obligation
for future lease payments, is recorded at an amount equal to the initial
present value of those lease payments.

Depreciation and amortization
of owned depreciable assets is based on the straight-line method over the
assets' estimated service lives. Leasehold improvements are amortized over
the remaining period of the lease or the estimated service life of the
related asset, whichever is less. Aircraft are depreciated to estimated
salvage values, generally over lives of 25 to 30 years; buildings are depreciated
over lives of 25 to 45 years; and other property and equipment are depreciated
over lives of 3 to 15 years.

Properties under capital
leases are amortized on the straight-line method over the life of the lease
or, in the case of certain aircraft, over their estimated service lives.
Lease terms are 10 to 22 years for aircraft and 29 years for buildings.
Amortization of capital leases is included in depreciation and amortization
expense.

Maintenance and repairs,
including the cost of minor replacements, are charged to maintenance expense
as incurred, except for our costs incurred under our power by the hour
engine maintenance agreement, which are accrued monthly based upon the
number of hours flown. Costs of additions to and renewals of units of property
are capitalized as property and equipment additions.

(g) Mileage Plus Awards

-

United's Mileage Plus frequent flyer program awards miles to passengers
who fly on United, Ted, United Express, the Star Alliance carriers and
certain other airlines that participate in the program. Additionally, United
sells mileage credits to participating airline partners in the Mileage
Plus program and ULS sells mileage credits to non-airline business partners.
In either case, the outstanding miles may be redeemed for travel on any
airline that participates in the program.

When a travel award level
is attained by a Mileage Plus member, we record a liability for the estimated
cost of such awards. Our cost includes an estimated incremental cost to
United for future travel redeemed on United, or the contractually determined
amount per award for travel redeemed on other participating airline partners.

Members may not reach the
threshold necessary for a free ticket award and outstanding miles may not
always be redeemed for free travel. Therefore, based on historical data
and other information, we estimate how many miles will never be used for
an award and exclude those miles from our estimate of the Company's liability.
We also estimate the number of miles that will be used per award which
can vary depending upon member choices from alternatives.

For miles earned by members
through non-airline business partners, a portion of revenue from the sale
of mileage is deferred and recognized when the transportation is provided.

(h) Deferred Gains

-

Gains on aircraft sale and leaseback transactions are deferred and amortized
over the terms of the related leases as a reduction of aircraft rent expense.

(i) United Express

-

United has marketing agreements under which independent regional carriers,
flying under the United Express ("UAX") name, connect passengers to other
United-branded flights, which we refer to as mainline operations.

Historically, we have paid
UAX regional carriers on a fee-per-departure basis and included the revenues
derived from them in passenger revenue, net of these expenses. Beginning
in the third quarter of 2004, our

Statements of Consolidated Operations

reflect reclassifications of regional carrier revenue and expenses in order
to provide better presentation of results of operations for our United
Airlines mainline and United Express (Regional affiliates). Revenues and
expenses for all of our UAX carriers are now presented gross on our financial
statements as "Regional affiliates". Prior periods have been reclassified
to conform to the current year's presentation. These reclassifications
did not impact our operating loss, net loss or related per share amounts
for any period presented.

The following table shows
the effect of these reclassifications on operating revenues and operating
expenses for amounts previously reported in prior years:

Additionally, contractual
payments made to UAX regional carriers include payments for aircraft operated
by them as United Express and as a result, we consider these aircraft to
be effectively leased by UAL. Accordingly, the minimum future lease payments
for these UAX-operated aircraft are included in our lease obligations as
described in Note 10, "Lease Obligations."

We also have call options
on 185 regional jets owned or leased by these carriers. The call option
is intended to allow United to secure control over regional jets used for
United Express flying in the event a United Express agreement is terminated
and are exercisable only if United maintains a specified credit rating
and the United Express carrier fails to meet required operating and/or
financial performance levels for a specified period of time. None of the
call options are exercisable at this time.

Generally, the marketing
agreements (or capacity purchase agreements) with our regional carriers
are not considered to be variable interest entities ("VIEs"), as all but
one regional carrier meets the definition of an independent business. In
the case of one agreement, substantially all of that regional carrier's
revenues are derived from United. The current capacity purchase agreement
with this entity is effective from October 1, 2003 through December 31,
2014. Qualitatively, we have determined that United is not the primary
beneficiary of this VIE. We believe our exposure to loss under this agreement
is not material.

(j) Advertising

-

Advertising costs, which are included in other operating expenses, are
expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $250 million, $190 million
and $169 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.

(k) Intangibles

-

Intangibles consist primarily of route acquisition costs and intangible
pension assets (see Note 15, "Retirement and Postretirement Plans").

SFAS No. 142, "

Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets

" requires companies to test intangibles
for impairment on an annual basis or on an interim basis when a triggering
event occurs. At December 31, 2004, we performed an evaluation of our intangibles
and determined that the fair value remained in excess of the book value.

The following information
relates to our intangibles at December 31, 2004 and 2003:

Gates are amortized on a
straight-line basis over the life of the related leases. Airport slots
and other intangibles are amortized over periods of 2 to 5 years. Total
amortization expense recognized was $5 million in 2004, $8 million in 2003
and $12 million in 2002. We expect to record amortization expense of $4
million in 2005, and $3 million in each of 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009, with
respect to amortized intangible assets recorded as of December 31, 2004.

During 2004, we removed the
book value on certain airport slots that were fully-amortized in accordance
with Company policy. This lowered our gross carrying amount and accumulated
amortization by approximately $145 million each.

Route authorities are rights
granted by governments to operate flights to and from a particular country.
These authorities are very specific and limited, fixed in nature and are
rarely available in the marketplace. Accordingly, route authorities are
highly valued and sought-after assets by all airlines. During 2004, we
obtained third-party appraisals of our route authorities that indicated
that the market value of these assets continues to be in excess of their
book value.

Slots and gates, like routes,
are highly valued assets that do not frequently come into the marketplace.
We believe that their market value continues to be in excess of recorded
book value.

(l) Measurement of
Impairments

-

We recognize an impairment charge when an asset's carrying value exceeds
its net undiscounted future cash flows and its fair market value. The amount
of the charge is the difference between the asset's carrying value and
fair market value.

(m) Stock Option Accounting

-

At December 31, 2004, we had certain stock-based employee compensation
plans, as described in Note 14, "Stock Options and Awards." We account
for these plans under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "

Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees

," ("APB 25") and related Interpretations.
No stock-based employee compensation cost for stock options is reflected
in our financial statements as provided under APB 25, as all options granted
under the plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the
underlying common stock on the date of grant.

If compensation cost for
stock-based employee compensation plans had been determined using the fair
value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, "

Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation

," we would have reported our net loss and loss per share
as the pro forma amounts indicated below:

(n) New Accounting
Pronouncements

-

In December 2004, the FASB issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004), "

Share-Based
Payment

" ("SFAS 123R") which establishes standards for accounting for
transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in exchange for
stock options or share-based payments. SFAS 123R requires that the compensation
cost (as measured by the fair value of the equity or liability instruments
issued) relating to share-based payment transactions be recognized in financial
statements. This statement replaces SFAS No. 123, "

Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation,

" and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, "

Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees.

" Currently we account for stock options
under APB Opinion No. 25 as permitted by SFAS No. 123. SFAS No. 123R is
effective for the first interim or annual reporting period that begins
after June 15, 2005. The Company will recognize compensation expense for
its participation in stock-based compensation plans for the portion of
outstanding awards for which the employee service has not yet been rendered,
based on the grant date fair value of those awards calculated under SFAS
123R. We anticipate the adoption of SFAS 123R will have no material impact
on our financial statements.

(o) Tax Contingencies

-

We have recorded reserves for taxes and associated interest in accordance
with SFAS No. 5, "

Accounting for Contingencies",

that may become
payable in future years as a result of audits by tax authorities. Although
we believe that the positions taken by the Company on previously filed
tax returns are reasonable, we nevertheless have established tax and interest
reserves in recognition that various taxing authorities may challenge the
positions taken by the Company resulting in additional liabilities for
taxes and interest. The tax reserves are reviewed as circumstances warrant
and adjusted as events occur that affect our potential liability for additional
taxes, such as lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations, conclusion
of tax audits, additional exposure based on current calculations, identification
of new issues, release of administrative guidance, or rendering a court
decision affecting a particular tax issue.

(3) Special Items


-

Air Canada.

During
the third quarter of 2004, Air Canada successfully emerged from bankruptcy
protection under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act ("CCAA") of the
Canada Business Corporation Act. We had filed a pre-petition claim against
Air Canada based on our equity interest in three Airbus A330 aircraft leased
to Air Canada. As part of its plan of reorganization, Air Canada offered
its unsecured creditors the opportunity to participate in their initial
public offering. We subscribed to 986,986 shares in the reorganized company
in August 2004 and sold them in October 2004 for a nominal gain. Separately,
we sold our interest in our pre-petition claim to a third party and recorded
a non-operating gain of $18 million during the third quarter of 2004.

Aircraft Write-down.

During
the first quarter of 2004, we incurred a $13 million charge in non-operating
expense for the write-down of certain non-operating B767 aircraft.


-

Aircraft Impairment.

As a result of our review of our operating fleet as part of our overall
restructuring, we decided to accelerate the retirement of our B767-200
aircraft from 2008 to 2005. Therefore, in accordance with SFAS No. 144,
we reviewed the B767-200 fleet for impairment and adjusted the carrying
value of these aircraft to their fair market values, as estimated using
third party appraisals. An impairment charge of $26 million was recorded
in the third quarter of 2003.

Aircraft Write-down.

During the third quarter of 2003, we also incurred a $25 million charge
in non-operating expense for the write-down of certain non-operating B767
aircraft.

Curtailment Charge.

Due to the ratification of new labor contracts for our major employee groups,
which resulted in lower wage and benefit levels and significant levels
of employee attrition (both voluntary and involuntary), we recorded a curtailment
charge of $152 million in the second quarter of 2003, which is included
in salaries and related costs.

Air Canada

.

On April 1, 2003, Air Canada filed for protection under the CCAA of the
Canada Business Corporation Act. During 2003, we recorded a non-operating
special charge of $226 million in connection with Air Canada's CCAA filing.
The charge included $46 million for the impairment of our investment in
Air Canada preferred stock, $91 million to record a liability resulting
from our guarantee of Air Canada debt, and $89 million for the write-off
of our equity interest in three Airbus A330 aircraft leased to Air Canada.
We consider the liability for the guarantee to be a pre-petition obligation
and accordingly, have classified it in liabilities subject to compromise.

Government Compensation.

On April 16, 2003, the Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act
("Wartime Act") was signed into law. The legislation included approximately
$3 billion of direct compensation for U.S. airlines. Of the total, $2.4
billion was intended to compensate air carriers for lost revenues and costs
related to aviation security (including $100 million for reinforcing cockpit
doors). In addition, collection of passenger security fees and payment
of air carrier security fees were suspended from June 1 through September
30, 2003.

In addition, the Wartime
Act required that the total compensation of the two most highly-compensated
executives of certain airlines (including United) be limited, during the
period between April 1, 2003 and April 1, 2004, to the salary they were
paid in 2002. We executed a contract with the government agreeing to comply
with these limits. Any violation of this provision would have required
us to repay the government the amount of compensation we received for airline
security fees described above. We believe that we complied with this provision
and that the likelihood of repaying the government is remote. In May 2003,
we received approximately $300 million in compensation under the Wartime
Act. In September 2003, we received an additional $14 million for cockpit
door reinforcement, which was accounted for as recovery of the capitalized
cost of door reinforcements previously completed.


-

Avolar.

On
March 22, 2002, we announced the orderly shutdown of our wholly owned subsidiary
Avolar, which was formed in early 2001 to operate and sell fractional ownership
interests in premium business aircraft. In connection with Avolar's closing,
we recorded a special charge of $82 million in the first quarter 2002 which
included aircraft deposits and termination fees ($55 million), operating-related
expenses ($18 million), severance-related costs ($7 million) and other
costs ($2 million). This charge was classified as other operating expense.

In accordance with EITF No.
94-3, "

Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits
and Other Costs to Exit an Activity

," we identified those charges that
should be recognized at the time management had committed to an exit plan.
The resulting special charge included current period and future estimated
liabilities incurred that would not produce any future economic benefits.

Specifically, the current
period expenses included in the charge were related to obligations incurred
prior to the commitment date, including costs for promotional flights,
consultant fees for the development of computer systems, advertising in
anticipation of operations and other miscellaneous expenses.

Government Compensation.

As part of the Act enacted in response to the events of September 11, 2001,
the federal government made $5.0 billion in federal grants available to
the airline industry. During 2002, we received our final allocation of
the grant money under the Act of $130 million.

Severance.

During the fourth quarter of 2002, we announced the closing of three reservation
centers, a maintenance line and four international stations and the conversion
of five stations to United Express service, which resulted in the furloughing
of a number of employees. Additionally, in connection with our plan to
decrease the airline's flying schedule, as well as overall cost-saving
measures, we announced a reduction in employment levels effective January
and February 2003. As a result of the announced furloughs, we recorded
a special charge of $67 million.

Reconciliation of Accruals

-

In the period following
September 11, 2001, we recorded an accrual of $162 million to reflect our
estimate of the early termination fees associated with certain contracts.
This obligation has yet to be resolved, and therefore continues to be included
in liabilities subject to compromise in its entirety.

Following is a reconciliation
of activity related to the accruals for the reduction in force:

(4) Per Share Amounts

Basic loss per share amounts
were computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of shares
of common stock outstanding during the year.

Stock options to purchase
approximately 10 million shares of common stock at December 31, 2004, 11
million shares of common stock at December 31, 2003 and 13 million shares
of common stock at December 31, 2002 were outstanding but were not included
in the computation of earnings per share because the exercise price of
the options in all periods was greater than the average market price of
the common shares. In addition, approximately 6 million and 34 million
shares of convertible ESOP preferred stock for years 2003 and 2002, respectively,
were not included in the computation as the result would have been antidilutive.

(5) Comprehensive Income (Loss)

Accumulated other comprehensive
income (loss) is made up of the following (net of taxes in 2001):

(6) Income Taxes

In 2004, UAL incurred both
a regular and an alternative minimum tax ("AMT") loss. The primary differences
between our regular tax loss and AMT loss are the depreciation adjustments
and preferences.

In assessing the realizability
of our deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely
than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will be realized.
During 2004, 2003 and 2002, we recorded a valuation allowance against our
deferred tax assets.

The 2002 provision (credit)
for income taxes is summarized as follows:

The significant components
of the deferred income tax provision (credit) are as follows:

The income tax provision
differed from amounts computed at the statutory federal income tax rate,
as follows:

Temporary differences and
carryforwards that give rise to a significant portion of deferred tax assets
and liabilities for 2004 and 2003 are as follows:

At December 31, 2004, UAL
and its subsidiaries had $294 million of federal AMT credits and $2.4 billion
of federal and state tax benefits resulting from $6.1 billion of net operating
losses which may be carried forward to reduce the tax liabilities of future
years. Federal tax benefits of $0.2 billion expire in 2022, $1.2 billion
expire in 2023, $0.3 billion expire in 2024 and $0.3 billion expire in
2025.

We have determined that it
is more likely than not that our net deferred tax asset at December 31,
2004, will be realized through the reversals of existing deferred tax credits.

(7) Investments

In January 2002, we sold
our remaining investment in Cendant for net proceeds of $137 million, resulting
in a gain of $46 million.

At December 31, 2002, we
owned approximately 14% of Hotwire, a leading discount travel website,
through a combination of stocks and warrants. On November 5, 2003, IAC/InterActive
Corp acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Hotwire for cash and
the assumption of outstanding options and warrants. As a result, we tendered
all of our shares, including options and warrants, in Hotwire for $85 million
in cash, resulting in a gain of $81 million.

In December 2003, Orbitz
completed an initial public offering of its stock, which resulted in a
reduction of our ownership percentage. As a result, we recognized a gain
of $23 million in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 51 "

Accounting
for Sales of Stock by a Subsidiary

". In addition, we sold a portion
of our investment in Orbitz for cash proceeds of $65 million and recognized
a gain of $54 million. On September 29, 2004, Cendant and Orbitz announced
their planned merger. Cendant offered to acquire all of the outstanding
common stock of Orbitz for cash. In addition, we entered into a Stockholder
Agreement to tender our shares. Subsequent to Bankruptcy Court approval,
we tendered all of our shares in Orbitz for $185 million in cash, resulting
in a gain of $158 million.

(8) Liabilities Subject to Compromise

Liabilities subject to compromise
refers to both secured and unsecured obligations which will be accounted
for under a plan of reorganization, including claims incurred prior to
the Petition Date. They represent the estimated amount expected to be allowed
on known or potential claims to be resolved through the Chapter 11 process,
and remain subject to future adjustments arising from negotiated settlements,
actions of the Bankruptcy Court, rejection of executory contracts and unexpired
leases, the determination as to the value of any collateral securing claims,
proofs of claim or other events. To date, such adjustments, as reflected
in reorganization expense, have been material and we anticipate that future
adjustments will be material as well.

Differences between liability
amounts we have estimated and claims filed by our creditors are being investigated
and the Bankruptcy Court will make a final determination of the allowable
claims. The determination of how these liabilities ultimately will be treated
cannot be made until the Bankruptcy Court approves a plan of reorganization.
We will continue to evaluate the amounts of these liabilities through the
remainder of the Chapter 11 process. To the extent that we identify additional
amounts subject to compromise, we recognize them accordingly. As a result,
the amounts of liabilities subject to compromise are subject to change.

At December 31, we
had liabilities subject to compromise consisting of the following:

(9) Long-Term Debt

As of December 31, 2004,
long-term debt consisted of the DIP Financing and debt associated with
certain aircraft operated by Air Canada ("Air Canada debt"). All of the
DIP Financing (which is described more fully in Note 1, "Voluntary Reorganization
Under Chapter 11 - DIP Financing") is classified as current. As of December
31, 2004, we had outstanding debt of $166 million associated with an operating
lease for aircraft operated by Air Canada. The debt has a fixed interest
rate of 7.15% and is scheduled to mature at various times through January
2016.

All of our pre-petition debt
is in default due to the Chapter 11 filing. In general, we are not permitted
to make payments on pre-petition debt while in Chapter 11; however, to
the extent we have reached agreements with certain financiers on specific
aircraft governed by Section 1110 of the Bankruptcy Code, we have continued
to make payments on the secured notes financing the aircraft with approval
of the Bankruptcy Court. In addition, we have rejected certain aircraft
that were originally financed under secured notes and have written off
$624 million in principal amount of these notes. Our pre-petition debt,
which is included in liabilities subject to compromise, consisted of the
following as of December 31:

At December 31, 2004, we
had recorded $493 million in special facilities revenue bonds to finance
the acquisition and construction of certain facilities at Los Angeles,
San Francisco, Miami and Chicago. We guarantee the payment of these bonds
under various payment and loan agreements. The bond proceeds are restricted
to expenditures on the facilities and unspent amounts are classified as
other assets in the

Statements of Consolidated Financial Position

.

As a result of reaching agreements
for specific aircraft under Section 1110, we currently anticipate making
the following principal payments under long-term debt agreements (including
the DIP Financing and Air Canada debt) in each of the next five years:
2005 - $985 million; 2006 - $140 million; 2007 - $144 million; 2008 - $186
million and 2009 - $132 million. However, because the agreements are subject
to change until such time as we emerge from bankruptcy, these expected
payment amounts are also subject to change.

Various assets, principally
aircraft, having an aggregate book value of $9.4 billion at December 31,
2004, were pledged as security under various loan agreements.

The carrying amount
of our borrowings under the DIP Financing approximates fair value. The
fair value of our debt included in liabilities subject to compromise cannot
be reasonably estimated at December 31, 2004.

We have a subsidiary trust
that has Trust Originated Preferred Securities ("TOPrS") outstanding with
a liquidation value of $97 million. These securities were issued in December
1996 and were previously reported on our

Statements of Consolidated
Financial Position

as Company-Obligated Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred
Securities of a Subsidiary Trust. The trust is considered a variable interest
entity under FASB Interpretation No. 46R, "

Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities - Revised

" ("FIN 46R") because we have a limited
ability to make decisions about its activities. However, we are not considered
the primary beneficiary of the trust. Therefore, the trust and the Mandatorily
Redeemable Preferred Securities issued by the trust are no longer reported
on our

Statements of Consolidated Financial Position

. Instead, we
report our Junior Subordinated Debentures held by the trust as long-term
debt included in liabilities subject to compromise.

(10) Lease Obligations

UAL leases aircraft, airport
passenger terminal space, aircraft hangars and related maintenance facilities,
cargo terminals, other airport facilities, real estate, office and computer
equipment and vehicles. As allowed under Section 365 of the Bankruptcy
Code, we may assume, assume and assign, or reject certain executory contracts
and unexpired leases, including leases of real property, aircraft and aircraft
engines, subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy Court and certain other
conditions. Consequently, we anticipate that our liabilities pertaining
to leases, and related amounts discussed below, will change significantly
in the future.

At December 31, 2004, scheduled
future minimum lease payments under capital leases (substantially all of
which are for aircraft) and operating leases having initial or remaining
noncancelable lease terms of more than one year were as follows:

As of December 31, 2004,
we leased 260 aircraft, 57 of which were under capital leases. These leases
have initial terms of 10 to 26 years, and expiration dates ranging from
2006 through 2024. Under the terms of all leases, we have the right to
purchase the aircraft at the end of the lease term, in some cases at fair
market value and in others at fair market value or a percentage of cost.
Additionally, the above amounts include lease payments related to our UAX
contracts for 46 aircraft under capital leases and 128 aircraft under operating
leases as described in Note 2(i), "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
- - United Express."

Certain of our aircraft lease
transactions contain provisions such as put options giving the lessor the
right to require us to purchase the aircraft at lease termination for a
certain amount resulting in residual value guarantees. Leases containing
this or similar provisions are recorded as capital leases on the balance
sheet and, accordingly, any and all residual value guarantee amounts contained
in an aircraft lease are fully reflected as capital lease obligations on
the

Statements of Consolidated Financial Position

.

In connection with the financing
of certain aircraft accounted for as capital leases, United had on deposit
at December 31, 2004 an aggregate 385 million euro ($525 million) and $15
million in certain banks and had pledged an irrevocable security interest
in such deposits to certain of the aircraft lessors. These deposits will
be used to pay off an equivalent amount of recorded capital lease obligations.

Amounts charged to rent expense,
net of minor amounts of sublease rentals, were $1.1 billion in 2004, $1.2
billion in 2003 and $1.5 billion in 2002.

In the first quarter of 2004,
we adopted FASB Interpretation No. 46, "

Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities

" ("FIN 46") and FIN 46R which requires disclosure of certain
information about VIEs that are consolidated and certain other information
about VIEs that are not consolidated.

We have various financing
arrangements for aircraft in which the lessors are trusts established specifically
to purchase, finance and lease aircraft to us. These leasing entities meet
the criteria for variable interest entities; however, we are not considered
the primary beneficiary of the leasing entities if the lease terms are
consistent with market terms at the inception of the lease and do not include
a residual value guarantee, fixed-price purchase option or similar feature
that obligates us to absorb decreases in value or entitles us to participate
in increases in the value of the aircraft. These financing arrangements
include 114 aircraft operating leases which contain a fair market value
purchase option. These leases are subject to, and will become effective
upon, the assumption of the leases by United and confirmation of the plan
of reorganization. In addition, the Company has


operating
leases that have either fixed price or fair market value purchase options,
the majority of which the Company expects to renegotiate as permitted under
Section 1110. United does not guarantee the residual value of these aircraft.

(11) Serial Preferred Stock

At December 31, 2004, we
had outstanding 3,203,177 depositary shares, each representing 1/1000 of
one share of Series B 12 Â¼% preferred stock, with a liquidation
preference of $25 per depositary share ($25,000 per Series B preferred
share) and a stated capital of $0.01 per Series B preferred share. We have
the option to redeem any portion of the Series B preferred stock or the
depositary shares for cash after July 11, 2004, at the equivalent of $25
per depositary share, plus accrued dividends. The Series B preferred stock
is not convertible into any other securities, has no stated maturity and
is not subject to mandatory redemption. As a result of our bankruptcy filing,
we do not intend to redeem any portion of the Series B preferred stock
or the depositary shares.

The Series B preferred stock
ranks senior to all other preferred and common stock outstanding, except
the TOPrS, as to receipt of dividends and amounts distributed upon liquidation.
The Series B preferred stock has voting rights only to the extent required
by law and with respect to charter amendments that adversely affect the
preferred stock or the creation or issuance of any security ranking senior
to the preferred stock. Additionally, if dividends are not paid for six
cumulative quarters, the Series B preferred stockholders are entitled to
elect two additional members to the UAL Board of Directors until all dividends
are paid in full. In accordance with our restated certificate of incorporation,
we are authorized to issue a total of 50,000 shares of Series B preferred
stock.

On September 30, 2002, we
announced the suspension of the payment of dividends on the Series B preferred
stock. As a result of our Chapter 11 filing, we are no longer accruing
for dividends on the Series B preferred stock. The amount of dividends
in arrears is approximately $22 million as of December 31, 2004.

UAL is authorized to issue
up to 15,986,584 additional shares of serial preferred stock.

(12) ESOP Preferred Stock

The following activity relates
to outstanding shares of ESOP preferred stocks:

On June 26, 2003, the ESOP
was terminated following the publication of a regulation by the Internal
Revenue Service that would permit the distribution of the remaining ESOP
shares to plan participants without jeopardizing our ability to utilize
our net operating losses. As a result of the termination of the ESOP, employees
were given until August 18, 2003 to make elections for distribution of
their stock in the plan. For participants who did not make an election
regarding their stock prior to the August 18 deadline, the stock remained
in the plan and distributions continued on a monthly basis until June of
2004, when we implemented a forced distribution of the remaining shares
in the plan. On June 28, 2004, all remaining ESOP shares were converted
to common and either distributed to participants at their request or transferred
to a broker account in their name.

Each share of Class 1 and
Class 2 ESOP Preferred Stock was convertible into four shares of UAL common
stock. Shares typically were converted to common as employees retired or
otherwise left the Company. The stock was nonvoting, with a par value of
$0.01 per share and a liquidation value of $126.96 per share. The Class
1 ESOP Preferred Stock provided a fixed annual dividend of $8.8872 per
share, which ceased on March 31, 2000; the Class 2 ESOP Preferred Stock
did not pay a fixed dividend.

The Voting ESOP Preferred
Stock had a par value and liquidation preference of $0.01 per share. The
stock was not entitled to receive any dividends and was convertible into
..0004 shares of UAL common stock.

(13) Common Stockholders' Equity

Changes in the number of
shares of UAL common stock outstanding during the years ended December
31 were as follows:

(14) Stock Options and Awards

The Company has granted options
to purchase common stock to various officers and employees. The option
price for all stock options is at least 100% of the fair market value of
UAL common stock at the date of grant. The options generally vest and become
exercisable in four equal, annual installments beginning one year after
the date of grant, and generally expire in ten years. We did not issue
any stock options during 2004 or 2003. We expect that our existing stock
options will become worthless upon emergence from bankruptcy.

We have also awarded shares
of restricted stock to certain officers and key employees. These shares
generally vest over a five-year period and are subject to certain transfer
restrictions and forfeiture under certain circumstances prior to vesting.
Unearned compensation, representing the fair market value of the stock
at the measurement date for the award, is amortized to salaries and related
costs over the vesting period. During 2002, 175,000 shares of restricted
stock were issued from treasury. No shares were issued in 2004 or 2003.
The amortization of restricted stock resulted in $1 million in compensation
expense being recorded in 2002. As of December 31, 2004, all restricted
shares were fully vested.

SFAS No. 123 establishes
a fair value based method of accounting for stock options. As discussed
in Note 2(m), "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Stock Option
Accounting," we have elected to continue using the intrinsic value method
of accounting prescribed in Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
"

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

," as permitted by SFAS
No. 123, and amended by SFAS No. 148, "

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation-Transition
and Disclosure

."

The fair value of each option
grant made in 2002 was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
option valuation model with the following assumptions:

Stock option activity for
the past three years was as follows:

The following information
relates to stock options outstanding as of December 31, 2004:

(15) Retirement and Postretirement Plans

We have various retirement
plans, both defined benefit (qualified and non-qualified) and defined contribution,
which cover substantially all employees. We also provide certain health
care benefits, primarily in the U.S., to retirees and eligible dependents,
as well as certain life insurance benefits to certain retirees. The Company
has reserved the right, subject to collective bargaining agreements, to
modify or terminate the health care and life insurance benefits for both
current and future retirees.

On December 30, 2004, the
PBGC filed a complaint against the Company in the District Court to seek
the involuntary termination of the defined benefit pension plan of United's
pilots. The PBGC is seeking to assume pension responsibility for the Company's
active and retired pilots, with benefit accruals terminated effective December
30, 2004. The Company's motion to refer the PBGC's involuntary termination
action to the Bankruptcy Court was granted by the District Court on January
27, 2005. The PBGC has indicated that it may appeal the District Court's
decision. The Company is evaluating its legal and other options. The Company
recorded a $152 million curtailment charge in the fourth quarter of 2004
relating to the PBGC's involuntary termination action and reclassified
the associated pension obligations of $2.5 billion to liabilities subject
to compromise.

On May 19, 2004, the FASB
issued FASB Staff Position No. 106-2 ("FSP 106-2") which superseded FASB
Staff Position No. 106-1 ("FSP 106-1") and provided specific guidance on
accounting for the federal subsidy provided to sponsors of certain retiree
health care benefit plans. The issuance of FSP 106-2 did not significantly
change our accounting for the federal subsidy, which reduced the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation by approximately $280 million when we
adopted FSP 106-1 in late 2003. The expected federal subsidy decreased
our postretirement cost in 2004 by approximately $37 million.

The following table sets
forth the reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the benefit
obligation and plan assets, the funded status and the amounts recognized
in the

Statements of Consolidated Financial Position

for the defined
benefit and other postretirement plans as of December 31 (utilizing a measurement
date of December 31):

The following information
relates to all pension plans with an accumulated benefit obligation in
excess of plan assets:

The net periodic benefit
cost included the following components:

Total pension expense for
all retirement plans (including defined contribution plans) recognized
in 2004, 2003 and 2002 respectively was $598 million, $804 million, and
$683 million.

The weighted-average assumptions
used for the U.S. plans were as follows:

The expected return on plan
assets is based on an evaluation of the historical behavior of the broad
financial markets and the Company's investment portfolio, taking into consideration
input from the plans' investment consultant and actuary regarding expected
long-term market conditions and investment management performance.

Assumed health care cost
trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health
care plan. A one-percentage-point change in the assumed health care trend
rate would have the following effects:

(In millions)

1% Increase

1% Decrease

Effect on total service and interest
cost

$ 21

$ 17

Effect on postretirement benefit
obligation



The weighted-average asset
allocations for our qualified U.S. pension plans at December 31, 2004 and
2003, by asset category are as follows:

Our targeted allocation of
assets is to the following fund types: 60% equities, 35% fixed income and
5% other, with approximate expected long-term rates of return of 10%, 7.5%
and 15%, respectively.

We believe that the long-term
asset allocation on average will approximate the targeted allocation and
regularly review the actual asset allocation to periodically rebalance
the investments to the targeted allocation when appropriate. Pension expense
is reduced by the expected return on plan assets, which is measured by
assuming the market-related value of plan assets increases at the expected
rate of return. The market-related value is a calculated value that phases
in differences between the expected rate of return and the actual return
over a period of five years.

The weighted-average asset
allocation for our other benefit plans at December 31, 2004 and 2003, by
asset category are as follows:

We do not expect to make
any further cash contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension
plan trusts in 2005. However, we do plan to contribute approximately $176
million to our other benefit plans in 2005. In addition, the following
benefit payments, which include expected future service, as appropriate,
are expected to be paid from the trusts:

(16) Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Uncertainties

General Guarantees
and Indemnifications.

In the normal course of business, we enter
into numerous real estate leasing and aircraft financing arrangements that
have various guarantees included in the contracts. These guarantees are
primarily in the form of indemnities. In both leasing and financing transactions,
we typically indemnify the lessors, and any tax/financing parties against
tort liabilities that arise out of the use, occupancy, operation or maintenance
of the leased premises or financed aircraft. Currently, we believe that
any future payments required under these guarantees or indemnities would
be immaterial, as most tort liabilities and related indemnities are covered
by insurance (subject to deductibles). Additionally, certain leased premises
such as fueling stations or storage facilities include indemnities of such
parties for any environmental liability that may arise out of or relate
to the use of the leased premises.

Financings and Guarantees.

In
addition to common commercial lease transactions, we have entered into
numerous long-term agreements to lease certain airport and maintenance
facilities that are financed through tax-exempt special facilities revenue
bonds and issued by various local municipalities to build or improve airport
and maintenance facilities. Under these lease agreements, we are required
to make rental payments in amounts sufficient to pay the maturing principal
and interest payments on the bonds. However, as a result of our bankruptcy
filing, we are not permitted to make payments on unsecured pre-petition
debt. We have been advised that our municipal bonds may be unsecured (or
in certain instances, partially secured) pre-petition debt. At December
31, 2004, $1.2 billion in principal of such bonds was outstanding but not
recorded in the

Statements of Consolidated Financial Position

in
accordance with GAAP. As of December 31, 2004, UAL and United had jointly
guaranteed $60 million of such bonds and United had guaranteed $1.2 billion
of such bonds, including accrued interest.

During 2003, we filed four
complaints for declaratory judgment and corresponding motions for temporary
restraining orders concerning United's municipal bond obligations for facilities
at DEN, JFK, SFO, and LAX. In each case, we sought clarification of our
obligations to pay principal and interest under the applicable municipal
bonds, and the protection of our rights concerning related airport lease
agreements at the applicable airports.

On March 30, 2004, the Bankruptcy
Court granted our motions for summary judgment with respect to the JFK,
SFO and LAX municipal bonds, holding that our payment obligations related
to municipal bonds financing airport improvements at these sites are not
obligations arising under "leases" pursuant to Section 365 of the Bankruptcy
Code. Based on this ruling, the outstanding $248 million in principal in
connection with these municipal bonds is considered pre-petition debt and
the applicable accrued rent has been classified as liabilities subject
to compromise.

In our adversary proceeding
involving DEN, however, the Bankruptcy Court did not grant our motion for
summary judgment. Rather, the Bankruptcy Court found that our payment obligations
for the municipal bonds financing airport improvements at DEN (which represents
approximately $261 million in principal) are obligations arising under
a true lease. We have appealed the adverse ruling of the DEN proceeding,
but in accordance with the Bankruptcy Court's order, we paid $36 million
into escrow for the April 2003, October 2003, April 2004 and October 2004
interest payments due for the DEN municipal bonds.

The defendants in the JFK,
SFO and LAX adversary proceedings also appealed the Bankruptcy Court's
ruling in the District Court. In November 2004, the District Court reversed
the Bankruptcy Court's ruling and held in favor of the defendants in the
SFO adversary proceeding. In January 2005, the District Court affirmed
the Bankruptcy Court's ruling with respect to the DEN adversary proceeding
and reversed the Bankruptcy Court's ruling with respect to the LAX adversary
proceeding. On February 18, 2005, the District Court affirmed the Bankruptcy
Court's ruling in the Company's favor in the JFK adversary proceeding.

The Company has appealed
the District Court's ruling with respect to the SFO, LAX and DEN adversary
proceedings to the United States Court of Appeals, Seventh Circuit. We
expect that the defendants will appeal the ruling in the Company's favor
in the JFK matter. The outcome of these matters is uncertain and, therefore,
the ultimate treatment of these municipal bond obligations in reorganization
is uncertain.

Similarly, in September 2003,
we filed a complaint for declaratory judgment for all seven municipal bond
issues (which represents approximately $601 million in principal) relating
to our facilities at Chicago O'Hare International Airport ("O'Hare"), seeking,
among other things, a declaration that a certain cross-default provision
in the O'Hare airport lease is unenforceable. On February 15, 2005, the
Bankruptcy Court approved an agreement resolving the disputes between the
parties to this proceeding that in effect reduces the Company's indebtedness
related to these bond issues from approximately $601 million to $150 million.
The City of Chicago, a party to these adversary proceedings, is not a party
to the O'Hare Settlement Agreement.

The O'Hare Settlement Agreement
requires the indenture trustees and certain designated bondholders to waive
any existing defaults with respect to the bonds, and not to seek any further
payment on account of the bonds beyond the consideration set forth in the
O'Hare Settlement Agreement. It requires the Company, in connection with
the confirmation of its plan of reorganization, to relinquish any claims
to certain unused construction fund monies (which currently total approximately
$65 million) and to issue convertible debt to the counterparties in the
O'Hare Settlement Agreement, upon emergence from bankruptcy of the reorganized
UAL Corporation, having a par value of $150 million.

As of December 31, 2004,
we have paid into escrow cash payments totaling $22 million related to
interest due on the O'Hare municipal bonds for March, April, May, September,
October and November of 2003 and for March, April and May of 2004. As part
of the O'Hare Settlement Agreement, these escrow funds, less legal fees,
will be remitted to the Company.

Fuel Consortia.

We
also participate in numerous fuel consortia with other carriers at major
airports to reduce the costs of fuel distribution and storage. Interline
agreements govern the rights and responsibilities of the consortia members
and provide for the allocation of the overall costs to operate the consortia
based on usage. The consortias (and in limited cases, the participating
carriers) have entered into long-term agreements to lease certain airport
fuel storage and distribution facilities that are typically financed through
tax-exempt bonds (either special facilities lease revenue bonds or general
airport revenue bonds), issued by various local municipalities. In general,
the consortium lease agreement requires the consortium to make lease payments
in amounts sufficient to pay the maturing principal and interest payments
on the bonds. As of December 31, 2004, approximately $488 million principal
amount of such bonds were secured by fuel facility leases at major hubs
in which we participate. United's maximum exposure is approximately $166
million principal amount of such bonds based on our past consortia participation
and will only trigger if the other participating carriers or consortia
members default on their lease payments. The guarantees are set to expire
when the tax-exempt bonds are paid in full, which ranges from 2010 to 2028.
We did not record a liability at the time the indirect guarantees were
made.

EETC Debt.

In 1997 and 2000, we issued Enhanced Equipment Trust Certificates ("EETCs")
to refinance certain owned aircraft and aircraft under operating leases.
A portion of these proceeds are direct obligations of United and were recognized
in the

Statements of Consolidated Financial Position

while certain
proceeds were placed in trusts not owned or affiliated with United. The
proceeds placed in off-balance sheet trusts were used to refinance the
remaining bank debt of the lessors in existing leveraged leases with United.
As of December 31, 2004, approximately $300 million of these proceeds were
placed in off-balance sheet trusts. For one of the trusts, United is the
swap provider and pays fixed interest and receives variable interest that
converts the trust's variable rate assets to fixed rate assets and converts
United's variable rate lease payments to fixed rate lease payments.

Legal and Environmental
Contingencies.

UAL has certain contingencies resulting from litigation
and claims (including environmental issues) incident to the ordinary course
of business. Management believes, after considering a number of factors,
including (but not limited to) the views of legal counsel, the nature of
contingencies to which we are subject and prior experience, that the ultimate
disposition of these contingencies will not materially affect the Company's
consolidated financial position or results of operations.

We record liabilities for
legal and environmental claims against us in accordance with GAAP. These
amounts are recorded based on our assessments of the likelihood of their
eventual settlements. The amounts of these liabilities could increase or
decrease in the near term, based on revisions to estimates relating to
the various claims. In addition, as a result of the bankruptcy filing,
as of the Petition Date, virtually all pending litigation is stayed, and
absent further order of the Bankruptcy Court, no party, subject to certain
exceptions, may take any action, again subject to certain exceptions, to
recover on pre-petition claims against us. Accordingly, we have classified
certain of these liabilities as liabilities subject to compromise.

The Company anticipates that
its liability from claims arising from the events of September 11, 2001
will be significant; however, we believe that, under the Act, our liability
will be limited to our insurance coverage.

We have not incurred any
material environmental obligations relating to the events of September
11, 2001.

Commitments.

At
December 31, 2004, commitments for the purchase of property and equipment,
principally aircraft, approximated $1.8 billion, after deducting advance
payments. Since September 11, 2001, we have reached agreements with the
aircraft manufacturers enabling us to delay delivery of future orders.
Since resetting our fleet plan is critical to our overall restructuring,
we continue to hold discussions regarding these deliveries. Our current
commitments would require the payment of an estimated $0.1 billion in 2005,
$0.6 billion in 2006 and 2007, $0.5 billion in 2008 and $0.6 billion in
2009 and thereafter primarily for the purchase of A319, A320 and B777 aircraft.
It is likely that the amount and timing of these obligations will change,
and could potentially be eliminated in their entirety. Additionally, the
disposition of advance payments to the manufacturers of $161 million is
subject to the ultimate outcome of these discussions. In March 2005, United
reached an agreement with respect to the undelivered B777 aircraft, eliminating
this obligation and allowing United to use a significant portion of the
approximately $45 million in associated advance payments for other purposes.
However, since that agreement remains subject to Bankruptcy Court approval,
we have not excluded those commitments from the obligations above.

Approximately 80% of United's
employees are represented by various U.S. labor organizations. In April
2003, we reached agreements with all of our labor unions for new collective
bargaining agreements. These agreements became effective on May 1, 2003
and were to become amendable in six years. Subsequently, in January 2005,
we reached new agreements with four of our six labor unions for new collective
bargaining agreements. These agreements became effective January, 2005.

(17) Financial Instruments and Risk Management

Aircraft Fuel

- Aircraft
fuel represented 17%, 13% and 10% of our total operating expenses for 2004,
2003 and 2002, respectively.

During the second quarter
of 2004, we began to implement a strategy to hedge a portion of our price
risk related to projected jet fuel requirements primarily through collar
options. The collars (designated as cash flow hedges) involve the purchase
of fuel call options with the simultaneous sale of fuel put options with
identical expiration dates. These contracts are recorded at fair value
with the changes in fair value, to the extent they are effective, recorded
in other comprehensive income until the underlying hedged fuel is consumed.
See Note 5 "Comprehensive Income (Loss)" for details. The fair value is
determined by the use of standard option value models using commodity-related
assumptions derived from prices observed in underlying markets. The impact
of these hedge transactions was immaterial to our results of operations
in 2004.

We have hedged approximately
11% of our 2005 projected fuel requirements at an average price of $1.27
per gallon, excluding taxes. The fair value of these contracts was approximately
$3 million as of December 31, 2004 that was included in other comprehensive
loss. We expect that the entire amount of $3 million will be recognized
as adjustments to fuel expense within the next 12 months. We plan to continue
to hedge future fuel purchases for 2005 and beyond as circumstances and
market conditions allow.

The following is a reconciliation
of current period changes of the portion of stockholders' equity relating
to derivatives that qualify as cash flow hedges:

Interest Rate -

United
is a party to a series of interest rate swaps that convert floating-rate
operating leases to fixed-rate leases. We have designated these swaps as
cash flow hedges of the floating-rate leases and recorded these contracts
at fair value with the effective portion recorded as a component of other
comprehensive loss. As of December 31, 2004, we had $130 million notional
amount of interest rate swaps outstanding with a fair value to United of
$(29) million. The ineffectiveness resulting from the change in fair value
of our interest rate hedge position was immaterial.

As the majority of this balance
is associated with aircraft financings for which we have yet to reach agreements
with the financiers, we are unable to determine what amount, if any, will
be recorded in earnings in the next twelve months.

(18) Segment Information

As is more fully discussed
in Note 2(i) "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

-

United
Express", the Company has reclassified UAX revenues and expenses in its

Consolidated
Statement of Operations

to reflect both gross revenue and gross expenses
as opposed to prior practice in which these amounts were reported as net
revenue. Segment disclosures have been restated for all periods presented
to conform to these changes.

In accordance with DOT guidelines,
we allocate mainline and regional affiliate passenger and cargo revenues
to the North America segment based on the actual flown revenue for flights
with an origin and destination wholly within the U.S. Passenger and cargo
revenue is allocated to international segments based on the actual flown
revenue for flights with an international origin or destination in that
segment. Other revenues that are not directly associated with a specific
flight (such as Red Carpet Club membership fees) are allocated based on
the pro rata share of available seat miles flown in each segment.

The accounting policies for
each of these segments are the same as those described in Note 2, "Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies," except that segment financial information
has been prepared using a management approach which is consistent with
how we internally disperse financial information for the purpose of making
internal operating decisions. We evaluate segment financial performance
based on earnings before income taxes, special items, reorganization items,
government compensation and gain on sale of investments.

A reconciliation of the total
amounts reported by reportable segments to the applicable amounts in the
consolidated financial statements follows:

UAL's operations involve
an insignificant level of dedicated revenue producing assets by reportable
segment. ULS has $991 million in total assets as of December 31, 2004.
The overwhelming majority of United's revenue producing assets (which are
primarily U.S. registered aircraft) can be deployed in any of United's
four remaining reportable segments, as any given aircraft may be used in
multiple segments on any given day. Therefore, we allocate depreciation
and amortization expense associated with those assets on the basis of available
seat miles flown in each segment. In addition, we have significant intangible
assets related to the acquisition of our Atlantic and Latin America route
authorities.

We did not have any significant
customers requiring disclosure in any period presented.

(19) Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows - Supplemental Disclosures

Supplemental disclosures
of cash flow information and non-cash investing and financing activities
were as follows:

(20) Subsequent Events

As of December 31, 2004,
the Company had recorded a receivable of approximately $77 million for
certain air and ground handling services. Based upon events subsequent
to the date of the financial statements, the Company has determined that
it is probable that this receivable has been impaired. Therefore, the Company
has adjusted its financial statements by reducing the receivable and recording
additional cost of sales.

The following table shows
the effect of the impairment of this receivable on amounts previously reported
on our Form 8-K:

(21) Selected Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited)

The sum of quarterly loss
per share amounts is not the same as annual loss per share amounts because
of changing numbers of shares outstanding.

As discussed in Note 2(i)
"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - United Express", revenues
and expenses for all of our UAX regional carriers are now presented gross
on our financial statements as "Regional Affiliates". Prior periods have
been reclassified to conform to the current year's presentation. These
reclassifications did not impact our earnings (loss) from operations, net
loss or related per share amounts for any period presented.

The following table shows
the effect of these reclassifications on operating revenues for amounts
previously reported on our Form 10-Q and 2003 Form 10-K:

The quarterly results are
impacted by the following significant items:

During the first quarter
of 2004, we adjusted our mainline passenger revenue and recognized an additional
$60 million in passenger revenue. In addition, we incurred a $13 million
charge in non-operating expense for the write-down of certain non-operating
B767 aircraft and recorded $130 million in reorganization items.

During the second quarter
of 2004, we recorded $144 million in reorganization items.

During the third quarter
of 2004, Air Canada successfully emerged from protection under the CCAA.
We had filed a pre-petition claim against Air Canada based on our equity
interest in three Airbus A330 aircraft leased to Air Canada. As part of
its plan of reorganization, Air Canada offered its unsecured creditors
the opportunity to participate in their initial public offering. We subscribed
to 986,986 shares in the reorganized company in August 2004 and sold them
in October 2004 for a nominal gain. Separately, we sold our pre-petition
claim and recorded a non-operating gain of $18 million during the third
quarter of 2004. Additionally, we recorded $115 million in reorganization
items.

During the fourth quarter
of 2004, we adjusted our Mileage Plus liability and recognized a charge
of $47 million. Additionally, we sold our investment in Orbitz and recognized
a gain of $158 million in non-operating expense and recorded $222 million
in reorganization items.

During the first quarter
of 2003, we recorded a non-operating special charge of $137 million in
connection with Air Canada's CCAA filing. We also recorded $248 million
for reorganization items in connection with our bankruptcy filing in non-operating
expense.

During the second quarter
of 2003, we recorded $152 million in curtailment charges as a result of
the revaluation of certain pension and postretirement plans. Additionally,
we recognized $300 million in compensation under the Wartime Act in non-operating
income and recorded an additional $397 million in reorganization items.

During the third quarter
of 2003, we recorded an impairment charge of $26 million in operating expense
for the impairment of the B767-200 fleet and incurred a $25 million charge
in non-operating expense for the write-down of certain non-operating B767
aircraft. We also recorded an additional $234 million in reorganization
items in the third quarter.

During the fourth quarter
of 2003, we recognized gains of $158 million on the sale of investments
in Hotwire and Orbitz. Additionally, we recorded a special charge of $89
million for the write-off of certain non-operating aircraft leased to Air
Canada and recorded an additional $294 million in reorganization items.

Certain items are described
more fully in Note 3, "Special Items" and Note 7, "Investments."

ITEM 9.  CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING
AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE.

None.

ITEM 9A.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

An evaluation was carried
out under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's management,
including the Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and Chief Financial Officer
("CFO"), of the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and
procedures as of December 31, 2004.  Based on that evaluation, the
Company's management, including the CEO and CFO, has concluded that the
Company's disclosure controls and procedures are effective. During the
period covered by this report, there was no change in the Company's internal
control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably
likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial
reporting.

Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

March 15, 2005

To the Stockholders of

UAL Corporation

Elk Grove Village, Illinois

The management of UAL Corporation and subsidiaries (the "Company") is
responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control
over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is
defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by, or under the supervision
of, the Company's principal executive and principal financial officers
and effected by the Company's board of directors, management and other
personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and
includes those policies and procedures that:

Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions of the Company;

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary
to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
and directors of the Company; and

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that
could have a material effect on the financial statements.

All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent
limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can
provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation
and presentation. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control
over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the
risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The Company's management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004. In making
this assessment, the Company's management used the criteria as set forth
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework.

Based on their assessment, management has concluded that, as of December
31, 2004, the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective
based on those criteria.

The Company's independent auditors have issued an audit report on management's
assessment of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
This report appears in this Item 9A.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

UAL Corporation

Chicago, Illinois

We have audited management's assessment, included in the accompanying
Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that UAL
Corporation (Debtor-in-Possession) and subsidiaries maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based
on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on management's assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness
of the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our
audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained
in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding
of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management's assessment,
testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary
in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinions.

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed
by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and
principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions,
and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other
personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies
and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts
and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have
a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial
reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management
override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may
not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any
evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial
reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management's assessment that the Company maintained
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2004, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the criteria
established in Internal Control

-

Integrated Framework issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Also
in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based
on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated statements
of financial position, the related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders' deficit, and cash flows, and the financial statement schedules
included in Item 15 as of and for the year ended December 31, 2004 of the
Company and our report dated March 15, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion
on those financial statements and financial statement schedules and included
explanatory paragraphs related to (i) the Company's reorganization under
Chapter 11 and (ii) the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.

Glenn F. Tilton.

See
information regarding Mr. Tilton above under Directors.

There are no family relationships
among the executive officers or the directors of the Company.  Our
executive officers serve at the discretion of the Board of Directors.

Board Independence

The Board of Directors
made a determination that all of the members of the Board are "independent"
other than Messrs. Bathurst, Canale and Tilton, based on the categorical
standards adopted by the Board in the UAL Corporation Corporate Governance
Guidelines (see below). Messrs. Bathurst, Canale and Tilton are not independent
because each is an employee of United Air Lines, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary
of UAL Corporation.

Categorical Standards

The Board has established
these categorical standards to assist it in determining whether a director
has any direct or indirect material relationship with the Company. 
A director is independent if, within the three years preceding the determination:

the director was not an employee of the Company and none of the director's
immediate family members was an executive officer of the Company;

the director, and each immediate family member of the director, did not
receive any compensation from the Company, other than director and committee
fees and pension or other forms of deferred compensation for prior service
(provided such compensation is not contingent in any way on continued service);

the director, and each immediate family member of the director, was not
affiliated with or employed by a current internal or external auditor of
the Company or a former internal or external auditor of the Company that
ceased providing services to the Company less than three years preceding
the determination;

the director, and each immediate family member of the director, was not
employed as an executive officer of another company where any of the Company's

ITEM 11.  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION.

Executive Compensation

Summary Compensation Table

(1) Amounts for Messrs. Tilton, Hacker, Brace and McDonald
in 2004 were paid under the UAL Success Sharing Program - Performance Incentive
Plan (referred to as the Success Sharing Plan). Amounts in 2004 for Mr.
Tague were paid under the Success Sharing Plan and the Corporation Retention
and Recognition Bonus Plan. Amounts for Messrs. Brace and McDonald in 2003
were paid under the UAL Corporation Retention and Recognition Bonus Plan.
Any bonus for 2003 under the UAL Corporation Performance Incentive Plan
for the named executive officers is not calculable at the time of filing
this report as the Human Resources Subcommittee has not determined the
amounts to pay the officers at this time.

(2) Amounts under "Other Annual Compensation" in 2004
are payments to the named executive officers to cover their tax liabilities
incurred in connection with the free transportation and cargo shipment
on United that it provides to the officers, except for Mr. Tague, who also
received $4,793 in 2004 to cover tax liabilities associated with relocation
and temporary living expenses.

(3) As of December 31, 2004 there was no outstanding restricted
stock. On May 12, 2004 the Human Resources Subcommittee approved the release
of restrictions on the remaining restricted shares held by the Messrs,
Tilton, Hacker and Brace for purposes of the officer donating the stock
or proceeds of the sale of stock to a charitable organization.

(4) Amounts represent awards under the UAL Loyalty Services
("ULS") long-term incentive plan ("LTIP") which was adopted in 2000. For
2003, amount represents award accrued for the net value created of ULS
asset portfolio during the performance period under the LTIP. This award
was reduced significantly from its stated dollar amount and the unvested
portion was forfeited when the LTIP was amended in June 2003. This amount
is subject to reduction based on the proportionate amount paid to all eligible
participants if the total payments for all LTIP awards exceed the maximum
amount specified in the LTIP. In addition, this amount is expected to be
paid only upon the Company's emergence from bankruptcy and is contingent
upon Mr. Hacker's continued employment at that time. For 2002, amount represents
a payment under the LTIP equal to Mr. Hacker's vested interest in net value
created of ULS' asset portfolio upon a liquidating event involving a sale
of a portfolio asset.

(5)  Amounts in 2004 represent premiums paid by the
Company for group variable life insurance. Amount in 2003 includes split
dollar life insurance compensation for Messrs. Brace, Hacker and McDonald.
For Mr. Tilton, amount in 2002 represents $4.5 million paid by the Company
into three secular trusts on Mr. Tilton's behalf. The secular trusts are
described in more detail under "Employment Contracts and Arrangements -
Mr. Tilton's Employment Agreement."

Aggregated 2004 FY-End Option Values

The table below provides information
about stock options held at the end of 2004 by the officers named in the
Summary Compensation Table.  No options were exercised by these officers
in 2004. The option exercise price was higher than the fair market value
of the underlying stock at year-end.

Pension Plan Table

Years of Participation

This table is based
on retirement at age 65 and selection of a straight life annuity (other
annuity options are available, which would reduce the amounts shown). 
The amount of the normal retirement benefit under the plan is the product
of 1.63% times years of credited participation in the plan times final
average pay (highest five of last ten years of covered compensation). 
The retirement benefit amount is not offset by the participant's social
security benefit.   The compensation used in calculating benefits
under the plan is base salary and performance incentive pay. Under the
qualified plan, years of participation for persons named in the compensation
table are as follows: Mr. Hacker - 11 years; Mr. Brace - 16 years; Mr.
McDonald - 33 years, Mr. Tilton - 1 year and Mr. Tague - 7 months. Mr.
Tilton began participation in the Company's qualified plan on October 1,
2003. The amounts shown do not reflect limitations imposed by the Internal
Revenue Code on retirement benefits that may be paid under plans qualified
under the code.  United has historically provided under non-qualified
plans the portion of the retirement benefits earned under the pension plan
that would otherwise be subject to code limitations; however, in February
2005, the Company terminated the non-qualified pension plans for its salaried
and management employees. Similarly, the Company believes that in order
to obtain exit financing, and successfully reorganize and emerge from Chapter
11 bankruptcy proceedings, it will also be necessary to terminate and replace
its defined benefit pension plans.

If Mr. Hacker is employed
until age 50, he will be credited with additional years of participation
so that his total years of participation will equal 25.4 years.  In
addition, if he is employed during the period between the date he attains
age 50 and the date he attains age 55, he will be credited with an additional
month of participation for each month of participation credited to him
during that period.  If he remains employed past age 55, he will be
credited an additional 1/2 month of participation for each month of participation
credited to him after age 55.

Employment Contracts and Arrangements

Mr. Tilton's Employment Agreement

Mr. Tilton was elected
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company on September
2, 2002. The Company entered into a five-year employment agreement with
Mr. Tilton in 2002, which provided a base salary of $950,000 and a $3 million
signing bonus. This agreement was amended on December 8, 2002 and again
on February 17, 2003 in connection with the Company's bankruptcy filing.
The amended agreement provided for an annual base salary of $845,500 (which
reflected an 11% reduction from the original amount of $950,000), and provided
for salary increases as part of the normal salary program for the Company's
senior executives. On April 4, 2003, Mr. Tilton agreed to an additional
14% reduction in his original base salary of $950,000, thereby reducing
his salary from $845,500 to $712,500 effective April 1, 2003. In April
2004, the Human Resources Subcommittee of the Company's Board of Directors
approved the restoration of Mr. Tilton's salary to $845,500. However, in
the wake of the ATSB's rejection of our application for a federal loan
guarantee, Mr. Tilton made the personal decision to reduce his salary and
have it revert by $133,000 annually to its previous level of $712,500 effective
August 1, 2004. Effective January 1, 2005, Mr. Tilton's base salary was
further reduced by 11% plus an additional temporary 4% reduction from $712,500
to $605,625. The temporary 4% reduction which Mr. Tilton has elected to
remain effective for himself was recently restored for salaried and management
employees. The overall reduction in Mr. Tilton's salary between September
2, 2002 and January 1, 2005 was $344,375, or approximately 36% of his original
salary of $950,000.

Under the terms of the agreement,
Mr. Tilton also received options to purchase 1,150,000 shares of UAL common
stock.  The exercise price for the options is $3.03, which was the
average of the high and low sales price of the common stock on the New
York Stock Exchange on August 30 and September 3, 2002.  The options
expire on September 1, 2012.  The Company also agreed to reimburse
Mr. Tilton for his and his family's relocation expenses, including a cash
payment to cover his income tax liability for the relocation reimbursement. 
Under his employment agreement, Mr. Tilton is eligible to receive an annual
incentive bonus with a target percentage equal to 100% of his base salary. 
He is entitled to an additional 100% over this target bonus amount for
superior performance.

If Mr. Tilton's employment
is terminated by UAL without "cause," or by him for "good reason," or if
there is a "change in control," UAL will pay him his base salary as reduced
by the December 8

th

amendment, any annual bonus and any earned
and vested benefits he may be entitled to through the termination date. 
UAL will also pay Mr. Tilton a lump sum payment equal to his base salary
reduced by the December 8

th

amendment and target bonus multiplied
by the greater of (1) the remaining term of his agreement or (2) three
years.  Mr. Tilton's other benefits will be continued for this period. 
All long-term incentive awards will immediately vest on the termination
date, including any unvested stock options or restricted stock awards. 
Under Mr. Tilton's agreement, a "change of control" is defined as: (1)
a merger, consolidation or sale of substantially all the Company's assets
in which the voting securities of the Company immediately before the merger,
consolidation or sale represent less than 80% of the voting power after
the merger, consolidation or sale; (2) the acquisition by a person or group
of 25% or more of the voting securities of the Company; (3) the UAL shareholders
approve any plan or proposal for the liquidation of the Company; (4) a
change in the majority of the Board over a 24-month period (unless the
new directors were approved by a two-thirds majority of prior directors);
or (5) any other event or transaction that the Board of Directors determines
is a change of control.

A "change of control" will
generally not arise as a result of events occurring prior to or on account
of a plan of reorganization of the Company under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy
Code, unless (1) there is a merger with another commercial airline and
the holders of the claims and/or interests in the Company before the merger
have less than 80% of the combined voting power after the merger; or (2)
creditors of the Company with an intent to control the management and policies
of the Company on an ongoing basis acquire at least 25% of the voting securities
of the Company; or (3) a sale of the assets of the Company to another commercial
airline, unless the creditors and/or interest holders in the Company receive,
directly or indirectly, at least 80% of the combined voting power of the
acquirer.

As reported in the Company's
Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2002 and 2003, in consideration of projected
retirement benefits foregone by Mr. Tilton as a result of his resignation
from his prior employer and acceptance of the Company's employment offer,
$4.5 million was paid into three secular trusts on Mr. Tilton's behalf
subject to ratable vesting over three years.  Two of these trusts
vested on September 2, 2003 and 2004. The third trust will vest on September
2, 2005; however, it will be forfeited and returned to the Company if Mr.
Tilton voluntarily terminates employment for other than good reason or
is terminated for cause.

On February 21, 2003, the
Bankruptcy Court approved the Company's motion to assume Mr. Tilton's amended
employment agreement.

Director Compensation

We do not pay directors
who are also employees of the Company or its subsidiaries additional compensation
for their service as directors.  In 2004, compensation for non-employee
directors included the following:

--   annual retainer
of $18,000;

--   $900 for each
board and board committee meeting attended;

- --   annual retainer of $2,700 to committee chairmen (other than
chair of the Human Resources Subcommittee if the

same as the chair of the Human Resources Committee);

--   reimbursement
of expenses of attending board and committee meetings;

Directors had the election to
receive some or all of their cash retainers and fees in Common Stock, as
well as to defer their stock and cash compensation for tax purposes.

We consider it important
for our directors to understand our business and have exposure to our operations
and employees. For this reason, we provide free transportation and free
cargo shipment on United to our directors and their spouses and eligible
dependent children. We reimburse our directors for federal and state income
taxes resulting from actual use of the travel and shipment privileges.
Current directors who retire from the Board with at least five years of
UAL creditable service will receive free travel and cargo benefits for
life, subject to certain exceptions.

The cost of this policy in
2004 for each director, including cash payments made in January 2005 for
income tax liability, was as follows:

ITEM 12.  SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND
MANAGEMENT AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS.

Equity Compensation Plan Information

The following table sets
forth information as of December 31, 2004 regarding the number of shares
of UAL common stock that may be issued under the Company's equity compensation
plans. We believe that UAL's presently outstanding equity securities will
have no value and it is expected that those securities will be canceled
under any plan of reorganization that we propose.

(1)  Includes shares and other awards under the
following plans that have not been approved by the Company's stockholders:
United Employees Performance Incentive Plan and 2002 Share Incentive Plan.
The material terms of each of these plans is described following the table.

(2)  The weighted-average exercise price was calculated
based on 650,000 options granted to Mr. Tilton at an exercise price of
$3.03. The remaining 4,358 shares do not have an exercise price.

(3)  Includes 12,777,228 shares available for future
issuance under the 2002 Share Incentive Plan and 38,172 shares available
for issuance under the 1995 Directors Plan.  The number of shares
available for future issuance does not include any shares issuable under
outstanding awards or the 2002 Share Incentive Plan that are subsequently
forfeited, expired or canceled without the delivery of shares of common
stock or withheld by UAL to satisfy any applicable tax withholding obligations,
which are available again for issuance under the 2002 Share Incentive Plan.

1995 Directors Plan

Under the UAL Corporation
1995 Directors Plan, each non-employee director is granted 400 shares of
common stock and 189 deferred stock units (each unit representing the right
to receive a share of common stock at a future date) during each year that
he or she is an outside director of the Company.  If any outside director
is not a director for the entire calendar year, the award of deferred stock
units will be prorated.  Each outside director may elect to forego
the receipt of all or any portion of cash fees payable to him or her for
service as a director (i.e., meeting fees and committee fees) and instead
receive shares of the common stock equivalent in value to the cash fees
based on the fair market value of a share of common stock on the date the
cash fee is payable to the director.  The outside directors may also
elect to defer the receipt of cash fees payable as well as the stock award
and the deferred stock units to be granted in any year, which deferral
may be paid after the director leaves the Board, either as a lump sum or
in ten or less annual payments.  The 1995 Directors Plan authorizes
the issuance of up to 400,000 shares of common stock (either through use
of treasury shares or open market purchases) and, as of December 31, 2004,
38,172 shares remained available for future awards. The Nominating/Governance
Committee determined not to issue the 189 deferred stock units in 2003
and the 400 shares issuable in January 2004.

2002 Share Incentive Plan

The 2002 Share Incentive
Plan permits the award of nonqualified stock options and restricted shares
to participants as well as stock appreciation rights. The exercise price
of a nonqualified stock option cannot be less than the fair market value
of a share of UAL common stock on the date of grant and the exercise period
cannot exceed ten years.  Restricted shares issued under the 2002
Share Incentive Plan vest over a time period established by the applicable
committee (not to exceed ten years) and are subject to certain transfer
restrictions and forfeiture under certain circumstances prior to vesting. 
In addition, the Human Resources Subcommittee of the Company's Board of
Directors may grant to participants other awards, including dividends and
dividend equivalents and other awards that are valued in whole or part
by reference to, or are otherwise based on, the fair market value of shares
of UAL common stock. The 2002 Share Incentive Plan authorizes the issuance
of 12,500,000 shares of common stock as well as 267,366 shares that were
available for issuance as awards under the 1998 Restricted Stock Plan as
of July 31, 2002 and, as of December 31, 2004, approximately 12,777,228
shares remained available for future awards under the 2002 Share Incentive
Plan. Only treasury shares may be issued under the 2002 Share Incentive
Plan. The terms of the 2002 Share Incentive Plan also provides that any
shares awarded under the 1998 Restricted Stock Plan or the 2002 Share Incentive
Plan that are subsequently forfeited, expired or canceled without the delivery
of shares of common stock or withheld by UAL to satisfy any applicable
tax withholding obligations will be available again for issuance under
the plan. There were no awards made under the 2002 Share Incentive Plan
in 2004.

United Employees Performance Incentive Plan

Under the terms of the UAL Corporation
Employee's Performance Incentive Plan (referred to as the "PIP"), which
was replaced as of January 1, 2004, participants were able to receive additional
cash compensation if the Company met specified performance criteria and
the employee's individual performance warranted additional compensation. 
Prior to the beginning of each year, the Human Resources Subcommittee of
the Company's Board of Directors established a threshold level of pre-tax
profit margin that the Company would have to have obtained before any award
would have been made under the PIP for that year.  The Human Resources
Subcommittee also determined the appropriate performance objectives for
each year that were related to specified areas, including financial performance,
operational performance and customer satisfaction.

Under the PIP, an incentive
award was typically paid in cash following the end of a calendar year;
however, certain key employees were allowed to elect to defer receipt of
their incentive awards and could have elected to receive their deferred
incentive awards in Common Stock (treasury shares or shares purchased in
the open market).  The amount of stock that would have been paid to
each employee was equal to the amount of the incentive award divided by
the fair market value of the stock (using a trailing five-day average share
price) determined as of the date the incentive award would have been paid
in cash but for the deferral election.  Under the PIP, any employee
who deferred his or her receipt of the incentive award for five or more
years would also have been credited with an additional amount equal to
20% of the incentive award.  The Human Resources Subcommittee administered
the plan for all participants.  There was no fixed number of shares
available for issuance under this plan.  In 2000, UAL's shareholders
approved the portion of the PIP relating to any "covered award" that could
result in the application of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code.
The United Employees Performance Incentive Plan was replaced by the Success
Sharing Program - Performance Incentive Plan effective January 1, 2004.

Success Sharing Program - Performance Incentive Plan

In connection with our reorganization
under Chapter 11, United employees have agreed to wage and salary reductions
and other work rule changes designed to reduce costs and improve our financial
position. Effective as of January 1, 2004, we implemented our Success Sharing
Program - Performance Incentive Plan (the "Plan"), which replaces the PIP
and now covers U.S. union and salaried and management employees. Participation
of international employees not on the U.S. payroll are determined under
applicable local law and organizations representing those employees. The
purpose of the Plan is to create a commonality of interest among employees
and to create a focus on financial and operational improvements. The Plan
provides qualified employees with a performance incentive award based on
financial and operational performance goals. These goals are the same for
all employees, including senior management.

Beneficial Ownership of Securities

The following table shows
the number of shares of UAL voting securities owned by any person or group
known to UAL as of February 20, 2005, to be the beneficial owner of more
than 5% of any class of its voting securities.

Directors and Executive Officers

The following table sets
forth the number of shares of common stock beneficially owned as of March
1, 2005, by each director, and each executive officer included in the Summary
Compensation Table, and by our directors and executive officers as a group. 
The owner exercises sole voting and investment power over the securities
(other than unissued securities which ownership we have imputed to the
owner).  Some of our directors and executive officers also own shares
of other classes of our preferred stock as shown in the table above.

Audit Committee Pre-Approval Policy and Procedures

.

The Audit Committee
of the UAL Board of Directors adopted a policy on pre-approval of services
of independent accountants in October 2002. The policy provides that the
Audit Committee shall pre-approve all audit and non-audit services to be
provided to the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates by its auditors.
The process by which this is carried out is as follows:

For recurring services, the
Audit Committee reviews and pre-approves Deloitte & Touche's annual
audit services and employee benefit plan audits in conjunction with the
Committee's annual appointment of the outside auditors. The materials include
a description of the services along with related fees. The Committee also
reviews and pre-approves other classes of recurring services along with
fee thresholds for pre-approved services. In the event that the pre-approval
fee thresholds are met and additional services are required prior to the
next scheduled Committee meeting, pre-approvals of additional services
follow the process described below.

Any requests for audit, audit-related,
tax and other services not contemplated with the recurring services approval
described above must be submitted to the Audit Committee for specific pre-approval
and cannot commence until such approval has been granted. Normally, pre-approval
is provided at regularly scheduled meetings. However, the authority to
grant specific pre-approval between meetings, as necessary, has been delegated
to the Chairman of the Audit Committee. The Chairman must update the Committee
at the next regularly scheduled meeting of any services that were granted
specific pre-approval.

On a periodic basis, the
Audit Committee reviews the status of services and fees incurred year-to-date
and a list of newly pre-approved services since its last regularly scheduled
meeting.
