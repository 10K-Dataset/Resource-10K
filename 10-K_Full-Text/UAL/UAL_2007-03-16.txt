ITEM 1.

BUSINESS.

UAL Corporation (together with its consolidated
subsidiaries, “we,” “our,” “us,” “UAL” or the “Company”) was incorporated under
the laws of the State of Delaware on December 30, 1968. World headquarters
is located at 1200 East Algonquin Road, Elk Grove Township, Illinois 60007. The
mailing address is P.O. Box 66919, Chicago, Illinois 60666 (telephone
number (847) 700-4000).

UAL is a holding company whose principal subsidiary is
United Air Lines, Inc. (“United”). United’s operations, which consist
primarily of the transportation of persons, property, and mail throughout the
U.S. and abroad, accounted for most of UAL’s revenues and expenses in 2006. United
provides these services through full-sized jet aircraft (which the Company
refers to as its “mainline” operations), as well as smaller aircraft in its
regional operations conducted under contract by “United Express

®

” carriers.

United is one of the largest passenger airlines in the
world with more than 3,600 flights a day to more than 200 destinations through
its mainline and United Express services. United offers approximately 1,550
average daily mainline (including Ted

(SM)

) departures to more than 120
destinations in 30 countries and two U.S. territories, including the Washington
Dulles-Rome service commencing in the first half of 2007. In addition, United
will commence its Washington Dulles-Beijing service on March 28, 2007
having received final U. S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”) approval for
this route in February 2007. United provides regional service, connecting
primarily via United’s domestic hubs, through marketing relationships with
United Express carriers, which provide more than 2,050 average daily departures
to approximately 160 destinations. United serves virtually every major market
around the world, either directly or through its participation in the Star
Alliance

®

, the world’s
largest airline network.

United offers
services that the Company believes will allow it to generate a revenue premium
by meeting distinct customer needs. This
strategy of market segmentation is intended to optimize margins and costs by
offering the right service to the right customer at the right time. These
services include:

·

United
mainline, including United First

®

,
United Business

®

and Economy Plus

®

, the last providing three to five inches
of extra legroom on all United mainline flights (including Ted), and on explus

(SM)

regional jet flights;

·

Ted,
a low-fare service, now operates 56 aircraft and serves 20 airports with over
230 daily departures from all United hubs;

·

p.s.

(SM)

—a premium transcontinental
service connecting New York with Los Angeles and San Francisco; and

·

United
Express, with a total fleet of 290 aircraft operated by regional partners,
including over 100 70-seat aircraft that offer explus, United’s premium
regional service, redefining the regional jet experience.

The Company also generates significant revenue through
its Mileage Plus

®

Frequent Flyer Program (“Mileage Plus”),
United Cargo

(SM)

and United Services. Mileage Plus contributed
approximately $600 million to passenger and other revenue in 2006 and
helps the Company attract and retain high-value customers. United Cargo
generated $750 million in freight and mail revenue in 2006. United Services
generated approximately $280 million in revenue in 2006 by utilizing downtime
of otherwise under-utilized resources.

The Company believes its restructuring has made United
competitive with network airline peers. In every year of the restructuring,
beginning in 2003, the Company has improved its financial performance. The
Company’s 2006 financial results clearly demonstrate this progress despite an
increase in the price of mainline fuel of over 160% since 2002. Since emerging
from bankruptcy on February 1, 2006, the Company


generated operating income
of $499 million for the eleven months ended December 31, 2006. Mainline
fuel expense in this period was $4.5 billion. These amounts compare to an
operating loss of $2.8 billion and mainline fuel expense of $1.9 billion in
2002, the year the Company filed for bankruptcy as discussed below.

Management’s goal is to further improve profit margins
through continuous improvements to its core business across its operations by
focusing on superior customer service, controlling unit costs and improving
unit revenues by offering differentiated products and services and realizing
revenue premiums. Having completed its reorganization and prepared a solid
platform for growth, the Company is now building on its core competitive
advantages, including strong brand recognition, its leading loyalty program and
broad global airline network.

Bankruptcy Considerations

The following discussion provides general background
information regarding the Company’s Chapter 11 cases, and is not intended to be
an exhaustive summary. Detailed information pertaining to its bankruptcy
filings may be obtained at

www.pd-ual.com

.
See also Note 1, “Voluntary Reorganization Under Chapter 11,” in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

.

On December 9, 2002 (the “Petition Date”), UAL,
United, and 26 direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively, the
“Debtors”) filed voluntary petitions to reorganize their businesses under
Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy
Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division (the “Bankruptcy
Court”). On January 20, 2006, the Bankruptcy Court confirmed the Debtors’
Second Amended Joint Plan of Reorganization Pursuant to Chapter 11 of the
United States Bankruptcy Code (the “Plan of Reorganization”). The Plan of
Reorganization became effective and the Debtors emerged from bankruptcy
protection on February 1, 2006 (the “Effective Date”). On the Effective
Date, UAL implemented fresh-start reporting in accordance with American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants’ Statement of Position 90-7 “

Financial Reporting by Entities in Reorganization under the Bankruptcy
Code

” (“SOP 90-7”).

The Plan of
Reorganization generally provides for the full payment or reinstatement of
allowed administrative claims, priority claims, and secured claims, and the
distribution of new equity and debt securities to the Debtors’ creditors and
employees in satisfaction of allowed unsecured and deemed claims. The Plan of
Reorganization contemplates UAL issuing up to 125 million shares of common
stock (out of the one billion shares of new common stock authorized under its
certificate of incorporation). The new common stock was listed on the NASDAQ
National Market and began trading under the symbol “UAUA”


on February 2,
2006. Ultimately, distributions of common stock, subject to certain holdbacks
as described in the Plan of Reorganization, will be as follows:

·

Approximately
115 million shares of common stock to unsecured creditors and employees;

·

Up
to 9.825 million shares of common stock (or options or other rights to acquire
shares) under the Management Equity Incentive Plan (“MEIP”) approved by the
Bankruptcy Court; and

·

Up
to 175,000 shares of common stock (or options or other rights to acquire
shares) under the Director Equity Incentive Plan (“DEIP”) approved by the
Bankruptcy Court.

The Plan of
Reorganization also provides for the issuance of the following securities:

·

million shares of 2% mandatorily convertible preferred stock issued to the
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (“PBGC”) shortly after the Effective Date;

·

Approximately
$150 million in aggregate principal amount of 5% senior convertible notes
issued to holders of certain municipal bonds shortly after the Effective Date;

·

$726
million in aggregate principal amount of 4.5% senior limited-subordination
convertible notes issued in July 2006 to certain irrevocable trusts
established for the benefit of certain employees (the “Limited-Subordination
Notes”);

·

$500
million in aggregate principal amount of 6% senior notes issued to the PBGC
shortly after the Effective Date; and

·

$500
million in aggregate principal amount of 8% senior contingent notes (in up to
eight equal tranches of $62.5 million) issuable to the PBGC upon the
satisfaction of certain contingencies.

Pursuant to the Company’s Plan of Reorganization, the
Limited-Subordination Notes were required to be issued within 180 days of the
Effective Date with a conversion price equal to 125% of the average closing
price for the 60 consecutive trading days following February 1, 2006, and
an interest rate established so the notes would trade at par upon issuance. In
July 2006, the Company reached agreement with five of the seven eligible
employee groups to modify the conversion price to instead be based upon the
volume-weighted average price of the common stock over the two trading days
ending on July 25, 2006. This modification resulted in a new conversion
price of $34.84, rather than of $46.86, which was the conversion price under
the initial terms of the notes. Because the reduction in the conversion price
resulted in a benefit to noteholders, the Company was able to issue the notes
at an interest rate of 4.5%, which is a lower rate of interest than would have
been required under the initial terms in order for the notes to trade at par
upon issuance. The Company reached agreement with the two other employee groups
to pay them cash totaling approximately $0.4 million rather than issuing
additional notes of similar value. See Note 11, “Debt Obligations,” in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

for further information.

Pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization, UAL common
stock, preferred stock, and Trust Originated Preferred Securities issued before
the Petition Date were canceled on the Effective Date, and no distribution was
made to holders of those securities.

On the Effective Date, the Company secured access to
$3.0 billion in secured exit financing (the “Credit Facility”) which consisted
of a $2.45 billion term loan, a $350 million delayed draw term loan and a $200
million revolving credit line. On the Effective Date, the $2.45 billion term
loan and the entire revolving credit line, consisting of $161 million in cash
and $39 million of letters of credit, were drawn and used to repay the
Debtor-In-Possession credit facility (the “DIP Financing”) and to make other
payments required upon exit from bankruptcy, as well as to provide ongoing
liquidity to conduct post-reorganization operations. Subsequently, during the
first quarter of 2006, the Company repaid the entire outstanding balance on the
revolving credit line and accessed the $350 million delayed draw term loan. In


February 2007, the
Company prepaid $972 million of its Credit Facility debt and amended certain
terms of the Credit Facility. For further details on the Credit Facility
including the prepayment and related facility amendment (the “Amended Credit
Facility”), see Note 11, “Debt Obligations,” in the

Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements

.

Significant Matters Remaining to be Resolved in
Bankruptcy Court.

During
the course of its Chapter 11 proceedings, the Company successfully reached
settlements with most of its creditors and resolved most pending claims against
the Debtors. However, certain significant matters remain to be resolved in the
Bankruptcy Court. For details, see Note 1, “Voluntary Reorganization Under
Chapter 11—Bankruptcy Considerations,” in the

Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements

.

Operations

Segments.

UAL operates its businesses
through two reporting segments:  mainline and United Express. In
2006, in light of the Company’s bankruptcy-related restructuring and
organizational changes, management reevaluated the Company’s segment reporting.
As a result, the Company determined that the geographic regions and UAL Loyalty
Services, LLC (“ULS”), which it previously reported as segments, were no longer
segments requiring disclosure under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 131, “

Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise
and Related Information”

(“SFAS 131”). UAL now manages its business
as an integrated network with assets deployed across integrated mainline and
regional carrier networks, whereas in the past United focused its business
management decisions within specific geographic regions and services. This new
focus on managing the business seeks to maximize the profitability of the
overall airline network. The operations of ULS are included in mainline
operations. See “UAL Loyalty Services, LLC,” below for further information on
its business activities. Financial information on UAL’s reportable segments,
including restated segment information for 2005 and 2004, can be found in Note
9, “Segment Information,” in the

Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements

.

Mainline.

Mainline operating revenues were $16.4 billion in
2006, $15.0 billion in 2005 and $14.5 billion in 2004. As of
December 31, 2006, mainline domestic operations served 85 destinations
primarily throughout the U.S. and Canada and operated hubs in Chicago, Denver,
Los Angeles, San Francisco and Washington, D.C. Mainline international
operations serve the Pacific, Atlantic, and Latin America regions. The Pacific
region includes nonstop service to Beijing, Hong Kong, Nagoya, Osaka, Seoul, Shanghai,
Sydney and Tokyo (with service to Taipei scheduled to commence in
June 2007); direct service to Bangkok, Seoul, Singapore and Taipei via its
Tokyo hub; direct service to Ho Chi Minh City and Singapore via Hong Kong, and
to Melbourne via Sydney. The Atlantic region includes nonstop service to
Amsterdam, Brussels, Frankfurt, London, Munich, Paris and Zurich, with service
to Rome scheduled to commence in April 2007. In 2006, United commenced
service from Washington Dulles to Kuwait City as part of the Atlantic region.
United also provides seasonal service to Bermuda. The Latin American region
offers nonstop service to Buenos Aires and Sao Paulo and direct service to
Montevideo (via Buenos Aires) and Rio de Janeiro (via Sao Paulo).  The Latin American region also serves various
Mexico destinations including Cancun,
Mexico City, Puerto Vallarta, San Jose del Cabo, and Ixtapa/Zihuatanejo
(seasonal); various Caribbean points including Aruba and seasonal service to
Montego Bay, Nassau, Punta Cana, and St. Maarten; and Central America including
Guatemala City, San Salvador and Liberia, Costa Rica (seasonal).

Operating revenues attributed to mainline domestic
operations were $10.0 billion in 2006, $9.0 billion in 2005 and $9.1 billion in
2004. Operating revenues attributed to mainline international operations were
$6.4 billion in 2006, $6.0 billion in 2005 and $5.3 billion in 2004. For
purposes of the Company’s geographic revenue reporting, the Company considers
destinations in Mexico to be part of the Latin America region as opposed to the
North America region. See Note 9, “Segment Information,” in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

for financial
information on the mainline and United Express segments and operating revenues
by geographic regions as reported to the DOT.


As of December 31, 2006, the mainline segment
operated 460 aircraft and produced approximately 143 billion available seat
miles (“ASMs”) and 117 billion revenue passenger miles (“RPMs”) during 2006.

United
Express.

United
Express operating revenues were $2.9 billion in 2006, $2.4 billion in 2005 and
$1.9 billion in 2004. United has contractual relationships with various
regional carriers to provide regional jet and turboprop service branded as
United Express. United Express is an extension of the United mainline network
(United, Ted and p.s.). SkyWest Airlines, Mesa Airlines, Colgan Airlines,
Chautauqua Airlines, Shuttle America, Trans States Airlines and GoJet Airlines
are all United Express carriers, most of which operate under capacity purchase
agreements. Under these agreements, United pays the regional carriers
contractually-agreed fees (carrier-controlled costs) for operating these
flights plus a variable reimbursement (incentive payment) based on agreed
performance metrics. The carrier-controlled costs are based on specific rates
for various operating expenses of the United Express carriers, such as crew
expenses, maintenance and aircraft ownership, some of which are multiplied by
specific operating statistics (e.g., block hours, departures) while others are
fixed monthly amounts. The incentive payment is a markup applied to the
carrier-controlled costs for superior operational performance. Under these
capacity agreements, United is responsible for all fuel costs incurred as well
as landing fees, facilities rent and de-icing costs, which are passed through
without any markup. In return, the regional carriers operate this capacity on
schedules determined by United, which also determines pricing, revenues and
inventory levels and assumes the inventory and distribution risk for the available seats.

The capacity agreements which United has entered into
with United Express carriers do not include the provision of ground handling
services. As a result, United Express sources ground handling support from a
variety of third-party providers as well as by utilizing internal United
resources in some cases.

While the regional carriers operating under capacity
purchase agreements comprise over 95% of United Express flying, the Company
also has limited prorate agreements with SkyWest Airlines and Colgan Airlines. Under
these prorate agreements, United and its prorate partners agree to divide
revenue collected from each passenger according to a formula, while both United
and the prorate partners are individually responsible for their own costs of
operations. United also collects a program fee from Colgan Airlines to cover
certain marketing and distribution costs such as credit card transaction fees,
global distribution systems (“GDS”) transaction fees, and frequent flyer costs.
Unlike capacity purchase agreements, these prorate agreements require the
regional carrier to retain the control and risk of scheduling, market
selection, seat pricing and inventory for its flights.

As of December 31, 2006, United Express carriers
operated 290 aircraft and produced approximately 16 billion ASMs and 12 billion
RPMs during 2006.

Ted.

In February of 2004,
United launched Ted in Denver to provide a tailored single-class service,
including Economy Plus seating, to better serve leisure destinations in the
United network. Currently 56 A320 aircraft are configured for Ted service. Ted
provides service from United’s hubs in Denver, Washington Dulles, Chicago O’Hare
International Airport (“O’Hare”), Los Angeles and San Francisco to destinations
in Arizona, California, Florida, Louisiana, Nevada, Mexico and the Caribbean. As
of December 31, 2006, Ted provided service from all of United’s hubs to 11

destinations in the U.S., including its territories,
and four in Mexico.

United Cargo.

United
Cargo offers both domestic and international shipping through a variety of
services including United Small Package Delivery, EXP (“Express”), and GEN (“General”)
cargo services. Freight shipments comprise approximately 85% of United Cargo’s
volumes, with mail comprising the remainder. During 2006, United Cargo
accounted for approximately 4% of UAL’s operating revenues by generating $750
million in freight and mail revenue, a 3% increase versus 2005.

United Services.

United
Services is a global airline support business offering customers comprehensive
solutions for their aircraft maintenance, repair and overhaul (“MRO”), aircraft
ground


handling and flight crew
training. United Services brings nearly 80 years of experience to serve
approximately 140 airline customers worldwide. MRO services account for
approximately 75% of United Services’ revenue with ground handling and flight
crew training accounting for the remainder. MRO revenue sources include engine
maintenance, maintenance of high-tech components, line maintenance and landing
gear maintenance. During 2006, United Services generated approximately $280
million in revenue, a 12% increase as compared to 2005.

Fuel.

In 2006, fuel was the Company’s
largest operating expense. The Company’s annual mainline and United Express
fuel costs and consumption were as follows:

Operations

.

The price and availability of jet fuel significantly
affect the Company’s results of operations. A significant rise in jet fuel
prices was the primary reason that the Company’s fuel expense increased in each
of the last two years. The Company expects to be able to offset some, but not
all, of any future fuel expense increases through higher revenues and the use
of fuel hedge contracts.

To ensure adequate supplies of fuel and to provide a
measure of control over fuel costs, the Company arranges to have fuel shipped
on major pipelines and stored close to its major hub locations. Although the
Company currently does not anticipate a significant reduction in the
availability of jet fuel, a number of factors make predicting fuel prices and
fuel availability uncertain, including changes in world energy demand,
geopolitical uncertainties affecting energy supplies from oil-producing
nations, industrial accidents, threats of terrorism directed at oil supply
infrastructure, extreme weather conditions causing temporary shutdowns of
production and refining capacity, and changes in relative demand for other
petroleum products that may impact the quantity and price of jet fuel produced
from period to period.

Alliances.

United has entered into a
number of bilateral and multilateral alliances with other airlines, expanding
travel choices for our customers through these relationships by participating
in markets worldwide that United does not serve directly. These marketing
alliances typically include one or more of the following features: joint
frequent flyer program participation; code sharing of flight operations
(whereby selected seats on one carrier’s flights can be marketed under the
brand name of another carrier); coordination of reservations, ticketing,
passenger check-in, baggage handling and flight schedules; and other
resource-sharing activities.

The most significant of these arrangements is the Star
Alliance, a global integrated airline network co-founded by United in 1997. As
of February 1, 2007, Star Alliance carriers serve over 800 destinations in
over 150 countries with over 14,000 average daily flights. Current Star
Alliance partners, in addition to United, are Air Canada, Air New Zealand, All
Nippon Airways, Asiana, the Austrian Airlines Group, bmi, LOT Polish Airlines,
Lufthansa, SAS, Singapore Airways, South African Airways, Spanair, Swiss, TAP
Portugal, Thai International Airways and US Airways.

In 2006, Star Alliance accepted the applications of
Air China, Shanghai Airlines and Turkish Airlines to join the alliance. These
airlines are in the process of completing their Star Alliance joining
requirements.


United also has independent marketing agreements with
other air carriers, not currently members of the Star Alliance, including Air
China, Aloha, Gulfstream International, 
Great Lakes Airlines, TACA Group, Island Air, Shanghai Airlines and
Virgin Blue.

Mileage Plus.

Mileage Plus builds customer
loyalty by offering awards and services to frequent travelers. Mileage Plus
members can earn mileage credit for flights on United, United Express, Ted,
members of the Star Alliance, and certain other airlines that participate in
the program. Miles also can be earned by purchasing the goods and services of
our non-airline partners, such as hotels, car rental companies, and credit card
issuers. Mileage credits can be redeemed for free, discounted or upgraded
travel and non-travel awards. There are nearly 50 million members enrolled in
Mileage Plus. For a detailed description of the accounting treatment of Mileage
Plus program activity, which was changed to a deferred revenue model upon the
adoption of fresh-start reporting on the Effective Date, see “Critical
Accounting Policies” in

Item 7. Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

.

UAL Loyalty
Services, LLC.

ULS
focuses on expanding the non-core marketing businesses of United and building
airline customer loyalty. ULS operates substantially all United-branded travel
distribution and customer loyalty e-commerce activities, such as united.com. In
addition, ULS owns and operates Mileage Plus, being responsible for member
relationships, communications and account management; while United is
responsible for other aspects of Mileage Plus, including elite membership
programs such as Global Services, Premier, Premier Executive and Premier
Executive 1K, and the establishment of award mileage redemption programs and
airline-related customer loyalty recognition policies. United is also
responsible for managing relationships with its Mileage Plus airline partners,
while ULS manages relationships with non-airline business partners, such as the
Mileage Plus Visa Card, hotels, car rental companies and dining programs, among
others.

Distribution Channels.

The majority of United’s
airline seat inventory continues to be distributed through the traditional
channels of travel agencies and GDS, such as Sabre and Galileo. The growing use
of alternative distribution systems, including the Company’s website and GDS
new entrants, however, provides United with an opportunity to lower its ticket
distribution costs. To encourage customer use of lower-cost channels and
capitalize on these cost-saving opportunities, the Company will continue to
expand the capabilities of its website, www.united.com, and it guarantees the
availability of the lowest prices on united.com.

The air travel business is
subject to seasonal fluctuations. The Company’s operations can be adversely
impacted by severe weather and the first and fourth quarter results of
operations normally reflect lower travel demand. Historically, results of
operations are better in the second and third quarters which reflect higher
levels of travel demand.

Domestic
Competition.

The
domestic airline industry is highly competitive and dynamic. In domestic
markets, new and existing carriers are generally free to initiate service
between any two points within the U.S. United’s competitors consist primarily
of other airlines, a number of whom are low-cost carriers (“LCC(s)”) with
lower-cost structures than United’s, and, to a lesser extent, other forms of
transportation.

About 82% of United’s domestic revenue is now exposed
to LCC competition. In 2006 and early 2007, Southwest Airlines, JetBlue Airways
and other LCCs have initiated new service or expanded their service from
certain of United’s hub cities. United has experience competing directly with
LCCs in its markets and believes it is well positioned to compete effectively.

Domestic pricing decisions are largely affected by the
need to meet competition from other U.S. airlines. Fare discounting by
competitors has historically had a negative effect on the Company’s financial
results because United often finds it necessary to match competitors’ fares to
maintain passenger traffic.


Attempts by United and
other network airlines to raise fares often fail due to lack of competitive
matching by LCCs; however, because of the pressure of higher fuel prices and
other industry conditions, some fare increases have occurred. Because of
different cost structures, low ticket prices that generate a profit for a LCC
have usually had a negative effect on the Company’s financial results.

International
Competition.

In
United’s international networks, the Company competes not only with U.S.
airlines, but also with foreign carriers. Competition on specified
international routes is subject to varying degrees of governmental regulations.
See “Industry Regulation,” below. As the U.S. is the largest market for air
travel worldwide, United’s ability to generate U.S. originating traffic from
its integrated domestic route systems provides United with an advantage over
non-U.S. carriers. Foreign carriers are prohibited by U.S. law from carrying
local passengers between two points in the U.S. and United experiences
comparable restrictions in foreign countries. In addition, U.S. carriers are
often constrained from carrying passengers to points beyond designated
international gateway cities due to limitations in air service agreements or
restrictions imposed unilaterally by foreign governments. To compensate for
these structural limitations, U.S. and foreign carriers have entered into
alliances and marketing arrangements that allow these carriers to feed traffic
to each other’s flights (see “Alliances,” above, for further details).

Insurance.

United carries hull
and liability insurance of a type customary in the air transportation industry,
in amounts that the Company deems appropriate, covering passenger liability,
public liability and damage to United’s aircraft and other physical property. United
also maintains other types of insurance such as property, directors and
officers, cargo, automobile and the like, with limits and deductibles that are
standard within the industry. Since the September 11, 2001 terrorist
attacks, the Company’s insurance premiums have increased significantly. Additionally,
after September 11, 2001, commercial insurers canceled United’s liability
insurance for losses resulting from war and associated perils (terrorism,
sabotage, hijacking and other similar events). The U.S. government subsequently
agreed to provide commercial war-risk insurance for U.S. based airlines until August 31,
2007 covering losses to employees, passengers, third parties and aircraft. The
Secretary of Transportation may extend this coverage until December 31,
2007. If the U.S. government does not extend this coverage beyond August 31,
2007, obtaining comparable coverage from commercial underwriters could result
in substantially higher premiums and more restrictive terms, if it is available
at all. See “Increases in insurance costs or reductions in insurance coverage
may adversely impact the Company’s operations and financial results” in

Item 1A. Risk Factors

, below.

Industry Regulation

Domestic
Regulation.

General.

All
carriers engaged in air transportation in the United States are subject to
regulation by the DOT. Among its responsibilities, the DOT issues certificates
of public convenience and necessity for domestic air transportation (no air
carrier, unless exempted, may provide air transportation without a DOT
certificate of public convenience and necessity), grants international route
authorities, approves international code share agreements, regulates methods of
competition and enforces certain consumer protection regulations, such as those
dealing with advertising, denied boarding compensation and baggage liability.

Airlines also are regulated by the Federal Aviation
Administration (“FAA”), a division of the DOT, primarily in the areas of flight
operations, maintenance and other safety and technical matters. The FAA has
authority to issue air carrier operating certificates and aircraft
airworthiness certificates, prescribe maintenance procedures, and regulate
pilot and other employee training, among other responsibilities. From time to
time, the FAA issues rules that require air carriers to take certain
actions, such as the inspection or modification of aircraft and other
equipment, that may cause the Company to incur substantial, unplanned expenses.
The airline industry is also subject to various other federal, state and local


laws and regulations. The
U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has jurisdiction over virtually
all aspects of civil aviation security. See “

Legislation

,”
below. The U.S. Department of Justice has jurisdiction over certain airline
competition matters. The U.S. Postal Service has authority over certain aspects
of the transportation of mail. Labor relations in the airline industry are
generally governed by the Railway Labor Act (“RLA”). The Company is also
subject to inquiries by the DOT, FAA and other U.S. and international
regulatory bodies.

Airport
Access.

Access to landing and take-off rights,
or “slots,” at several major U.S. airports and many foreign airports served by
United are, or recently have been, subject to government regulation. The FAA
designated John F. Kennedy International Airport (“JFK”) in New York, LaGuardia
Airport (“LaGuardia”) in New York and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport
in Washington, D.C. as “high density traffic airports” and has limited the
number of departure and arrival slots at those airports. Slot restrictions at O’Hare
were eliminated in July 2002 and were eliminated at JFK and LaGuardia in January 2007.
From time to time, the elimination of slot restrictions has impacted United’s
operational performance and reliability.

Notwithstanding the formal elimination of slot
restrictions at O’Hare in July 2002, the FAA imposed temporary
restrictions on flight operations there beginning in 2004 to address air
traffic congestion concerns. In August 2006, the FAA issued a longer-term rule restricting
flight operations at O’Hare, which remains in effect until 2008.

At LaGuardia, the FAA has proposed an interim rule that
would impose caps and restrictions on flight operations similar to those in
effect at O’Hare. The interim rule took effect in January 2007 when
the high density rule expired.

The FAA has
also proposed a longer-term rule at LaGuardia that is designed to control
air traffic congestion there indefinitely. The longer-term proposal contains
several novel elements that could impact United’s schedule and operational
performance at LaGuardia. It is not possible to predict whether or when such
longer-term rules might take effect.

Legislation.

The
airline industry is also subject to legislative activity that can have an
impact on operations and costs. Specifically, the law that authorizes federal
excise taxes and fees assessed on airline tickets expires in September 2007.
In 2007, Congress will attempt to pass comprehensive reauthorization
legislation to impose a new funding structure and make other changes to FAA
operations. Past aviation reauthorization bills have affected a wide range of
areas of interest to the industry, including air traffic control operations,
capacity control issues, airline competition issues, aircraft and airport
technology requirements, safety issues, taxes, fees and other funding sources.

Additionally, since September 11,
2001, aviation security has been and continues to be a subject of frequent
legislative action, requiring changes to our security processes and increasing
the cost of security procedures for the Company. The Aviation and
Transportation Security Act (the “Aviation Security Act”), enacted in November 2001,
has had wide-ranging effects on our operations. The Aviation Security Act made
the federal government responsible for virtually all aspects of civil aviation
security, creating a new Transportation Security Administration (“TSA”), which
is a part of the DHS pursuant to the Homeland Security Act of 2002. Under the
Aviation Security Act, substantially all security screeners at airports are now
federal employees and significant other aspects of airline and airport security
are now overseen by the TSA. Pursuant to the Aviation Security Act, funding for
airline and airport security is provided in part by a passenger security fee of
$2.50 per flight segment (capped at $10.00 per round trip), which is collected
by the air carriers from passengers and remitted to the government. In
addition, air carriers are required to submit to the government an additional
security fee equal to the amount each air carrier paid for security screening
of passengers and property in 2000. Congress is expected to continue to focus
on changes to aviation security law and requirements in 2007. Particular areas
of attention that could result in increased costs for air carriers will likely
include new requirements on cargo screening, possible deployment of antimissile
technology on passenger aircraft and potential for increased passenger and
carrier security fees.


International
Regulation.

General.

International
air transportation is subject to extensive government regulation. In connection
with United’s international services, the Company is regulated by both the U.S.
government and the governments of the foreign countries United serves. In
addition, the availability of international routes to U.S. carriers is
regulated by treaties and related aviation agreements between the U.S. and
foreign governments, and in some cases, fares and schedules require the
approval of the DOT and/or the relevant foreign governments.

Airport Access.

Historically,
access to foreign markets has been tightly controlled through bilateral
agreements between the U.S. and each foreign country involved. These agreements
regulate the number of markets served, the number of carriers allowed to serve
each market, and the frequency of carriers’ flights. Since the early 1990s, the
U.S. has pursued a policy of “open skies” (meaning all carriers have access to
the destination), under which the U.S. government has negotiated a number of
bilateral agreements allowing unrestricted access to foreign markets. Additionally,
all of the airports that United serves in Europe and Asia maintain slot
controls, and many of these are restrictive due to congestion at these airports.
London Heathrow, Frankfurt and Tokyo Narita are among the most restrictive due
to capacity limitations, and United has significant operations at these
locations.

Further, United’s ability to serve some countries and
expand into certain others is limited by the absence altogether of aviation
agreements between the U.S. and the relevant governments.

Shifts
in U.S. or foreign government aviation policies can lead to the alteration or
termination of air service agreements between the U.S. and other countries.
Depending on the nature of the change, the value of United’s route authorities
may be materially enhanced or diminished.

In February 2007, the
U.S. government and the European Union (“EU”) Commission concluded the
negotiation of a proposed transatlantic aviation agreement to replace the
existing bilateral arrangements between the U.S. government and the EU member
states. The EU Council of Transport Ministers (the “Council”) must approve the
agreement by unanimous vote. The Council is scheduled to consider the matter at
its next meeting in late March 2007.

The proposed U.S./EU
agreement is based on the U.S. open skies model and would authorize U.S.
airlines to operate between the United States and any point in the EU and
beyond, free from government restrictions on capacity, frequencies and
scheduling and provides EU carriers with reciprocal rights in these U.S./EU
markets. Currently, only 16 of the 27 EU member states have open skies
agreements with the United States. The agreement would authorize all U.S. and
EU carriers to operate services between the United States and London Heathrow,
thereby adding competition to United’s Heathrow operation, although Heathrow is
slot and terminal constrained.

The proposed agreement
would also resolve a legal issue concerning the “nationality” clauses in the
existing bilateral agreements between the United States and the EU member
states. The proposed agreement would replace this clause with a community
carrier clause that would allow carriers owned and controlled by EU citizens to
operate services to the United States from any point in the EU.

The proposed agreement
would confer a number of additional rights on EU carriers that are designed to
redress what the EU considers to be an imbalance between U.S. carrier access to
the intra-EU market versus EU carrier access to the U.S. domestic market. In
particular, EU ownership of more than 50 percent of a U.S. carrier will
not be presumed to violate the actual control by U.S. citizens requirement,
provided foreign ownership of the voting equity of the U.S. carrier does not
exceed the statutory limit of 25 percent. U.S. ownership of EU carriers
may not exceed 49.9 percent and the EU may enact legislation restricting US
ownership of the voting stock of EU airlines to 25 percent. The agreement also
provides EU passenger carriers with the right to operate between the U.S. and a
limited number of non-EU countries and does not provide reciprocal rights to
U.S. carriers. It is uncertain at this early stage what commercial effects
these provisions may have.


If the Council approves the agreement, it is scheduled
to go into effect during the winter season of 2007 with a transition to open
skies for Ireland in the summer season of 2008. If the Council does not approve
the agreement, the EU Commission may call upon the member states to renounce
their existing bilateral agreements with the U.S. or face infringement
proceedings. If EU member states renounce their agreements with the U.S., the
status of United’s existing antitrust immunity with its European partners would
be in doubt because the immunity is based upon an open skies agreement between
the U.S. and the applicable EU member state.

The EU Commission has or is expected to propose
important new legislation by the end of 2007 that will also impact the Company.
New proposed legislation may officially sanction secondary slot trading, which
is a current practice among carriers that involves the sale, purchase or lease
of slots. If adopted, that legislation should resolve disputes about the
legality of slot exchanges at EU airports and permit carriers to continue with
this longstanding practice. In addition, on December 20, 2006, the EU
Commission proposed legislation to include aviation within the EU’s existing
emissions trading scheme. If adopted, such a measure could add significantly to
the costs of operating in Europe. The precise cost to United will depend upon
the terms of the legislation enacted, which would determine whether United will
be forced to buy emission allowances and the cost at which these allowances may
be obtained.

Pursuant to an agreement
reached in December 2005, a full open skies agreement between the United
States and Canada is likely to take effect in early 2007. The DOT is expected
to finalize its tentative decision from December 2006 approving United’s
proposed 9-party antitrust immunity application (including United, Air
Canada, Lufthansa, SAS, Austrian, Swiss, LOT, TAP and bmi). At that time,
United and Air Canada will be permitted to expand their existing antitrust
immunity beyond the currently allowed transborder region.

Environmental Regulation.

The airline industry is
subject to increasingly stringent federal, state, local, and foreign
environmental laws and regulations concerning emissions to the air, discharges
to surface and subsurface waters, safe drinking water, and the management of
hazardous substances, oils, and waste materials. New regulations surrounding
the emission of greenhouse gases (such as carbon dioxide) are being considered
for promulgation both internationally and within the United States. United will
be carefully evaluating the potential impact of such proposed regulations. Other
areas of developing regulations include the State of California rule-makings
regarding air emissions from ground support equipment and a federal rule-making
concerning the discharge of deicing fluid. The airline industry is also subject
to other environmental laws and regulations, including those that require the
Company to remediate soil or groundwater to meet certain objectives. Compliance
with all environmental laws and regulations can require significant
expenditures. Under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as “Superfund,” and similar
environmental cleanup laws, generators of waste materials, and owners or
operators of facilities, can be subject to liability for investigation and
remediation costs at locations that have been identified as requiring response
actions. The Company also conducts voluntary environmental assessment and
remediation actions. Environmental cleanup obligations can arise from, among
other circumstances, the operation of aircraft fueling facilities, and
primarily involve airport sites. Future costs associated with these activities
are currently not expected to have a material adverse affect on the Company’s
business.

Employees

As of December 31, 2006, the Company and its
subsidiaries had approximately 55,000 active employees, of whom approximately
81% were represented by various U.S. labor organizations.


As of December 31,

International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers (“IFPTE”) and
Professional Airline Flight Control Association (“PAFCA”).

Collective bargaining agreements (“CBAs”) are
negotiated under the RLA, which governs labor relations in the air
transportation industry, and such agreements typically do not contain an
expiration date. Instead, they specify an amendable date, upon which the
contract is considered “open for amendment.” 
Before the amendable date, neither party is required to agree to
modifications to the bargaining agreement. Nevertheless, nothing prevents the
parties from agreeing to start negotiations or to modify the agreement in
advance of the amendable date. Contracts remain in effect while new agreements
are negotiated. During the negotiating period, both the Company and the
negotiating union are required to maintain the status quo.


ITEM 1A.

RISK
FACTORS.

The following risk factors should be read carefully
when evaluating the Company’s business and the forward-looking statements
contained in this report and other statements the Company or its
representatives make from time to time. Any of the following risks could
materially adversely affect the Company’s business, operating results,
financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which
forward-looking statements are made in this report.

Risks Related to the Company’s Business

Continued periods
of historically high fuel costs or significant disruptions in the supply of
aircraft fuel could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s operating
results.

The Company’s operating
results have been and continue to be significantly impacted by changes in the
availability or price of aircraft fuel. Previous record-high fuel prices
increased substantially in 2006 as compared to 2005. At times, United has not
been able to increase its fares when fuel prices have risen due to the highly
competitive nature of the airline industry, and it may not be able to do so in
the future. Although the Company is currently able to obtain adequate supplies
of aircraft fuel, it is impossible to predict the future availability or price
of aircraft fuel. In addition, from time to time the Company enters into
hedging arrangements to protect against rising fuel costs. The Company’s
ability to hedge in the future, however, may be limited due to market
conditions and other factors.

Additional
terrorist attacks or the fear of such attacks, even if not made directly on the
airline industry, could negatively affect the Company and the airline industry.

The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001
involving commercial aircraft severely and adversely affected the Company’s
financial condition and results of operations, as well as prospects for the
airline industry generally. Among the effects experienced from the September 11,
2001 terrorist attacks were substantial flight disruption costs caused by the
FAA-imposed temporary grounding of the U.S. airline industry’s fleet,
significantly increased security costs and associated passenger inconvenience,
increased insurance costs, substantially higher ticket refunds and
significantly decreased traffic and revenue per revenue passenger mile (“yield”).

Additional terrorist
attacks, even if not made directly on the airline industry, or the fear of or
the precautions taken in anticipation of such attacks (including elevated
national threat warnings or selective cancellation or redirection of flights)
could materially and adversely affect the Company and the airline industry. The
war in Iraq and additional international hostilities could also have a material
adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition, liquidity and results of
operations. The Company’s financial resources might not be sufficient to absorb
the adverse effects of any further terrorist attacks or an increase in post-war
unrest in Iraq or other international hostilities involving the United States.

The airline industry is highly competitive and
susceptible to price discounting.

The U.S. airline industry is characterized by
substantial price competition, especially in domestic markets. Some of our
competitors have substantially greater financial resources or lower-cost
structures than United does, or both. In recent years, the market share held by
LCCs has increased significantly. Large network carriers, like United, have
often had a lack of pricing power within domestic markets.

In addition, U.S. Airways, Northwest, Delta and
several small U.S. competitors have recently reorganized or are currently
reorganizing under bankruptcy protection. Other carriers could file for
bankruptcy or threaten to do so to reduce their costs. Carriers operating under
bankruptcy protection can operate in a manner that could be adverse to the
Company and could emerge from bankruptcy as more vigorous competitors.


From time to time the U.S.
airline industry has undergone consolidation, as in the recent merger of U.S.
Airways and America West, and may experience additional consolidation in the
future. United routinely monitors changes in the competitive landscape and
engages in analysis and discussions regarding its strategic position, including
alliances, asset acquisitions and business combinations. If other airlines
participate in merger activity, those airlines may significantly improve their
cost structures or revenue generation capabilities, thereby potentially making
them stronger competitors of United.

Additional security requirements may increase the
Company’s costs and decrease its traffic.

Since September 11, 2001, the DHS and the TSA
have implemented numerous security measures that affect airline operations and
costs, and are likely to implement additional measures in the future. In
addition, foreign governments have also begun to institute additional security
measures at foreign airports United serves. A substantial portion of the costs
of these security measures is borne by the airlines and their passengers,
increasing the Company’s costs and/or reducing its revenue.

Security measures imposed
by the U.S. and foreign governments after September 11, 2001 have
increased United’s costs and may further adversely affect the Company and its
financial results. Additional measures taken to enhance either passenger or
cargo security procedures and/or to recover associated costs in the future may
result in similar adverse effects.

Extensive
government regulation could increase the Company’s operating costs and restrict
its ability to conduct its business.

Airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal
compliance requirements that result in significant costs. In addition to the
enactment of the Aviation Security Act, laws, regulations, taxes and airport
rates and charges have been proposed from time to time that could significantly
increase the cost of airline operations or reduce airline revenue. The FAA from
time to time also issues directives and other regulations relating to the
maintenance and operation of aircraft that require significant expenditures by
the Company. The Company expects to continue incurring material expenses to
comply with the regulations of the FAA and other agencies.

United operates under a certificate of public
convenience and necessity issued by the DOT. If the DOT altered, amended,
modified, suspended or revoked United’s certificate, it could have a material
adverse effect on its business.

The FAA can also limit United’s
airport access by limiting the number of departure and arrival slots at “high
density traffic airports” and local airport authorities may have the ability to
control access to certain facilities or the cost of access to such facilities,
which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business.

Many aspects of United’s operations are also subject
to increasingly stringent federal, state and local laws protecting the
environment. Future regulatory developments in the U.S. and abroad could
adversely affect operations and increase operating costs in the airline
industry. For example, potential future actions that may be taken by the U.S.
government, foreign governments, or the International Civil Aviation
Organization to limit the emission of greenhouse gases by the aviation industry
are uncertain at this time, but the impact to the Company and its industry
would likely be adverse and could be significant.

The ability of U.S. carriers to operate international
routes is subject to change because the applicable arrangements between the
United States and foreign governments may be amended from time to time, or
because appropriate slots or facilities may not be made available. United
currently operates on a number of international routes under government
arrangements that limit the number of carriers, capacity, or the number of
carriers allowed access to particular airports. If an open skies policy were to
be adopted for any of these routes, such an event could have a material adverse
impact on the Company’s financial position and results of operations and could
result in the impairment of material amounts of related intangible assets.


Further, the Company’s
operations in foreign countries are subject to various laws and regulations in
those countries. The Company cannot provide any assurance that current laws and
regulations, or laws or regulations enacted in the future, will not adversely
affect its financial condition or results of operations.

The Company’s
results of operations fluctuate due to seasonality and other factors associated
with the airline industry.

Due to greater demand for
air travel during the summer months, revenues in the airline industry in the
second and third quarters of the year are generally stronger than revenues in
the first and fourth quarters of the year. The Company’s results of operations
generally reflect this seasonality, but have also been impacted by numerous
other factors that are not necessarily seasonal including, among others, the
imposition of excise and similar taxes, extreme or severe weather, air traffic
control delays and general economic conditions. As a result, the Company’s
quarterly operating results are not necessarily indicative of operating results
for an entire year and historical operating results are not necessarily
indicative of future operating results.

The Company’s
financial condition and results of operations may be further affected by the
future resolution of bankruptcy-related contingencies.

Despite the Company’s exit
from bankruptcy on February 1, 2006, several significant matters remain to
be resolved in connection with its reorganization under Chapter 11 of the
United States Bankruptcy Code. Unfavorable resolution of these matters could
have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business. For additional detail
regarding these matters, see Note 1, “Voluntary Reorganization Under Chapter 11—Bankruptcy
Considerations,” in the

Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements

.

The Company’s
initiatives to improve the delivery of its products and services to its
customers, reduce costs, and increase its revenues may not be adequate or
successful.

The Company continues to
identify and implement continuous improvement programs to improve the delivery
of its products and services to its customers, reduce its costs and increase
its revenues. Some of these efforts are focused on cost savings in such areas
as telecommunications, airport services, catering, maintenance materials,
aircraft ground handling and regional affiliates. A number of the Company’s
ongoing initiatives involve significant changes to the Company’s business that
it may be unable to implement successfully. The adequacy and ultimate success
of the Company’s programs and initiatives to improve the delivery of its
products and services to its customers, reduce its costs and increase its
revenues cannot be assured.

Union disputes,
employee strikes and other labor-related disruptions may adversely affect the
Company’s operations.

Approximately 81% of the employees of UAL are
represented for collective bargaining purposes by U.S. labor unions. These
employees are organized into six labor groups represented by six different
unions.

Relations between air
carriers and labor unions in the United States are governed by the RLA. Under
the RLA, a carrier must maintain the existing terms and conditions of
employment following the amendable date through a multi-stage and usually
lengthy series of bargaining processes overseen by the National Mediation Board.
This process continues until either the parties have reached agreement on a new
CBA or the parties are released to “self-help” by the National Mediation Board.
Although in most circumstances the RLA prohibits strikes, shortly after release
by the National Mediation Board carriers and unions are free to engage in
self-help measures such as strikes and lock-outs. All of the Company’s U.S. labor
agreements become amendable in January 2010. There is also a risk that
dissatisfied employees, either with or without union involvement, could engage
in illegal slow-downs, work stoppages, partial work


stoppages,
sick-outs or other actions short of a full strike that could individually or
collectively harm the operation of the airline and impair its financial
performance.

Increases in
insurance costs or reductions in insurance coverage may adversely impact the
Company’s operations and financial results.

The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 led
to a significant increase in insurance premiums and a decrease in the insurance
coverage available to commercial airlines. Accordingly, the Company’s insurance
costs increased significantly and its ability to continue to obtain certain
types of insurance remains uncertain. The Company has obtained third-party war
risk (terrorism) insurance through a special program administered by the FAA,
resulting in lower premiums than if it had obtained this insurance in the
commercial insurance market. Should the government discontinue this coverage,
obtaining comparable coverage from commercial underwriters could result in
substantially higher premiums and more restrictive terms, if it is available at
all. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate war risk insurance, its
business could be materially and adversely affected.

If any of United’s
aircraft were to be involved in an accident, the Company could be exposed to
significant liability. The insurance it carries to cover damages arising from
any future accidents may be inadequate. If the Company’s insurance is not
adequate, it may be forced to bear substantial losses from an accident.

The Company relies
heavily on automated systems to operate its business and any significant
failure of these systems could harm its business.

The Company depends on
automated systems to operate its business, including its computerized airline
reservation systems, flight operations systems, telecommunication systems and
commercial websites, including united.com. United’s website and reservation
systems must be able to accommodate a high volume of traffic and deliver
important flight information, as well as process critical financial
transactions. Substantial or repeated website, reservations systems or
telecommunication systems failures could reduce the attractiveness of United’s
services versus its competitors and materially impair its ability to market its
services and operate its flights.

The Company’s
business relies extensively on third-party providers. Failure of these parties
to perform as expected, or unexpected interruptions in the Company’s
relationships with these providers or their provision of services to the
Company, could have an adverse effect on its financial condition and results of
operations.

The Company has engaged a
growing number of third-party service providers to perform a large number of
functions that are integral to its business, such as operation of

United Express flights, operation of
customer service call centers, provision of information technology
infrastructure and services, provision of maintenance and repairs, provision of
various utilities and performance of aircraft fueling operations, among other
vital functions and services. The Company does not directly control these
third-party providers, although it does enter into agreements with many of them
that define expected service performance. Any of these third-party providers,
however, may materially fail to meet their service performance commitments to
the Company. The failure of these providers to adequately perform their service
obligations, or other unexpected interruptions of services, may reduce the
Company’s revenues and increase its expenses or prevent United from operating
its flights and providing other services to its customers. In addition, the
Company’s business and financial performance could be materially harmed if its
customers believe that its services are unreliable or unsatisfactory.


The Company’s high
level of fixed obligations could limit its ability to fund general corporate
requirements and obtain additional financing, could limit its flexibility in
responding to competitive developments and could increase its vulnerability to
adverse economic and industry conditions.

The Company has a
significant amount of financial leverage from fixed obligations, including the
Amended Credit Facility, aircraft lease and debt financings, leases of airport
property and other facilities, and other material cash obligations. In
addition, as of February 2, 2007, the Company had pledged all of its
available assets as collateral to secure its various fixed obligations, except
for certain aircraft and related parts with an estimated current market value of
approximately $2.5 billion.

The Company’s high level
of fixed obligations or a downgrade in the Company’s credit ratings could
impair its ability to obtain additional financing, if needed, and reduce its
flexibility to conduct its business. Certain of the Company’s existing
indebtedness also requires it to meet covenants and financial tests to maintain
ongoing access to those borrowings. See Note 11, “Debt Obligations,” in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

for further
details. A failure to timely pay its debts or other material uncured breach of
its contractual obligations could result in a variety of adverse consequences,
including the acceleration of the Company’s indebtedness, the withholding of
credit card sale proceeds by its credit card service providers and the exercise
of other remedies by its creditors and equipment lessors that could result in
material adverse effects on the Company’s operations and financial condition. In
such a situation, it is unlikely that the Company would be able to fulfill its
obligations to repay the accelerated indebtedness, make required lease
payments, or otherwise cover its fixed costs.

The Company’s net
operating loss carry forward may be limited.

The Company has a net
operating loss (“NOL”) carry forward of approximately $2.7 billion for federal
and state income tax purposes that primarily originated before UAL’s emergence
from bankruptcy and will expire over a five to twenty year period. This tax
benefit is mostly attributable to federal NOL carry forwards of
$7.0 billion. If the Company were to have a change of ownership within the
meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, under current
conditions, its annual federal NOL utilization could be limited to an amount
equal to its market capitalization at the time of the ownership change
multiplied by the federal long-term tax exempt rate.

To avoid a potential
adverse effect on the Company’s ability to utilize its NOL carry forward for
federal income tax purposes after the Effective Date, the Company’s certificate
of incorporation contains a “5% Ownership Limitation,” applicable to all
stockholders except the PBGC. The 5% Ownership Limitation remains effective
until February 1, 2011. While the purpose of these transfer restrictions
is to prevent a change of ownership from occurring within the meaning of Section 382
of the Internal Revenue Code (which ownership change would materially and
adversely affect the Company’s ability to utilize its NOL carry forward or
other tax attributes), no assurance can be given that such an ownership change
will not occur, in which case the availability of the Company’s substantial NOL
carry forward and other federal income tax attributes would be significantly
limited or possibly eliminated.

The Company has identified a material weakness in its internal
control over financial reporting associated with tax accounting as of December
31, 2006 that, if not properly remediated, could result in material
misstatements in its financial statements in future periods.

Based on an evaluation of
our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, our
management has concluded that such internal control over financial reporting
was not effective as of such date due to the existence of a deficiency in the
operation of our internal accounting controls, which constituted a material
weakness in our internal control over financial reporting.  While the controls were properly designed and
did not result in a material misstatement, they did not operate effectively to
ensure proper accounting and disclosure of income taxes. The Company has
suffered from high management attrition during its reorganization. The material
weakness was primarily related to high staff turnover in the tax department.


As defined in Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board Auditing Standard No. 2, a material weakness
is a significant deficiency, or a combination of significant deficiencies, that
results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of a
Company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or
detected.

Because of this material
weakness, there is a risk that a material misstatement of our annual or
quarterly financial statements may not be prevented or detected. The Company
has taken and will continue to take whatever steps are necessary to remediate
the material weakness, including the hiring of staff, use of external advisors,
as well as implementing a more rigorous review process of tax accounting and
disclosure matters. We cannot guarantee, however, that such remediation efforts
will correct the material weakness such that our internal control over
financial reporting will be effective. In the event that we do not adequately
remedy this material weakness, or if we fail to maintain effective internal
control over financial reporting in future periods, our access to capital could
be adversely affected.

The Company is
subject to economic and political instability and other risks of doing business
globally.

The Company is a global
business with operations outside of the United States from which it derives
approximately one-third of its operating revenues. The Company’s operations in
Asia, Latin America, Middle East and Europe are a vital part of its worldwide
airline network. Volatile economic, political and market conditions in these
international regions may have a negative impact on the Company’s operating
results and its ability to achieve its business objectives. In addition,
significant or volatile changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and
other currencies, the imposition of exchange controls or other currency
restrictions may have a material adverse impact upon the Company’s liquidity,
revenues, costs, or operating results.

The loss of skilled employees upon whom the Company
depends to operate its business or the inability to attract additional
qualified personnel could adversely affect its results of operations.

The Company believes that
its future success will depend in large part on its ability to attract and
retain highly qualified management, technical and other personnel. The Company
may not be successful in retaining key personnel or in attracting and retaining
other highly qualified personnel. Any inability to retain or attract
significant numbers of qualified management and other personnel could adversely
affect its business.

The Company could
be adversely affected by an outbreak of a disease that affects travel behavior.

An outbreak of a disease
that affects travel behavior, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) or
avian flu, could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business,
financial condition and results of operations.

Certain provisions of the Company’s governance
documents could discourage or delay changes of control or changes to the board
of directors of the Company.

Certain provisions of the
amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated
bylaws of UAL (the “Governance Documents”) may make it difficult for
stockholders to change the composition of the Company’s board of directors and
may discourage takeover attempts that some of its stockholders may consider
beneficial.

Certain provisions of the
Governance Documents may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in
control if the Company’s board of directors determines that such changes in
control are not in the best interests of UAL and its stockholders.

These provisions of the
Governance Documents are not intended to prevent a takeover, but are intended
to protect and maximize the value of the Company’s stockholders’ interests. While
these provisions have the effect of encouraging persons seeking to acquire
control of the Company to negotiate


with the
board of directors, they could enable the board of directors to prevent a
transaction that some, or a majority, of its stockholders might believe to be
in their best interests and, in that case, may prevent or discourage attempts
to remove and replace incumbent directors.

Risks Related to
the Company’s Common Stock

The Company’s
common stock has a limited trading history and its market price may be
volatile.

Because the Company’s
common stock began trading on the NASDAQ National Market on February 2,
2006, there is limited trading history. The market price of its common stock
may fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors, many of which are
beyond the Company’s control.

The issuance of additional shares of the Company’s
common stock, including upon conversion of its convertible preferred stock and
its convertible notes, could cause dilution to the interests of its existing
stockholders.

In connection with the
Company’s emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, the Company issued
5,000,000 shares of 2% convertible preferred stock. This preferred stock may be
converted into shares of the Company’s common stock upon the earlier of February 1,
2008, or upon a fundamental change or change in control of the Company. Further,
the preferred stock is mandatorily convertible 15 years from the issuance date.
The Company also issued approximately $150 million in convertible 5% notes
shortly after the Effective Date, and subsequently issued approximately $726
million in convertible 4.5% notes on July 25, 2006. Holders of these
securities may convert them into shares of the Company’s common stock according
to their terms. If the holders of the convertible preferred stock or the
holders of the convertible notes were to exercise their rights to convert their
securities into common stock, it could cause substantial dilution to existing
stockholders. For further information, see Note 1, “Voluntary Reorganization
Under Chapter 11—Bankruptcy Considerations” and Note 11—“Debt Obligations,” in
the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

.

The Company’s certificate
of incorporation authorizes up to one billion shares of common stock. In
certain circumstances, the Company can issue shares of common stock without
stockholder approval. In addition, the board of directors is authorized to
issue up to 250 million shares of preferred stock without any action on the part
of the Company’s stockholders. The board of directors also has the power,
without stockholder approval, to set the terms of any series of shares of
preferred stock that may be issued, including voting rights, conversion rights,
dividend rights, preferences over the Company’s common stock with respect to
dividends or if the Company liquidates, dissolves or winds up its business and
other terms. If the Company issues preferred stock in the future that has a
preference over its common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or
upon its liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or if the Company issues
preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of its common
stock, the rights of holders of its common stock or the market price of its common
stock could be adversely affected. The Company is also authorized to issue,
without stockholder approval, other securities convertible into either
preferred stock or, in certain circumstances, common stock.

In the future the Company may decide to raise
capital through offerings of its common stock, securities convertible into its
common stock, or rights to acquire these securities or its common stock. The
issuance of additional shares of common stock or securities convertible into
common stock could result in dilution of existing stockholders’ equity
interests in the Company. Issuances of substantial amounts of its common stock,
or the perception that such issuances could occur, may adversely affect
prevailing market prices for the Company’s common stock and the Company cannot predict the effect this dilution may
have on the price of its common stock.

Ground Facilities

United has entered into various leases relating to its
use of airport landing areas, gates, hangar sites, terminal buildings and other
airport facilities in most of the municipalities it serves. These leases were
subject to assumption or rejection under the Chapter 11 process. As of December 31,
2006, United had assumed major facility leases in Washington (Dulles and
Reagan), Denver (terminal lease only), San Francisco, Newark (terminal lease
only), Austin, Cleveland, Columbus, Detroit (terminal lease only), Las Vegas,
Oakland, Portland, Fort Meyers (fuel system lease only), Orange County and
Tucson. Major facility leases expire at San Francisco in 2011 and 2013,
Washington Dulles in 2014, Chicago O’Hare in 2018, Los Angeles in 2021 and
Denver in 2025.

The Company owns a 66.5-acre complex in suburban
Chicago consisting of more than 1 million square feet of office space for its
former world headquarters, a computer facility and a training center. United
also owns a flight training center, located in Denver, which accommodates 36
flight simulators and more than 90 computer-based training stations. The
Company owns a limited number of other properties, including a reservations
facility in Denver and a crew hotel in Honolulu. All of these facilities are
mortgaged.

Beginning in March 2007, the Company will move
approximately 350 management employees, including its senior management, to its
new headquarters in downtown Chicago. The Company’s new corporate headquarters
will be located at 77 West Wacker Drive, where the Company leases approximately
137,000 square feet of office space. The Company’s former world headquarters,
located in suburban Elk Grove Township, will become the Operations Center. Consistent
with the Company’s goals of achieving additional cost savings and operational
efficiencies, the Company will relocate employees from several of its other
suburban Chicago facilities into the new Operations Center.

The Company’s Maintenance Operation Center at San
Francisco International Airport occupies 130 acres of land, 2.9 million
square feet of floor space and 9 aircraft hangar bays under a lease expiring in
2013.


United’s off-airport leased properties historically
included a number of ticketing, sales and general office facilities in the
downtown and suburban areas of most of the larger cities within the United
system. As part of the Company’s restructuring and cost containment efforts,
United closed, terminated or rejected all of its former domestic city ticket
office leases. United continues to lease and operate a number of
administrative, reservations, sales and other support facilities worldwide. United
also continues to evaluate opportunities to reduce space requirements at its
airports and off-airport locations.


ITEM 3.

LEGAL
PROCEEDINGS.

In re: UAL Corporation, et. al.

As discussed above, on the Petition Date the Debtors
filed voluntary petitions to reorganize their businesses under Chapter 11 of
the Bankruptcy Code. On October 20, 2005, the Debtors filed the Debtor’s
First Amended Joint Plan of Reorganization Pursuant to Chapter 11 of the United
States Bankruptcy Code and the Disclosure Statement. The Bankruptcy Court
approved the Disclosure Statement on October 21, 2005.

Commencing on October 27, 2005, the Disclosure
Statement, ballots for voting to accept or reject the proposed plan of
reorganization and other solicitation documents were distributed to all classes
of creditors eligible to vote on the proposed plan of reorganization. After a
hearing on confirmation, on January 20, 2006, the Bankruptcy Court
confirmed the Plan of Reorganization. The Plan of Reorganization became
effective and the Debtors emerged from bankruptcy protection on the Effective
Date.

Numerous pre-petition
claims still await resolution in the Bankruptcy Court due to the Company’s
objections to either the existence of liability or the amount of the claim. The
process of determining whether liability exists and liquidating the amounts due
is likely to continue through 2007. Additionally, certain significant matters
remain to be resolved in the Bankruptcy Court. For details see Note 1, “Voluntary
Reorganization Under Chapter 11—Bankruptcy Considerations,” in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

.

Air Cargo/Passenger Surcharge Investigations

In February 2006, the
European Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice commenced an
international investigation into what government officials describe as a
possible price fixing conspiracy relating to certain surcharges included in
tariffs for carrying air cargo. In June 2006, United received a subpoena
from the U.S. Department of Justice requesting information related to certain
passenger pricing practices and surcharges applicable to international
passenger routes. The Company is cooperating fully. United is considered a
source of information for the investigation, not a target. In addition to the
federal grand jury investigation, United and other air cargo carriers have been
named as defendants in over ninety class action lawsuits alleging civil damages
as a result of the purported air cargo pricing conspiracy. Those lawsuits have
been consolidated for pretrial activities in the United States Federal Court
for the Eastern District of New York. United has entered into an agreement with
the majority of the private plaintiffs to dismiss United from the class action
lawsuits in return for an agreement to cooperate with the plaintiffs’ factual
investigation. More than fifty additional putative class actions have also been
filed alleging violations of the antitrust laws with respect to passenger
pricing practices. Those lawsuits have been consolidated for pretrial
activities in the United States Federal Court for the Northern District of
California (“Federal Court”). United has entered a settlement agreement with a
number of the plaintiffs in the passenger pricing cases to dismiss United from
the class action lawsuits in return for an agreement to cooperate with the
plaintiffs’ factual investigation. The settlement agreement is subject to
review and approval by the Federal Court. Penalties for violating competition
laws can be severe, involving both criminal and civil liability. The Company is
cooperating with the grand jury investigations while carrying out its own
internal review of its pricing practices, and is not in a position to evaluate
the potential financial impact of this litigation at this time. However, a
finding that the Company violated either U.S. antitrust laws or the competition
laws of some other jurisdiction could have a material adverse impact on the
Company.


Summers v. UAL Corporation ESOP, et. al.

Certain participants in
the UAL Corporation Employee Stock Ownership Plan (“ESOP”) sued the ESOP, the
ESOP Committee and State Street Bank and Trust Company (“State Street”) in the
U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois (“the District Court”)
in February 2003 seeking monetary damages in a purported class action that
alleges that the ESOP Committee breached its fiduciary duty by not selling UAL
stock held by the ESOP commencing as of July 19, 2001. The ESOP Committee
appointed State Street in September 2002 to act as investment manager and
fiduciary to manage the assets of the ESOP itself. In August 2005, a
proposed settlement was reached between the plaintiffs and the ESOP Committee
defendants. The agreed upon settlement amount is to be paid out of the $5.2
million in insurance proceeds remaining after deducting legal fees. State
Street objected to the agreement during the required fairness hearing before
the District Court.  The Court
nevertheless approved the settlement in October 2005, but also granted
State Street’s motion for summary judgment, dismissing the underlying claims. Both
sides appealed from the District Court’s decision, and as a result, no
settlement funds have been disbursed pending a ruling on appeal. In June 2006,
the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit (“Court of Appeals”)
affirmed the lower court’s ruling dismissing the claims against State Street
and in effect rendering State Street’s challenge to the settlement agreement
moot. Both parties requested the United States Supreme Court (“Supreme Court”)
to review the decision of the Court of Appeals. On February 20, 2007, the
Supreme Court declined both parties’ requests to review the Court of Appeals
decision, bringing this dispute to a final conclusion and foreclosing any
potential claim for indemnity against the Company.

Litigation Associated with September 11 Terrorism

Families of 94 victims of
the September 11 terrorist attacks filed lawsuits asserting a variety of
claims against the airline industry. United and American Airlines, as the two
carriers whose flights were hijacked, are the central focus of the litigation,
but a variety of additional parties have been sued on a number of legal
theories ranging from collective responsibility for airport screening and
security systems that allegedly failed to prevent the attacks to faulty design
and construction of the World Trade Center towers. In excess of 97% of the
families of the deceased victims received awards from the September 11

th

Victims Compensation Fund of 2001, which was
established by the federal government, and consequently are now barred from
making further claims against the airlines. World Trade Center Properties, Inc.
and The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey have filed cross-claims in
the wrongful death litigation against all of the aviation defendants as owners
of the World Trade Center property for property damage sustained in the attacks.
The insurers of various tenants at the World Trade Center have filed
subrogation claims for damages as well. In the aggregate, September 11

th

claims are estimated to be well in excess of
$10 billion. By statute, these matters were consolidated in the U.S. District
Court for the Southern District of New York, and airline exposure was capped at
the limit of the liability coverage maintained by each carrier at the time of
the attacks. In the personal injury and wrongful death matters, settlement
discussions continue and the parties have reached settlements in several
matters. The Company anticipates that any liability it may face arising from
the events of September 11, 2001 could be significant, but will be subject
to the statutory limitation to the amount of its insurance coverage.

Environmental Proceedings

In accordance with an order issued by the California
Regional Water Quality Control Board in June 1999, United, along with most
of the other tenants of the San Francisco International Airport, has been
investigating potential environmental contamination at the
airport (geographically including United’s San Francisco maintenance
center) and conducting monitoring and/or remediation when needed. United’s
projected costs associated with this order were significantly reduced in 2006;
therefore, the Company does not consider this to be a material proceeding.


United recently completed
negotiations with the Bay Area Air Quality Management District regarding
notices of violations received at its San Francisco maintenance center and
payment of associated penalties.

Internal Revenue Service Matter

In 1999, UAL Corporation
entered into a restructuring of its risk management function for retiree
medical benefits in an attempt to control the spiraling costs of medical care.
As part of the redesign of this function, UAL partnered with Blue Cross Blue
Shield of Illinois-Health Care Service Corporation. Upon audit of UAL’s 1999
federal income tax return, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) took the
position that this restructuring was the same as, or substantially similar to,
a listed tax shelter transaction. The IRS proposed a penalty for “gross
valuation misstatement” under Section 6662(h)(1) of the Internal
Revenue Code in the amount of approximately $16 million. The settlement of the
issue resulted in a penalty payment by UAL in 2006 in the amount of
approximately $2 million.

Other Legal Proceedings

UAL and United are involved in various other claims
and legal actions involving passengers, customers, suppliers, employees and
government agencies arising in the ordinary course of business. Additionally,
from time to time, the Company becomes aware of potential non-compliance with
applicable environmental regulations, which have either been identified by the
Company (through internal compliance programs such as its environmental
compliance audits) or through notice from a governmental entity. In some
instances, these matters could potentially become the subject of an
administrative or judicial proceeding and could potentially involve monetary
sanctions. After considering a number of factors, including (but not limited
to) the views of legal counsel, the nature of contingencies to which the
Company is subject and prior experience, management believes that the ultimate
disposition of these contingencies will not materially affect its consolidated
financial position or results of operations.

ITEM 5.

MARKET
FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER
PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES.

Shares of UAL Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately before the Effective Date (the “Old Common Stock”) traded on the
over-the-counter market (OTCBB) under the symbol UALAQ.OB from April 3,
2003 to February 1, 2006. On February 1,
2006, the Old Common Stock was canceled pursuant to the terms of the Plan of
Reorganization and the Company has no continuing obligations under the Old
Common Stock.

Pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization, the Company
issued or reserved for issuance up to 125,000,000 shares of common stock (the “New
Common Stock”) comprised of: (a) 115,000,000 shares to be distributed to
unsecured creditors and employees in accordance with the terms of the Plan of
Reorganization; (b) up to 9,825,000 shares and options (or other rights to
acquire shares) pursuant to the terms of the MEIP; and (c) up to 175,000

The Company

suspended
the payment of cash dividends on the Old Common Stock in 2002 and does not
currently anticipate paying dividends on the New Common Stock. Additionally,
under the provisions of the Amended Credit Facility the Company’s ability to
pay dividends on or repurchase New Common Stock is restricted. See Note 11, “Debt
Obligations,” in the

Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements

for more information related to dividend
restrictions under the Amended Credit Facility. Any future determination to pay
dividends will be at the discretion of the board of directors, subject to
applicable limitations under Delaware law.

Based on reports by the Company’s transfer agent for
the New Common Stock, there were approximately 1,200 record holders of its New
Common Stock as of February 28, 2007.

The following graph shows the cumulative total shareholder return for
the New Common Stock during the period from February 2, 2006 to December 31,
2006. Five year historical data is not presented as a result of the significant
period the Company was in bankruptcy and since the financial results of the Successor
Company are not comparable with the results of the Predecessor Company, as
discussed in.

ITEM 6.

SELECTED
FINANCIAL DATA.

In
connection with its emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, the
Company adopted fresh-start reporting in accordance with SOP 90-7 and in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America (“GAAP”). As a result of the adoption of fresh-start reporting, the
financial statements prior to February 1, 2006 are not comparable with the
financial statements after February 1, 2006. References to “Successor
Company” refer to UAL on or after February 1, 2006, after giving effect to
the adoption of fresh-start reporting. References to “Predecessor Company”

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

Overview

As discussed further in

Item 1.
Business

, the Company derives virtually all of its revenues from
airline related activities. The most significant source of airline revenues is
passenger revenues; however, Mileage Plus, United Cargo, and United Services
are also significant sources of operating revenues. The airline industry is
highly competitive, and is characterized by intense price competition. Fare discounting
by United’s competitors has historically had a negative effect on the Company’s
financial results because it is generally required to match competitors’ fares
to maintain passenger traffic. Future competitive fare adjustments may
negatively impact the Company’s future financial results. The Company’s most
significant operating expense is jet fuel. Jet fuel prices are extremely
volatile and are largely uncontrollable by the Company. UAL’s historical and
future earnings have been and will continue to be significantly impacted by jet
fuel prices. The impact of recent jet fuel price increases is discussed below. The
Company’s results in 2006 were significantly impacted by the adoption of
fresh-start reporting upon its emergence from bankruptcy. See the “Fresh-Start
Reporting” section below for a discussion of the of the significant fresh-start
items that impacted the Company’s earnings in 2006.

Bankruptcy Matters.

On December 9, 2002,
UAL, United and 26 direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries filed
voluntary petitions to reorganize its business under Chapter 11 of the
Bankruptcy Court. The Company emerged from bankruptcy on February 1, 2006,
under a Plan of Reorganization that was approved by the Bankruptcy Court. In
connection with its emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, the
Company adopted fresh-start reporting, which resulted in significant changes in
post-emergence financial statements, as compared to UAL’s historical financial
statements, as is further discussed in the “Financial Results”

section below. Also, see Note 1, “Voluntary
Reorganization Under Chapter 11—Bankruptcy Considerations,” in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

and

Item 1. Business

for further information regarding
bankruptcy matters.

Recent Developments.

The Company believes its
restructuring has made the Company competitive with its network airline peers. The
Company’s financial performance has continued to improve despite significant
increases in fuel prices, as noted below. Average mainline unit fuel expense
has increased 68% from 2004 to 2006, which has negatively impacted the Company’s
operating margin. However, the Company has been able to overcome rising fuel
costs through its restructuring accomplishments, improved revenues and other
means, which have contributed to the generation of operating income of $447
million in calendar-year 2006, as compared to operating losses of $219 million
and $854 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively.

United seeks to
continuously improve the delivery of its products and services to its
customers, reduce unit costs, and increase unit revenues. Together with these
initiatives, some of the Company’s more significant recent developments are
noted as follows:

·

In
February 2007, the Company prepaid $972 million of Credit Facility debt
and amended certain terms of the Credit Facility. The Amended Credit Facility
requires significantly less collateral as compared to the Credit Facility and
is expected to provide net interest expense savings of approximately $70
million annually. This amount represents the net impact of reduced interest
expense and interest income as a result of lower cash and debt balances, as
well as a more favorable interest rate on the Amended Credit Facility. See the “Liquidity
and Capital Resources” section, below, and Note 11, “Debt Obligations,” in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

for further
information related to this new facility.

·

In
2006, the Company announced a program to reduce then-projected 2007 expenses by
$400 million. The Company has identified specific programs to realize
these savings, and continues


to identify and evaluate
other savings opportunities. For example, the Company expects to reduce costs
by approximately $200 million through savings in such areas as
telecommunications, airport services, catering, maintenance materials and
aircraft ground handling. The Company also expects to reduce advertising and
marketing costs by as much as $60 million. Increased operational efficiencies,
through the implementation of such initiatives as a new flight planning system
and reduced block times are expected to generate approximately $40 million in
savings. In addition, the Company estimates it will achieve a $100 million
reduction in general and administrative expenses, which includes a reduction of
salaried and management positions. The Company realized approximately $135
million of the projected $400 million of 2007 cost reductions in 2006, and is
on track to achieve $265 million of projected cost savings in 2007.

·

In
the second quarter of 2006, the General Services Administration (“GSA”) awarded
its annual U.S. government employee travel contracts for its upcoming fiscal
year beginning October 1, 2006. The GSA selected United to provide certain
air transportation services for which the estimated annual revenue to United
will be approximately $540 million, or 27.4% of the total estimated GSA
employee travel award. This award level represents a 6.7 point increase over
the prior contract year.

·

Effective
September 2006, United began charging travel agents within North America a
$3.50 per passenger segment fee if low cost booking channels are not used. In
2006, United also renegotiated its agreements with four major GDS providers to
allow access to low cost booking options for United’s appointed travel agencies.
Increased use of low cost booking channels is expected to reduce United’s
product distribution expenses.

·

In
the third quarter of 2006, United announced the addition of 22 new flights from
Washington Dulles, which increased departures from Dulles by 14 percent in the
fall of 2006 as compared to the fall of 2005. In early 2007, the DOT awarded
United the route between Washington Dulles-Beijing and this nonstop service
will commence on March 28, 2007. The Company plans to reallocate existing
aircraft to serve this new route.

·

The
Company continues to identify and implement continuous improvement programs,
and is actively training key employees in continuous improvement strategies and
techniques. These include such initiatives as optimization of aircraft and
airport facilities and selected outsourcing of activities to more
cost-effective service providers. The Company expects that these programs, as
well as the aforementioned expense reduction programs, will produce economic
benefits which will be necessary to mitigate inflationary cost pressures in
other categories of operating expenses, such as airport usage fees, aircraft
maintenance, and employee healthcare benefits, among others.

Financial Results.

Upon UAL’s emergence from
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, the Company adopted fresh-start reporting in
accordance with SOP 90-7. Thus, the consolidated financial statements
before February 1, 2006 reflect results based upon the historical cost
basis of the Company while the post-emergence consolidated financial statements
reflect the new basis of accounting, which incorporates fair value adjustments
recorded from the application of SOP 90-7. Therefore, financial
statements for the post-emergence periods are not comparable to the
pre-emergence period financial statements. The adoption of fresh-start
reporting had a significantly negative impact on the Company’s results of
operations. The significant differences in accounting results are discussed
under “Fresh-Start Reporting,” below.

For purposes of providing management’s year-over-year
discussions of UAL’s financial condition and results of operations, management
has compared the combined 2006 annual results consisting of the Successor
Company’s results for the eleven months ended December 31, 2006 and the
Predecessor Company’s January 2006 results, to the Predecessor Company’s
annual 2005 and 2004 results. References to “Successor Company” refer to UAL on
or after February 1, 2006, after giving effect to the adoption of
fresh-start reporting. References to “Predecessor Company” refer to UAL before
its exit from bankruptcy on February 1, 2006.


The
table below presents a reconciliation of the Company’s net income (loss) to net
income (loss), excluding reorganization items for the three years ended December 31,
2006. Presentation of results for the combined twelve month period of 2006, as
described in the preceding paragraph, and the presentation of net income
excluding reorganization items, are non-GAAP measures. However, the Company
believes that these year-over-year comparisons of the results of operations, as
shown in the table below, provide management and investors a useful perspective
of the Company’s core business and on-going operational and financial
performance and trends, since reorganization items pertain to accounting for
the effects of the bankruptcy restructuring and are not recurring. In addition,
the combined twelve month period of 2006 is presented to improve comparability
with the full years of 2005 and 2004.

The combined period
includes the results for one month ended January 31, 2006 (Predecessor
Company) and eleven months ended December 31, 2006 (Successor
Company).

The Company’s improved results of operations in 2006,
as compared with 2005 and 2004, were influenced by a number of significant
factors, including fresh-start reporting and other factors that are described
below.

Fresh-Start
Reporting.

Under fresh-start
reporting at the Effective Date, the Company’s asset values were remeasured
using fair value, and were allocated in conformity with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 141,

“Business Combinations”

(“SFAS 141”). The excess of reorganization value over the net fair value of
tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities was recorded as
goodwill. In addition, fresh-start accounting also requires that all assets and
liabilities be stated at fair value or at the present values of the amounts to
be paid using appropriate market interest rates, except for deferred taxes,
which are accounted for in conformity with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 109

“Accounting for Income
Taxes”

(“SFAS 109”). The Company’s results in 2006 were
significantly impacted by fresh-start reporting and other non-cash expenses;
the most significant impacts are discussed below.

·

As
part of fresh-start reporting the Company changed its accounting for Mileage
Plus from the incremental cost model to the deferred revenue model. Under the
incremental cost method, the estimated liability was based on incremental costs
and adjustments were made to both operating revenues and advertising expense. Under
the deferred revenue model a portion of ticket revenue from Mileage Plus
members, and other qualifying mileage transactions, is allocated to deferred
revenue at fair value to reflect the Company’s obligation for future award
redemptions. This change in accounting negatively impacted the Company’s
operating revenues by approximately $158 million in 2006 as compared to 2005.  The negative revenue impact was partially
offset by a reduction in advertising expense of approximately $27 million which
the Company estimates would have been recorded if the incremental cost method
had been continued. Mileage Plus accounting is discussed further in “Critical
Accounting Policies,” below.


·

The
Company recorded non-cash share-based compensation expense of $159 million in
2006 in association with its MEIP and DEIP plans as approved under the Plan of
Reorganization. This expense was not recognized in 2005 and 2004, because prior
to 2006 the Company accounted for its share-based compensation plans under the
intrinsic method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
“

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.

”

·

In
2006, the Company recognized non-cash depreciation and amortization charges of
$74 million on assets that were recorded at fair value as part of fresh-start
reporting, including definite-lived intangible assets that were recognized
under fresh-start accounting. UAL did not recognize similar asset values or
related amortization expense in the preceding annual periods.

·

The
adjustment of the Company’s postretirement plan liabilities to fair value at
fresh-start resulted in the elimination of unrecognized prior service credits
and actuarial losses for its non-pension postretirement plan. The elimination
of these unrecognized items negatively impacted the Company’s 2006 expenses by
approximately $51 million.

·

Aircraft
rent was negatively impacted by approximately $101 million. This included an
unfavorable impact of $66 million related to deferred gains on pre-emergence
sale-leaseback transactions that were eliminated as part of fresh-start
reporting. Before fresh-start reporting, these deferred gains were being
amortized into earnings over the lease terms as a reduction of the related
aircraft rent expense.  Also due to the
restructuring of aircraft financings in bankruptcy, the Company’s operating
leases were at average rates below market value; therefore, a deferred charge
was recorded to adjust these leases to fair value. Amortization of this
deferred charge resulted in additional rent expense of approximately $35
million in 2006.

·

The
Company recognized additional non-cash interest expense of approximately $51
million for the amortization of debt and capital lease obligation discounts
that were recorded upon its emergence from bankruptcy to adjust its debt and
capital lease obligations to fair value.

·

At
UAL’s emergence from bankruptcy, there were certain unresolved matters which
are considered to be preconfirmation contingencies. The Company initially
recorded an obligation for its best estimate of the amounts it expected to pay
to resolve these matters.  Adjustments to
these initial estimates are recorded in current results of operations. The most
significant of these were classified as Special items in the Company’s 2006

Statement of Consolidated Operations

and include a net
benefit of $12 million related to the San Francisco International Airport (“SFO”)
and Los Angeles International Airport (“LAX”) municipal bond obligations and a
benefit of $24 million related to the termination of certain of the Company’s
non-qualified pension plans. The Company adjusted its estimated liabilities for
these preconfirmation contingencies during the eleven months ended December 31,
2006 to the amounts the Company now believes to be probable based on court
rulings and other updated information. In addition to the special items
previously noted, other accruals and accrual adjustments provided an additional
net benefit of approximately $29 million to 2006 operating expenses. See Note
1, “Voluntary Reorganization Under Chapter 11—Claims Resolution Process,” in
the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

for additional information related to these adjustments.

Other Factors.

·

Operating
revenues increased $2.0 billion, or 11%, in 2006 as compared to 2005 and by
$2.9 billion, or 18%, in 2006 as compared to 2004. Revenues increased in 2006
and 2005 largely due to passenger revenue growth from United’s improved
worldwide airline network performance and a more healthy revenue environment
for United and the airline industry, which was significantly aided by
constrained industry capacity growth during these periods. However, United’s
passenger revenue growth rate has slowed in the latter part of 2006, with the
2006 fourth quarter operating


revenues increasing 5%
over the same quarter in 2005, as compared to a growth rate of 10% in the
fourth quarter of 2005 over the same quarter in 2004. Fourth quarter revenues
in 2006 were also negatively impacted by severe winter storms in Denver and
Chicago, as discussed below. These revenues were also adversely affected by
Mileage Plus accounting in 2006 as discussed above.

·

United
Express contributed $77 million to operating income in 2006 as compared to
negative contributions to operating results of $317 million in 2005 and $494
million in 2004. This improvement is due to an improved regional operations
cost structure resulting from the bankruptcy reorganization, network
optimization similar to that achieved for the mainline operation, and the
replacement of some 50-seat regional jets with 70-seat regional
jets providing both first class and Economy Plus service, among other factors.

·

Mainline
fuel costs have significantly trended upward since 2004, increasing by $792
million between 2005 and 2006, and by $1.9 billion between 2004 and 2006. These
increases are primarily due to significant increases in market prices for jet
fuel. The Company’s average cost per gallon for jet fuel, including taxes and
hedge impacts, increased from approximately $1.25 in 2004, to $1.79 in 2005,
and to $2.11 in 2006. Similar increases were experienced in the average cost
per gallon of jet fuel for United Express between periods, which is classified
as Regional affiliates expense in the

Statements of Consolidated
Operations

.

·

Aircraft
maintenance materials and outside repairs expense increased $128 million, or
15%, in 2006 as compared to 2005, and by $262 million, or 35%, in 2006 as
compared to 2004. As further discussed in the “Results of Operations” section
below, these increases are due to several factors, including higher volumes of
outsourced maintenance, increased rates under certain long-term maintenance
contracts and aging engines within United’s fleet.

·

Interest
expense increased $288 million in 2006 as compared to 2005, and by $321 million
as compared to 2004, primarily due to increased debt outstanding of
approximately $1.4 billion as a result of the Company’s new capital structure
resulting from its emergence from bankruptcy on February 1, 2006 and the
fresh-start reporting adjustments discussed above. The increased interest
expense was partially offset by increased interest income of $211 million in
2006, as compared to 2005. The Predecessor Company included $6 million and $60
million of interest income in reorganization items, net in accordance with SOP
90-7, for January 2006 and calendar-year 2005, respectively.

·

The
January 2006 reorganization income of approximately $22.9 billion
primarily relates to the discharge of liabilities and other fresh-start
adjustments recorded in connection with the Company’s implementation of the
Plan of Reorganization preparatory to its emergence from bankruptcy. In 2005,
the reorganization charges of approximately $20.6 billion were primarily for
pension, employee-related, and aircraft claim charges of $8.9 billion, $6.5
billion and $3.0 billion, respectively. For additional information, see Note 1,
“Voluntary Reorganization Under Chapter 11—Financial Statement
Presentation,” in the

Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements

.

Liquidity.

As of December 31, 2006,
the Company had total cash, including restricted cash and short-term
investments, of $5.0 billion. The Company’s strong cash position resulted from
its recapitalization upon emergence from bankruptcy, together with strong
operating cash flows of $1.6 billion in 2006, as compared to $1.1 billion in
2005 and $0.1 billion in 2004.

As noted above, in February 2007, the Company
reduced its cash by approximately $1.0 billion to a level that it believes is
more optimal for its capital structure. The cash was used to prepay a portion
of the Company’s Credit Facility, which accordingly reduced debt by $972
million. As part of this transaction, the Company entered into the Amended
Credit Facility consisting of an amended and restated revolving credit, term
loan and guaranty agreement of $2.1 billion.


The Company has significant contractual cash payment
obligations associated with debt, aircraft leases and aircraft purchase
commitments, among others. See the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section,
below, for further information related to the Amended Credit Facility and the
Company’s contractual obligations.

Contingencies.

During the course of its
Chapter 11 proceedings, the Company successfully reached settlements with most
of its creditors and resolved most pending claims against the Debtors. The
following discussion provides a summary of the material matters yet to be resolved
in the Bankruptcy Court, as well as other contingencies. For further
information on these matters, see Note 1, “Voluntary Reorganization Under
Chapter 11 - Bankruptcy Considerations” and Note 15, “Commitments, Contingent
Liabilities and Uncertainties,” in the

Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements

.

Municipal
Bond Obligations.

The Company is a party to
numerous long-term agreements to lease certain airport and maintenance
facilities that are financed through tax-exempt municipal bonds issued by
various local municipalities to build or improve airport and maintenance
facilities. As a result of the Company’s bankruptcy filing, United was not
permitted to make payments on unsecured pre-petition debt. The Company had been
advised that these municipal bonds may have been unsecured (or in certain
instances, partially secured) pre-petition debt. Therefore, through the
bankruptcy process, the Company either settled or rejected certain pre-petition
debt associated with the municipal bonds. In 2006, certain of the Company’s
municipal bond obligations relating to JFK, LAX and SFO have been conclusively
adjudicated through the Bankruptcy Court as financings and not true leases,
while the bonds relating to Denver International Airport (“DEN”) have been
conclusively adjudicated as a true lease. The Company has guaranteed $261
million of the DEN bonds as discussed in

Capital Commitments and
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

below. There remains pending
litigation to determine the value of the security interests, if any, that the
bondholders at LAX and SFO have in the underlying UAL leaseholds.

Pension
Benefit Terminations.

In June 2006, the
District Court entered an order approving the termination of the United
Airlines Pilot Defined Benefit Pension Plan (“Pilot Plan”). ALPA, United
Retired Pilots Benefit Protection Association (“URPBPA”) and the PBGC each
filed appeals with the Court of Appeals. On October 25, 2006, the Court of
Appeals affirmed the District Court’s order approving the termination of the
Pilot Plan effective December 30, 2004. Both ALPA and URPBPA have filed petitions
for writ of certiorari from the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has yet to rule on
either petition.

If the termination order is ultimately reversed by the
Supreme Court and it results in the reversal of the termination of one or more
of the Company’s previously defined benefit pension plans, it could have a
materially adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and financial
condition.

There is also a dispute with respect to the continuing
obligation of United to pay non-qualified pension benefits to retired pilots
pending settlement of the involuntary termination proceeding. On October 6,
2005, the Bankruptcy Court ruled that the Company was obligated to make payment
of all non-qualified pension benefits for October 2005. During the first
quarter of 2006, the District Court dismissed the Company’s appeal of the
Bankruptcy Court’s October 6, 2005 order in light of its earlier decision
reversing the Bankruptcy Court’s termination order. On October 25, 2006,
the Court of Appeals reversed the District Court’s order dismissing for lack of
ripeness the Company’s appeal of the Bankruptcy Court’s October 6, 2005
order and remanded the case with instructions to reverse the Bankruptcy Court’s
order compelling payment of non-qualified benefits for October 2005. On November 6, 2006, ALPA filed a
petition for rehearing on the Court of Appeals reversal of the October 6,
2005 order. Both ALPA and URPBPA filed petitions for writ of certiorari
from the Supreme Court on this issue. The Supreme Court has yet to rule on
either petition.


In March 2006, the Bankruptcy Court ruled that
the Company was obligated to make payment of all pilot non-qualified pension
benefits for the months of November and December 2005 and
January 2006. The Bankruptcy Court also ruled that the Company’s obligation
to pay pilot non-qualified pension benefits ceased as of January 31, 2006.
The Company filed a notice of appeal of the Bankruptcy Court’s ruling to the
District Court. URPBPA and ALPA also filed notices of appeal with respect to
the Bankruptcy Court’s order, which were subsequently consolidated with the
Company’s appeal. United agreed with URPBPA and ALPA to pay into an escrow
account the disputed non-qualified pension benefits for the months of
November and December 2005 and January 2006, an aggregate amount
totaling approximately $17 million. The District Court affirmed the Bankruptcy
Court’s ruling in September 2006. The Company filed a notice of appeal of
the District Court’s ruling to the Court of Appeals. URPBPA and ALPA also
appealed the District Court’s decision. The Company subsequently filed a motion
to consolidate its appeal from the Bankruptcy Court’s October 2005
non-qualified benefits order with the three appeals from the Bankruptcy Court’s
March 2006 non-qualified benefits order. The Court of Appeals denied the
Company’s motion, but issued an order staying briefing on the March 2006
non-qualified benefits order until further order of the Court of Appeals. In
light of the Court of Appeals’ October 25, 2006 decision described above, the
Company is reasonably optimistic of a successful outcome of its appeal in this
matter, although there can be no assurances that the ultimate outcome of this
appeal will be favorable to the Company.

Legal
and Environmental.

UAL has
certain contingencies resulting from litigation and claims (including
environmental issues) incident to the ordinary course of business. Management
believes, after considering a number of factors, including (but not limited to)
the views of legal counsel, the nature of contingencies to which the Company is
subject and prior experience, that the ultimate disposition of these
contingencies will not materially affect the Company’s consolidated financial
position or results of operations. When appropriate, the Company accrues for
these matters based on its assessments of the likely outcomes of their eventual
disposition. The amounts of these liabilities could increase or decrease in the
near term, based on revisions to estimates relating to the various claims.

New regulations surrounding the emission of greenhouse
gases (such as carbon dioxide) are being considered for promulgation both
internationally and within the United States. The Company will be carefully
evaluating the potential impact of such proposed regulations.

The Company anticipates
that if ultimately found liable, its damages from claims arising from the
events of September 11, 2001, could be significant; however, the Company
believes that, under the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act
of 2001, its liability will be limited to its insurance coverage.

Results of Operations

As described in the “Overview” section above,
presentation of the combined twelve month period of 2006 is a non-GAAP measure;
however, management believes it is useful for comparison with the full years of
2005 and 2004.

The air travel business is subject to seasonal
fluctuations. The Company’s operations can be adversely impacted by severe
weather and its first and fourth quarter results normally reflect lower travel
demand. Historically, because of these seasonal factors, results of operations
are better in the second and third quarters.

Earnings from operations
increased $666 million to $447 million in 2006 as compared to a loss from
operations of $219 million in 2005. Excluding reorganization items, the net
loss was $58 million in 2006 which represents an improvement of $517 million
over the net loss in 2005 of $575 million. These improvements are due to the
net impact of the items discussed below, among other factors. See Note 1, “Voluntary
Reorganization Under Chapter 11—Financial Statement Presentation,” in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

for further
information on reorganization items.

(a)

The combined 2006 period includes the results for one
month ended January 31, 2006 (Predecessor Company) and eleven
months ended December 31, 2006 (Successor Company).

Strong demand, industry capacity restraint, yield
improvements, United’s resource optimization initiatives, and ongoing airline
network optimization all contributed to a $2.0 billion increase in total
operating revenue to $19.3 billion in 2006. The 11% mainline passenger
revenue increase was due to both increased traffic and higher average ticket
prices; United reported a 3% increase in mainline traffic on a 2% increase in
capacity and an 8% increase in yield. Severe winter storms in December 2006
at the Chicago and Denver hubs, which resulted in the cancellation of
approximately 3,900 United and United Express flights at these locations, had
the estimated impact of reducing revenue by $40 million and reducing total
expenses by $11 million. As discussed in “Critical Accounting Policies,” below,
the Company changed the accounting for its frequent flyer obligation to a
deferred revenue model upon its emergence from bankruptcy which negatively
impacted revenues by $158 million. This resulted in increased deferred revenue
due to a net increase in miles earned by Mileage Plus customers that will be
redeemed in future years.

The 19% increase in regional affiliate revenues was
also due to traffic and yield improvements as indicated in the table below.

The increase in cargo revenue was primarily due to
improved yield, which was partially due to higher fuel surcharges between
periods.

Consolidated operating revenues increased $988
million, or 6%, in 2005 as compared to 2004 and mainline RASM increased 7% from
9.95 cents to 10.66 cents. Mainline passenger revenues increased $372 million,
or 3%, due to a 4% increase in yield slightly offset by a decline in RPMs of 1%.
ASMs decreased 3%; however, passenger load factor increased 2.2 points to
81.4%.

Passenger revenues—Regional Affiliates increased $498
million, or 26%, in 2005 as compared to 2004 mainly due to increased volume of
United Express regional carrier flying. Cargo revenues increased $25 million,
or 4%, in 2005 as compared to 2004 due to a 1% increase in cargo ton miles
combined with a 2% increase in cargo yield. Other operating revenues increased
$93 million, or 8%, primarily due to increases in third-party maintenance
revenues and ULS revenues, partially offset by a decrease in United Airlines
Fuel Corporation (“UAFC”) fuel sales to third parties.

(a)

The combined period includes the results for one month
ended January 31, 2006 (Predecessor Company) and eleven months ended December 31,
2006 (Successor Company).

In 2006, United implemented a resource optimization
initiative that increased the number of mainline ASMs by 1% and United Express
ASMs by 3%, for a consolidated ASM impact of 2%, without the use of additional
aircraft. In addition to generating increased revenue, this contributed to
additional variable expenses such as fuel, salaries, and other expense items.

Higher fuel costs have had a significantly adverse
effect on the Company’s operating expenses in 2006 as compared to 2005. In
2006, mainline aircraft fuel expense increased 20% due to an increase in
average mainline fuel cost from $1.79 per gallon in 2005 to $2.11 per gallon in
2006, while fuel consumption increased 2% on a similar increase in mainline
capacity. The Company recognized a net fuel hedge loss of $26 million in
aircraft fuel expense in 2006, which is included in the $2.11 per gallon
average cost, whereas in 2005 most fuel hedging gains and losses were recorded
in non-operating income and expense. In 2005, the Company recorded $40 million
of fuel hedging gains in non-operating income, as discussed below.

Salaries and related costs increased $240 million, or
6%, in 2006 as compared to the prior year. In 2006 the Company recorded
$159 million of expense, representing 4% of the increase in salaries and
related costs, for the Successor Company’s share-based compensation plans
because of the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123
(Revised 2004),

“Share-Based Payment,”

effective January 1,
2006. In addition, the Company incurred an additional $26 million related to
employee performance incentive programs in 2006 as compared to 2005. The
Company also recorded $64 million in higher postretirement expenses and $35
million in higher medical and dental expenses in 2006 than in 2005. Salaries
also increased due to merit increases awarded to employees in 2006, which were
infrequent throughout bankruptcy. These cost increases were partially offset by
a 6% year-over-year improvement in


labor productivity
resulting from the Company’s continuous improvement efforts, together with
selective outsourcing of certain non-core functions. In 2006, the Company
achieved its goal to reduce 1,000 management and administrative positions.

The Company’s most significant regional affiliate
expenses are capacity payments to the regional carriers and fuel expense. Fuel
accounted for 30% of the Company’s regional affiliate expense in 2006, as
compared to 26% in 2005. Fuel cost increased due to increased market prices for
jet fuel, as discussed above, and increased fuel consumption from higher
capacity. The Company’s regional affiliate expense increased only 3% despite a
9% increase in capacity due to the benefits of restructured lower-cost regional
carrier capacity agreements in 2006 along with regional carrier network
optimization and the replacement of some 50-seat regional jets with 70-seat
regional jets. The 3% increase in regional affiliates expense includes an 18%
increase in fuel costs. See Note 2(i), “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies—United
Express,” in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

for further discussion of the Regional affiliates expense.

Purchased services increased $205 million, or
14%, in 2006, as compared to 2005, primarily due to an increase of approximately
$120 million in outsourcing costs for various non-core work activities; a
$31 million increase in certain professional fees, which were classified
as reorganization expenses by the Predecessor Company; and a $24 million
increase in credit card fees due to higher passenger revenues. The offsetting
benefits of higher outsourcing costs are reflected in a 4% reduction in
manpower associated with the 6% labor productivity improvement noted for
salaries and related costs.

In 2006, aircraft maintenance materials and outside
repairs expense increased $128 million, or 15%, from 2005 primarily due to
engine-related maintenance rate increases as well as increased volume.

As discussed in Note 1, “Voluntary Reorganization
Under Chapter 11—Fresh-Start Reporting,” in the

Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements

, the Company revalued its assets
and liabilities to estimated fair values. In 2006, amortization expense
increased $162 million due to the recognition of $453 million of
additional definite-lived intangible assets; however, this increase was offset
by decreased depreciation expense from fresh-start reporting adjustments that
significantly reduced depreciable tangible asset book values to fair value. The
impact of the decrease in tangible asset valuation was significant as
depreciation and amortization only increased $32 million despite the $162
million increase in intangible asset amortization and incremental depreciation
on post-emergence property additions.

Other operating expense decreased $104 million in
2006, as compared to 2005. The adoption of fresh-start reporting, which
included the revaluation of the Company’s frequent flyer obligation to
estimated fair value and the change in accounting policy to a deferred revenue
model for the Successor Company reduced other expense by $27 million. For
periods on or after February 1, 2006, adjustments to the frequent flyer
obligation are recorded to passenger and other operating revenues, whereas
periodic adjustments under the Predecessor Company’s incremental cost basis
were recognized in both operating revenues and other operating expense. See “Critical
Accounting Policies,” below, for further details. Various cost savings
initiatives also reduced the Company’s costs in 2006 as compared to 2005.

In 2006, the Company recognized a net benefit of
approximately $36 million to operating expense resulting from the resolution of
preconfirmation contingencies for the estimated liability for SFO and LAX
municipal bond obligations, and favorable adjustments to preconfirmation contingencies
related to the pilots non-qualified pension plan. In 2005, the Company
recognized a charge of $18 million for aircraft impairments related to the
planned accelerated retirement of certain aircraft. See Note 19, “Special
Items,” in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

for further information.

Overall, operating
expense increased only 2% in 2005 from 2004. The significant changes from 2004
to 2005 included:

·

A
$1.1 billion, or 37%, increase in aircraft fuel expense was primarily due to a
43% increase in the average cost of fuel (including tax and hedge impact),
partially offset by a 4% decrease in consumption.

·

Salaries
and related costs decreased by $1.0 billion, or 20%, primarily due to cost
savings associated with lower salaries and benefits as well as lower full-time
equivalent employees. The decrease in salaries and related costs was driven by
wage and benefit concessions resulting from negotiations with employees and
productivity improvements.

·

Regional
affiliates increased $321 million primarily as a result of increased fuel costs
and volumes of United Express regional carrier flying, partially offset by new
and amended contract savings.

·

A
$134 million increase in aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs
resulted primarily from higher levels of purchased maintenance activity. This
increase was partially offset by certain productivity and labor rate
improvements, the effects of which are reflected in salaries and related costs.

·

A $131 million decrease in
aircraft rent was due to the restructuring of aircraft lease obligations and
fleet reductions.

The Company incurred a
$288 million increase in interest expense, which was partly due to the
higher outstanding principal balance of the Credit Facility for the Successor
Company, as compared to the lower DIP Financing balance for the Predecessor
Company. Interest expense in 2006 was also unfavorably impacted by the
associated amortization of various discounts which were recorded on debt
instruments and capital leases to record these obligations at fair value upon
the adoption of fresh-start reporting. Interest income increased $211 million
year-over-year, reflecting a higher cash balance in 2006, as well as higher
rates of return on certain investments. Interest income also increased due to
the classification of most interest income in 2005 as reorganization expense in
accordance with SOP 90-7. In 2005, the Company recorded $40 million
of fuel hedge gains which did not qualify for hedge accounting in non-operating
income, while in 2006 the $26 million net realized and unrealized loss
from economic fuel hedges was recognized in aircraft fuel expense.

The Company reported a gain of $158 million from the
sale of its investment in Orbitz in 2004. In addition, an increase in interest
expense of $33 million, or 7%, in 2005 was due to higher interest and fees
applicable to the increased outstanding debt on the DIP Financing between
periods. The Company recorded $40 million of fuel hedge gains in Miscellaneous,
net in 2005 since they did not qualify for hedge accounting. There were no
significant fuel hedge gains or losses included in Miscellaneous, net in 2004. In


2005, the other
significant item that was included in Miscellaneous, net was approximately $25
million of foreign currency transaction gains from the revaluation of certain
foreign currency denominated debt and pension obligations.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Liquidity.

UAL’s total of cash and cash
equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments was $5.0 billion and $2.8
billion at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, including restricted
cash of $847 million and $957 million, respectively. At December 31,
2006, the Company reclassified $972 million of its long-term debt to current
maturities to reflect its intent to prepay a portion of the Credit Facility. In
February 2007, the Company reduced its cash position by $972 million
through the prepayment of part of its Credit Facility debt. This debt
prepayment reduced the Company’s cash balance to a level that it believes is
more optimal. In addition, certain terms of the Credit Facility were amended in
February 2007. The Amended Credit Facility consists of a $1.8 billion term
loan and a $255 million revolving commitment. At the Company’s option, interest
payments are based on either a base rate, as defined in the Amended Credit
Facility, or at LIBOR plus 2%. This applicable margin on LIBOR rate loans is a
significant reduction of 1.75% from the Credit Facility. The Amended Credit
Facility frees up a significant amount of assets that had been pledged as
collateral under the Credit Facility. See the “Capital Commitments and
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements” section, below, for information related to
scheduled maturities on the Amended Credit Facility. In January 2007, the
Company decided to terminate the interest rate swap that had been used to hedge
the future interest payments under the original Credit Facility term loan of
$2.45 billion. In the first quarter of 2007, the Company expects to
expense approximately $16 million of deferred financing costs related to the
prepaid portion of the Credit Facility.

Restricted cash primarily
represents cash collateral to secure workers’ compensation obligations,
security deposits for airport leases and reserves with institutions that process
United’s credit card ticket sales. Certain of the credit card processing
arrangements are based on the aggregate then-outstanding bank card air traffic
liability, the Company’s credit rating and its compliance with certain debt
covenants. Credit rating downgrades or debt covenant noncompliance could
materially increase the Company’s reserve requirements.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities.

2006 compared to

The Company generated cash from operations of $1.6
billion in 2006 compared to $1.1 billion in 2005. The higher operating cash
flow generated in 2006 was due to improved results of operations as discussed
above in the “Results of Operation” section, together with differences in the
timing and amount of working capital items, and other smaller changes. As
discussed in the “Fresh-Start Reporting” section, above, UAL’s 2006 net income
includes significant non-cash items.

The Company does not have
any significant defined benefit pension plan contribution requirements as most
of the Company-sponsored plans were replaced with defined contribution plans
upon its emergence from bankruptcy. The Company contributed approximately $259
million and $11 million to its defined contribution plans and non-U.S. pension
plans, respectively, in the eleven months ended December 31, 2006.


2005 compared to

For the year ended December 31, 2005, UAL
generated cash from operations of $1.1 billion, a $980 million increase
over cash generated from operations of $99 million in 2004. The higher
operating cash generated in 2005 was largely due to improved results of
operations, together with increased advanced ticket sales and differences in
amounts and timing of other working capital changes.

The Company contributed
$127 million towards its U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2004, but
made no such cash contributions in 2006 or 2005. The Company contributed $61
million and $75 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively, largely towards
its non-U.S. pension plans and its U.S. non-qualified pension plans. Detailed
information regarding the Company’s pension plans is included in Note 8,
“Retirement and Postretirement Plans,” in the

Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements

.

Cash Flows from Investing Activities.

2006 Compared to

Cash used by investing activities was $250 million in
2006 as compared to $291 million in 2005. Cash released from segregated funds
after exit from bankruptcy in 2006 provided $200 million in cash proceeds, and
the sale of the subsidiary MyPoints.com, Inc. in 2006 generated an
additional $56 million in cash proceeds. Cash used for increases in short-term
investments in 2006 was $235 million, as compared to $1 million provided
from the sale of short-term investments in 2005. A reduction in restricted cash
balances provided $110 million of cash proceeds in 2006, as compared to cash
used to increase restricted cash of $80 million in 2005. Required restricted
cash balances in 2006 have decreased slightly from 2005 as a result of the
Company’s emergence from bankruptcy, among other factors.

In 2006, the Company did
not reject or return any aircraft under Section 1110 of the Bankruptcy
Code, although the sale of nine non-operating B767-200 aircraft during
this period provided $19 million in cash proceeds from the disposition of
property and equipment. The Company used $362 million in cash for the
acquisition of property and equipment in 2006, as compared to $470 million in
2005.

2005 Compared to

Overall, cash used in investing activities of $291
million in 2005 was comparable to cash used of $296 million in 2004.

The Company sold ten B727, five B737 and seven B767
aircraft and rejected or returned to the financiers 30 B737 aircraft, ten B767
aircraft and one B747 aircraft under Section 1110 of the Bankruptcy Code
in 2005. The Company then reacquired eight of the previously-returned B767
aircraft, of which four were purchased by the Company from the Public Debt
Group and subsequently sold to a third-party and simultaneously leased back,
and of which four were acquired directly by a third-party from the Public Debt
Group and subsequently leased to the Company. In addition, the Company, as part
of its agreement with the Public Debt Group, purchased six additional B767
aircraft from the Public Debt Group, which were subsequently sold to and leased
back from third parties.

During 2004, the Company
received $218 million from the sales of its investments in Orbitz and Air
Canada, and used $198 million to provide increased cash deposits classified as
restricted, and $267 million for the acquisition of property and equipment.


Cash Flows from Financing Activities.

2006 Compared to

Cash generated through financing activities was $782
million in 2006 compared to cash used of $110 million in 2005. In 2006,
the Company made principal payments under long-term debt and capital lease obligations
totaling $2.1 billion, which included $1.2 billion for the repayment of the DIP
Financing.

In 2006, the Company obtained access to up to $3.0
billion in secured exit financing which consisted of a $2.45 billion term loan,
a $350 million delayed draw term loan and a $200 million revolving credit line.
On the Effective Date, $2.45 billion of the $2.8 billion term loan and the
entire revolving credit line was drawn and used to repay the DIP Financing and
to make other payments required upon exit from bankruptcy, as well as to
provide ongoing liquidity to conduct post-reorganization operations.
Subsequently, the Company repaid borrowings under the revolving credit line and
accessed the remaining $350 million on the delayed draw term loan. For further
details on the Credit Facility, see Note 11, “Debt Obligations,” in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

. At December 31,
2006, the Company had a total of $2.8 billion of debt and $63 million in
letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Facility.

During 2006, the Company secured control of 14
aircraft that were included in the 1997-1 EETC transaction by remitting
$281 million to the 1997-1 EETC trustee on behalf of the holders of the
Tranche A certificates. The Company subsequently refinanced the 14 aircraft on March 28,
2006 with the $350 million delayed draw term loan provided under the
Credit Facility. The 14 aircraft are comprised of four B737 aircraft, two B747
aircraft, four B777 aircraft and four A320 aircraft.

Significant 2006 non-cash
financing and investment activities included the conversion of six B757
aircraft and one B747 aircraft from leased to owned status resulting in
additional aircraft assets and debt obligations of $242 million. The Company
completed definitive documentation for this transaction in July 2006, as
discussed in Note 1—“Voluntary Reorganization Under Chapter 11—Bankruptcy
Considerations,” in the

Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements

. In addition, in the first quarter of 2006 the
Successor Company completed a transaction that converted certain mortgaged
aircraft to capital leases for $137 million. See Note 17, “Statement of
Consolidated Cash Flows—Supplemental Disclosures,” in the

Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements

.

2005 Compared to

Cash used in financing activities was $110 million in
2005 compared to $72 million in 2004. During 2005, the Company made principal
payments under long-term debt, DIP Financing, and capital lease obligations of
$285 million, $16 million, and $94 million, respectively.  The total cash used for these payments was
$395 million in 2005, as compared to total cash used of $737 million for
principal payments under debt and capital lease obligations in 2004. In 2005 as
compared to 2004, a decrease of $203 million in proceeds from the DIP financing
offset the significant decrease in principal payments.

During 2005, the Company made $16 million in principal
payments on the DIP Financing. In addition, the Company renegotiated and
expanded its DIP Financing facility, allowing it to borrow an additional $310
million during 2005. The amended DIP Financing facility also permitted the
Company to make capital expenditures not exceeding $750 million towards
aircraft acquisitions, with cash expenditures for such acquisitions not to
exceed $300 million. This capital expenditures basket was created primarily to
allow the Company to purchase certain aircraft that were controlled by the
Public Debt Group, all of which were already in its fleet or had been in its
fleet in the recent past. The Company raised $253 million in connection with
the subsequent long-term financing of ten of the B767 aircraft acquired from
the Public Debt Group.

Capital Commitments
and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements.

UAL’s business is very capital
intensive, requiring significant amounts of capital to fund the acquisition of
assets, particularly aircraft. In the past,


the Company has funded the
acquisition of aircraft through outright purchase, by issuing debt, by entering
into capital or operating leases, or through vendor financings. The Company
also often enters into long-term lease commitments with airports to ensure
access to terminal, cargo, maintenance and other required facilities.

Facility in February 2007, as this was not a contractual obligation at December 31,
2006).

(b)

Future interest payments on variable rate debt are

for aircraft.

(d)

Amounts represent lease payments that are made by
United under capacity agreements with the regional carriers who operate these
aircraft on United’s behalf.

(e)

Amounts represent postretirement benefit payments, net
of subsidy receipts, through 2016. Benefit payments approximate plan
contributions as plans are substantially unfunded. Not included in the table
above are contributions related to the Company’s foreign pension plans. The
Company does not have any significant contributions required by government
regulations. The Company’s expected pension plan contributions for 2007 are $14
million.

(f)

Amounts are principally for aircraft and exclude
advance payments. The Company has the right to cancel its commitments for the
purchase of A319 and A320 aircraft; however, such action could cause the
forfeiture of $91 million of advance payments.

In February 2007, the Company prepaid $972
million on the Credit Facility and amended certain of its terms. This
prepayment increases (decreases) the Company’s expected debt payments in the
table above by $972 million in 2007, $(10) million in each of the years
2008 through 2011 and $(932) million thereafter. The prepayment and amendment
of interest rate terms increases (decreases) the Company’s total expected
interest payments, as reported in the table above, by $(82) million in one year
or less, $(252) million in combined years two and three, $(243) million in
combined years four and five and $703 million after five years. Interest
payments in the after five years period are higher because the Amended Credit
Facility matures in 2014 while the Credit Facility would have matured in 2012
based on its original terms.


See Note 2(i), “Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies—United Express,” Note 8, “Retirement and Postretirement Plans,” Note
11, “Debt Obligations,” and Note 16, “Lease Obligations,” in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

for additional
discussion of these items.

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements.

An off-balance sheet
arrangement is any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement
involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has (1) made
guarantees, (2) a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets,
(3) an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity or (4) any
obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated
entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support
to the company, or that engages in leasing, hedging or research and development
arrangements with the company. The Company’s off-balance sheet arrangements
include operating leases, which are summarized in the contractual obligations
table, above, and certain municipal bond obligations as discussed below.

Certain municipalities issued municipal bonds on
behalf of United to finance the construction of improvements at airport-related
facilities. The Company also leases facilities at airports where municipal
bonds funded at least some of the construction of airport-related projects. At December 31,
2006, the Company guaranteed interest and principal payments on $261 million in
principal of such bonds that were issued in 1992 and are due in 2032 unless the
Company elects not to extend its lease in which case the bonds are due in 2023.
The outstanding bonds and related guarantee are not recorded in the Company’s

Statements of Consolidated Financial Position

in accordance
with GAAP. The related lease agreement is accounted for as an operating lease,
and the related rent expense is recorded on a straight-line basis. The annual
lease payments through 2023 and the final payment for the principal amount of
the bonds are included in the operating lease payments in the contractual
obligations table above. For further details, see Note 1 “Voluntary
Reorganization Under Chapter 11—Bankruptcy Considerations” and Note 15, “Commitments,
Contingent Liabilities and Uncertainties—Guarantees and Off-Balance Sheet
Financing,” in the

Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements

.

Fuel
Consortia.

The
Company participates in numerous fuel consortia with other carriers at major
airports to reduce the costs of fuel distribution and storage. Interline
agreements govern the rights and responsibilities of the consortia members and
provide for the allocation of the overall costs to operate the consortia based
on usage. The consortia (and in limited cases, the participating carriers) have
entered into long-term agreements to lease certain airport fuel storage and
distribution facilities that are typically financed through tax-exempt bonds
(either special facilities lease revenue bonds or general airport revenue
bonds), issued by various local municipalities. In general, each consortium
lease agreement requires the consortium to make lease payments in amounts
sufficient to pay the maturing principal and interest payments on the bonds. As
of December 31, 2006, approximately $484 million principal amount of such
bonds were secured by fuel facility leases at major hubs in which United
participates, as to which United and each of the signatory airlines has
provided indirect guarantees of the debt. United’s exposure is approximately
$171 million principal amount of such bonds based on its recent consortia
participation. The Company’s exposure could increase if the participation of
other carriers decreases. The guarantees will expire when the tax-exempt bonds
are paid in full, which ranges from 2010 to 2028. The Company did not record a
liability at the time these indirect guarantees were made.

Debt Covenants.

The Company was in compliance with the Credit
Facility covenants as of December 31, 2006. As part of the amendment to
the Credit Facility completed in February 2007, several covenants were
amended to provide the Company more flexibility. The Amended Credit Facility
contains covenants that will limit the ability of United and the Guarantors to,
among other things, incur or guarantee additional indebtedness, create liens,
pay dividends on or repurchase stock, make certain types of investments, pay
dividends or other payments from United’s direct or indirect subsidiaries,
enter into transactions with affiliates, sell assets or merge with other
companies, modify corporate documents or change lines of business. The Amended
Credit Facility also requires compliance with certain financial covenants.
Failure to comply with the covenants could result in a default under the
Amended Credit


Facility unless the
Company were to obtain a waiver of, or otherwise mitigate or cure, any such
default. Additionally, the Amended Credit Facility contains a cross-default
provision with respect to other credit arrangements that exceed $50 million. A
payment default could result in a termination of the Amended Credit Facility
and a requirement to accelerate repayment of all outstanding facility
borrowings. The Company believes that the combination of its existing cash and
cash flows generated by operations will be adequate to satisfy its projected
liquidity needs over the next twelve months. For further details about the
Amended Credit Facility and the associated covenants, see Note 11, “Debt
Obligations,” in the

Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements

.

Future Financing.

Substantially
all of the Company’s unencumbered assets were pledged to the Credit Facility as
of December 31, 2006. The Amended Credit Facility allowed the Company to
release certain assets with an estimated market value of approximately $2.5
billion from the Credit Facility collateral pool, which are now unencumbered.
The Amended Credit Facility does not place any specific restrictions on the
Company’s ability to issue debt secured by these newly unencumbered assets. In
addition, subject to the restrictions of its Amended Credit Facility, the
Company could raise additional capital by issuing unsecured debt, equity or
equity-like securities, monetizing or borrowing against certain assets or
refinancing existing obligations to generate net cash proceeds. However, the
availability and capacity of these funding sources cannot be assured or
predicted.

Credit Ratings.

As part of its exit from bankruptcy, United and UAL
received a corporate credit rating of B (outlook stable) from Standard &
Poor’s and a corporate family rating of B2 (outlook stable) from Moody’s
Investors Services. These credit ratings are below investment grade levels. Downgrades
from these rating levels could restrict the availability and/or increase the
cost of future financing for the Company.

Other Information

Foreign Operations.

The Company’s

Statements
of Consolidated Financial Position

reflect material amounts of
intangible assets related to the Company’s Pacific and Latin American route
authorities, and its hub at London’s Heathrow Airport. See Note 2(k), “Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies—Intangibles,” in the

Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements

for further information. Because
operating authorities in international markets are governed by bilateral
aviation agreements between the U.S. and foreign countries, changes in U.S. or
foreign government aviation policies can lead to the alteration or termination
of existing air service agreements that could adversely impact, and
significantly impair, the value of our international route authorities. Significant
changes in such policies could also have a material impact on the Company’s
operating revenues and expenses and results of operations. See

Item 1. Business—International Regulation

for further
information and

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures above Market Risk

for further information on the Company’s
foreign currency risks associated with its foreign operations.

Critical Accounting
Policies

Critical accounting
policies are defined as those that are affected by significant judgments and
uncertainties which potentially could result in materially different accounting
under different assumptions and conditions. The Company has prepared the
accompanying financial statements in conformity with GAAP, which requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ
from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The Company has
identified the following critical accounting policies that impact the
preparation of these financial statements.

Passenger Revenue
Recognition.

The
value of unused passenger tickets and miscellaneous charge orders (“MCO’s”) is
included in current liabilities as advance ticket sales. United records
passenger ticket sales as operating revenues when the transportation is
provided or when the ticket expires. Non-refundable


tickets generally
expire on the date of the intended flight, unless the date is extended by
notification from the customer on or before the intended flight date. Fees
charged in association with changes or extensions to non-refundable tickets are
recorded as passenger revenue at the time the fee is incurred. Change fees
related to non-refundable tickets are considered a separate transaction from
the air transportation because they represent a charge for the Company’s
additional service to modify a previous reservation. Therefore, the pricing of
the change fee and the initial customer reservation are separately determined
and represent distinct earnings processes. Refundable tickets expire after one
year. MCO’s are stored value documents that are either exchanged for a
passenger ticket or refunded after issuance. United records an estimate of MCO’s
that will not be exchanged or refunded as revenue ratably over the validity
period based on historical results. Due to complex industry pricing structures,
refund and exchange policies, and interline agreements with other airlines,
certain amounts are recognized as revenue using estimates both as to the timing
of recognition and the amount of revenue to be recognized. These estimates are
based on the evaluation of actual historical results.

Accounting for Long-Lived
Assets.

The
Company has $11.5 billion in net book value of operating property and equipment
at December 31, 2006. In addition to the original cost of these assets, as
adjusted by fresh-start reporting at February 1, 2006, their recorded
value is impacted by a number of accounting policy elections, including the
estimation of useful lives and residual values and, when necessary, the
recognition of asset impairment charges.

Except for the adoption of
fresh-start reporting at February 1, 2006, whereby the Company remeasured
long-lived assets at fair value, it is the Company’s policy to record assets
acquired, including aircraft, at acquisition cost. Depreciable life is
determined through economic analysis, such as reviewing existing fleet plans,
obtaining appraisals and comparing estimated lives to other airlines that
operate similar fleets. Older generation aircraft are assigned lives that are
generally consistent with the experience of United and the practice of other
airlines. As aircraft technology has improved, useful life has increased and
the Company has generally estimated the lives of those aircraft to be 30 years.
Residual values are estimated based on historical experience with regards to
the sale of both aircraft and spare parts, and are established in conjunction
with the estimated useful lives of the related fleets. Residual values are
based on current dollars when the aircraft are acquired and typically reflect
asset values that have not reached the end of their physical life. Both
depreciable lives and residual values are revised periodically to recognize
changes in the Company’s fleet plan and other relevant information. A one year
increase in the average depreciable life of our aircraft would reduce annual
depreciation expense by approximately $19 million.

In accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, “

Accounting
for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,

” the Company
evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist.

The
Company’s policy is to recognize an impairment charge when an asset’s carrying
value exceeds its net undiscounted future cash flows and its fair market value.
The amount of the charge is the difference between the asset’s book value and
fair market value (sometimes estimated using appraisals). More often, the
Company estimates the undiscounted future cash flows for its various aircraft
with financial models used by the Company to make fleet and scheduling
decisions. These models utilize projections on passenger yield, fuel costs,
labor costs and other relevant factors, many of which require the exercise of
significant judgment on the part of management. Changes in these projections
may expose the Company to future impairment charges by raising the threshold
which future cash flows need to meet.

The Company recognized
impairment charges on assets held-for-sale of $5 million in 2006 and $18 million
for the early retirement of certain aircraft in 2005. See Note 2(l), “Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies—Measurement of Impairments” and Note 19, “Special
Items,” in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

.

See Note 2(f), “Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies—Operating Property and Equipment,” in the

Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements

for additional information
regarding United’s policies on accounting for long-lived assets.


Fresh-Start
Reporting.

In connection with its emergence from
Chapter 11 protection as of February 1, 2006, the Company adopted fresh-start
reporting in accordance with SOP 90-7. Accordingly, UAL’s assets,
liabilities and equity were valued at their respective fair values as of the
Effective Date. The excess reorganization value over the fair value of net
tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities has been reflected
as goodwill in the accompanying

Statements of Consolidated
Financial Position

.

Fair values of assets and liabilities represent the
Company’s best estimates based on independent appraisals and valuations and, where
the foregoing are not available, industry data and trends and by reference to
relevant market rates and transactions. Accordingly, the Company cannot provide
assurance that the estimates, assumptions, and values reflected in the asset
and liability valuations will be realized, and actual results could vary
materially from those estimates. In accordance with SFAS 141, the preliminary
measurement and allocation of fair value to assets and liabilities was subject
to additional adjustment within one year after emergence from bankruptcy to
provide the Company time to complete its valuation of its assets and
liabilities. See Note 1, “Voluntary Reorganization Under Chapter 11—Fresh-Start
Reporting,” and Note 2(k), “Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies—Intangibles” in the

Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements

for further details related to the fresh-start
fair value adjustments.

To facilitate the calculation of the enterprise value
of the Successor Company, a set of financial projections were developed. Based
on these financial projections, the equity value was estimated by the Company
using various valuation methods, including (i) a comparison of the Company
and its projected performance to the market values of comparable companies, (ii) a
review and analysis of several recent transactions of companies in similar
industries to the Company, and (iii) a calculation of the present value of
projected future cash flows using the Company’s financial projections.

The estimated enterprise value and corresponding
equity value are highly dependent upon achieving the future financial results
set forth in the projections as well as the realization of certain other
assumptions that cannot be guaranteed. The estimated equity value of the
Company was calculated to be approximately $1.9 billion. The foregoing
estimates and assumptions are inherently subject to significant uncertainties
and contingencies beyond the reasonable control of the Company. Moreover, the
market value of the Company’s common stock may differ materially from the
fresh-start equity valuation.

Frequent
Flyer Accounting.

In accordance with fresh-start
reporting, the Company revalued its frequent flyer obligation to estimated fair
value at the Effective Date, which resulted in a $2.4 billion increase to the
frequent flyer obligation. The Successor Company also has elected to change its
accounting policy for its Mileage Plus frequent flyer program to a deferred
revenue model. The Company believes that accounting for frequent flyer miles
using a deferred revenue model is preferable, as it establishes a consistent
valuation methodology for both miles earned by frequent flyers and miles sold
to non-airline business partners.

Before the Effective Date, the Predecessor Company had
used the historical industry practice of accounting for frequent flyer miles
earned on United flights on an incremental cost basis as an accrued liability
and as advertising expense, while miles sold to non-airline business partners
were accounted for on a deferred revenue basis. As of the Effective Date, the
deferred revenue value of all frequent flyer miles are measured using
equivalent ticket value as described below, and all associated adjustments are
made to passenger revenues.

The deferred revenue measurement method used to record
fair value of the frequent flyer obligation on and after the Effective Date was
to allocate an equivalent weighted-average ticket value to each outstanding
mile, based upon projected redemption patterns for available award choices when
such miles are consumed. Such value was estimated assuming redemptions on both
United and other participating carriers in the Mileage Plus program, and by
estimating the relative proportions of awards to be redeemed by class of
service within broad geographic regions of the Company’s operations, including
North America, Atlantic, Pacific and Latin America.


Under the new method of accounting adopted for this
program at the Effective Date, the Company reduced operating revenue by
approximately $158 million more in the eleven months ended December 31,
2006 to account for the effects of the program as compared to the reduction in
revenues that would have been recognized using the Predecessor Company’s
accounting method. The Company’s new accounting policy does not continue the
use of the former incremental cost method, which impacted revenues and
advertising expense under that prior policy. Assuming the use of the
Predecessor Company’s accounting for this program, for the eleven months ended December 31,
2006, the Company estimates that it would have recorded approximately $27
million of additional advertising expense.

The estimation of the fair value of each award mile
requires the use of several significant assumptions, for which significant
management judgment is required. For example, management must estimate how many
miles are projected to be redeemed on United, versus on other airline partners.
Since the equivalent ticket value of miles redeemed on United and on other
carriers can vary greatly, this assumption can materially affect the
calculation of the weighted-average ticket value from period to period.

Management must also estimate the expected redemption
patterns of Mileage Plus customers, who have a number of different award
choices when redeeming their miles, each of which can have materially different
estimated fair values. Such choices include different classes of service
(first, business and several coach award levels), as well as different flight
itineraries, such as domestic and international routings, and different
itineraries within domestic and international regions of United’s and other
participating carriers’ flight networks. Customer redemption patterns may also
be influenced by program changes, which occur from time to time and introduce
new award choices, or make material changes to the terms of existing award
choices. Management must often estimate the probable impact of such program
changes on future customer behavior using limited data, which requires the use
of significant judgment. Management uses historical customer redemption
patterns as the best single indicator of future redemption behavior in making
its estimates, but changes in customer mileage redemption behavior to patterns
which are not consistent with historical behavior can result in material
changes to deferred revenue balances, and to recognized revenue.

Management’s estimate of the expected breakage of
miles as of the fresh-start date, and for recognition of breakage
post-emergence, also requires significant management judgment. For customer
accounts which are inactive for a period of 36 consecutive months, it has been
United’s policy to cancel all miles contained in those accounts at the end of
the 36 month period of inactivity. In early 2007, the Company announced that it
is reducing the expiration period from 36 months to 18 months effective December 31,
2007. Under its deferred revenue accounting policy effective in 2006, the
Company recognized revenue from breakage of miles by amortizing such estimated
breakage over the 36 month expiration period. However, current and future
changes to program rules, such as the recent change in the expiration period,
and program redemption opportunities can significantly alter customer behavior
from historical patterns with respect to inactive accounts. Such changes may
result in material changes to the deferred revenue balance, as well as
recognized revenues from the program. A hypothetical 1% change in the Company’s
estimated breakage rate, estimated at 14% annually as of December 31,
2006, has approximately an $18 million effect on the liability.

At December 31, 2006, the Company’s outstanding
number of miles was approximately 508.8 billion. The Company estimates that
approximately 438.3 billion of these miles will ultimately be redeemed based on
assumptions as of December 31, 2006 and, accordingly, has recorded
deferred revenue of $3.7 billion. A hypothetical 1% change in the Company’s
outstanding number of miles or the weighted-average ticket value has
approximately a $42 million effect on the liability. These assumptions do not
include the impact of reducing the expiration period from 36 months to 18
months.

Goodwill
and Intangible Assets.

In
accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 142, “

Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets

” (“SFAS 142”), the Company applies a fair
value-based


impairment test to the
book value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets on an annual
basis and, if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss
may have been incurred, on an interim basis. An impairment charge could have a
material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position and results of
operations in the period of recognition.

Upon the implementation of fresh-start reporting (

see Note 1, “Voluntary Reorganization Under
Chapter 11—Fresh-Start Reporting,” in the

Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements

) the Company’s assets, liabilities
and equity were valued at their respective fair values. The excess of
reorganization value over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable
intangible assets and liabilities has been reflected as goodwill in the
accompanying

Statements of Consolidated Financial Position

on the Effective Date. As discussed in Note 9, “Segment Information,” in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

, the entire
goodwill amount of $2.7 billion at December 31, 2006 has been allocated to
the mainline reportable segment. In addition, the adoption of fresh-start
reporting resulted in the recognition of $2.2 billion of indefinite-lived
intangible assets.

SFAS 142 requires that a two-step impairment test be
performed on goodwill. In the first step, the Company compares the fair value
of the reportable segment to its carrying value. If the fair value of the
reportable segment exceeds the carrying value of the net assets of the
reportable segment, goodwill is not impaired and the Company is not required to
perform further testing. If the carrying value of the net assets of the
reportable segment exceeds the fair value of the reportable segment, then the
Company must perform the second step to determine the implied fair value of the
goodwill and compare it to the carrying value of the goodwill. If the carrying
value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then the Company must record
an impairment charge equal to such difference.

The Company assessed the fair value of its reportable
segments considering both the market and income approaches. Under the market
approach, the fair value of the reportable segment is based on quoted market
prices and recent transaction values of peer companies.  Under the income approach, the fair value of
the reportable segment is based on the present value of estimated future cash
flows. The income approach is dependent on a number of factors including
estimates of future capacity, passenger yield, traffic, operating costs,
appropriate discount rates and other relevant factors.

The Company performed its annual impairment test for
its goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets as of October 1,
2006. To estimate the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets the
Company used the market and income approaches, discussed above, and the cost
method, which uses the concept of replacement cost as an indicator of fair
value. The Company did not identify any impairments in these assets.

Other
Postretirement Benefit Accounting.

The Company accounts for other postretirement
benefits using Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106,

“Employers’ Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions”

(“SFAS 106”) and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158,

“Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other
Postretirement Plans—an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and
132(R)”

(“SFAS 158”). For the year ended December 31, 2006, the
Company adopted SFAS 158, which requires the Company to recognize the
difference between plan assets and obligations, or the plan’s funded status, in
its

Statements of Consolidated Financial Position

.
Under these accounting standards, other postretirement benefit expense is
recognized on an accrual basis over employees’ approximate service periods and
is generally calculated independently of funding decisions or requirements. The
Company has not been required to pre-fund its current and future plan
obligations resulting in a significant net obligation, as discussed below.

The fair value of plan assets at December 31,
2006 was $54 million for the other postretirement benefit plans. The benefit
obligation was $2.1 billion for the other postretirement benefit plans at December 31,
2006. The difference between the plan assets and obligations has been recorded
in the

Statements of Consolidated Financial Position

at December 31, 2006. Detailed information regarding the


Company’s other
postretirement plans, including key assumptions, is included in Note 8, “Retirement
and Postretirement Plans,” in the

Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements

.

The following provides a summary of the methodology to
determine the assumptions used in Note 8, “Retirement and Postretirement Plans,”
in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

.
The calculation of other postretirement benefit expense and obligations
requires the use of a number of assumptions, including the assumed discount
rate for measuring future payment obligations and the expected return on plan
assets. The discount rates were based on the construction of theoretical bond
portfolios, adjusted according to the timing of expected cash flows for the
Company’s future postretirement obligations. A yield curve was developed based
on a subset of these bonds (those with yields between the 40th and 90th
percentiles). The projected cash flows were matched to this yield curve and a
present value developed, which was then calibrated to develop a single
equivalent discount rate.

The expected return on plan assets is based on an
evaluation of the historical behavior of the broad financial markets and the
Company’s investment portfolio, taking into consideration input from the plan’s
investment consultant and actuary regarding expected long-term market
conditions and investment management performance. The Company believes that the
long-term asset allocation on average will approximate the targeted allocation
and it regularly reviews the actual asset allocation to periodically rebalance
the investments to the targeted allocation when appropriate. Other
postretirement expense is reduced by the expected return on plan assets, which
is measured by assuming that the market-related value of plan assets increases
at the expected rate of return. The market-related value is a calculated value
that phases in differences between the expected rate of return and the actual
return over a period of five years.

Actuarial gains or losses are triggered by changes in
assumptions or experience that differ from the original assumptions. Under the
applicable accounting standards, those gains and losses are not required to be
recognized currently as other postretirement expense, but instead may be
deferred as part of accumulated other comprehensive income and amortized into
expense over the average remaining service life of the covered active employees.
At December 31, 2006, the Company had unrecognized actuarial gains of $120
million for the other postretirement benefit plans recorded in Accumulated
other comprehensive income.

Valuation
Allowance for Deferred Tax Assets.

The Company initially recorded a tax valuation
allowance against its deferred tax assets in the third quarter of 2002. In
recording the valuation allowance, management considered whether it was more
likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets would be realized. This
analysis included consideration of scheduled reversals of deferred tax
liabilities, projected future taxable income, carry back potential and tax
planning strategies, in accordance with SFAS 109. At December 31,
2006, our valuation allowance totaled $2.2 billion. See also Note 6, “Income
Taxes,” in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

for additional information.

Income

Taxes.

During
the evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2006, the Company identified a deficiency in our internal control over
financial reporting associated with tax accounting which constituted a material
weakness.   While the Company had
appropriately designed control procedures, high staff turnover caused the
Company to poorly execute those control procedures for evaluating and recording
its current and deferred income tax provision and related deferred taxes balances.  This control deficiency did not result in a
material misstatement, but did result in adjustments to the deferred tax assets
and liabilities, net operating losses, valuation allowance and footnote
disclosures and could have resulted in a misstatement of current and deferred
income taxes and related disclosures that would result in a material
misstatement of annual or interim financial statements.  We have and are continuing to take steps to
remediate this material weakness, including the hiring of several tax
professionals, as well as implementing a more rigorous review process of tax
accounting and disclosure matters. 
Additional review, evaluation and oversight have been undertaken to
ensure our


consolidated financial
statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles and, as a result, we have concluded that the consolidated financial
statements in this Form 10-K fairly present, in all material respects, our
financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods
presented.  See also Note 6, “Income
Taxes,” in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

for additional information.

Operations

and elsewhere in this report are forward-looking and thus
reflect the Company’s current expectations and beliefs with respect to certain
current and future events and financial performance. Such forward-looking
statements are and will be subject to many risks and uncertainties relating to
United’s operations and business environment that may cause actual results to
differ materially from any future results expressed or implied in such forward-looking
statements. Words such as “expects,” “will,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “indicates,”
“believes,” “forecast,” “guidance,” “outlook” and similar expressions are

information available to the Company on the date of this report. The Company
undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking
statement, whether as a result of new information, future events, changed
circumstances or otherwise.

The Company’s actual results could differ materially
from these forward-looking statements due to numerous factors including,
without limitation, the following: its ability to comply with the terms of
financing arrangements; the costs and availability of financing; its ability to
execute its business plan; its ability to realize benefits from its resource
optimization efforts and cost reduction initiatives; its ability to utilize its
net operating losses; its ability to attract, motivate and/or retain key
employees; its ability to attract and retain customers; demand for
transportation in the markets in which it operates; general economic conditions
(including interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, crude oil prices,
costs of aviation fuel and refining capacity in relevant markets); its ability
to cost-effectively hedge against increases in the price of aviation fuel; the
effects of any hostilities, act of war or terrorist attack; the ability of
other air carriers with whom the Company has alliances or partnerships to
provide the services contemplated by the respective arrangements with such
carriers; the costs and availability of aircraft insurance; the costs
associated with security measures and practices; labor costs; competitive
pressures on pricing (particularly from lower-cost competitors) and on demand;
capacity decisions of its competitors; U.S. or foreign governmental legislation,
regulation and other actions; its ability to maintain satisfactory labor
relations;

any disruptions to operations due to any
potential actions by its labor groups; weather conditions; and other risks and
uncertainties set forth under

Item 1A. Risk Factors

of this Form 10-K, as well as other risks and uncertainties set
forth from time to time in the reports the Company files with the SEC.
Consequently, the forward-looking statements should not be regarded as
representations or warranties by the Company that such matters will be
realized.


ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE
AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Interest Rate and Foreign
Currency Exchange Rate Risks—

United’s exposure to
market risk associated with changes in interest rates relates primarily to its
debt obligations and short-term investments. The Company does not use
derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio. United’s policy
is to manage interest rate risk through a combination of fixed and floating
rate debt and by entering into swap agreements, depending upon market
conditions. A portion of United’s capital lease obligations ($537 million in
equivalent U.S. dollars at December 31, 2006) is denominated in foreign
currencies that expose us to risks associated with changes in foreign exchange
rates. To hedge against some of this risk, United has placed foreign currency
deposits (primarily for euros) to meet foreign currency lease obligations
denominated in those respective currencies. Since unrealized mark-to-market
gains or losses on the foreign currency deposits are offset by the losses or
gains on the foreign currency obligations, United reduces its overall exposure
to foreign currency exchange rate volatility. The fair value of these deposits
is determined based on the present value of future cash flows using an appropriate
swap rate. The fair value of long-term debt is based on the quoted market
prices for the same or similar issues or the present value of future cash flows
using a U.S. Treasury rate that matches the remaining life of the instrument,
adjusted by a credit spread. The table below presents information as of December 31,
2006 about certain of the Company’s financial instruments that are sensitive to
changes in interest and exchange rates.

In addition to the cash equivalents and short-term
investments included in the table above, the Company has $341 million of
short-term restricted cash and $506 million of long-term restricted cash at
December 31, 2006. As discussed in Note 2(d), “Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies—Cash and Cash Equivalents, Short-Term Investments and
Restricted Cash” in the

Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements

, this cash is being held in restricted accounts
for workers’ compensation obligations, security deposits for airport leases and
reserves with institutions that process United’s credit card ticket sales. Due
to the short term nature of these cash balances, the carrying values
approximate the fair values. The Company’s interest income is exposed to
changes in interest rates on these cash balances.


In the first quarter of 2006, United entered into an
interest rate swap whereby it fixed the rate of interest on $2.45 billion
notional value of floating-rate debt at 5.14% plus a fixed credit margin. The
swap had a fair value of negative $12 million at December 31, 2006. In January 2007,
United terminated the swap. The termination value of the swap was negative $4
million due to an $8 million increase in fair value from December 31, 2006
to the termination date. See Note 14, “Financial Instruments and Risk
Management—Interest Rate Swap,” in the

Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements

for additional information.

In February 2007, the Company completed a
prepayment of a portion of its Credit Facility debt. This prepayment reduces
the Company’s variable rate debt maturities in the table above by $972 million
($10 million in each of 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011 and $932 million
thereafter).  See Note 11, “Debt
Obligations,” in the

Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements

for additional information.

Price
Risk (Aircraft Fuel)—

United enters into fuel option
contracts and futures contracts to reduce its price risk exposure to jet fuel. These
contracts are designed to provide protection against sharp increases in the
price of aircraft fuel. The Company may update its hedging strategy in response
to changes in market conditions. The fair value of the Company’s fuel related
derivatives was a negative $2 million at December 31, 2006. These
instruments have a maturity of less than one year.

Foreign
Currency—

United

generates revenues and
incurs expenses in numerous foreign currencies. Such expenses include fuel,
aircraft leases, commissions, catering, personnel expense, advertising and
distribution costs, customer service expenses and aircraft maintenance. Changes
in foreign currency exchange rates impact the Company’s results of operations
through changes in the dollar value of foreign currency-denominated operating
revenues and expenses.

Despite the adverse effects a strengthening foreign
currency may have on demand for U.S.-originating traffic, a strengthening of
foreign currencies tends to increase reported revenue and operating income
because the Company’s foreign currency-denominated operating revenue generally
exceeds its foreign currency-denominated operating expense for each currency. Likewise,
despite the favorable effects a weakening foreign currency may have on demand
for U.S.-originating traffic, a weakening of foreign currencies tends to
decrease reported revenue and operating income.

The
Company’s biggest net foreign currency exposures in 2006 were typically for the
Canadian dollar, Chinese renminbi, Australian dollar, British pound, Korean
won, European euro, Hong Kong dollar and Japanese yen. The table below sets
forth the Company’s net exposure to various currencies for 2006:

ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED
PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

UAL Corporation

Elk Grove Township, Illinois

We have audited the accompanying statements of
consolidated financial position of UAL
Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31,
2006 (Successor Company balance sheet) and as of December 31, 2005
(Predecessor Company balance sheet), and the related statements of consolidated
operations, consolidated stockholders’ equity (deficit), and consolidated cash
flows for the Successor Company eleven months ended December 31, 2006
(Successor Company operations) and for the one month ended January 31,
2006 and for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2005
(Predecessor Company operations). Our audits also included the financial
statement schedule of the Successor Company for the eleven months ended December 31,
2006 and the Predecessor Company for the one month January 31, 2006 and
for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2005 as listed
in the Index at Item 15. These consolidated financial statements and financial
statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial
statements, on January 20, 2006, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order
confirming the plan of reorganization which became effective after the close of
business on February 1, 2006. Accordingly, the accompanying consolidated
financial statements have been prepared in conformity with AICPA Statement of
Position 90-7, “Financial Reporting by Entities in Reorganization Under
the Bankruptcy Code,” for the Successor Company as a new entity with assets,
liabilities and a capital structure having carrying values not comparable with
prior periods as described in Note 1.

In our opinion, the Successor Company consolidated
financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of UAL Corporation and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2006 and the results of their operations
and their cash flows for the eleven month period ended December 31, 2006
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. Further, in our opinion, the Predecessor Company
consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of the Predecessor Company as of December 31,
2005 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the one month
period ended January 31, 2006 and for each of the two years in the period
ended December 31, 2005, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such
Successor Company financial statement schedule and Predecessor Company
financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic
consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all
material respects, the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial
statements on January 1, 2006, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment” which
changed the method of accounting for share based payments and as discussed in
Note 2 to the


consolidated financial
statements on December 31, 2006, the Company adopted the recognition and
related disclosure provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158,
“Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
Plans—an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132R”, which
changed the method of accounting for and the disclosures regarding pension and
postretirement benefits.

We
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based
on the criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our
report dated March 16, 2007

,

expressed an unqualified opinion on
management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting and an adverse opinion on the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting because of a material
weakness.

UAL Corporation and
Subsidiary Companies

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

The Company

UAL Corporation is a
holding company and its principal, wholly-owned subsidiary is United Air Lines, Inc.,
a Delaware corporation (“United”). We sometimes collectively refer to UAL
Corporation, together with its consolidated subsidiaries, as “we,” “our,” “us,”
“UAL” or the “Company.”

As a
result of the adoption of fresh-start reporting in accordance with American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants’ Statement of Position 90-7 “

Financial Reporting by Entities in Reorganization under the Bankruptcy
Code

” (“SOP 90-7”), the financial statements before February 1,
2006 are not comparable with the financial statements for periods on or after February 1,
2006. References to “Successor Company” refer to UAL on or after February 1,
2006, after giving effect to the adoption of fresh-start reporting. References
to “Predecessor Company” refer to UAL before February 1, 2006. See Note 1,
“Voluntary Reorganization Under Chapter 11—Fresh-Start Reporting,” for further
details.

(1) Voluntary
Reorganization Under Chapter 11

Bankruptcy Considerations.

The
following discussion provides general background information regarding the
Company’s Chapter 11 cases, and is not intended to be an exhaustive summary. Detailed
information pertaining to the bankruptcy filings may be obtained at www.pd-ual.com.

On December 9, 2002
(the “Petition Date”), UAL, United and 26 direct and indirect wholly-owned
subsidiaries (collectively, the “Debtors”) filed voluntary petitions to
reorganize their businesses under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy
Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of
Illinois, Eastern Division (the “Bankruptcy Court”). On January 20, 2006,
the Bankruptcy Court confirmed the Debtors’ Second Amended Joint Plan of
Reorganization Pursuant to Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the
“Plan of Reorganization”). The Plan of Reorganization became effective and the
Debtors emerged from bankruptcy protection on February 1, 2006 (the “Effective
Date”). On the Effective Date, UAL implemented fresh-start reporting.

The
Plan of Reorganization generally provided for the full payment or reinstatement
of allowed administrative claims, priority claims and secured claims, and the
distribution of new equity and debt securities to the Debtors’ creditors and
employees in satisfaction of allowed unsecured and deemed claims. The Plan of
Reorganization contemplated UAL issuing up to 125 million shares of common
stock (out of the one billion shares of new common stock authorized under its
certificate of incorporation). The new common stock was listed on the NASDAQ
National Market and began trading under the symbol “UAUA” on February 2,
2006. Ultimately, the distributions of common stock, subject to certain
holdbacks as described in the Plan of Reorganization, will be as follows:

·

Approximately
115 million shares of common stock to unsecured creditors and employees;

·

Up
to 9.825 million shares of common stock (or options or other rights to acquire
shares) under the management equity incentive plan approved by the Bankruptcy
Court; and

·

Up
to 175,000 shares of common stock (or options or other rights to acquire
shares) under the director equity incentive plan approved by the Bankruptcy
Court.

The
Plan of Reorganization also provided for the issuance of the following
securities:

·

million shares of 2% mandatorily convertible preferred stock issued to the
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (“PBGC”) shortly after the Effective Date;

·

Approximately
$150 million in aggregate principal amount of 5% senior convertible notes
issued to holders of certain municipal bonds shortly after the Effective Date;


·

$726
million in aggregate principal amount of 4.5% senior limited-subordination
convertible notes issued in July 2006 to certain irrevocable trusts
established for the benefit of certain employees (the “Limited-Subordination
Notes”);

·

$500
million in aggregate principal amount of 6% senior notes issued to the PBGC shortly
after the Effective Date; and

·

$500
million in aggregate principal amount of 8% senior contingent notes (in up to
eight equal tranches of $62.5 million) issuable to the PBGC upon the
satisfaction of certain contingencies.

Pursuant to the Company’s
Plan of Reorganization, the Limited-Subordination Notes were required to be
issued within 180 days of the Effective Date with a conversion price equal to
125% of the average closing price for the 60 consecutive trading days following
February 1, 2006, and an interest rate established so the notes would
trade at par upon issuance. In July 2006, the Company reached agreement
with five of the seven eligible employee groups to modify the conversion price
to instead be based upon the volume-weighted average price of the common stock
over the two trading days ending on July 25, 2006, the date the notes were
issued to the trusts. This modification resulted in a new conversion price of
$34.84, rather than $46.86 which was the conversion price under the initial
terms of the notes. Because the reduction in the conversion price resulted in a
benefit to noteholders, the Company was able to issue the notes at an interest
rate of 4.5%, which is a lower rate of interest than would have been required
under the initial terms in order for the notes to trade at par upon issuance. The
Company reached agreement with the two other employee groups to pay them cash
totaling approximately $0.4 million rather than issuing additional notes of
similar value. See Note 11, “Debt Obligations—Successor Company Debt,” for
further information.

Pursuant to the Plan of
Reorganization, UAL common stock, preferred stock and Trust Originated
Preferred Securities issued before the Petition Date were canceled on the
Effective Date, and no distribution was made to holders of those securities.

On the Effective Date, the
Company secured access to $3.0 billion in secured exit financing (the “Credit
Facility”) which consisted of a $2.45 billion term loan, a $350 million delayed
draw term loan and a $200 million revolving credit line. On the Effective Date,
the $2.45 billion term loan and the entire revolving credit line, consisting of
$161 million in cash and $39 million of letters of credit, were drawn and used
to repay the Debtor-In-Possession credit facility (the “DIP Financing”) and to
make other payments required upon exit from bankruptcy, as well as to provide
ongoing liquidity to conduct post-reorganization operations. Subsequently,
during the first quarter of 2006, the Company repaid the entire outstanding
balance on the revolving credit line and accessed the $350 million delayed draw
term loan. In February 2007, the Company prepaid $972 million of its
Credit Facility debt and amended certain terms of the Credit Facility. For
further details on the Credit Facility including the facility amendment and the
prepayment, see Note 11, “Debt Obligations.”

Significant Matters Resolved Since Emergence from
Bankruptcy.

During
the course of the Chapter 11 proceedings, the Company successfully reached
settlements with most of its creditor constituencies and resolved most pending
claims against the Debtors. The following material matters have been resolved
in the Bankruptcy Court since the Effective Date:

(a)

1997 EETC Aircraft Financings.

The Company had an
ongoing dispute with respect to a group of mostly-public financiers (the “Public
Debt Group”) involving 14 aircraft financed under the Series 1997-1
Enhanced Equipment Trust Certificates (“1997-1 EETC”). During the first
quarter of 2006, the Company resolved the dispute and entered into a settlement
agreement that was approved by the Bankruptcy Court. The settlement agreement
resolved all pending litigation in connection with the 1997-1 EETC
transaction and aircraft and provided for a permanent mutual release of all related
claims. The Company remitted $281 million to the 1997-1 EETC trustee as
final payment to the holders of the Tranche A certificates. The Company
previously acquired the


1997-1 EETC
Tranche B and Tranche C certificates as a precursor to utilizing the
transaction par buyout mechanism to purchase the Tranche A certificates. Following
shortly thereafter in the first quarter of 2006, the Company refinanced the 14
aircraft with the $350 million delayed draw term loan provided under the Credit
Facility. The Company recorded the 1997-1 EETC debt at fair market value
upon its emergence from bankruptcy in accordance with fresh-start reporting. As
a result, no gain or loss was realized on the extinguishment of debt.

(b)

Wells Fargo Appeal of Confirmation Order.

Wells Fargo
Bank Northwest, N.A., not individually but in its capacity as a trustee, filed
a notice of appeal of the confirmation order to the United States District
Court for the Northern District of Illinois (“District Court”). The parties
subsequently filed a stipulation agreeing to voluntarily dismiss the appeal,
and the appeal has been dismissed.

(c)

Pre- and Post-1997 EETC Aircraft Financings.

In August 2005,
United entered into term sheets to restructure the three post-1997
Enhanced Equipment Trust Certificate (“EETC”) transactions, financing 80
aircraft in United’s fleet that were controlled by the Public Debt Group. In May 2006,
the Company reached a settlement with the Public Debt Group with respect to
these financing transactions. In conjunction with the settlement, the Company
and the EETC trustees agreed to cooperate and to use reasonable efforts to
complete definitive documentation. The settlement was approved by the
Bankruptcy Court in June 2006. The Company completed definitive
documentation on the three post-1997 EETC transactions in July 2006
and met its obligations to have the transactions rated by both Standard and
Poor’s and Moody’s.

In addition, in August 2005,
United entered into term sheets to restructure the pre-1997 transactions
financing 19 aircraft that are controlled by the Public Debt Group. United has
subsequently closed transactions covering all of the associated aircraft.

(d)

Municipal Bond Litigation at DEN, JFK, SFO and LAX.

United is a party to numerous long-term
agreements to lease certain airport and maintenance facilities that are
financed through tax-exempt municipal bonds that are issued by various local
municipalities to build or improve airport and maintenance facilities. During
2003, the Company filed four complaints for declaratory judgment and
corresponding motions for temporary restraining orders concerning United’s
municipal bond obligations for facilities at Denver International Airport (“DEN”),
John F. Kennedy International Airport (“JFK”), San Francisco International
Airport (“SFO”) and Los Angeles International Airport (“LAX”). In each case,
United sought clarification of its obligations to pay principal and interest
under the applicable municipal bonds, and the protection of its rights
concerning related airport lease agreements at the applicable airports. Final
non-appealable court decisions have concluded that the SFO, JFK, and LAX
agreements were financings, and not true leases. Even though the SFO and LAX obligations
have been determined to be financings and not true leases, there remains an
issue regarding the extent to which those financings are considered to have a
security interest in the underlying leasehold or the value thereof, as
agreements have secured interests as discussed in “Significant Matters
Remaining to be Resolved in Chapter 11 Cases,” items (a) and (b). A final
non-appealable court decision has concluded that United’s municipal bond
obligations at DEN are a true lease.

(e)

O’Hare Airport Use Agreement.

In 2003, United filed a
complaint for declaratory judgment for all of its municipal bond issues
relating to its facilities at O’Hare International Airport (“O’Hare”), seeking
a declaration that a certain cross-default provision in the O’Hare airport
lease was unenforceable. In 2005, the Bankruptcy Court approved an agreement (“O’Hare
Settlement Agreement”) resolving the disputes between United, the trustees and
the bondholders. The City of Chicago, a party to these adversary proceedings,
was not a party to the O’Hare Settlement Agreement. Subsequently, the Company
announced that it had reached an agreement in principle with the City of
Chicago, with respect to all unresolved disputes relating to


our facilities at O’Hare.
However, the parties were unable to finalize the terms of this settlement as
the City of Chicago continued to maintain that it could revoke United’s
exclusive rights to terminals in place of “preferential” rights if United did
not meet the terms of the cross-default provision (the O’Hare Airport Use
Agreement (“AUA”) did not define or provide for any usage rights, other than
exclusive rights).

In July 2006, the
Bankruptcy Court held that the AUA is a self-contained agreement governing
United’s use of O’Hare and providing the full consideration for that use. To
realize the full value of United’s estate, the Bankruptcy Code allows United to
assume the AUA free from obligations imposed under the separate bond payment
agreements, notwithstanding the cross-default provisions. The time for the City
of Chicago to appeal this ruling has expired.

(f)

ALPA Agreement Approval.

In January 2005, United
filed a motion seeking approval of an agreement to restructure the Air Line
Pilots Association (“ALPA”) collective bargaining agreement pursuant to Section 363(b) of
the Bankruptcy Code. The Bankruptcy Court approved the ALPA agreement over the
objections of various parties. The active pilots ratified the agreement, and
the Bankruptcy Court entered an order approving the ALPA agreement (the “ALPA
Order”). In February 2005, the United Retired Pilots Benefit Protection
Association and seven retired pilots (collectively, “URPBPA”) filed its notice
of appeal of the ALPA Order based principally on the allegation that the ALPA
Order unfairly failed to provide for the distribution of the
Limited-Subordination Notes to the retired pilots as provided to the active
pilots pursuant to the ALPA agreement. The ALPA Order was approved by the
District Court and, in March 2006, by the Court of Appeals. In June 2006,
URPBPA filed a petition for a writ of certiorari from the Supreme Court to
review the Court of Appeals’ ruling with respect to this matter. In October 2006,
the Supreme Court denied the petition for a writ of certiorari, which
effectively concluded this matter.

(g)

URPBPA Appeal of Confirmation Order.

In January 2006,
URPBPA filed a notice and brief supporting an appeal of the order confirming
the Plan of Reorganization. In February 2006, United filed a motion to
dismiss the appeal based on the substantial consummation of the Plan of
Reorganization. In June 2006, the District Court dismissed URPBPA’s appeal
for lack of ripeness. Subsequently, URPBPA filed a notice of appeal of the
decision to the Court of Appeals. On October 25, 2006, the Court of
Appeals reversed the District Court’s order dismissing for lack of ripeness
URPBPA’s appeal of the confirmation order and remanded the case to the District
Court with instructions to affirm the confirmation order. On December 4,
2006, the District Court entered an order affirming the confirmation order. As
of January 23, 2007, URPBPA did not file a petition for writ of certiorari
and thus this matter is effectively concluded.

Significant Matters Remaining to be Resolved in
Chapter 11 Cases.

The
following material matters remain to be resolved in the Bankruptcy Court or
another court:

(a)

SFO Municipal Bond Secured
Interest

.   HSBC Bank Inc. (“HSBC”), as trustee for the 1997
municipal bonds related to SFO, filed a complaint against United asserting a
security interest in United’s leasehold for portions of its maintenance base at
SFO. Pursuant to Section 506(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, HSBC alleges that
it is entitled to be paid the value of that security interest, which HSBC had
claimed was as much as $257 million. HSBC and United went to trial in
April 2006 and the Bankruptcy Court rejected as a matter of law HSBC’s
$257 million claim. HSBC subsequently alleged that it was entitled to $154
million, or at a minimum, approximately $93 million. The parties tried the case
and filed post-trial briefs which were heard by the Bankruptcy Court. In
October 2006, the Bankruptcy Court issued its written opinion holding that
the value of the security interest is approximately $27 million. After the
Bankruptcy Court denied various post-trial motions, both parties have appealed
to the District Court and those appeals are pending.


(b)

LAX Municipal Bond Secured
Interest

.   In addition, there is pending litigation before the
Bankruptcy Court regarding the extent to which the LAX municipal bond debt is
entitled to secured status under Section 506(a) of the Bankruptcy
Code. Trial in this matter is scheduled for the week of April 11,

2007. The Company has recorded an obligation of $60 million
at December 31, 2006 for this matter, which is the Company’s best estimate
of the liability.

(c)

Pilot Plan
Termination Order

.   In December 2004, the PBGC filed an
involuntary termination proceeding against United, as plan administrator for
the United Airlines Pilot Defined Benefit Pension Plan (the “Pilot Plan”), in
the District Court. In January 2005, the District Court granted a motion
filed by the Company and referred the involuntary termination proceeding to the
Bankruptcy Court. ALPA and URPBPA were later granted leave to intervene in the
involuntary termination proceeding.

After several months, the Bankruptcy Court conducted a
trial and determined that the Pilot Plan should be involuntarily terminated
under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”) Section 4042
with a termination date of December 30, 2004. Subsequently, the Bankruptcy
Court entered an order authorizing termination of the Pilot Plan.

The PBGC, ALPA and URPBPA filed notices of appeal with
the District Court. In February 2006, the District Court reversed and
remanded the Bankruptcy Court’s termination order on the grounds that the
matter was not a core proceeding in which it could issue a final order, but
rather, could only issue proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law for
consideration by the District Court. Upon remand and after the Bankruptcy Court
made proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law and, in June 2006,
the District Court entered an order approving the termination of the Pilot
Plan. ALPA, URPBPA and PBGC each filed an appeal with the Court of Appeals. On
October 25, 2006, the Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court’s order
approving the termination of the Pilot Plan effective December 30, 2004. On November 6, 2006, ALPA filed a
petition for rehearing in the Court of Appeals which motion has been denied.
ALPA and URPBPA have filed

petitions
for writ of certiorari from the United States Supreme Court on the plan
termination. The Supreme Court has yet to rule on such petitions.

If the termination order was
ultimately reversed on appeal, it could have a materially adverse effect on the
Company’s financial performance, should such determination result in the
reversal of the termination of one or more defined benefit pension plans.

(d)

Pilot Plan
Non-Qualified Pension Benefits.

After the PBGC commenced its
involuntary termination proceeding and sought a December 30, 2004
termination date, the Company suspended payment of non-qualified pension
benefits under the Pilot Plan pending the setting of such a termination date. In
the first quarter of 2005, the Bankruptcy Court required the Company to
continue paying non-qualified pension benefits to retired pilots pending the
outcome of the involuntary termination proceeding, notwithstanding the
possibility that the Pilot Plan might be terminated retroactively to December 30,
2004. Then, on October 6, 2005, despite its oral ruling terminating the
Pilot Plan, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order requiring the Company to
continue paying non-qualified pension benefits until entry of a written order. However,
United appealed that order and placed approximately $6 million necessary to pay
non-qualified benefits for the month of October 2005 in a segregated
account. Following the entry of the Bankruptcy Court’s termination order on October 28,
2005, United ceased paying non-qualified benefits. Subsequently, during the
first quarter of 2006, the District Court dismissed the Company’s appeal of the
Bankruptcy Court’s October 6, 2005 order in light of its earlier decision
reversing the Bankruptcy Court’s termination order. The Company filed a notice of appeal of the District Court’s ruling
regarding the October 6, 2005 order to the Court of Appeals. On October 25, 2006, the Court of
Appeals reversed the District Court’s order dismissing for lack of ripeness the
Company’s appeal of the Bankruptcy Court’s October 6, 2005 order and
remanded the case with


instructions
to reverse the Bankruptcy Court’s order compelling payment of non-qualified
benefits for October 2005 or later months. On November 6, 2006, ALPA
filed a petition for rehearing on the Court of Appeals reversal of the October 6,
2005 order, which motion has been denied.

ALPA and URPBPA have filed
petitions for writ of certiorari from the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has
yet to rule on such petitions.

In March 2006, the Bankruptcy Court ruled that
the Company was obligated to make payment of all non-qualified pension benefits
for the months of November and December 2005 and January 2006. The
Bankruptcy Court also ruled that the Company’s obligation to pay non-qualified
pension benefits ceased as of January 31, 2006. The Company filed a notice
of appeal of the Bankruptcy Court’s ruling to the District Court. URPBPA and
ALPA also filed notices of appeal with respect to the Bankruptcy Court’s order,
which were subsequently consolidated with the Company’s appeal. United agreed
with URPBPA and ALPA to pay the disputed non-qualified pension benefits for the
months of November and December 2005 and January 2006, an
aggregate amount totaling approximately $17 million, into an escrow account. The
District Court affirmed the Bankruptcy Court’s ruling in September 2006. The
Company filed a notice of appeal of the District Court’s ruling to the Court of
Appeals. URPBPA and ALPA also appealed the District Court’s decision. The
Company subsequently filed a motion to consolidate its appeal from the
Bankruptcy Court’s October 2005 non-qualified benefits order with the
three appeals from the Bankruptcy Court’s March 2006 non-qualified
benefits order. The Court of Appeals denied the Company’s motion, but issued an
order staying briefing on the March 2006 non-qualified benefits order until
further order of the Court of Appeals. In light of the Court of Appeals’ October 25,
2006 decision described above, the Company is reasonably optimistic of a
successful outcome of its appeal in this matter, although there can be no
assurances that the ultimate outcome of this appeal will be favorable to the
Company.

Claims Resolution
Process.

As
permitted under the bankruptcy process, the Debtors’ creditors filed proofs of
claim with the Bankruptcy Court. Through the claims resolution process, the
Company identified many claims which were disallowed by the Bankruptcy Court
for a number of reasons, such as claims that were duplicative, amended or
superseded by later filed claims, were without merit, or were otherwise
overstated. Throughout the Chapter 11 proceedings, the Company resolved many
claims through settlement or objections ordered by the Bankruptcy Court. The
Company will continue to settle claims and file additional objections with the
Bankruptcy Court.

With respect to unsecured claims, once a claim is
deemed to be valid, either through the Bankruptcy Court process or through
other means, the claimant is entitled to a distribution of common stock in the
Successor Company. Pursuant to the terms of the Plan of Reorganization, 115
million shares of common stock in the Successor Company have been authorized to
be issued to satisfy valid unsecured claims. T

he Bankruptcy Court confirmed the Plan of
Reorganization and established January 20, 2006 as the record date for
purposes of establishing the persons that are claimholders of record to receive
distributions. Approximately 108

million common
shares have been issued and distributed to holders of valid unsecured claims
between February 2, 2006, the first distribution date established in the
Plan of Reorganization, and December 31, 2006. As of December 31,
2006, approximately 45,000 valid unsecured claims aggregating to approximately
$29 billion in claim value had received those common shares to partially
satisfy those claims. The approximately 7 million remaining shares are being
held in reserve to satisfy all of the remaining disputed and undisputed
unsecured claim values, once the remaining claim disputes are resolved.

The Company’s current estimate of the probable range
of unsecured claims to be allowed by the Bankruptcy Court is between $29
billion and $30 billion. Differences between claim amounts filed and the
Company’s estimates continue to be investigated and will be resolved in
connection with the claims resolution process. However, there will be no further
financial impact to the Company associated with the settlement of such
unsecured claims, as the holders of all allowed unsecured claims will receive
under the


Plan of Reorganization no
more than their pro rata share of the distribution of the 115 million shares of
common stock of the Successor Company, together with the previously-agreed
issuance of certain securities.

With respect to valid administrative and priority
claims, pursuant to the terms of the Plan of Reorganization these claims will
be satisfied with cash. Many asserted administrative and priority claims still
remain unpaid, and the Company will continue to settle claims and file
objections with the Bankruptcy Court to eliminate or reduce such claims. An
estimate of these claims was accrued by the Successor Company on the Effective
Date based upon the best available evidence of amounts to be paid. However, it
should be noted that the claims resolution process is uncertain and adjustments
to claims estimates could result in material adjustments to the Successor
Company’s financial statements in future periods. The most significant items
included in the adjustments made to this accrual since the Effective Date are
$36 million for special items associated with certain litigation, as discussed in
Note 19, “Special Items.”  In addition,
net accruals and adjustments of $29 million have been made which relate
primarily to revisions of claim estimates for aircraft financings, tax matters
and professional fees as a result of the receipt of new or revised information
or the finalization of these matters.

Additionally, secured claims were deemed unimpaired
under the Plan of Reorganization, pursuant to which these claims were satisfied
by reinstatement of the obligations in the Successor Company, surrendering the
collateral to the secured party, or by making full payment in cash. However,
certain disputes, the most significant of which are discussed in “Significant
Matters Remaining to be Resolved in Chapter 11 Cases,” above, still remain with
respect to the valuation of certain claims. Revisions to the Company’s
estimates of its liability for these claims due to the receipt of new
information or final court rulings on these claims may result in material
future adjustments to the Company’s financial statements.

The
table below includes activity related to the administrative and priority claims
and other bankruptcy-related claim reserves including reserves related to
legal, professional and tax matters, among others, for the Successor Company
for the eleven months ended December 31, 2006. These reserves are
primarily classified in other current liabilities and other non-current
liabilities in the

based on the expected timing of resolution of
these matters.

Financial Statement
Presentation.

The
Company has prepared the accompanying consolidated financial statements in
accordance with SOP 90-7 and on a going-concern basis, which assumes
continuity of operations, realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities
in the ordinary course of business.


SOP 90-7
requires that the financial statements for periods after a Chapter 11 filing
separate transactions and events that are directly associated with the
reorganization from the ongoing operations of the business. Accordingly, all
transactions (including, but not limited to, all professional fees, realized
gains and losses and provisions for losses) directly associated with the
reorganization and restructuring of the business are reported separately in the
financial statements as reorganization items, net. For the month ended January 31,
2006 and the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, the Predecessor
Company recognized the following primarily non-cash reorganization income
(expense) in its financial statements:

(a)

The discharge of claims
and liabilities primarily relates to those unsecured claims arising during the
bankruptcy process, such as those arising from the termination and settlement
of the Company’s U.S. defined benefit pension plans and other employee claims;
aircraft-related claims, such as those arising as a result of aircraft
rejections; other unsecured claims due to the rejection or modification of
executory contracts, unexpired leases and regional carrier contracts; and
claims associated with certain municipal bond obligations based upon their
rejection, settlement or the estimated impact of the outcome of pending
litigation. In accordance with the Plan of Reorganization, the Company
discharged its obligations to unsecured creditors in exchange for the
distribution of 115 million common shares of the Successor Company and the
issuance of certain other securities. Accordingly, the Company recognized a
non-cash reorganization gain of $24.6 billion.

(b)

The Company revalued its
Mileage Plus Frequent Flyer Program (“Mileage Plus”) obligations at fair value
as a result of fresh-start reporting, which resulted in a $2.4 billion non-cash
reorganization charge.

(c)

In accordance with
fresh-start reporting, the Company revalued its assets at their estimated fair
value and liabilities at estimated fair value or the present value of amounts
to be paid. This resulted in a non-cash reorganization gain of $2.1 billion,
primarily as a result of newly recognized intangible assets, offset partly by
reductions in the fair value of tangible property and equipment.

(d)

In exchange for
employees’ contributions to the successful reorganization of the Company,
including agreeing to reductions in pay and benefits, the Company agreed in the
Plan of Reorganization to provide each employee group a deemed claim which was
used to provide a distribution of a portion of the equity of the reorganized
entity to those employees. Each employee group received a deemed claim amount
based upon a portion of the value of cost savings provided by that group
through reductions to pay and benefits as well as through certain work rule changes.
The total value of this


deemed claim was
approximately $7.4 billion. As of December 31, 2005, the Company recorded
a non-cash reorganization charge of $6.5 billion for the deemed claim amount
for all union-represented employees. The remaining $0.9 billion associated with
non-represented salaried and management employees was recorded as a
reorganization charge in January 2006, upon confirmation of the Plan of
Reorganization.

(e)

Contract rejection
charges are non-cash costs that include estimated claim values resulting from
the Company’s rejection or negotiated modification of certain contractual
obligations such as executory contracts, unexpired leases and regional carrier
contracts.

(f)

Upon termination and
settlement of the Pension Plans, the Company recognized non-cash curtailment
charges of $640 million and $152 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively, associated
with actions taken by the PBGC to involuntarily terminate United Air Lines, Inc.
Ground Employees’ Retirement Plan (the “Ground Employees Plan”), United
Airlines Flight Attendant Defined Benefit Pension Plan (the “Flight Attendant
Plan”) and United Airlines Management, Administrative and Public Contact
Defined Benefit Pension Plan (“MAPC Plan”). The PBGC was appointed trustee for
the Ground Employees Plan effective May 23, 2005 and the MAPC Plan and the
Flight Attendant Plan effective June 30, 2005, assuming all rights and
powers over the pension assets and obligations of each plan. Upon termination
and settlement of these plans, the Company recognized non-cash net settlement
losses of approximately $1.1 billion in 2005 in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 88, “

Employer’s
Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans
and for Termination Benefits”

(“SFAS 88”). Further, the Company
recognized a non-cash charge of $7.2 billion related to a final settlement with
the PBGC as a result of the termination of the defined benefit pension plans.
In addition, the Company recognized a non-cash settlement loss in the amount of
$10 million during 2005 for the termination of the non-qualified supplemental retirement
plan for management employees who had benefits under the tax-qualified pension
plan that could not be paid under the qualified plan due to Internal Revenue
Code limitations.

(g)

Aircraft claim charges
include the Company’s estimate of claims incurred as a result of the rejection
of certain aircraft leases and return of aircraft as part of the bankruptcy
process, together with certain claims resulting from the modification of other
aircraft financings in bankruptcy.

(h)

Municipal bond
obligations include the Company’s best estimate of unsecured claims incurred as
a result of certain restructured municipal bond obligations, together with
certain claims expected to result from the rejection and litigation of other
municipal bond obligations. The ultimate disposition of several bond
obligations, specifically SFO and LAX, remains subject to the uncertain outcome
of pending litigation. In recognition of this and other claims contingencies
which remain unresolved, the Company continues to withhold a portion of the
equity distribution authorized by the Plan of Reorganization to unsecured
creditors and other claimants. See “Claims Resolution Process” and “Significant
Matters Remaining to be Resolved in Chapter 11 Cases,” above, for further
details.

(i)

In 2004, the Company
reached agreement with representatives of its retirees to
modify medical and life insurance benefits for individuals who
had retired from United before July of 2003, as provided under Section 1114
of the Bankruptcy Code (“retiree welfare benefit claims”). As a result, the
Company proposed, as part of the approved Plan of Reorganization, a general
unsecured claim for these changes to retiree benefits for each of the eligible
individuals. The aggregate amount of retiree welfare benefit claims allowed by
the Bankruptcy Court pursuant to these agreements and the Company’s
confirmed Plan of Reorganization was approximately $652 million.

(j)

In accordance with
the term sheets reached with the Public Debt Group, the Company agreed to
cancel certain 1997-1 EETC certificates that were held by a related party.
Accordingly, in 2005, the Company recorded a non-cash charge in the amount of
$134 million for the principal and interest on


such certificates. In
addition, the Company recorded adjustments retroactively for aircraft rent and
interest expense in the amount of $60 million to reflect the revised aircraft
financing terms.

The

distinguish pre-petition liabilities subject to
compromise from both those pre-petition liabilities that are not subject to
compromise and from post-petition liabilities. Liabilities subject to
compromise were reported at the amounts expected to be allowed by the
Bankruptcy Court, even if they were settled for lesser amounts.

At December 31,
2005, the Company had Liabilities subject to compromise consisting of the

DIP Financing.

At January 31, 2006, the
Company’s outstanding balance of its DIP Financing was $1.2 billion.   On
the Effective Date, the proceeds from the Credit Facility were drawn and used
to repay the DIP Financing. For further details on the Credit Facility, see Note
11, “Debt Obligations.”

Fresh-Start
Reporting.

Upon
emergence from its Chapter 11 proceedings on February 1, 2006, the Company
adopted fresh-start reporting in accordance with SOP 90-7. The Company’s
emergence from Chapter 11 resulted in a new reporting entity with no retained
earnings or accumulated deficit. Accordingly, the Company’s consolidated
financial statements on or after February 1, 2006 are not comparable to
its pre-emergence consolidated financial statements because they are, in
effect, those of a new entity. See the Company’s

Statements
of Consolidated Financial Position

, below.

Fresh-start reporting reflects the
value of the Company as determined in the confirmed Plan of Reorganization. Under
fresh-start reporting, the Company’s asset values are remeasured usi

ng fair value, and are
allocated in conformity with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141,
“

Business Combinations

” (“SFAS 141”). The
excess of reorganization value over the fair value of net tangible and
identifiable intangible assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill in the
accompanying

Statements of Consolidated Financial
Position

. In addition, fresh-start reporting also requires that all
liabilities, other than deferred taxes, should be stated at fair value or at the
present values of the amounts to be paid using appropriate market interest
rates. Deferred taxes are determined in conformity with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 109, “

Accounting for Income
Taxes

” (“SFAS 109”).

Estimates of fair value represent the Company’s best
estimates, which are based on industry data and trends and by reference to
relevant market rates and transactions, and discounted cash flow valuation
methods, among other factors. The foregoing estimates and assumptions are inherently
subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies beyond the control of
the Company. Accordingly, the Company cannot provide assurance that the
estimates, assumptions, and values reflected in the valuations will be
realized, and actual results could vary materially. In accordance with SFAS
141, the preliminary allocation of the reorganization value was subject to
additional adjustment within one year after emergence from bankruptcy to
provide the Company with the time to complete the valuation of its assets and
liabilities.


This adjustment allocation
period ended January 31, 2007; see (c) “Revaluation of Assets and
Liabilities,” below, for further information about adjustments recorded by the
Company after the Effective Date.

To facilitate the calculation of the enterprise value
of the Successor Company, the Company developed a set of financial projections.
Based on these financial projections, the equity value was determined by the
Company, using various valuation methods, including (i) a comparison of
the Company and its projected performance to the market values of comparable
companies; (ii) a review and analysis of several recent transactions of
companies in similar industries to the Company; and (iii) a calculation of
the present value of the future cash flows of the Company under its
projections.

The estimated enterprise value, and corresponding
equity value, is highly dependent upon achieving the future financial results
set forth in the projections as well as the realization of certain other assumptions.
The estimated equity value of the Company was calculated to be approximately
$1.9 billion. The estimates and assumptions made in this valuation are
inherently subject to significant uncertainties and the resolution of
contingencies beyond the reasonable control of the Company. Accordingly, there
can be no assurance that the estimates, assumptions, and amounts reflected in
the valuations will be realized, and actual results could vary materially. Moreover,
the market value of the Company’s common stock may differ materially from the
equity valuation.

In accordance with SOP 90-7, the Company was
required to adopt on February 1, 2006 all accounting guidance that was
going to become effective within the subsequent twelve-month period. See Note
2(o), “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies—Adopted Accounting
Pronouncements.”


The
implementation of the Plan of Reorganization and the effects of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated therein, which included

Settlement
of Unsecured Claims.

This column reflects a discharge of $28.1
billion of liabilities subject to compromise pursuant to the terms of the Plan
of Reorganization. Along with other creditor and employee claims incurred
through the bankruptcy proceedings (i.e., by the rejection of aircraft,
executory contracts, etc.), discharged liabilities include claims related to
termination of the Debtors’ defined benefit pension plans. Pursuant to the Plan
of Reorganization, the unsecured creditors will receive 115 million common
shares of the Successor Company in satisfaction of such claims, together


with certain debt
securities and preferred stock. The Company recorded a $24.6 billion non-cash
reorganization gain on the discharge of unsecured claims net of newly-issued
securities. See “Financial Statement Presentation,” above, and Note 11, “Debt
Obligations,” for further details.

(b)

Reinstatement of Liabilities.

This column reflects the
reinstatement of certain secured liabilities pursuant to the terms of the Plan
of Reorganization. As a result of the reinstatement of liabilities, the Company
reclassified $7.5 billion of liabilities subject to compromise.

·

$7.1
billion represents the reinstatement of secured debt plus accrued interest.

·

$0.4 billion represents
accruals for administrative and priority payments, reinstatement of certain
municipal bond obligations, and other accruals of payments required under the
Plan of Reorganization.

(c)

Revaluation of Assets and Liabilities

. Fresh-start
adjustments are made to reflect asset values at their estimated fair value and
liabilities at estimated fair value or the present value of amounts to be paid,
including:

·

Recognition
of additional estimated fair value of $2.8 billion for international route
authorities, airport slots, trade names and other separately-identifiable
intangible assets,

·

of additional estimated fair value of $2.4 billion for the Mileage Plus
frequent flyer obligation,

·

Adjustments
of $1.3 billion to reduce the values of operating property and equipment,
including owned assets and assets under capital leases, to their estimated fair
market value,

·

Adjustments
of $0.4 billion to reduce recorded flight equipment net book value as a result
of refinancing certain aircraft from mortgage and capital lease financing to

Additionally, goodwill of $2.8 billion was recorded upon
our exit from bankruptcy to reflect the excess of the Successor Company’s
reorganization value over the estimated fair value of net tangible and
identifiable intangible assets and liabilities. In addition, deferred tax
assets and liabilities were adjusted based upon additional information,
including adjustments to fair value estimates of underlying assets and
liabilities.

Post-Emergence
Items.

Certain
additional Successor Company material transactions occurred on or after February 2,
2006 and have been reflected in the accompanying

Statements
of Consolidated Financial Position

as of December 31, 2006.

Release
of Segregated Funds.

The Company reclassified
$271 million for the release of cash previously restricted by a certain credit
card processor. Additionally, $200 million of cash segregated for the payment
of certain tax liabilities and recorded as other current assets before the
Effective Date, was released and reclassified to unrestricted cash.

Goodwill.

During
the eleven months ended December 31, 2006, goodwill was decreased by $62 million
as a result of net adjustments to the valuation allowance for deferred tax
assets. See Note 2(k), “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies—Intangibles,”
for further information.

Credit
Facility Financing Transactions.

On the
Effective Date, the Company received $1.4 billion in net proceeds from the
Credit Facility, consisting of borrowings of $2.6 billion under the Credit
Facility


which includes $161
million borrowed under the revolving credit facility, and the simultaneous
repayment of the Company’s $1.2 billion DIP Financing. For further details, see
Note 11, “Debt Obligations.”

Adjustments of
Preconfirmation Contingencies.

The
Company recorded its best estimates for certain preconfirmation contingent
liabilities that were not resolved at the Effective Date. In accordance with
AICPA Practice Bulletin 11, “

Accounting for
Preconfirmation Contingencies in Fresh-Start Reporting,

” (“Practice
Bulletin 11”), the Company has recorded the impact of revisions to these
estimates in current results of operations. In 2006, the Company recorded a net
benefit of $36 million to operating income from adjustments to its SFO and LAX
municipal bond obligations and its pilot non-qualified pension plan obligations.
These matters are discussed above and in Note 19, “Special Items.”  The net benefit of $36 million was
classified as a Special item on the Company’s 2006

Statement of
Consolidated Operations

. The Company also recorded an additional $29
million net benefit in 2006, which was due to the resolution of numerous
outstanding issues related primarily to the Company’s aircraft, professional
fees and taxes subsequent to the Company’s emergence from bankruptcy.

(2) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

(a)

Basis
of Presentation

—

UAL is a holding company whose principal
subsidiary is United. The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of UAL Corporation and all of its majority-owned affiliates. All
significant intercompany transactions are eliminated. Certain prior year amounts
have been reclassified to conform to the current year’s presentation.

Upon emergence from its Chapter 11 proceedings, the
Company adopted fresh-start reporting in accordance with SOP 90-7 as of February 1,
2006. The Company’s emergence from reorganization resulted in a new reporting
entity with no retained earnings or accumulated deficit as of February 1,
2006. Accordingly, the Company’s consolidated financial statements for periods
before February 1, 2006 are not comparable to consolidated financial statements
presented on or after February 1, 2006.

(b)

Use
of Estimates

—The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Under fresh-start reporting, the Company’s asset
values are remeasured using fair value, which is allocated using the purchase
method of accounting in conformity with SFAS 141. In addition, fresh-start
reporting also requires that all liabilities, other than deferred taxes, should
be stated at fair value, or at the present values of the amounts to be paid
using appropriate market interest rates. Deferred taxes are determined in
conformity with SFAS 109.

Estimates of the fair value of assets and liabilities
were determined based on the Company’s best estimates as discussed in Note 1, “Voluntary
Reorganization Under Chapter 11—Fresh-Start Reporting,” above. These estimates
and assumptions are inherently subject to significant uncertainties and
contingencies beyond the control of the Company. Accordingly, the Company
cannot provide assurance that the estimates, assumptions, and values reflected
in the valuations will be realized, and actual results could vary materially.

(c)

Airline
Revenues

—The value of unused passenger tickets and miscellaneous
charge orders (“MCO’s”) are included in current liabilities as advance ticket
sales. United records passenger ticket sales as operating revenues when the
transportation is provided or when the ticket expires. Non-refundable tickets
generally expire on the date of the intended flight, unless the date is
extended by notification from the customer on or before the intended flight
date. Fees charged in association with changes or extensions to nonrefundable
tickets are recorded as passenger revenue at the time the fee is incurred.
Change fees related to non-refundable tickets are considered a separate
transaction from the air


transportation because
they represent a charge for the Company’s additional service to modify a
previous order. Therefore, the pricing of the change fee and the initial
customer order are separately determined and represent distinct earnings
processes. Refundable tickets expire after one year. MCO’s are stored value
documents that are either exchanged for a passenger ticket or refunded after
issuance. United records an estimate of MCO’s that will not be exchanged or refunded
as revenue ratably over the validity period based on historical results. Due to
complex industry pricing structures, refund and exchange policies, and
interline agreements with other airlines, certain amounts are recognized as
revenue using estimates both as to the timing of recognition and the amount of
revenue to be recognized. These estimates are based on the evaluation of actual
historical results. United recognizes cargo and mail revenue as service is
provided.

(d)

Cash
and Cash Equivalents, Short-Term Investments and Restricted Cash—

Cash
in excess of operating requirements is invested in short-term, highly liquid,
income-producing investments. Investments with a maturity of three months or
less on their acquisition date are classified as cash and cash equivalents. Other
investments are classified as short-term investments. Investments classified as
held-to-maturity are stated at amortized cost, which approximates market due to
their short-term maturities. Investments in debt securities classified as
available-for-sale are stated at fair value. The gains or losses from sales of
available-for-sale securities are included in interest income.

At December 31, 2006, the Successor Company’s
investments in debt securities classified as held-to-maturity included $3.8
billion recorded in cash and cash equivalents and $312 million recorded in
short-term investments. At December 31, 2005, the Predecessor Company’s
investments in debt securities included $1.6 billion classified as
held-to-maturity and recorded in cash and cash equivalents and $77 million
classified as available-for-sale and recorded in short-term investments.

The Successor Company had $341 million classified as
short-term restricted cash at December 31, 2006 while the Predecessor
Company had $643 million in short-term restricted cash at December 31,
2005, representing security for workers’ compensation obligations, security
deposits for airport leases and reserves with institutions that process our
credit card ticket sales. In addition, the Successor Company had $506 million,
and the Predecessor Company had $314 million, in long-term restricted cash at
December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Financial and other institutions
with which the Company conducts its business may require additional levels of
security deposits or reserve holdbacks.

(e)

Aircraft
Fuel, Spare Parts and Supplies

—

In accordance with fresh-start
reporting, aircraft fuel, maintenance and operating supplies were revalued to
estimated fair values on February 1, 2006. Flight equipment spare parts
were also stated at estimated fair value at the Effective Date. The Company
records fuel, maintenance, operating supplies, and aircraft spare parts at cost
when acquired, and provides an obsolescence allowance for aircraft spare parts.

(f)

Operating
Property and Equipment

—

Owned operating property and equipment,
and equipment under capital leases, were stated at fair value as of
February 1, 2006. The Company records additions to owned operating
property and equipment at cost when acquired. Property under capital leases,
and the related obligation for future lease payments, is recorded at an amount
equal to the initial present value of those lease payments.

Depreciation and amortization of owned depreciable
assets is based on the straight-line method over the assets’ estimated service
lives. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the remaining term of the
lease, including estimated facility renewal options when renewal is reasonably
assured at key airports, or the estimated service life of the related asset,
whichever is less. Aircraft are depreciated to estimated salvage values,
generally over lives of 27 to 30 years; buildings are depreciated over lives of
25 to 45 years; and other property and equipment are depreciated over lives of
4 to 15 years.


Properties under capital
leases are amortized on the straight-line method over the life of the lease or,
in the case of certain aircraft, over their estimated service lives. Lease
terms are 9 to 17 years for aircraft and 40 years for buildings. Amortization
of capital leases is included in depreciation and amortization expense.

Maintenance and repairs,
including the cost of minor replacements, are charged to maintenance expense as
incurred, except for costs incurred under our power-by-the-hour engine maintenance
agreements, which are expensed based upon the number of hours flown. Costs of
additions to and renewals of units of property are capitalized as property and
equipment additions.

(g)

Mileage Plus Awards

—

As a result of
the adoption of fresh-start reporting, the Mileage Plus frequent flyer
obligation was revalued at the Effective Date to reflect the estimated fair
value of miles to be redeemed in the future. Outstanding miles earned by flying
United or its partner carriers were revalued using a weighted-average per-mile
equivalent ticket value, taking into account such factors as differing classes
of service and domestic and international ticket itineraries, which can be
reflected in awards chosen by Mileage Plus members.

The Successor Company also
elected to change its accounting policy as of the Effective Date from an
incremental cost basis to a deferred revenue model, to measure its obligation
for miles to be redeemed based upon the equivalent ticket value of similar
fares on United or amounts paid to other Star Alliance partners, as applicable.

For customer accounts
which are inactive for a period of 36 consecutive months, it is United’s policy
to cancel all miles contained in those accounts at the end of the 36 month
period of inactivity. The Company recognizes revenue from the breakage
of miles in such deactivated accounts by amortizing such breakage over the 36-month
expiration period.

In early 2007, the Company
announced that it will reduce the expiration period from 36 months to 18 months
effective December 31, 2007. Additional future changes to program rules and
program redemption opportunities can significantly alter customer behavior from
historical patterns, which may result in material changes to the deferred
revenue balance, as well as passenger revenues.

At December 31, 2006,
the Successor Company had recorded deferred revenue for its frequent flyer
program of $3.7 billion related to award travel, of which $1.1 billion was
current. At December 31, 2005, the Predecessor Company had recorded deferred
revenue totaling $923 million, of which $681 million was current.

See Note 18, “Advanced
Purchase of Miles,” for additional information related to the Mileage Plus
program.

(h)

Deferred Gains

—

Gains on aircraft
sale and leaseback transactions are deferred and amortized over the terms of
the related leases as a reduction of aircraft rent expense.

(i)

United Express

—United has agreements
under which independent regional carriers, flying under the United Express
name, connect passengers to other United Express and/or United flights (the
latter of whom we also refer to as “mainline” operations, to distinguish them
from United Express regional operations). The vast majority of United Express
flights are operated under capacity agreements, while a relatively smaller
number are operated under prorate agreements.

United Express operating
revenues and expenses are classified as “Passenger—Regional Affiliates” and “Regional
affiliates,” respectively, on the attached

Statements of Consolidated
Operations

, the latter includes both allocated and direct costs. Direct
costs represent expenses that are specifically and exclusively related to
United Express flying activities, such as capacity agreement payments,
commissions, booking fees, fuel expenses and dedicated staffing. The capacity
agreement payments are based on specific rates for various operating expenses
of the United Express carriers, such as crew expenses, maintenance and aircraft
ownership, some of which are multiplied by specific operating statistics (e.g.,
block hours, departures) while others are fixed per month. Allocated costs
represent


United Express’s portion
of shared expenses and include charges for items such as airport operating
costs, reservation-related costs, credit card discount fees and facility rents.
For each of these expense categories, the Company estimates United Express’s
portion of total expense and allocates the applicable portion of expense to the
United Express carrier.

United has the right to
exclusively operate and direct the operations of these aircraft, and
accordingly the minimum future lease payments for these United Express
- -operated aircraft are included in the Company’s lease obligations. See Note 9,
“Segment Information” and Note 16, “Lease Obligations,” for additional information
related to United Express.

The Company recognizes
revenue as flown on a net basis for the United Express prorate carriers.

United has call options on
152 regional jet aircraft currently being operated by certain United Express
carriers. Generally, these options are intended to allow United to secure
control over regional jets used for United Express routes only when a United
Express carrier contract is terminated early due to performance or safety issues,
breach of codeshare limitations or is wrongfully terminated by the regional
affiliate carrier. The options would allow United to have an alternative to
replace capacity that was previously provided by a cancelled United Express
contract. The conditions under which United can exercise these call options
vary by contract, but include operational performance metrics and in some cases
the financial standing of one or both of the parties. At December 31,
2006, none of the call options were exercisable.

(j)

Advertising

—

Advertising costs, which are included in other operating expenses, are
expensed as incurred. Upon adoption of fresh-start reporting, the Company
changed its accounting policy to record the Mileage Plus obligation using a
deferred revenue model. Before emergence from bankruptcy, the Predecessor
Company recorded both deferred revenue and advertising expense relating to
Mileage Plus activity using an incremental cost method.

(k)

Intangibles

—Goodwill represents the excess of the
reorganization value of the Successor Company over the fair value of net
tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities resulting
from the application of SOP 90-7. Identifiable intangible assets consist
primarily of international route authorities, trade-names, the Mileage Plus
customer database, airport slots and gates, certain favorable contracts, hubs,
patents, and other items. Most airport slots, international route authorities
and trade-names are indefinite-lived and, as such, are not amortized. Instead,
these indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually
or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the asset may be
impaired. The
Mileage Plus customer database is amortized on an accelerated basis utilizing
cash flows correlating to the expected attrition rate of the Mileage Plus
database. The other customer relationships, which are included in “Contracts”
in the table below, are amortized in a manner consistent with the timing and
amount of revenues that the Company expects to generate from these customer
relationships. All other definite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a
straight-line basis over the estimated lives of the related assets.

In
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, “

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

” (“SFAS 142”), the
Company applies a fair value-based impairment test to the net book value of
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets on an annual basis as of October 1,
or on an interim basis whenever a triggering event occurs.

No impairments of
goodwill or indefinite-lived assets have been identified since the Effective
Date.

As discussed in Note 9, “Segment Information,

”

in 2006 the Company determined that it has

two reportable segments that
reflect the management of its business: 
mainline and

United
Express. Prior to this determination, the Company’s reportable segments
under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, “

Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information

,”
(“SFAS 131”) included four geographic segments and UAL Loyalty Services,
LLC (“ULS”).  At the Effective Date, the
Company allocated goodwill to the Pacific, Latin America and ULS segments.


After determining the
Company’s reportable segments were mainline and

United Express, the Company
reevaluated the goodwill allocation and determined that all goodwill was in the
mainline segment. SFAS 142 requires
that a two-step impairment test be performed on goodwill. In the first step,
the Company compares the fair value of each reportable segment to its carrying
value. If the fair value of a reportable segment exceeds the carrying value of
the net assets of the reportable segment, goodwill is not impaired and the
Company is not required to perform further testing. If the carrying value of
the net assets of a reportable segment exceeds the fair value of the reportable
segment, then the Company must perform the second step to determine the implied
fair value of the goodwill and compare it to the carrying value of the goodwill.
If the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then the
Company must record an impairment charge equal to such difference.

The Company assesses the
fair value of the mainline segment considering both the market and income
approaches. Under the market approach, the fair value of the reportable segment
is based on a comparison of similar publicly traded companies. Under the income
approach, the fair value of the reportable segment is based on the present
value of estimated future cash flows. The income approach is dependent on a
number of assumptions including estimates of future capacity, passenger yield,
traffic, operating costs including jet fuel prices, appropriate discount rates
and other relevant assumptions.

The following table presents information about the
intangible assets of the Successor and Predecessor companies, including
goodwill, at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively:

The Company initially recorded goodwill of $2,756 million
upon its exit from bankruptcy. During the eleven month period ended December 31,
2006, goodwill was decreased by $62 million due to Successor Company tax
activity that impacted the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, and
increased by $9 million due to net adjustments to the fair values of
certain assets and liabilities, resulting in goodwill of $2,703 million at
December 31, 2006. Total amortization
expense recognized was approximately $1 million for the one month period ended January 31,
2006, $169 million for the eleven month period ended December 31, 2006 and
$8 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The Company expects to
record amortization expense of $155 million, $92 million, $69 million, $64
million and $58 million for 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011, respectively.


(l)

Measurement of Impairments

—

In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 144, “

Accounting for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

” and SFAS 142, the
Company evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets and intangible assets
subject to amortization whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that an impairment may exist. An impairment charge is recognized when the asset’s
carrying value exceeds its net undiscounted future cash flows and its fair
market value. The amount of the charge is the difference between the asset’s
carrying value and fair market value. At December 31, 2006, the Company
had assets held-for-sale of $13 million. In 2006, the Company recorded an
impairment charge of $5 million to decrease the carrying value of assets
held-for-sale to their estimated fair value. See Note 19, “Special Items,” for
information related to the 2005 impairment charge.

(m)

Share-Based Compensation

—The Company
adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (Revised
2004),

“Share-Based Payment”

(“SFAS 123R”)
effective January 1, 2006. This pronouncement requires companies to
measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of
equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award. The
resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is
required to provide service in exchange for the award, usually the vesting
period.

Before
the adoption of SFAS 123R, the Company accounted for these plans under
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,

“Accounting
for Stock Issued to Employees,”

(“APB 25”) and disclosed the pro
forma compensation expense as required under

Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 123,

“Accounting for Stock Based Compensation,”

(“SFAS 123”).
No stock-based employee compensation cost for stock options is reflected in the
Company’s financial statements for 2005 or 2004, as all options granted had an
exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the
date of grant.

If compensation cost for stock-based employee
compensation plans had been determined using the fair value recognition
provisions of SFAS 123, the Company would have reported its 2005 and 2004
net loss and loss per share as the pro forma amounts indicated below:

Excise Taxes

—Certain governmental
taxes are imposed on United’s ticket sales through a fee included in ticket
prices. United collects these fees and remits them to the appropriate
government agency. These fees are recorded on a net basis (excluded from
operating revenues).

(o)

Adopted Accounting Pronouncements—

As
discussed above, the Company adopted SFAS 123R effective January 1,
2006. In addition, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158,

“Employers’
Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans—an
amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)”

(“SFAS 158”)
in September 2006, which requires companies to recognize the overfunded or
underfunded status of all defined benefit postretirement plans as an asset or
liability in the statement of financial position and to recognize changes in
that funded status through comprehensive income in the year in which the
changes occur. As part of the adoption of fresh-start reporting in accordance


with SOP 90-7
as of February 1, 2006, the obligation for the Company’s defined benefit
postretirement plans was recorded at fair value in the Company’s

Statements of Consolidated Financial Position

. See Note 8, “Retirement
and Postretirement Plans,” for additional information regarding the impact of
adoption of SFAS 158.

(p)

New Accounting Pronouncements—

In July 2006,
the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, “

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an interpretation of FASB
Statement No. 109

” (“FIN 48”), which modifies the
accounting and disclosure associated with certain aspects of recognition and
measurement related to accounting for income taxes. FIN 48 is effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The FASB proposed FASB
Staff Position (“FSP”) No. 48-a,

“Definition of Settlement in FASB Interpretation No. 48,”

that would provide additional guidance related to FIN 48. This FSP could be
issued in early 2007 after the March 28, 2007 comment deadline. In light
of the significance of this new accounting interpretation and pending issuance
of the FSP, the Company has not yet determined the impact of the adoption of
FIN 48 on the Company’s financial position or results of operations.

In September 2006,
the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157,

“Fair Value Measurements”

(“SFAS 157”), which defines
fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands
disclosure about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 does not require any
new fair value measurements; rather it specifies valuation methods and
disclosures to be applied when fair value measurements are required under
existing or future accounting pronouncements. SFAS 157 is effective for
fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within
those fiscal years. The Company has not determined the impact of SFAS 157
on its results of operations or financial position.

In September 2006,
the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108 (“SAB No. 108”),
which provides guidance for the quantification and evaluation of materiality of
financial statement misstatements. The Company applied the provisions of SAB No. 108
in the preparation of its financial statements for the year ended December 31,
2006. The adoption of this guidance did not impact the Company’s financial
statements.

In November 2006, the
FASB ratified EITF Issue No. 06-06, “

Debtor’s
Accounting for a Modification (or Exchange) of Convertible Debt Instruments

”
(“EITF 06-6”). This standard amends EITF Issue No. 96-19, “

Debtor’s Accounting for a Modification or Exchange of Debt Instruments

”
and supersedes EITF Issue No. 05-07, “

Accounting
for Modifications to Conversion Options Embedded in Debt Instruments and
Related Issues

.”  This standard affects issuers that modify the
terms of (or that exchange) convertible debt instruments that contain an
embedded conversion option not accounted for as a derivative under Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, “

Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

” (“SFAS 133”)
and the testing criteria. This EITF applies to modifications (or exchanges) in
interim or annual reporting periods beginning after November 29, 2006.

In November 2006, the
FASB ratified EITF Issue No. 06-07, “

Issuer’s
Accounting for a Previously Bifurcated Conversion Option in a Convertible Debt
Instrument When the Conversion Option No Longer Meets the Bifurcation Criteria
in FASB Statement No. 133

” (“EITF 06-07”). EITF 06-07
affects convertible debt issuers with previously bifurcated conversion options
that no longer require separate derivative accounting under SFAS 133. EITF
06-07 states that when a previously bifurcated conversion option no
longer requires separate accounting, the issuer shall disclose (1) a
description of the change causing the conversion option to no longer require
bifurcation and (2) the amount of the derivative liability reclassified to
shareholders’ equity. EITF 06-07 is effective for interim and annual
periods beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company expects EITF 06-07
will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.


In February 2006, the
FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 159,

“The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Liabilities Including
an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115”

(“SFAS 159”). This
statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and
certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be
measured at fair value. The objective of SFAS 159 is to improve financial
reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in
reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities
differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. SFAS 159
also established presentation and disclosure requirements designed to
facilitate comparisons between entities that choose different measurement
attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. This statement does not
affect any existing accounting literature that requires certain assets and
liabilities to be carried at fair value. This statement is effective for the
Company as of January 1, 2008; however, early adoption is permitted. The
Company has not determined the impact, if any, that adoption of this statement
will have on its consolidated financial statements.

(q)

Tax Contingencies

—In
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, “

Accounting for Contingencies,”

the Company

has recorded
reserves for taxes and associated interest that may become payable in future
years as a result of audits by tax authorities. Although it believes that the
positions taken by the Company on previously filed tax returns are reasonable,
the Company nevertheless has established tax and interest reserves in recognition
that various taxing authorities may challenge certain of the positions taken by
the Company, potentially resulting in additional liabilities for taxes and
interest. The Company’s tax contingency reserves are reviewed periodically and
are adjusted as events occur that affect its estimates, such as the
availability of new information, the lapsing of applicable statutes of
limitations, the conclusion of tax audits, the measurement of additional
estimated liability based on current calculations, the identification of new
tax contingencies, the release of administrative tax guidance affecting its
estimates of tax liabilities, or the rendering of relevant court decisions.

(3) Common
Stockholders’ Equity

As a
result the Plan of Reorganization becoming effective on February 1, 2006,
the then-outstanding equity securities as well as the shares held in treasury
of the Predecessor Company were canceled. New shares of UAL common stock began
trading on the NASDAQ market on February 2, 2006 under the symbol “UAUA”. In
accordance with the Plan of Reorganization, the Successor Company established
the equity structure in the table below upon emergence.

Pursuant to the Plan of
Reorganization, on February 2, 2006 the Successor Company began distributing
portions of the total 125 million shares of new common stock to certain
general unsecured creditors and employees and certain management employees and
non-employee directors. The remaining undistributed shares will be distributed
periodically to employees and holders of previously allowed claims and disputed
claims that are pending final resolution, as well as to certain management
employees and non-employee directors of the Successor Company who may receive
awards under stock compensation plans. All treasury shares were MEIP shares
acquired either for tax withholding obligations or as consideration under an
employment agreement. Forfeited MEIP shares or MEIP shares that are settled for
cash or stock are automatically available again for issuance under the MEIP. For
further details, see Note 4, “Per Share Amounts” and Note 5, “Share-Based
Compensation Plans.”

(4) Per Share Amounts

In
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, “

Earnings per Share

” (“SFAS 128”), basic per share amounts
were computed by dividing earnings (loss) available to common shareholders by
the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding. Approximately
7 million shares remaining to be issued to unsecured creditors and
employees under the Plan of Reorganization are included in outstanding basic
shares as the necessary conditions for issuance have been satisfied. The table
below represents the reconciliation of the basic earnings per share to diluted
earnings per share.

In
accordance with SFAS 128, no potential common share is included in the diluted
per share computation if it is antidilutive. When an entity reports a loss
available for common shareholders, the effect of including potential common
shares is antidilutive. Accordingly, the Company did not include any


potential
common shares in the diluted earnings per share computations for the periods
that resulted in a loss. For the eleven month period ended December 31,
2006, the one month period ended January 31, 2006 and the years ended December 31,
2005 and 2004, the Company did not include 5 million, 9 million, 9 million
and 10 million of outstanding stock options, respectively, in the diluted per
share computation as they were antidilutive during those periods based on
application of the treasury stock method. In addition, for the eleven months
ended December 31, 2006, the Company did not include 21 million of
potential common shares related to the Limited-Subordination Notes, 11 million
of potential common shares related to the preferred securities or 3 million of
potential common shares related to the 5% convertible notes in the diluted per
share computation as they were determined to be antidilutive.

(5) Share-Based Compensation Plans

See Note 2(m), “Share-Based Compensation,” for
information regarding the Company’s adoption of SFAS 123R effective January 1,
2006, and pro forma compensation expense for 2005 and 2004.

Predecessor Company—

As
of January 31, 2006, a total of 9 million stock options were outstanding. The
Company did not issue any stock-based awards during 2005 or 2004. Under the
Company’s Plan of Reorganization, these stock options were canceled on the
Effective Date. No material share-based compensation expense was incurred as a
result of these outstanding options for the month of January 2006.

Successor Company—

As part
of the Plan of Reorganization and as described in more detail below, the
Bankruptcy Court approved the Company’s share-based compensation plans known as
the MEIP and the DEIP which became effective on February 1, 2006. The
following table summarizes the number of awards authorized, issued and
available for future grants under each plan as of December 31, 2006:

During the second quarter
of 2006, the Company revised its initial estimated award forfeiture rate of
7.5% to 15% based upon actual attrition. As a result, the share-based
compensation expense was reduced by approximately $7 million for the eleven
month period ended December 31, 2006.

As of December 31,
2006, approximately $80 million of total unrecognized costs related to
nonvested shares are expected to be recognized over the remaining
weighted-average period of 3.1 years. Approximately $45 million is expected to
be recognized in 2007.

Management Equity
Incentive Plan.

The Human Resources Subcommittee
of the UAL Board of Directors (the “HR Subcommittee”) is authorized under the
plan to grant equity-based and other performance-based awards (“Award(s)”) to
executive officers and other key management employees of the Company and its
subsidiaries.


All executive
officers and other key management employees of the Company and its subsidiaries
are eligible to become participants in the MEIP. The HR Subcommittee will
select from time to time, from among all eligible individuals, the persons who
will be granted an Award. The MEIP authorizes the HR Subcommittee to grant any
of a variety of incentive Awards to participants, including the following:

·

stock
options, including both tax qualified and non-qualified options,

·

stock
appreciation rights, which provide the participant the right to receive the
excess (if any) of the fair market value of a specified number of shares of
common stock at the time of exercise over the grant price of the stock
appreciation right,

·

stock
awards to be granted at no cost to the participant, including grants in the form
of (i) an immediate transfer of shares which are subject to forfeiture and
certain transfer restrictions (“Restricted Stock”); and (ii) an immediate
transfer of shares which are not subject to forfeiture or a deferred transfer
of shares if and when the conditions specified by the HR Subcommittee are met (“Unrestricted
Stock”), and

·

performance-based
awards, in which the HR Subcommittee may grant a stock award that will entitle
the holder to receive a specified number of shares of common stock, or the cash
value thereof, if certain performance goals are met.

The shares may be issued from authorized and unissued
shares of common stock or from the Company’s treasury stock. The exercise price
for each underlying share of common stock under all options and stock
appreciation rights awarded under the MEIP will not be less than the fair
market value of a share of common stock on the date of grant or as otherwise
determined by the HR Subcommittee.

The
table below summarizes stock option activity pursuant to the Company’s MEIP
stock options for the period February 1 through December 31, 2006:

The
weighted-average fair value of options granted for the period February 1,
2006 to December 31, 2006, was determined to be $21.37 based on the
following assumptions:

Risk-free
  interest rate

4.4-5.1

%

Dividend yield


%

Expected market
  price volatility of our common stock

55-57

%

Expected life of options
  (years)

5.0-6.2


The fair value of options was determined at the grant
date using a Black-Scholes option pricing model, which requires the Company to
make several assumptions. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S.
Treasury yield curve in effect for the expected term of the option at the time
of grant. The dividend yield on the Company’s common stock is assumed to be
zero since it does not pay dividends and has no current plans to do so in the
future.

The volatility assumptions were based upon historical
volatilities of comparable airlines whose shares are traded using daily stock
price returns equivalent to the contractual term of the option. Due to its
emergence from more than three years in bankruptcy, historical volatility data
for UAL was not considered in determining expected volatility. The Company did
consider implied volatility data for both UAL and comparable airlines, using
current exchange-traded options.

The expected life of the options was determined based
upon a simplified assumption that the option will be exercised evenly from
vesting to expiration under the transitional guidance of Staff Accounting
Bulletin No. 107, Topic 14, “Share-Based Payments.”

The stock options typically vest over a four year
period, except for awards to retirement-eligible employees, which are
considered vested at the grant date.

table below summarizes Restricted Stock activity for the period February 1
through December 31, 2006:

Under SFAS 123R, the fair value of
the Restricted Stock awards was based upon the volume weighted-average share
price on the date of grant. The Restricted Stock awards typically vest over
four years, except for awards to retirement-eligible employees, which are
considered vested at the grant date. Approximately 2.5  million of the 2.7 million
nonvested restricted stock awards at December 31, 2006 are expected to
vest.

Director Equity Incentive
Plan.

The Nominating/Governance Committee of the
Board of Directors (the “Governance Committee”) is authorized to grant equity-based
awards to non-employee directors of the Company under the plan. The DEIP
authorizes the Governance Committee to grant any of a variety of incentive
awards to participants, including the following:

·

non-qualified
stock options,

·

stock
appreciation rights, which provide the participant the right to receive the
excess (if any) of the fair market value of a specified number of shares of
common stock at the time of exercise over the grant price of the stock
appreciation right,

·

stock
awards to be granted at no cost to the participant, including grants in the
form of Restricted Stock and Unrestricted Stock,

·

annual
compensation in the form of credits to a participant’s share account
established under the DEIP, and


·

shares
of common stock in lieu of receipt of all or any portion of cash amounts
payable by the Company to a participant including retainer fees, board
attendance fees and committee fees (but excluding expense reimbursements and
similar items).

The
shares may be issued from authorized and unissued shares of common stock or
from the Company’s treasury stock. The exercise price for each underlying share
of common stock under all options and stock appreciation rights awarded under
the DEIP will not be less than the fair market value of a share of common stock
on the date of grant. Each option granted under the DEIP will generally expire
10 years after its date of grant. The 100,000 unrestricted shares issued under
the DEIP in the eleven month period ended December 31, 2006 immediately
vested on their respective grant dates.

(6) Income Taxes

In 2006 and
2005, UAL incurred both a regular tax loss and an alternative minimum
tax (“AMT”) loss. The primary differences between its regular tax loss and AMT
loss were certain depreciation adjustments and preferences.

The
significant components of the deferred income tax provision (credit) are as
follows:

As a result of the Company’s
emergence from bankruptcy, the Company has an unrealized tax benefit of $782
million at December 31, 2006, resulting from an excess tax deduction of
$2.1 billion. The excess tax deduction represents the difference between the
total tax deduction available, which is equal to the fair value of the
common stock issued to certain unsecured creditors and employees pursuant to
the Plan of Reorganization, and the amount of the deduction attributable to the
amount expensed, which is the value of the stock determined in the Plan of
Reorganization. The Company has accounted for the excess tax deduction by
analogy to SFAS 123R and will recognize this deduction when it is realized as a
reduction of taxes payable.

At December 31, 2006, UAL Corporation and its
subsidiaries had $291 million of federal AMT credits. Additionally, the Company
has $2.4 billion of federal tax benefits and $271 million of state tax
benefits, relating to net operating losses which may be carried forward to
reduce the tax liabilities of future years. This tax benefit is mostly
attributable to federal NOL carry forwards of $7.0 billion. If not
utilized, the federal tax benefits of $1.1 billion expire in 2022, $0.4 billion
expire in 2023, $0.5 billion
expire in 2024 and $0.4 billion expire in 2025. In addition, the state tax
benefit, if not utilized, expires over a five to twenty year period.

At December 31,
2006, the federal and state net operating loss (“NOL”) carry forward was
reduced by discharge of indebtedness income of $1.3 billion resulting from
bankruptcy-related negotiations. At this time, the Company does not believe
that the limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code on the usage of the
NOL carry forward and other tax attributes following an ownership change will
have an effect on the Company.  Therefore, the Company does not believe its
exit from bankruptcy has had any material impact on the utilization of its
remaining NOL carry forward and other tax attributes.

The Company’s management
assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets, and records a valuation
allowance for the deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a
portion, or all of the deferred tax assets, will not be realized. The ultimate
realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future
taxable income (including the reversals of deferred tax liabilities) during the
periods in which those temporary differences will become deductible. As such,
the Company has a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets as of December 31,
2006 and 2005, to reflect management’s assessment regarding the realizability
of the deferred tax assets. The Company expects to continue to maintain a
valuation allowance on deferred tax assets until other positive evidence is
sufficient


to
justify realization. With the adoption of fresh-start reporting, a valuation
allowance of $2,310 million was established which, if reversed in future
periods, will be allocated to reduce goodwill and then other intangible assets.

(7) Investments

The Company had cost
method investments of $91 million and $5 million at December 31, 2006 and
2005, respectively. The Company revalued its investments to their estimated
fair values as of the Effective Date in accordance with SOP 90-7. Since
that time, there have been no triggering events that required the Company to
evaluate any of these investments for impairment.

On September 29,
2004, Cendant and Orbitz announced their planned merger. Cendant offered to
acquire all of the outstanding common stock of Orbitz for cash. The Company
entered into a stockholder agreement to tender its shares. After Bankruptcy
Court approval, United tendered all of its shares in Orbitz for $185 million in
cash, resulting in a gain of $158 million.

(8) Retirement and
Postretirement Plans

Historically, the Company
has maintained various retirement plans, both defined benefit (qualified and
non-qualified) and defined contribution, which have covered substantially all
employees. The Company also has provided certain health care benefits,
primarily in the U.S., to retirees and eligible dependents, as well as certain
life insurance benefits to certain retirees reflected as “Other Benefits” in
the tables below. The Company has reserved the right, subject to collective
bargaining agreements, to modify or terminate the health care and life
insurance benefits for both current and future retirees.

Upon emergence from bankruptcy on February 1,
2006, the Company completed a revaluation of the postretirement liabilities
resulting in a reduction of the net accumulated benefit obligation of
approximately $28 million. In accordance with SOP 90-7 upon emergence,
the Company also accelerated the recognition of net unrecognized actuarial gains
and losses, prior service costs and transition obligation pertaining to its
foreign pension plans and postretirement plans upon emergence, and recorded a
reorganization expense thereon. The unrecognized costs as of January 31,
2006 that were recognized as part of fresh-start reporting are reported in the
table below.

With the termination of the Company’s domestic
defined benefit retirement plans, the Company has reached agreements with
all of its employee groups to implement replacement plans, largely defined
contribution plans. See “Defined Contribution Plans,” below, for further
information.

On December 30, 2004,
the PBGC filed a complaint against the Company in the District Court to seek
the involuntary termination of the Pilot Plan, with benefit accruals terminated
effective December 30, 2004. The Company recorded a $152 million
curtailment charge in the fourth quarter of 2004 relating to the PBGC’s
involuntary termination action and reclassified the associated pension
obligations of $2.5 billion to Liabilities subject to compromise.

In April 2005, United
and the PBGC entered into a global settlement agreement which provided for the
settlement and compromise of various disputes and controversies with respect to
these pension plans. In May 2005, the Bankruptcy Court approved the
settlement agreement, including modifications requested by certain creditors.

The PBGC assumed
responsibility for the assets of the Ground Plan effective May 23, 2005
(with a termination date of March 11, 2005), the Flight Attendant and the
MAPC Plans effective June 30, 2005 and the Pilot Plan effective October 26,
2005, and the Company has no further duties or rights with respect to these
plans. On March 17, 2006, the Bankruptcy Court ruled that the Company’s
obligations regarding non-qualified benefits that were earned under the Pilot
Plan ceased on January 31, 2006. See Note 1, “Voluntary Reorganization
Under Chapter 11—Significant Matters Remaining to be Resolved in Chapter 11
Cases,” items (c) and (d), for further details on Plan termination matters
still pending in litigation. In 2005, the Company recorded an additional $640
million in curtailment charges related to these Pension Plans and reclassified
an additional $1.9 billion of pension obligations to Liabilities subject


to
compromise. The Company also recorded approximately $7.2 billion of PBGC
allowable claims in Liabilities subject to compromise in accordance with the
confirmed Plan of Reorganization. In addition, the Company recognized net
settlement losses of approximately $1.1 billion in 2005 in accordance with SFAS
88.

As part of fresh-start reporting, the Company
also adjusted its remaining retirement plan obligations to fair value. See Note
1, “Voluntary Reorganization Under Chapter 11—Fresh-Start Reporting,” for more
information.

behavior of the broad financial markets and the Company’s investment portfolio,
taking into consideration input from the plans’ investment consultant and

management performance.

The Company believes that the long-term asset
allocations on average will approximate the targeted allocations and regularly
reviews the actual asset allocations to periodically rebalance the investments
to the targeted allocations when appropriate. The target asset allocations are
established with the objective of achieving the plans’ expected return on
assets without undue investment risk.

Expected
2007 contributions are $14 million for the pension plans and $173 million for
the other postretirement benefit plans. The following benefit payments are

Defined
Contribution Plans

In place of the domestic defined benefit pension plans
that were terminated during bankruptcy, the Company enhanced its contributions
to the defined contribution plans for most employee groups. Contributions are
based on matching percentages, years of service and/or eligible earnings. The
Company’s contribution percentages vary from 2% to 15% of eligible earnings
depending on the terms of each plan. The Company agreed to contribute to most
of its defined contribution plans effective in June and July 2005,
although such contributions for 2005 were not funded until shortly after the
Effective Date.

Effective March 1,
2006, an International Association of Machinists (“IAM”) replacement plan was
implemented. The IAM replacement plan is a multi-employer plan whereby the
assets contributed by the Company (based on hours worked) may be used to
provide benefits to employees of other participating companies, since assets
contributed by all participating companies are not segregated or restricted to
provide benefits specifically to employees of one participating company. In
accordance with the applicable accounting for multi-employer plans, the Company
would only recognize a withdrawal obligation if it becomes probable it would
withdraw from the plan. The Predecessor Company recorded expense from defined
contribution plans of $16 million for the month of January 2006 and $122
million and $92 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. The Successor Company recognized $206 million of expense for
the eleven months ended December 31, 2006 for all of the Company’s defined
contribution employee retirement plans, of which $21 million related to the IAM
multi-employer plan.

(9) Segment Information

Segments.

The Company manages its
business by two reportable segments: mainline and United Express. In 2006, in
light of the Company’s bankruptcy-related restructuring and organizational
changes, management reevaluated the Company’s segment reporting. As a result,
management determined that the geographic regions and ULS, which were
previously reported as segments, are no longer reportable segments requiring
disclosure under SFAS 131. UAL now manages its business as an integrated
network with assets deployed across various regions, whereas in the past United
focused its business management decisions within specific geographic regions
and services instead of as an integrated network. This new approach seeks to
allocate resources to maximize the profitability of the overall airline
network.

The accounting policies for each of these segments are
the same as those described in Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies,” except that segment financial information has been prepared using a
management approach which is consistent with how the Company internally
disperses financial information for the purpose of making internal operating
decisions. The Company evaluates segment financial performance based on
earnings before income taxes, special items, reorganization items, and gain on
sale of investments. As discussed in the notes to the tables below, the Company
does not allocate corporate overhead expenses to its

United Express segment. Certain
selling and operational costs are allocated to United Express. See Note 2(i), “Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies—United Express” for additional information related to United Express expenses.


The following table
includes financial information, which has been restated from prior period
presentation to conform to the Company’s new mainline and United Express
segments, for the eleven month period ended December 31, 2006, the one
month period ended January 31, 2006 and the years ended December 31,
2005 and 2004:

Equity earnings are part
of the mainline segment. Accordingly, the pre-tax equity earnings are included
in the mainline segment results. Income taxes on equity earnings are subtracted
from segment earnings to reconcile the sum of pre-tax income and equity
earnings, which is presented net of tax in the

Statements

.

The Company does not allocate interest income or
interest expense to the United Express segment in reports used to evaluate
segment performance. Therefore, all amounts classified as interest income and
interest expense in the

Statements of Consolidated
Operations

relate to the mainline segment.

In accordance with SFAS 142, on the Effective Date the
Company allocated goodwill upon adoption of fresh-start reporting in a manner
similar to how the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is
determined. This required the determination of the fair value of each
reportable segment to calculate an estimated purchase price for such segment. This
purchase price was then allocated to the individual assets and liabilities
assumed to be related to that segment. Any excess purchase price is the amount
of goodwill assigned to that segment. To the extent that individual assets and
liabilities could be assigned directly to specific segments, those assets and
liabilities were so assigned. This process was performed based on the Company’s
reportable segments at the time, which consisted of the ULS, North


America, Pacific,
Atlantic, and Latin America segments, and resulted in the allocation of
goodwill of $2.7 billion to the Pacific, Latin America and ULS segments.

The Company performed its annual goodwill impairment
test for goodwill at these segments and determined that there was no impairment
of goodwill. Subsequently, after concluding that the Company’s reportable
segments are mainline and United Express, a SFAS 141 goodwill allocation
process was performed, as described above, and determined that all of the
Company’s goodwill of $2.7 billion is within the mainline segment. Based on the
timing of this analysis the Company also concluded there is no impairment of
goodwill allocated to the new mainline segment. During the eleven months ended December 31,
2006, Successor Company goodwill decreased by $62 million as discussed in
Note 2(k), “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies—Intangibles.”

At December 31,
2006 and 2005, the net carrying values of mainline and United Express segment
assets were as follows:

The Company attributes revenue among the geographic
areas based upon the origin and destination of each flight segment. United’s
operations involve an insignificant level of dedicated revenue-producing assets
in geographic regions as the overwhelming majority of the Company’s revenue
producing assets (primarily U.S. registered aircraft) generally can be deployed
in any of its geographic regions, as any given aircraft may be used in multiple
geographic regions on any given day.

Credit Facility.

On the Effective Date, United entered into the Credit
Facility provided by a syndicate of banks and other financial institutions led
by J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and Citicorp Global Markets Inc., as joint lead
arrangers and joint book runners; JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (“JPMCB”) and
Citicorp USA, Inc. (“CITI”), as co-administrative agents and co-collateral
agents; General Electric Capital Corporation, as syndication agent; and JPMCB
as paying agent. The Credit Facility provided for a total commitment of up to
$3.0 billion that comprised two separate tranches: (i) Tranche A consisted
of up to $200 million revolving commitment available for Tranche A loans and
for standby letters of credit to be issued in the ordinary course of business
of United or one of its subsidiary guarantors; and (ii) Tranche B
consisted of a term loan commitment of up to $2.45 billion available at the
time of closing and additional delayed draw term loan commitments of up to $350
million available upon, among other things, United’s acquiring unencumbered
title to some or all of the 14 airframes and related engines that were subject
to United’s 1997-1 EETC financing. The Credit Facility would have matured
on February 1, 2012 but was subsequently amended in February 2007, as
explained below.

Borrowings
under the Credit Facility were at a floating interest rate based on either

a base rate, or at our option, a LIBOR rate, plus an applicable margin of 2.75%
in the case of the base rate loans and 3.75% in the case of the LIBOR loans. The
Tranche B term loan required regularly scheduled semi-annual payments of
principal equal to 0.5% of the original principal amount of the Tranche B term
loan. Interest


was
payable on the last day of the applicable interest period but in no event less
than quarterly. In March 2006, the Company entered into an interest rate
swap to mitigate its exposure to increases in interest rates under the $2.45
billion term loan. In January 2007, as a result of changes in the Company’s
mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt, the Company terminated this swap. For
further details, see Note 14, “Financial Instruments and Risk Management—Interest
Rate Swap.”

United’s
obligations under the Credit Facility were unconditionally guaranteed by UAL

and certain of the direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries of the Company,
other than certain immaterial subsidiaries (the “Guarantors”), and were secured
by a security interest in substantially all of the tangible and intangible
assets of the Guarantors. The obligations under the Credit Facility were also
secured by a pledge of the capital stock of United and the direct and indirect
subsidiaries of UAL Corporation and United, except that a pledge of any
first-tier foreign subsidiary was limited to 65% of the stock of such
subsidiary and such foreign subsidiaries were not required to pledge the stock
of their subsidiaries.

The Credit Facility
contained covenants that limited the ability of United and the Guarantors to,
among other things, incur or guarantee additional indebtedness, create liens,
pay dividends on or repurchase stock, make certain types of investments, pay
dividends or other payments from United’s direct or indirect subsidiaries,
enter into transactions with affiliates, sell assets or merge with other
companies, modify corporate documents or change lines of business. The Credit
Facility also required compliance with several financial covenants: (i) a
minimum ratio of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
and aircraft rent (“EBITDAR”) to the sum of cash interest expense, cash
aircraft rent (other than capitalized leases) and scheduled debt payments; (ii) a
minimum unrestricted cash balance of $1.2 billion; and (iii) the
market value of the collateral had to be greater than 150% of the sum of (a) the
aggregate outstanding amount of the loans plus (b) the undrawn amount of
outstanding letters of credit, plus (c) the unreimbursed amount of
drawings under any letters of credit, and (d) the termination value of
certain interest rate protection and hedging agreements with the exit lenders
and their affiliates. The Credit
Facility received a rating of B+ from Standard & Poor’s and B1 from
Moody’s Investment Services.

United used all $2.45
billion of the available borrowings under Tranche B and $161 million of the $200
million available under Tranche A of the Credit Facility at the Effective Date
to finance working capital needs and for other general corporate purposes,
including repayment of the borrowings outstanding under the DIP Financing. Subsequently,
in 2006 the Company repaid $161 million on the revolving credit line borrowings
and accessed the remaining $350 million of the delayed draw term loan.

As of December 31,
2006, the Company had outstanding borrowings of $2.8 billion of which $2,438 million
was subject to an interest rate of 9.12% with the remaining balance of $348
million at 9.125%.  In addition, letters
of credit were issued under the Credit Facility in an aggregate amount of $63 million
subject to an interest rate of 3.75%. The Company was in compliance with the
Credit Facility covenants at December 31, 2006.

Amended Credit Facility.

On February 2, 2007, the Company prepaid $972
million of its Credit Facility debt and entered into an amended and restated
revolving credit, term loan and guaranty agreement (the “Amended Credit
Facility”) that, among other things, reduced the size of the facility from $3.0
billion to $2.055 billion, reduced the applicable interest rates, and provided
for a more limited collateral package and a relaxation of certain restrictive
covenants. There were no prepayment penalties associated with this debt retirement.
In the first quarter of 2007, the Company expects to expense approximately $16
million of deferred financing costs which are related to the portion of the
Credit Facility prepaid in 2007 and included in other assets on the December 31,

Statements of Consolidated Financial Position

.

The Amended Credit
Facility was provided by a syndicate of banks and other financial institutions
led by J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and Citicorp Global Markets, Inc., as
joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunners: JPMCB and CITI, as
co-administrative agents and co-collateral agents, Credit Suisse Securities
(USA) LLC, as syndication agent, and JPMCB, as paying agent. The Amended Credit
Facility


provides
for a total commitment of up to $2.055 billion, comprised of two separate
tranches: (i) a Tranche A consisting of $255 million revolving commitment
available for Tranche A loans and standby letters of credit and (ii) a
Tranche B consisting of a term loan commitment of $1.8 billion available at the
time of closing. The Tranche A loans mature on February 1, 2012, and the
Tranche B loans mature on February 1, 2014.

Borrowings under the
Amended Credit Facility bear interest at a floating rate, which, at the Company’s
option, can be either a base rate or a LIBOR rate, plus an applicable margin of
1.0% in the case of base rate loans, and 2.0% in the case of LIBOR loans. The
Tranche B term loan requires regularly scheduled semi-annual payments of
principal equal to $9 million. Interest is payable at least every three months.
The Company may prepay some or all of the Tranche B loans from time to time, at
a price equal to 100% of the principal amount prepaid plus accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, to the date of prepayment, but without penalty or premium.

United’s obligations under the Amended Credit Facility
are unconditionally guaranteed by UAL Corporation and certain of its direct and
indirect domestic subsidiaries, other than certain immaterial subsidiaries (the
“Guarantors”); hereafter, Guarantors refers to the guarantor companies as
defined by the Amended Credit Facility. On the closing date for the Amended
Credit Facility, the obligations are secured by a security interest in the
following tangible and intangible assets of United and the Guarantors: (i) the
Pacific (Narita, China and Hong Kong) and Atlantic (Heathrow) routes (the “Primary
Routes”), (ii) primary foreign slots, primary domestic slots, certain gate
interests in domestic airport terminals and certain supporting route
facilities, (iii) certain spare engines, (iv) certain quick engine
change kits, (v) certain owned real property and related fixtures, and (vi) certain
flight simulators (the “Collateral”). After the closing date, and subject to
certain conditions, United and the Guarantors may grant a security interest in
the following assets, in substitution for certain Collateral (which may be
released from the lien in support of the Amended Credit Facility upon the
satisfaction of certain conditions): (a) certain aircraft, (b) certain
spare parts, (c) certain ground handling equipment, and (d) accounts
receivable.

The Amended Credit Facility contains covenants that
will limit the ability of United and the Guarantors to, among other things,
incur or guarantee additional indebtedness, create liens, pay dividends on or
repurchase stock, make certain types of investments, enter into transactions
with affiliates, sell assets or merge with other companies, modify corporate
documents or change lines of business. The Amended Credit Facility also
requires compliance with the following financial covenants: (i) a minimum
ratio of EBITDAR to the sum of cash interest expense, aircraft rent and
scheduled debt payments, (ii) a minimum unrestricted cash balance of $750
million, and (iii) a minimum ratio of market value of collateral to the
sum of (a) the aggregate outstanding amount of the loans plus (b) the
undrawn amount of outstanding letters of credit, plus (c) the unreimbursed
amount of drawings under such letters of credit and (d) the termination
value of certain interest rate protection and hedging agreements with the
Amended Credit Facility lenders and their affiliates, of 150% at any time, or
200% at any time following the release of Primary Routes having an appraised
value in excess of $1 billion (unless the Primary Routes are the only
collateral then pledged). Failure to comply with the Amended Credit Facility
covenants could result in a default under the Amended Credit Facility unless
the Company were to obtain a waiver of, or otherwise mitigate or cure, the
default. Additionally, the Amended Credit Facility contains a cross-default
provision with respect to other credit arrangements that exceed $50 million. A
default could result in a termination of the Amended Credit Facility and a
requirement to accelerate repayment of all outstanding facility borrowings.


Limited-Subordination
Notes.

As
discussed in Note 1, “Voluntary Reorganization Under Chapter 11—Bankruptcy
Considerations,” after the Effective Date the Company reached an agreement with
five of the seven eligible employee groups to modify certain terms of these
notes.

In July 2006,
the Company issued $726 million aggregate principal amount of 4.5% senior
limited-subordination convertible notes to irrevocable trusts established for
the benefit of certain of its employees, including employees under collective
bargaining agreements. The notes are unsecured, mature on June 30, 2021
and do not require any payment of principal before maturity. Interest is
payable semi-annually, in arrears. Interest for the first year may be paid in
shares of common stock, at the option of the Company. These notes may be
converted into common stock of the Successor Company at any time after October 23,
2006, at an initial conversion price of $34.84 which may be subject to
adjustment for certain dilutive items and events. The notes are junior, in
right of payment upon liquidation, to the Company’s obligations under the 5%
senior convertible notes and 6% senior notes discussed below in “Newly-issued
Debt.”  The notes are callable in cash
and/or Successor Company common stock beginning approximately five years after
the issuance date, except that the Company may elect to pay in common stock
only if the common stock has traded at not less than 125% of the conversion
price for the 60 consecutive trading days immediately before the redemption
date. In addition, on each of June 30, 2011 and June 30, 2016,
holders have the option to require the Company to repurchase its notes, which
the Company may elect to do through the payment of cash or Successor Company
common stock, or a combination of both.

Pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization, the notes were to
have been issued at a conversion price of $46.86, which was calculated as 125%
of the average closing common stock price for the 60 consecutive trading days
following February 1, 2006. The Plan of Reorganization also required that
the notes bear interest at a rate so that the notes would trade at par upon
issuance. Since the original conversion option was priced significantly out of
the money as of the note issuance date of July 25, 2006, the Company
agreed with employee groups to modify the conversion price to make the notes
more marketable and to provide United with a more favorable interest rate. This
modification did not alter or eliminate the requirement that an interest rate
be selected so that the notes would trade at par upon issuance. Had the Company
not modified the conversion price, the interest rate required to meet the par
trading requirement would have been significantly higher than 4.5%.

The
Company accounted for this modification of debt in accordance with EITF Issue No. 96-19,

“Debtor’s Accounting for a Modification or Exchange
of Debt Instruments”

and EITF Issue No. 05-7,

“Accounting for Modifications to Conversion Options Embedded in Debt
Instruments and Related Issues.”

The Company evaluated the original and modified terms of this debt
instrument (including performing a fair valuation of the conversion feature
before and after the modification), and determined that the modification
qualified to be accounted for as an extinguishment of debt. As a result, the
modified Limited-Subordination Notes were recorded at fair market value on
their date of issuance, which approximated the book value of the original
extinguished notes, and no gain or loss was realized on the extinguishment. The
Company had recorded the original obligation to issue the Limited-Subordination
Notes at fair market value upon its emergence from bankruptcy in accordance
with fresh-start reporting.

After the issuance of the modified notes in July 2006,
the trusts sold the notes to third parties and remitted the majority of the
proceeds to the employee beneficiaries in 2006 with the remainder to be
remitted in 2007.

Newly-issued
Debt.

In
addition to the mandatorily convertible preferred securities discussed in Note 13,
“Preferred Stock,” the Company issued the following new debt instruments on the
Effective Date:

·

5% senior convertible notes
were issued to certain holders of the O’Hare municipal bonds. The notes are
unsecured, have a term of 15 years from the date of issuance and do not require
any payment of principal before maturity. Interest is payable semi-annually, in
arrears. Interest for the first year may be paid in kind, at the option of the
Company, in Successor Company common stock.


These
5% senior convertible notes may be converted, at the holder’s option, into
Successor Company common stock, at any time, at a per share price of $46.86. This
conversion price is subject to adjustment for certain dilutive items and events.
These notes are callable, at the Company’s option, in cash or Successor Company
common stock, under certain conditions, beginning five years after the issuance
date. In the case of any such redemption, the Company may only redeem these
notes with shares of common stock if the Successor Company’s common stock has
traded at no less than 125% of the conversion price for the 60 consecutive
trading days prior to the redemption date. The holders have the option to
require the Company to repurchase their notes on the 5

th

and 10

th

anniversary of
the date of issuance, which the Company may elect to do through the payment of
cash or Successor Company common stock, or a combination of both.

·

6%
senior notes were issued to the PBGC on the Effective Date. These notes are
unsecured, mature 25 years from the issuance date and do not require any
payment of principal before maturity. Interest is payable semi-annually, in
arrears. Interest may be paid with cash, in kind notes or Successor Company
common stock through 2011 and thereafter in cash. These notes are callable at
any time at 100% of par value, and can be redeemed with either cash or
Successor Company common stock at the Company’s option. Upon a change in
control or other event as defined in the agreement, the Company has an
obligation to redeem the notes. In the case of such mandatory redemption, the
Company may elect to redeem the notes in cash, in shares of Successor Company
common stock or a combination thereof.

Contingent Senior Unsecured Notes.

In
addition to the newly-issued debt as noted above, the Company is obligated to
issue to the PBGC 8% senior unsecured notes with an aggregate $500 million
principal amount in up to eight equal tranches of $62.5 million (with no more
than two tranches issued on a single date) upon the occurrence of certain financial
triggering events. Any required tranche will be issued no later than 45 days
following the end of any fiscal year in which there is an issuance trigger
event, starting with the fiscal year 2009 and ending with the fiscal year 2017.
An issuance trigger event occurs when, among other things, the Company’s
EBITDAR exceeds $3.5 billion over the prior twelve months ending September 30
or December 31 of any applicable fiscal year, beginning with the fiscal year
2009. However, if the issuance of a tranche would cause a default under any
other securities then existing, the Company may satisfy its obligations with
respect to such tranche by issuing Successor Company common stock having a
market value equal to $62.5 million. Each issued tranche will mature 15 years
from its respective issuance date, with interest payable in cash in semi-annual
installments, and will be callable at any time at 100% of par value, plus
accrued and unpaid interest.

At December 31,
2006, contractual principal payments under then-outstanding long-term debt
agreements in each of the next five calendar years are as follows:  2007—$715 million; 2008—$684 million; 2009—$759
million; 2010—$941 million and 2011—$836 million. After giving effect to the February 2007
prepayment of $972 million and the amendment of the Credit Facility, the
Company’s prepaid and contractual principal payments in each of the next five
calendar years are as follows:  2007—$1,687
million; 2008—$674 million; 2009—$749 million; 2010—$931 million and 2011—$826
million.

In addition to the Credit Facility collateral that
included a security interest in substantially all of the Guarantors tangible
and intangible assets, various assets, principally aircraft, having an
aggregate book value of $4.4 billion at December 31, 2006, were pledged as
security under various loan agreements. The amendment to the Credit Facility
released certain of the Company’s assets from collateral; however, this
amendment did not impact the $4.4 million of security pledged under separate
loan agreements at December 31, 2006.

Predecessor
Company Debt

As of December 31, 2005, long-term debt consisted
of the DIP Financing and debt associated with certain aircraft operated by Air
Canada (“Air Canada Debt”). The amended agreement with the DIP


financing lenders, which
was approved by the Bankruptcy Court, consisted of a $1.1 billion term loan and
a $200 million revolving credit and letter of credit facility and was due on March 31,
2006. The terms of the DIP Financing included covenants with respect to ongoing
monthly financial requirements, including thresholds for minimum EBITDAR,
limitations on capital expenditures and minimum unrestricted cash. F

ailure to comply
with these covenants would have constituted an event of default under the DIP
Financing and allowed the lenders to accelerate the loan. The Company complied
with the EBITDAR covenant in the fourth quarter of 2005 and in the first
quarter of 2006, up to the repayment of the DIP Facility with proceeds from the
Credit Facility on the Effective Date. As of December 31, 2005, the
Company had outstanding debt of $154 million associated with aircraft leased by
Air Canada. The Air Canada Debt has a fixed interest rate of 7.15% and is
scheduled to mature at various times through January 2016.

During the Company’s reorganization under Chapter 11,
it was not permitted to make payments on pre-petition debt while in Chapter 11;
however, to the extent it had reached agreements with certain financiers on
specific aircraft governed by Section 1110 of the Bankruptcy Code, the
Company continued to make payments on the secured notes financing the aircraft
with the approval of the Bankruptcy Court. In addition, the Company had
rejected certain aircraft that were originally financed under secured notes and
had reclassified $651 million in principal amount of these secured notes to
Liabilities subject to compromise.

At December 31,
2005, the Company had recorded $434 million in municipal bonds to finance the
acquisition and construction of certain facilities at Los Angeles, San
Francisco, Miami and Chicago. These municipal bonds were rejected and/or
settled as part of the bankruptcy process, and rejected amounts were recorded
in Liabilities subject to compromise at December 31, 2005. The Company
does not have any obligations for these municipal bonds as a result of its
bankruptcy proceedings, except for potential obligations related to leasehold
security interests at LAX and SFO as discussed in Note 1, “Voluntary
Reorganization Under Chapter 11—Significant Matters Remaining to be Resolved in
Chapter 11 Cases.”

The
Company has a subsidiary trust that had Trust Originated Preferred Securities (“TOPrS”)
outstanding with a liquidation value of $97 million at December 31, 2005. These
securities were issued in December 1996 and were previously reported on
the Company’s

Statements of Consolidated Financial
Position

as Company-Obligated Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred
Securities of a Subsidiary Trust. The trust was considered a variable interest
entity under FASB Interpretation No. 46R, “

Consolidation
of Variable Interest Entities—Revised

” (“FIN 46R”) because the
Company had limited ability to make decisions about its activities. However,
the Company was not considered the primary beneficiary of the trust. Therefore,
the trust and the Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Securities issued by the
trust were not reported on the Company’s

Statements of Consolidated
Financial Position

. Instead, the Company reported its Junior
Subordinated Debentures held by the trust as long-term debt included in
Liabilities subject to compromise at December 31, 2005.  Pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization, the
TOPrS were cancelled on the Effective Date; no distribution was made to the
holders of the TOPrS.

The Company’s pre-petition
debt, which was classified as Liabilities subject to compromise, consisted of
the following at December 31, 2005:

Various assets, principally aircraft, having an

security under various loan agreements.


(12) ESOP Preferred Stock

On June 26, 2003, the ESOP was terminated
following the publication of a regulation by the Internal Revenue Service that
would permit the distribution of the remaining ESOP shares to plan
participants without jeopardizing the Company’s ability to utilize its net
operating losses. As a result of the termination of the ESOP, employees were
given until August 18, 2003 to make elections for distribution of their
stock in the plan. For participants who did not make an election regarding
their stock before the August 18 deadline, the stock remained in the plan
and distributions continued on a monthly basis until June of 2004, when
the Company implemented a forced distribution of the remaining shares in the
plan. On June 28, 2004, all remaining ESOP shares consisting of 1,181,201 Class 1
ESOP Preferred Stock, 279,706 Class 2 ESOP Preferred Stock and
1,412,361 Voting ESOP Preferred Stock were converted to common and either
distributed to participants at their request or transferred to a broker account
in their name.

Each share of Class 1
and Class 2 ESOP Preferred Stock was convertible into four shares of UAL
common stock. Shares typically were converted to common as employees retired or
otherwise left the Company. The ESOP Preferred Stock was nonvoting, with a par
value of $0.01 per share and a liquidation value of $126.96 per share.
The Class 1 ESOP Preferred Stock provided a fixed annual dividend of
$8.8872 per share, which ceased on March 31, 2000; the Class 2
ESOP Preferred Stock did not pay a fixed dividend. The Voting ESOP Preferred
Stock had a par value and liquidation preference of $0.01 per share. The
stock was not entitled to receive any dividends and was convertible into .0004 shares
of UAL common stock.

(13) Preferred Stock

Pursuant to the Plan of
Reorganization, preferred stock issued before the Petition Date was canceled on
the Effective Date, and no distribution was made to holders of those
securities.

Successor Company Preferred Stock

The Successor Company is authorized to issue 250 million
shares of preferred stock (without par value), 5 million shares of 2%
convertible preferred stock (par value $0.01 per share) and two shares of
junior preferred stock (par value $0.01 per share).

The 2% convertible
preferred stock was issued to the PBGC on the Effective Date. The shares were
issued at a liquidation value of $100 per share, convertible at any time
following the second anniversary of the issuance date into common stock of the
Successor Company at a conversion price of $46.86 per common share; with
dividends payable in kind semi-annually (in the form of increases to the
liquidation value of the issued and outstanding shares); the preferred stock
ranks pari passu with all current and future UAL or United preferred stock and
is redeemable at any time at

the then-current liquidation value (plus accrued and
unpaid dividends) at the option
of the issuer. The preferred stock is mandatorily convertible 15 years
from the date of issuance. Upon a fundamental change or a change in ownership as
defined in the Company’s restated certificate of incorporation, holders of
shares of the preferred stock are also entitled to receive payment equal to the
amount they would receive in an actual liquidation of the Company. At December 31,
2006, 5 million shares of 2% convertible preferred stock were outstanding
with an aggregate liquidation value of $509 million, which includes $9 million
in dividends that were declared in 2006. At December 31, 2006, the
carrying value of the 2% convertible preferred stock was $361 million
which includes $9 million in dividends that were declared in 2006.  In addition, the two shares of junior
preferred stock have been issued.

Predecessor Company Preferred Stock

At December 31, 2005, the Predecessor Company had
outstanding 3,203,177 depositary shares, each representing 1/1000 of one
share of Series B 12


¤


% preferred
stock, with a liquidation preference of


$25 per depositary
share ($25,000 per Series B preferred share) and a stated capital of
$0.01 per Series B preferred share. The Predecessor Company had the
option to redeem any portion of the Series B preferred stock or the
depositary shares for cash after July 11, 2004, at the equivalent of $25 per
depositary share, plus accrued dividends. The Series B preferred stock was
not convertible into any other securities, had no stated maturity and was not
subject to mandatory redemption. In accordance with the Company’s confirmed
Plan of Reorganization, the Series B preferred stock was canceled.

Before its cancellation, the Series B preferred
stock ranked senior to all other preferred and common stock outstanding, except
the TOPrS, as to receipt of dividends and amounts distributed upon liquidation.
The Series B preferred stock had voting rights only to the extent required
by law and with respect to charter amendments that adversely affected the
preferred stock or the creation or issuance of any security ranking senior to
the preferred stock. Additionally, if dividends were not paid for six
cumulative quarters, the Series B preferred stockholders were entitled to
elect two additional members to the UAL Board of Directors until all dividends
were paid in full. In accordance with the Company’s restated certificate of
incorporation, it was authorized to issue a total of 50,000 shares of Series B
preferred stock.

On September 30, 2002, the Company announced the
suspension of the payment of dividends on the Series B preferred stock and
upon its Chapter 11 filing, stopped accruing for unpaid dividends on the Series B
preferred stock. The amount of dividends in arrears was approximately $32 million
as of December 31, 2005.

At December 31, 2005,
UAL was authorized to issue up to 15,986,584 additional shares of serial
preferred stock.

(14) Financial Instruments and Risk Management

Instruments designated as cash flow hedges receive
favorable accounting treatment under SFAS 133, as long as the hedge is
effective and the underlying transaction is probable. If both factors are
present, the effective portion of the changes in fair value of these contracts
is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until earnings are
affected by the cash flows being hedged.

Instruments classified as
economic hedges do not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS 133. Under
this classification all changes in the fair value of these contracts are
recorded currently in operating income, with the offset to either current
assets or liabilities each reporting period.

Aircraft Fuel Hedges.

During 2004, the Company began to implement a strategy
to hedge a portion of its price risk related to projected jet fuel requirements
primarily through collar options. The collars (only some of which were
designated as cash flow hedges) involve the purchase of fuel call options with
the simultaneous sale of fuel put options with identical expiration dates. Contracts
designated as cash flow hedges are recorded at fair value, with the changes in
intrinsic value, to the extent they are effective, recorded in other
comprehensive loss until the underlying hedged fuel is consumed. To the extent
that the designated cash flow hedges are ineffective, gain or loss is
recognized currently. As part of fresh-start reporting for economic hedges, the
Company changed its classification to record the gains and losses currently in
Aircraft fuel in the

Statements of Consolidated
Operations

as these hedges are executed to mitigate its exposure to
fuel price volatility. Previously such amounts were recorded as an element of
non-operating income.

At December 31, 2005 and for the one month ended January 31,
2006, the Predecessor Company had no fuel hedges in place. In the eleven months
ended December 31, 2006, the Successor Company entered into and settled
aircraft fuel hedges for its mainline operations that were classified as
economic hedges.

In 2005, the Predecessor Company recognized income of
$40 million (which included a loss of approximately $1 million as a
result of ineffective fuel hedges) in non-operating income mainly due to


non-designated
hedges. In the eleven months ended December 31, 2006, the Successor
Company recognized a net loss of $26 million which included a $24 million
realized loss on settled contracts and $2 million of unrealized
mark-to-market losses for contracts settling after December 31, 2006, all
of which were classified as mainline fuel expense in the

Statements
of Consolidated Operations

.

As of December 31, 2006, the Company had hedged
32% of forecasted first quarter 2007 fuel consumption through crude oil collars
and swaps. On a weighted-average basis, hedge protection begins if crude
exceeds $65 per barrel and is capped at $74 per barrel. Conversely,
payment obligations begin if crude, on a weighted-average basis, drops below
$59 per barrel.

As of December 31,
2006, the Company had hedged 4% of forecasted fuel consumption for the second
quarter 2007 predominantly through crude oil three-way collars with upside
protection, on a weighted-average basis, beginning from $64 per barrel and
capped at $75 per barrel. Payment obligations, on a weighted-average
basis, begin if crude drops below $60 per barrel.

Interest Rate Swap.

The Company uses interest rate swap agreements to
effectively limit exposure to interest rate movements within the parameters of
the Company’s interest rate hedging policy. In February 2006, the
Successor Company entered into an interest rate swap with an initial notional
amount of $2.45 billion that would have decreased to $1.8 billion
over the term of the swap. The swap would have expired in February 2012
and required that the Company pay a fixed rate of 5.14% and receive a floating
rate based on the three-month LIBOR rate.

At December 31, 2006,
the Company determined that it is no longer probable that a portion of the
forecasted cash flows hedged by the swap would occur, in light of the Company’s
developing plans to retire a portion of the Credit Facility in advance of
scheduled maturities. For the eleven months ended December 31, 2006, the
total unrealized pre-tax loss on the swap was $12 million, of which a $4 million
loss was recorded in earnings as interest expense and $8 million was
recorded as other comprehensive loss. In January 2007, as a result of the
Company’s reevaluation of the mix of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt in its debt
portfolio, the Company terminated the swap for a payment of $4 million. In
2007, the $8 million gain in swap value from December 31, 2006 to the
termination date will be recognized in earnings.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments.

The following methods and
assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial
instruments for which such estimates can be made:

Cash and Cash
Equivalents, Restricted Cash and Short-term Investments.

The carrying amounts
approximate fair value because of the short-term maturity of these investments.

Derivative
Financial Instruments.

Market prices used to
determine fair value are primarily based on closing exchange prices.

Preferred Stock and
Long-Term Debt.

The fair value is based on the quoted market prices
for the same or similar issues, discounted cash flow models using appropriate
market rates and the Black-Scholes model to value stock options.


The
following table presents the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of the
Company’s financial instruments at December 31, 2006 and 2005:

(15) Commitments,
Contingent Liabilities and Uncertainties

General Guarantees and Indemnifications.

In the normal course of
business, the Company enters into numerous real estate leasing and aircraft
financing arrangements that have various guarantees included in the contracts. These
guarantees are primarily in the form of indemnities. In both leasing and
financing transactions, the Company typically indemnifies the lessors, and any
tax/financing parties, against tort liabilities that arise out of the use,
occupancy, operation or maintenance of the leased premises or financed aircraft.
Currently, the Company believes that any future payments required under these
guarantees or indemnities would be immaterial, as most tort liabilities and
related indemnities are covered by insurance (subject to deductibles). Additionally,
certain leased premises such as fueling stations or storage facilities include
indemnities of such parties for any environmental liability that may arise out
of or relate to the use of the leased premises.

Legal and Environmental Contingencies.

UAL has certain contingencies
resulting from litigation and claims (including environmental issues) incident
to the ordinary course of business. Management believes, after considering a
number of factors, including (but not limited to) the views of legal counsel,
the nature of contingencies to which the Company is subject and prior
experience, that the ultimate disposition of these contingencies will not
materially affect the Company’s consolidated financial position or results of
operations.

The Company records
liabilities for legal and environmental claims when a loss is probable and
reasonably estimatable. These amounts are recorded based on the Company’s
assessments of the likelihood of their eventual disposition. The amounts of
these liabilities could increase or decrease in the near term, based on
revisions to estimates relating to the various claims.

The Company anticipates
that if ultimately found liable, its damages from claims arising from the
events of September 11, 2001 could be significant; however, the Company
believes that, under the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act
of 2001, its liability will be limited to its insurance coverage.

Commitments.

At December 31, 2006,
future commitments for the purchase of property and equipment, principally
aircraft, approximated $2.5 billion, after deducting advance payments. The
Company’s current commitments are primarily for the purchase of, in the
aggregate, 42 A319 and A320 aircraft. In January 2006, United reached
an agreement with the airframe manufacturer to delay, with the right to cancel
these future orders. Such action could cause the forfeiture of $91 million
of advance payments if United does not take future delivery of these aircraft. The
Company also reached an agreement with the engine manufacturer eliminating all
provisions pertaining to firm commitments and support for future Airbus
aircraft. While this permits future negotiations on engine pricing with
any engine manufacturer, restructured aircraft manufacturer commitments have
assumed that aircraft will be delivered with installed engines at list price. The
Company’s current commitments would require the payment of an estimated $0.1 billion
in 2007, $0.1 billion for the combined years of 2008 and 2009, $0.7 billion
for the combined years of 2010 and 2011 and $1.6 billion thereafter.


Guarantees and Off-Balance Sheet Financing.

Fuel
Consortia.

The
Company participates in numerous fuel consortia with other carriers at major
airports to reduce the costs of fuel distribution and storage. Interline
agreements govern the rights and responsibilities of the consortia members and
provide for the allocation of the overall costs to operate the consortia based
on usage. The consortium (and in limited cases, the participating carriers)
have entered into long-term agreements to lease certain airport fuel storage
and distribution facilities that are typically financed through tax-exempt
bonds (either special facilities lease revenue bonds or general airport revenue
bonds), issued by various local municipalities. In general, each consortium
lease agreement requires the consortium to make lease payments in amounts
sufficient to pay the maturing principal and interest payments on the bonds. As
of December 31, 2006, approximately $484 million principal amount of
such bonds were secured by fuel facility leases at major hubs in which United
participates, as to which United and each of the signatory airlines has
provided indirect guarantees of the debt. United’s exposure is approximately
$171 million principal amount of such bonds based on its recent consortia
participation. The Company’s exposure could increase if the participation of
other carriers decreases. The guarantees will expire when the tax-exempt bonds
are paid in full, which ranges from 2010 to 2028. The Company did not record a
liability at the time these indirect guarantees were made.

Municipal Bond Guarantees.

The
Company has entered into long-term agreements to lease certain airport and
maintenance facilities that are financed through tax-exempt municipal bonds.
These bonds were issued by various local municipalities to build or improve
airport and maintenance facilities. Under these lease agreements, United is
required to make rental payments in amounts sufficient to pay the maturing
principal and interest payments on the bonds. However, as a result of the
bankruptcy filing, United was not permitted to make payments on unsecured
pre-petition debt. The Company was advised that these municipal bonds may be
unsecured (or in certain instances, partially secured). In 2006, as a result of
the final Bankruptcy Court decisions, certain leases (SFO, JFK and LAX) were considered
to be financings resulting in the Company’s guarantees being discharged in
bankruptcy. The DEN lease was not rejected; therefore, the Company still has a
guarantee under this lease. The Company has guaranteed interest and principal
payments on $261 million of the DEN bonds, which were issued in 1992 and
are due in 2032 unless the Company elects not to extend its lease in which case
the bonds are due in 2023. The outstanding bonds and related guarantee are not
recorded in the Company’s

Statements of Consolidated
Financial Position

at December 31, 2006, based on proper
application of GAAP. The related lease agreement is accounted for as an
operating lease, and the related rent expense is recorded on a straight-line
basis. The annual lease payments through 2023 and the final payment for the
principal amount of the bonds are included in the future operating lease
payments disclosed in the Non-aircraft lease payments in Note 16 “Lease
Obligations.” There remains an issue as to whether the LAX and SFO bondholders
have a secured interest in certain of the Company’s leasehold improvements. The
Company has accrued an amount which it estimates is probable to be approved by
the Bankruptcy Court for these secured interests. See Note 1, “Voluntary
Reorganization Under Chapter 11—Significant Matters Remaining to be
Resolved in Chapter 11 Cases,”

for a
discussion of ongoing litigation with respect to certain of these obligations.

Collective
Bargaining Agreements.

Approximately 81% of United’s employees are
represented by various U.S. labor organizations. During 2005, United reached
new agreements with its labor unions for new collective bargaining agreements
which became effective in January 2005. These agreements are not amendable
until January 2010. In addition, an initial collective bargaining
agreement with the International Federation of Professional and Technical
Engineers was ratified on March 8, 2006, with an initial effective date of
March 1, 2006; this agreement is likewise not amendable until
January 2010.


(16) Lease Obligations

UAL leases aircraft, airport passenger terminal space,
aircraft hangars and related maintenance facilities, cargo terminals, other
airport facilities, other commercial real estate, office and computer equipment
and vehicles. As allowed under Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code, during
its reorganization the Company assumed, assumed and assigned, or rejected
certain executory contracts and unexpired leases, including leases of real
property, aircraft and aircraft engines, subject to the approval of the
Bankruptcy Court and certain other conditions. During bankruptcy, the Company
also entered into numerous aircraft financing term sheets with financiers, some
of which were implemented before the Effective Date, and others of which were
implemented on the Effective Date. Under fresh-start reporting, the Company was
required to apply lease modification testing on these leases, which resulted in
the reclassification of some financings as capital leases or operating leases
for the Successor Company, which were different from classifications for the
Predecessor Company.

In connection with fresh-start reporting requirements,
aircraft operating leases were adjusted to fair value and a net
deferred asset of $263 million was recorded in the

Statement of Consolidated Financial Position

on the
Effective Date, representing the net present value of the differences between
stated lease rates in agreed term sheets and the fair market lease rates for
similar aircraft. These deferred amounts are amortized on a straight-line basis
as an adjustment to aircraft rent expense over the individual applicable
remaining lease terms, generally from one to 18 years.

At December 31,
2006, scheduled future minimum lease payments under capital leases
(substantially all of which are for aircraft) and operating leases having
initial or remaining noncancelable lease terms of more than one year were as

in 2011 and $19 million thereafter.


At December 31,
2006, UAL leased 214 mainline aircraft, 47 of which were accounted for as
capital leases. These leases have initial terms of 5 to 26 years, with
expiration dates ranging from 2007 through 2024. Under the terms of most
leases, the Company has the right to purchase the aircraft at the end of the
lease term, in some cases at fair market value and in others, which include 167
operating leases, at fair market value or a percentage of cost. Additionally,
the amounts in the above table include lease payments related to the Company’s
United Express contracts for 28 aircraft under capital leases and 262 aircraft
under operating leases as described in Note 2(i), “Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies—United Express.”

Certain of the Company’s aircraft lease transactions
contain provisions such as put options giving the lessor the right to require
us to purchase the aircraft at lease termination for a certain amount resulting
in residual value guarantees. Leases containing this or similar provisions are
recorded as capital leases on the balance sheet and, accordingly, all residual value
guarantee amounts contained in the Company’s aircraft leases are fully
reflected as capital lease obligations in the

Statements
of Consolidated Financial Position

.

In connection with certain euro-denominated aircraft
financings accounted for as capital leases, United had on deposit in certain
banks at December 31, 2006 an aggregate 396 million euros ($522 million)
and $17 million in U.S. denominated deposits, and had pledged an
irrevocable security interest in such deposits to certain of the aircraft lessors.
These deposits will be used to repay an equivalent amount of recorded capital
lease obligations, and are classified as aircraft lease deposits in the

Statements of Consolidated Financial Position

.

Amounts charged to rent expense, net of minor amounts
of sublease rentals, were $833 million for the Successor Company for the
eleven months ended December 31, 2006; and $76 million, $1.0 billion
and $1.1 billion for the month ended January 31, 2006 and the years
ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, for the Predecessor
Company. Included in Regional affiliates expense in the

Statements
of Consolidated Operations

were operating rents for United Express
aircraft of $403 million for the Successor Company for the eleven months
ended December 31, 2006; as well as $35 million and $449 million
for the month ended January 31, 2006 and the year ended December 31,
2005, respectively, for the Predecessor Company.

In the first quarter of 2004, the Company adopted FASB
Interpretation No. 46, “

Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities

” (“FIN 46”) and FIN 46R, as subsequently amended,
which requires disclosure of certain information about VIEs that are
consolidated and certain other information about VIEs that are not
consolidated.

The Company has various
financing arrangements for 79 aircraft in which the lessors are trusts
established specifically to purchase, finance and lease aircraft to United. These
leasing entities meet the criteria for VIEs; however, the Company does not hold
a significant variable interest in, and is not considered the primary
beneficiary of the leasing entities since the lease terms are consistent with
market terms at the inception of the lease and do not include a residual value
guarantee, fixed-price purchase option or similar feature that obligates us to
absorb decreases in value, or entitles the Company to participate in increases
in the value, of the financed aircraft.

(18) Advanced Purchase of Miles

In October 2005, the Company entered into an
amendment to its agreement with Chase regarding the Mileage Plus Visa card
under which Chase pays in advance for frequent flyer miles to be earned by
Mileage Plus members for making purchases using the Mileage Plus Visa card. The
existing agreement includes an annual guaranteed payment for the purchase of
frequent flyer miles.

In addition to extending the agreement until 2012 and
making certain other adjustments in the relationship, the agreement provided
for an advance purchase of miles of $200 million in 2005. This advanced
purchase of miles otherwise reduced the annual guaranteed payments for 2006
through 2009 by $75 million per year. In addition, the Company provided a
junior lien upon, and security interest in, all collateral pledged or in which
security interest is granted, as security in connection with the Credit
Facility. The security interest was junior to other Credit Facility debt, and applied
to no more than $850 million in total advance purchases at any time.

In February 2007, the
Company amended the agreement with Chase whereby Chase released their junior
security interest in the collateral pledged to the Amended Credit Facility. However
under certain circumstances, the Company is obligated to reinstate Chase’s
junior security interest in the assets pledged to the Amended Credit Facility.
As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the total advanced purchase of miles was
$681 million and $679 million, respectively.

(19) Special Items

2006—

Successor
Company

SFO
Municipal Bonds Security Interest.

In October 2006,
the Bankruptcy Court issued an order declaring that the owners of certain
municipal bonds, issued before the Petition Date to finance construction of
certain leasehold improvements at SFO, should be allowed a secured claim of
approximately $27 million, based upon the court-determined fair value of
UAL’s underlying leasehold.


After the denial of
post-trial motions, both parties have appealed to the District Court. In
accordance with SOP 90-7, as of the Effective Date, UAL had recorded $60 million
as its best estimate of the probable security interest to be awarded in this
unresolved litigation. In the third quarter of 2006 the Company recorded a
special item of $30 million benefit to operating income, to reduce the
Company’s recorded obligation for the SFO municipal bonds to the amount the
Company now estimates is probable to be allowed by the Bankruptcy Court, in
accordance with Practice Bulletin 11.

ALPA
Non-Qualified Pension Plan.

In
the fourth quarter of 2006, the Company recorded a special item of $24 million
as a benefit to operating income to reduce the Company’s recorded obligation
for this matter. This adjustment was based on the receipt of a favorable court
ruling in ongoing litigation and the Company’s determination that it is now
probable the Company will not be required to satisfy this obligation.

LAX
Municipal Bonds Obligation.

In
the fourth quarter of 2006, based on litigation developments, the Company
recorded a special item of $18 million as a charge to operating income to
adjust the Company’s recorded obligation for the LAX municipal bonds to the
amount the Company now estimates is probable to be allowed by the Bankruptcy
Court.

See Note 1, “Voluntary
Reorganization Under Chapter 11—Significant Matters Remaining to be
Resolved in Chapter 11 Cases” for further information on these items.

2005—

Predecessor
Company

Aircraft Impairment.

During
the second quarter of 2005, the Company recognized a charge of $18 million
for aircraft impairments related to the planned accelerated retirement of
certain aircraft.

2004—

Predecessor
Company

Air
Canada.

During
the third quarter of 2004, Air Canada successfully emerged from bankruptcy
protection under the Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act of the Canada
Business Corporation Act. The Company had filed a pre-petition claim against
Air Canada based on its equity interest in three Airbus A330 aircraft leased to
Air Canada. As part of its plan of reorganization, Air Canada offered its
unsecured creditors the opportunity to participate in their initial public
offering. The Company subscribed to 986,986 shares in the reorganized company
in August 2004 and sold them in October 2004 for a nominal gain.
Separately, the Company sold its interest in its pre-petition claim to a
third-party and recorded a non-operating gain of $18 million during the third
quarter of 2004.

Aircraft Write-down.

During the first quarter of 2004, the Company
incurred a $13 million charge in non-operating expense for the write-down of
certain non-operating B767 aircraft.

(20) Severance Accrual

The Company has
implemented several cost saving initiatives that have resulted in a reduction
in workforce such as the outsourcing of administrative functions, the closing
of certain call centers and its announcement of the elimination of certain
salaried and management positions through attrition and layoffs. The Company’s
severance policy provides the affected employees salary continuation as well as
certain insurance benefits for a specified period of time. Accordingly, the
Company has estimated its severance obligations to be $5 million as of
December 31, 2006 in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 112 (As Amended),  “

Employers’ Accounting for Postemployment Benefits—an amendment of FASB Statements No. 5
and 43.

The quarterly results were impacted by the following
significant items:

·

In 2006, the January period
includes reorganization income of $22.9 billion.

·

The third quarter of 2006
includes income of $30 million from a special item as discussed in Note 19,
“Special Items.”

·

The third quarter of 2006
was favorably impacted by the reversal of accrued interest of $30 million while
the quarters ended March 31, 2006 and June 30, 2006 were adversely
affected by interest accruals related to the Chase agreement. In 2005, the net
loss for the quarters ended March 31, June 30, September 30, and
December 31 included reorganization items of $768 million, $1.4 billion, $1.8
billion, and $16.6 billion, respectively. In addition, the second quarter of
2005 included an impairment charge of $18 million for the write down of
aircraft.

·

Diluted
EPS in the third quarter of 2006 was significantly impacted by the
Limited-Subordination Notes. The change in the dilutive impact of these notes
was primarily due to the modification of the conversion price from $46.86 to
$34.84 in July 2006. See Note 11, “Debt Obligations,” for further
information on this debt modification.

See
Note 19, “Special Items,” for further discussion of these items.

IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE.

ITEM 9A.

CONTROLS
AND PROCEDURES.

The Company maintains controls and procedures that are
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports
filed or submitted by the Company to the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”)
is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods
specified by the SEC’s rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to
management including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The
Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, performed an evaluation to conclude with reasonable assurance that the
Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were designed and operating
effectively to report the information it is required to disclose in the reports
it files with the SEC on a timely basis. Based on that evaluation, our Chief
Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of December 31,
2006, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to a
material weakness related to the operation of our internal control over
financial reporting with respect to the accounting and disclosure for income
taxes, as discussed below in Management’s Report on Internal Control over
Financial Reporting. Additional review, evaluation and oversight have been
undertaken to ensure our consolidated financial statements were prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and, as a result, we
have concluded that the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K
fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of
operations and cash flows for the periods presented.

The only changes to the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31,
2006 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially
affect the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in
Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934) are new controls implemented for the preparation of an effective
tax provision that is no longer zero, and for the implementation of new tax
accounting standard FASB Interpretation No. 48, “

Accounting
for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109

Management Report
on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

March 16, 2007

To the Stockholders of

UAL Corporation

Elk Grove Township, Illinois

The management of UAL Corporation and subsidiaries
(the “Company”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange
Act Rules 13a-15(f). Our internal control over financial reporting is designed
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Under the supervision and with the participation of
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of the
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

Based on that evaluation, management identified a
deficiency in the operation of the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting related to the accounting and disclosure for income taxes, which
constituted a material weakness in our internal control over financial
reporting.  As defined in Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board Auditing Standard No. 2, a material weakness is a
significant deficiency, or a combination of significant deficiencies, that
results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of a
company’s annual or interim financial statements would not be prevented or
detected.  While the Company had the
appropriate control procedures in place, high staff turnover caused the Company
to poorly execute the controls for evaluating and recording its current and
deferred income tax provision and related deferred taxes balances.  This control deficiency did not result in a
material misstatement, but did result in adjustments to the deferred tax assets
and liabilities, net operating losses, valuation allowance and footnote
disclosures and could have resulted in a misstatement of current and deferred
income taxes and related disclosures that would result in a material
misstatement of annual or interim financial statements.

Based upon management’s determination of the existence
of a material weakness in accounting and disclosure for taxes, management has
concluded that internal control over financial reporting was not effective as
of December 31, 2006.

Management’s assessment of the ineffectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006 has been
audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public
accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.


REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED
PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

UAL Corporation

Elk Grove Township, Illinois

We have audited management’s assessment, included in
the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting, that UAL Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) did not
maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2006, because of the effect of the material weakness identified in management’s
assessment based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based
on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting
is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal
executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar
functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and
other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal
control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error
or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections
of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial
reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

A material weakness is a significant deficiency, or a
combination of significant deficiencies, that results in more than a remote
likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial
statements will not be prevented or detected. The following material weakness
has been identified and included in management’s assessment: the Company lacked
effective operating controls for evaluating and recording its current and
deferred income tax provision and related deferred tax balances. This control
deficiency resulted in adjustments to the deferred tax assets and liabilities,
net operating losses, valuation allowance and footnote disclosures and could
result in a misstatement of current and deferred income taxes and related
disclosures that would result in a material misstatement of annual or interim
financial


statements. This material
weakness was considered in determining the nature, timing and extent of audit
tests applied in our audit of the consolidated financial statements and
financial statement schedule as of December 31, 2006 and for the eleven
month period ended December 31, 2006 and for the one month ended January 31,
2006 and this report does not affect our report on such financial statements
and financial statement schedule.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that the
Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as
of December 31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on
the criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Also in our
opinion, because of the effect of the material weakness described above on the
achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, the Company has not
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on the criteria established in
Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We
have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the statement of consolidated financial position of the Company as of December 31,
2006 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the eleven
month period ended December 31, 2006 and for the one month period ended January 31,
2006 and our report dated March 16, 2007 expressed an unqualified
opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedule and
included explanatory paragraphs regarding the Company’s emergence from
bankruptcy, the changes in accounting for share-based payments, and the method
of accounting for and the disclosures regarding pension and postretirement
benefits.
