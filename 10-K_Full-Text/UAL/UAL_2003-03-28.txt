UAL Corporation and Subsidiary Companies Report on Form 10-K

For the Year Ended December 31, 2002

PART I

ITEM 1.  BUSINESS.

UAL Corporation ("UAL" or
the "Company") was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware
on December 30, 1968.  The world headquarters of the Company is located
at 1200 East Algonquin Road, Elk Grove Township, Illinois 60007. 
The Company's mailing address is P.O. Box 66919, Chicago, Illinois 60666. 
The telephone number for the Company is (847) 700-4000.

UAL is a holding company
and its principal, wholly owned subsidiary is United Air Lines, Inc., a
Delaware corporation ("United").  United's operations, which consist
primarily of the transportation of persons, property and mail throughout
the U.S. and abroad, accounted for most of the Company's revenues and expenses
in 2002.  United is the second largest scheduled passenger airline
in the world and for the full year 2002 was the industry leader in domestic
on-time performance, according to U.S. Department of Transportation data.

The Company's web address
is www.united.com.  Through the Company's web site, its annual report
on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K,
and all amendments to those reports are made available (free of charge)
as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically
filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission.

This Form 10-K contains various "forward-looking statements"
within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Forward-looking
statements represent the Company's expectations and beliefs concerning
future events, based on information available to the Company on the date
of the filing of this Form 10-K, and are subject to various risks and uncertainties.
Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those
referenced in the forward-looking statements are listed in the last paragraph
of the section, "Outlook for 2003" in

Item 7. Management's Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

.

The Company disclaims any intent or obligation to update
or revise any of the forward-looking statements, whether in response to
new information, unforeseen events, changed circumstances or otherwise.

Bankruptcy Considerations

On December 9, 2002 (the
"Petition Date"), UAL, United and 26 other direct and indirect wholly owned
subsidiaries (collectively, the "Debtors") filed voluntary petitions for
relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United
States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern
Division, in Chicago (the "Bankruptcy Court") under case numbers 02-B-48191
through 02-B-48218 (the "Chapter 11 Cases"). Specific information pertaining
to the bankruptcy filing may be obtained from the website www.pd-ual.com.

The Debtors are currently
operating their business as "debtors-in-possession" under the jurisdiction
of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions
of the Bankruptcy Code, the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure and applicable
court orders.  In general, as debtors-in-possession, the Debtors are
authorized under Chapter 11 to continue to operate as an ongoing business,
but may not engage in transactions outside the ordinary course of business
without the prior approval of the Bankruptcy Court.

Changes in consumer behavior,
particularly the reduction in business travel and the changes in business
travel patterns, have led to a significant decline in revenues, yield and
revenue passenger miles for United, which in turn have severely impacted
the Company's financial condition and United's ability to meet some of
its maturing debt obligations. The Company filed for bankruptcy because
the Chapter 11 process offered the best available means to facilitate the
implementation of necessary changes to the Debtors' business to bring costs
and operations in line with the current business environment.  In
addition, the protections of the Chapter 11 process offered the Debtors
access to capital through debtor-in-possession financing that otherwise
would not have been available.

On the Petition Date, the
Bankruptcy Court gave interim approval for an aggregate of up to $1.5 billion
in debtor-in-possession secured financing (the "DIP Financing"). The DIP
Financing is structured as a $300 million facility from Bank One, NA (the
"Bank One Facility") and a $1.2 billion facility provided by a group led
by JPMorgan Chase Bank, Citicorp USA, Inc., Bank One, NA and The CIT Group/Business
Credit, Inc. (the "Club Facility").  The Company has received commitments
of $1.0 billion under the Club Facility following the completion of the
syndication process for that facility; the balance is conditioned upon
the participation of one or more additional lenders, subject to approval
by the existing participants.  The Company currently has access to
the entire Bank One Facility and to $500 million of the Club Facility.
Access to the balance of the Club Facility is subject to specified terms
of that facility.  These terms require that the Company achieve performance
milestones under its business plan, which include substantial cost savings
in the near term.  Final approval of the DIP Financing was granted
by the Bankruptcy Court on December 30, 2002.

United's DIP Financing
requires compliance with a number of financial covenants, including the
achievement of specified earnings thresholds.  The adverse economic
impact of external events, such as those described below in "Fuel," "Conflict
with Iraq" and "Employees - Labor Matters," if not offset by the achievement
of savings elsewhere, could lead to the breach of one or more of those
covenants and, absent a waiver from the DIP lenders, their foreclosure
on substantial assets United needs to operate its business.  For more
information on the DIP Financing, see Note 1, "Proceedings Under Chapter
11 of the Bankruptcy Code" in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

.

In order to exit Chapter
11 successfully, the Company will need to propose, and obtain confirmation
by the Bankruptcy Court of, a plan of reorganization that satisfies the
requirements of the Bankruptcy Code. A plan of reorganization would resolve,
among other things, the Debtors' pre-petition obligations, set forth the
revised capital structure of the newly reorganized entity and provide for
its corporate governance subsequent to exit from bankruptcy. On March 21,
2003, the Bankruptcy Court approved the extension to October 2003 of the
Company's "exclusivity period," during which it is the only party permitted
to file a plan of reorganization.  Under certain circumstances, the
exclusivity period could be shortened by two months. The timing of filing
a plan of reorganization by the Company will depend on the timing and outcome
of numerous other ongoing matters in the Chapter 11 Cases. Although the
Company expects to file a plan of reorganization that provides for its
emergence from bankruptcy as a going concern, there can be no assurance
at this time that a plan of reorganization will be confirmed by the Bankruptcy
Court or that any such plan will be implemented successfully.

Under Section 362 of the
Bankruptcy Code, the filing of a bankruptcy petition automatically stays
most actions against a debtor, including most actions to collect pre-petition
indebtedness or to exercise control over the property of the debtor's estate. 
Absent an order of the Bankruptcy Court, substantially all pre-petition
liabilities are subject to settlement under the plan of reorganization.

Notwithstanding the preceding
general discussion of the automatic stay, the Debtors' rights to possess
and operate certain qualifying aircraft, aircraft engines and other aircraft-related
equipment that are leased or subject to a security interest or conditional
sale contract are governed by a particular provision of the Bankruptcy
Code that specifies different treatment. Section 1110 of the Bankruptcy
Code ("Section 1110") provides that unless the Debtors take certain action,
within 60 days after the Petition Date or such later date as is agreed
by the applicable lessor, secured party, or conditional vendor, the contractual
rights of such financier to take possession of such equipment and to enforce
any of its other rights or remedies under the applicable agreement are
not limited or otherwise affected by the automatic stay or any other provision
of the Bankruptcy Code. For more information on Section 1110, see "Properties
- - Flight Equipment" under Item 2 below and Note 1, "Proceedings Under Chapter
11 of the Bankruptcy Code" in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Under Section 365 of the
Bankruptcy Code, the Debtors may assume, assume and assign, or reject certain
executory contracts and unexpired leases, including leases of real property,
aircraft and aircraft engines, subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy
Court and certain other conditions.  In general, rejection of an unexpired
lease or executory contract is treated as a pre-petition breach of the
lease or contract in question. Subject to certain exceptions, this rejection
relieves the Debtors of performing their future obligations under that
lease or contract but entitles the lessor or contract counterparty to a
pre-petition general unsecured claim for damages caused by the deemed breach.

Counterparties to these rejected
contracts or leases may file proofs of claim against the Debtors' estate
for such damages.  Due to the uncertain nature of many of the potential
rejection and abandonment related claims, the Company is unable to project
the magnitude of these claims with any degree of certainty at this time.

Generally, the assumption
of an executory contract or unexpired lease requires a debtor to cure most
existing defaults under such executory contract or unexpired lease.

The Bankruptcy Code provides
special treatment for collective bargaining agreements ("CBAs"). In particular,
Section 1113(c) of the Bankruptcy Code permits the Company to move to reject
its collective bargaining agreements if the Company first satisfies a number
of statutorily prescribed substantive and procedural prerequisites and
obtains the Bankruptcy Court's approval of the rejection. After bargaining
in good faith and sharing relevant information with its unions, the debtor
must make proposals to modify its existing CBAs based on the most complete
and reliable information available at the time. The proposed modifications
must be necessary to permit the reorganization of the debtor and must ensure
that all the affected parties are treated fairly and equitably relative
to the creditors and the debtor. Ultimately, rejection is appropriate if
the unions refuse to agree to the debtors necessary proposals "without
good cause" and the balance of the equities favors rejection. See "Employees
- - Labor Matters" below under this Item 1 and "Labor Matters" under

Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation

.

The United States Trustee
for the Northern District of Illinois (the "U.S. Trustee") has appointed
an official committee of unsecured creditors (the "Creditors' Committee"). 
The Creditors' Committee and its legal representatives have a right to
be heard on all matters that come before the Bankruptcy Court.  There
can be no assurance that the Creditors' Committee will support the Debtors'
positions or the Debtors' ultimate plan of reorganization, once proposed,
and disagreements between the Debtors and the Creditors' Committee could
protract the Chapter 11 Cases, could negatively impact the Debtors' ability
to operate during the Chapter 11 Cases and could prevent the Debtors' emergence
from Chapter 11.

At this time, it is not possible
to predict accurately the effect of the Chapter 11 reorganization process
on the Company's business or when it may emerge from Chapter 11. 
The Company's future results depend on the timely and successful confirmation
and implementation of a plan of reorganization. The rights and claims of
various creditors and security holders will be determined by the plan as
well.  No assurance can be given as to what values, if any, will be
ascribed in the bankruptcy proceedings to each of these constituencies,
and it is possible that UAL's equity or other securities will be restructured
in a manner that will reduce substantially or eliminate any remaining value.
Accordingly, the Company urges that appropriate caution be exercised with
respect to existing and future investments in any of such securities and
claims.

On February 24, 2003, the
Bankruptcy Court entered a preliminary injunction in order to restrict
the trading of the Company's common stock and debt interests in the Company.
The purpose of the preliminary injunction was to ensure that the Company
did not lose the benefit of its net operating loss ("NOL"). Under federal
and state income tax law, an NOL can be used to offset future taxable income,
and thus is an extremely valuable asset. However, a company can lose the
benefit of its NOLs if the company is deemed to undergo an "ownership change"
under certain very specific tax rules in the Internal Revenue Code. Excessive
trading in a company's stock (or debt when the company is in bankruptcy)
can trigger such an "ownership change," and thus the Company sought to
restrict the trading of the Company's common stock and debt interests.

Under the terms of the preliminary
injunction, no person can buy or sell UAL stock if that person holds more
than 4.8 million shares of UAL common stock or would hold more than 4.8
million shares after the purchase. Any person who holds more than $200
million in debt claims against UAL must register as a "substantial claimholder"
with UAL, and no person may acquire debt claims against UAL if the acquisition
of the claims would cause them to hold more than $200 million in such claims.
See Note 7, "Income Taxes" in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

.

Plan for Transformation

Central to UAL's reorganization
and emergence from Chapter 11 is its plan for transformation, which outlines
the fundamental changes to United's strategic direction. The plan, which
the Company seeks to refine through further collaboration with its employee
and creditor constituencies, is intended to lay the foundation for a company
that is successful and competitive for the long run. Core objectives of
the plan are the reduction of United's labor and non-labor costs and the
development of a more comprehensive and compelling portfolio of products.
Key operational elements of the plan include: (1) the preservation and
enhancement of United's extensive mainline service targeted primarily at
the business traveler; (2) the creation of a low-cost offering to compete
directly with low-cost carriers for leisure and price-sensitive travelers;
(3) the growth of the Company's United Express regional operations and
(4) the expansion of United's domestic and international alliances. See

Operations

Segments.

UAL operates its businesses
through five reporting segments:  North America, the Pacific, the
Atlantic and Latin America, each of which is operated by United, and UAL
Loyalty Services, Inc. ("ULS").  Financial information on UAL's operating
segments can be found in Note 23, "Segment Information" in the

Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements

.

During 2002, United carried
approximately 69 million passengers and flew approximately 109 billion
revenue passenger miles.  United's network provides comprehensive
transportation service within its North American segment and to international
destinations within its Pacific, Atlantic and Latin America segments.

Operating revenues attributed to
United's North America segment were $8.8 billion in 2002, $10.7 billion
in 2001 and $13.1 billion in 2000.  Operating revenues attributed
to United's international segments were $4.7 billion in 2002, $5.4 billion
in 2001 and $6.2 billion in 2000.

North America

. 
As of March 24, 2003, United serves approximately 83 destinations throughout
North America and operates hubs in Chicago, Denver, Los Angeles, San Francisco
and Washington, D.C.  United's North America operations accounted
for 61.9% of UAL's revenues in 2002.

Pacific

.  Via
its Tokyo hub, United provides passenger service between its U.S. gateway
cities (Chicago, Honolulu, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco and Seattle)
and the Asian cities of Bangkok, Beijing, Hong Kong, Seoul, Singapore and
Taipei. United also provides nonstop service between Hong Kong and each
of Chicago and San Francisco; between San Francisco and each of Osaka,
Shanghai, Sydney and Melbourne (via Sydney); between Los Angeles and Sydney
and Melbourne (via Sydney); and between Chicago and Beijing. In 2002, United's
Pacific operations accounted for 16.9% of UAL's operating revenues.

Atlantic

.  Washington,
D.C. is United's primary gateway to Europe, serving Amsterdam, Brussels,
Frankfurt, London, Munich and Paris.  Chicago is United's secondary
gateway to Europe, with nonstop service to Frankfurt, London and Paris. 
United also provides nonstop service between San Francisco and each of
London and Frankfurt; and between London and each of Los Angeles, Newark
and New York. In 2002, United's Atlantic operations accounted for 12.9%
of UAL's operating revenues.

Latin America

. 
United's primary gateway to Latin America is Washington, D.C., providing
service from Washington, D.C. to Aruba, Buenos Aires, Rio de Janeiro (one-stop),
Sao Paolo, San Juan and St. Thomas.  United also provides service
from Mexico City to each of Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Washington,
D.C., and San Jose (Costa Rica).  In addition, United has service
from Chicago to Aruba, Montevideo (one-stop), San Juan, Sao Paulo and St.
Thomas; between Miami and Buenos Aires and Sao Paulo; between Los Angeles
and Guatemala City, San Jose (one-stop) and San Salvador; between New York
and San Juan; and between Guatemala City and San Jose. In 2002, United's
Latin America operations accounted for 3.4% of UAL's revenues.

UAL Loyalty Services,
Inc

.  UAL Loyalty Services, Inc. ("ULS") is the fifth reporting
segment of UAL's operations and accounted for 4.9% of UAL's 2002 revenues. 
ULS focuses on expanding the non-core marketing businesses of UAL and building
customer loyalty for United and others.  ULS operates in four areas: 
loyalty programs, travel distribution, direct-to-consumer services and
media assets.

ULS operates substantially
all United-branded travel distribution and customer loyalty e-commerce
activities, such as united.com, and also owns and manages UAL's interests
in various third-party e-commerce enterprises, such as Orbitz and Hotwire. 
In addition, as of the first quarter of 2002, ULS owns and operates the
Mileage Plus frequent flyer programs and is responsible for certain aspects
of it, including member relationships, communications and account management,
while United continues to be responsible for the elite frequent flyer aspects
of the program, including the Premier, Premier Executive and Premier Executive
1K programs, as well as the air travel accrual and award aspects of the
program.  United also retains responsibility for managing the relationship
with Mileage Plus' airline partners, while ULS manages relationships with
non-airline business partners, such as the Mileage Plus Visa Card, hotels,
car rental companies and dining programs. ULS also owns and operates certain
other United-branded customer programs as well as the MyPoints.com online
loyalty program, under which registered consumers earn points for goods
and services purchased from participating vendors.

United Cargo

®

.

United Cargo offers both domestic and international shipping through its
Small Package Delivery; T.D. Guaranteed; First Freight; International Freight;
UA 2-Day service; and United SameDay.  Freight accounts for most of
United Cargo's shipments, while mail remains an important component of
United's cargo strategy.

For the year 2002, United
Cargo generated approximately $673 million in freight and mail revenue,
which represents a 4.4% decrease versus 2001.  Traffic has gradually
improved, but volumes remain below pre-September 11, 2001 levels.

In August 2002, United Cargo
opened a new cargo warehouse facility in Chicago, which is presently the
largest facility for processing freight and mail in North America. 
This completes United Cargo's planned investment in facilities.

In January of 2003, United
Cargo, along with Unisys Corporation and two other cargo carriers, launched
Cargo Portal Services, an internet portal that allows freight forwarders
to book and manage shipments more easily through the delivery cycle. 
By providing enhanced computer-based communications between customers and
air carriers, United expects Cargo Portal Services to reduce transaction
costs for both United and its customers.

Fuel.

Fuel is United's second largest cost behind labor.   The Company's
fuel costs and consumption for the years 2002, 2001 and 2000 were as follows:

The price and availability of jet
fuel significantly affect United's operations. Based on projected 2003
fuel consumption, the Company estimates that every $0.01 change in the
average annual price-per-gallon of jet fuel will impact United's 2003 fuel
costs by approximately $21 million, absent any fuel hedging arrangements. 
Due to the highly competitive nature of the airline industry, United may
be unable to pass on to its customers any increased fuel costs that it
may encounter.

To help mitigate against
price increases, United in the past has entered into hedging arrangements.
In 2002, United hedged 26% of its fuel consumption using crude oil and
heating oil swaps.  United had also put in place hedges for 7% of
its estimated fuel consumption for the first half of 2003 (the impact of
these hedges is included in the total fuel cost shown above).  However,
as a result of the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases, the derivatives counterparties
terminated all outstanding swap contracts, leaving United completely unhedged. 
As market conditions and its economic outlook change, the Company continually
evaluates the potential economic benefit of entering into fuel hedging
arrangements.

To ensure adequate supplies
of fuel and to provide a measure of control over fuel costs, United ships
fuel on major pipelines and stores fuel close to its major hub locations. 
Although the Company currently does not anticipate a significant reduction
in the availability of jet fuel, a number of factors make accurate predictions
impossible, including geopolitical uncertainties in oil-producing nations. 
For example, hostilities in Iraq could lead to disruptions in oil production
and/or to substantially increased oil prices.  The continuing political
turmoil in Venezuela also could have similar effects.

Insurance.

United carries hull and liability insurance of a type customary in the
air transportation industry, in amounts which it deems adequate, covering
passenger liability, public liability and damage to United's aircraft and
other physical property.  However, as a result of the September 11,
2001 terrorist attacks, the premiums have increased significantly.

Additionally, after September
11, 2001 commercial insurers cancelled United's liability insurance for
losses resulting from war perils (terrorism, sabotage, hijacking and other
similar perils), but United obtained replacement coverage through the FAA. 
Under the Homeland Security Act, which became effective in February 2003,
the FAA is authorized to offer this insurance through August 31, 2003,
and it may be extended to December 31, 2003, if the federal government
determines such an extension is in the national interest.  Likewise,
United maintains hull war risk insurance through the FAA program, which
provides worldwide coverage for war and associated perils (including hijacking
and confiscation).  There can be no assurance, however, that the FAA
insurance will continue to be available.  Should the FAA discontinue
this coverage, obtaining it from commercial underwriters could result in
substantially higher premiums and more restrictive terms, if it is available
at all.

Also, United maintains other
types of insurance such as property and casualty, directors and officers,
cargo, automobile and the like, with limits and deductibles that are standard
within the industry.  Compared to insurance prior to September 11,
the premiums are substantially higher with lower limits.

Civil Reserve Air Fleet
Program.

In time of war or certain other national emergencies,
the U.S. government can require United and other major air carriers to
provide airlift services to the U.S. Military under the Civil Reserve Air
Fleet Program ("CRAF").  On February 8, 2003, the U.S. government
activated CRAF (for only the second time since the program was established
in 1951) because the U.S. military's airlift needs exceeded the military's
capabilities in connection with the buildup of troops in the Middle East. 
As a result, United, along with other U.S. commercial airlines, is currently
participating in the transportation of troops and cargo to the Middle East. 
While United's participation in the CRAF program to date has had a positive
impact on United's profitability, should United be required to provide
a more substantial amount of these services for an extended period, its
business could be adversely impacted.

Conflict With Iraq

In anticipation of the U.S.
conflict with Iraq, United conducted extensive contingency preparations
and developed a plan to address the likely effects on the airline industry
as a whole and on United in particular.  With the initiation of the
military campaign on March 19, 2003, United implemented that plan, which
included an immediate reduction in capacity of 8% effective April 6, 2003
and placing a number of employees on temporary unpaid leave.

In addition, United has been
working with other carriers, major labor unions, and the Air Transport
Association, a trade association of major U.S. airlines, to develop and
propose a comprehensive government assistance package for the carriers. 
Potential components could include relief from certain taxes, the payment
by the federal government of all costs for airport security, opening up
the Strategic Oil Reserve and government-provided terrorism insurance for
the airlines.  At this time it is impossible to assess the prospects
of such legislation and there can be no assurance that Congress or the
President will approve this or any other relief for the industry.

Further, if other relief
is insufficient or is unavailable on a timely basis, the Company may seek
to implement additional, temporary wage reductions for all employees.

Marketing Strategy

United seeks to attract customers
and create customer preference for United by providing a comprehensive
network, an attractive frequent flyer program and enhanced and differentiated
product and service offerings.

Alliances.

United has entered into a number of bilateral and multilateral alliances
with other airlines to provide its customers more choices and to participate
in markets worldwide that it does not serve directly.  These collaborative
marketing arrangements typically include one or more of the following features:
joint frequent flyer participation; code sharing of flight operations (whereby
one carrier's flights can be marketed under the two-letter airline designator
code of another carrier); coordination of reservations, baggage handling
and flight schedules; and other resource-sharing activities.

The most significant of these
is the Star Alliance

Ô

,

a
global integrated airline network co-founded by United in 1997.  As
of December 31, 2002, Star Alliance carriers served approximately 727 destinations
in approximately 125 countries with approximately 10,622 daily flights. 
Current Star Alliance partners, in addition to United, are Air Canada,
Air New Zealand, All Nippon Airways, Asiana, Austrian Airlines, bmi, Lauda
Air, Lufthansa, Mexicana, SAS, Singapore Airways, Thai International Airways,
Tyrolean and Varig.  Two additional carriers are expected to join
in 2003: Spanair as of April 1 and LOT Polish Airlines as of October 26. 
United currently holds bilateral antitrust immunity with Air Canada and
integrated antitrust immunity with Lufthansa, SAS and the Austrian Airlines
Group (which includes Austrian Airlines, Lauda Air and Tyrolean). 
United has limited antitrust immunity with bmi subject to completion of
an "Open Skies" Agreement between the U.S. and U.K.  For more information
on Open Skies and international rights, see "Government Regulation" in
this Item 1.

In July 2002, United announced
the development of a marketing partnership with US Airways to include joint
frequent flyer participation, joint lounge access and code sharing on certain
flights.  Currently, United and US Airways have substantially implemented
the first two of those arrangements.  The carriers currently code
share on selected flights and expect to complete the implementation of
the code sharing element of the partnership by the end of 2003, subject
to certain conditions imposed by the U.S. government.  On August 11,
2002, US Airways and certain subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for
relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.  That case is still
pending before the Bankruptcy Court. Although US Airways has filed a plan
of reorganization that has been approved by its creditors and confirmed
by the Bankruptcy Court and that provides for its emergence from bankruptcy
as a going concern, there can be no assurance that such plan will be implemented
successfully.  If US Airways is unable to emerge as a going concern
or if it emerges as a significantly smaller or different company, the anticipated
benefits to United of the marketing partnership may never materialize and
United's business may suffer.

United has also formed independent
marketing agreements with other air carriers, including Aloha, BWIA West
Indies Airways, Continental Connection (operated by Gulfstream), Great
Lakes Airlines (a regional carrier) and Spanair.  United continually
evaluates the need for relationships with these and other carriers and
from time to time will change its independent marketing partners as conditions
warrant.

In addition, United operates
the United Express

®

marketing program
in North America, under which independent regional carriers serve small
and medium-sized cities and link them to United's mainline network. 
United Express carriers are Air Wisconsin Airlines, Atlantic Coast Airlines
and Sky West Airlines.  On February 27, 2003, United announced that
it had entered into an agreement with Mesa Air Group, Inc., pursuant to
which Mesa Air will become a United Express carrier on western routes. 
As part of the Chapter 11 process, the Company is reevaluating each of
the contracts with the three existing United Express carriers and may renegotiate
or reject any of these agreements in connection with its reorganization.

Mileage Plus.

The Mileage Plus frequent flyer program was established to develop passenger
loyalty by offering awards and services to frequent travelers.  More
than 40 million members have enrolled in Mileage Plus since it began in

Management's Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

.

Distribution Channels.

The overwhelming majority of United's airline inventory continues to be
distributed through the traditional channels of travel agencies and global
distribution systems ("GDS").  The U.S. Department of Transportation
("DOT") has issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that could significantly
change the rules under which carriers deal with the GDS.  These new
rules are expected to be finalized in January 2004.

United uses the Apollo reservation
system, which is hosted by Galileo International.  The hosting agreement
with Galileo continues through 2004.

Industry Conditions

Operating Environment.

The air travel business is subject to seasonal fluctuations.  United's
operations can be adversely impacted by winter weather and United's first-
and fourth-quarter results normally reflect reduced travel demand. 
Historically, operating results are better in the second and third quarters. 
The events of September 11, 2001, and the recession in the U.S. economy
distorted the normal seasonal relationships in 2001 and 2002.  As
a result of the U.S. war with Iraq, the typical seasonal fluctuations may
continue to be disrupted in 2003.

Competition.

The airline industry is highly competitive.  In domestic markets,
new and existing carriers are free to initiate service on any route. 
United's domestic competitors include all of the other major U.S. airlines
as well as regional carriers, most of which have lower cost structures
than United.  Recently, three of United's largest competitors, Delta
Airlines, Continental Airlines and Northwest Airlines, have given notice
of their intention to implement a comprehensive code sharing arrangement,
subject to certain regulatory approval.  The successful introduction
of this arrangement, or of other comparable arrangements by other carriers,
likely will further intensify domestic competition.

In its international service,
United competes not only with U.S. airlines, but also with foreign carriers. 
United's competition on specified international routes is subject to varying
degrees of governmental regulations (see "Government Regulation"). 
United has advantages over foreign air carriers in the U.S. because of
its ability to generate U.S. origin-destination traffic from its integrated
domestic route systems, and because foreign carriers are prohibited by
U.S. law from carrying local passengers between two points in the U.S. 
United experiences comparable restrictions in foreign countries. 
In addition, U.S. carriers are often constrained from carrying passengers
to points beyond designated international gateway cities due to limitations
in air service agreements or restrictions imposed unilaterally by foreign
governments.  To compensate for these structural limitations, U.S.
and foreign carriers have entered into alliances and marketing arrangements
that allow the carriers to provide traffic feed to each other's flights. 
See "Marketing Strategy - Alliances."

Government Regulation

Domestic Regulation.

All carriers engaged in air transportation in the U.S. are subject to regulation
by the DOT.  Among its responsibilities, the DOT has authority to
issue certificates of public convenience and necessity for domestic air
transportation, grant international route authorities, approve international
code share agreements, regulate methods of competition and enforce certain
consumer protection regulations, such as those dealing with advertising,
denied boarding compensation and baggage liability.

Airlines are also regulated
by the FAA, primarily in the areas of flight operations, maintenance and
other safety and technical matters.  The FAA has authority to issue
air carrier operating certificates and aircraft airworthiness certificates,
prescribe maintenance procedures, and regulate pilot and other employee
training, among other responsibilities.  The FAA also administers
the U.S. air-traffic control system.  From time to time, the FAA issues
rules that require air carriers to take certain actions, such as the inspection
or modification of aircraft and other equipment, that may cause United
to incur substantial, unplanned expenses.

From time to time, the Company
is subject to inquiries by these and other U.S. and international regulatory
bodies.  The Company does not believe that any such existing inquiries
will have a material effect on its business.

Access to landing and take-off
rights, or "slots," at four U.S. airports historically has been subject
to government regulation.  At these airports, O'Hare International
in Chicago, John F. Kennedy International and LaGuardia in New York, and
Reagan National in Washington, D.C., the FAA has regulated the number of
available slots. The Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act
for the 21st Century, enacted in April of 2000, eliminated all slot restrictions
at O'Hare in July of 2002 and called for the elimination of slot restrictions
at Kennedy and LaGuardia by 2007. The eliminations to date have not had,
and the planned eliminations are not expected to have, a material effect
on the Company.

International Regulation.

Internationally, the Company is subject to the aviation authorities of
the foreign countries that United serves. These authorities may from time
to time impose regulations beyond those that apply to United's domestic
operations.

Historically, access to foreign
markets has been tightly controlled through bilateral treaties regulating
the number of points served, the number of carriers and the frequencies
of flights. More recently, the U.S. has pursued a policy of "Open Skies,"
under which the U.S. government has negotiated a number of bilateral agreements
allowing unrestricted access to foreign markets. While a considerable number
of foreign governments have agreed to Open Skies, several major markets
remain subject to restrictive bilateral agreements. Among them are London
and Tokyo, where United has significant operations. Further, United's ability
to serve some countries and its expansion into certain others is limited
by the absence altogether of aviation agreements between the U.S. and the
relevant governments. Shifts in U.S. or foreign government aviation policies
can lead to the alteration or termination of air service agreements between
the U.S. and other countries.  These changes could diminish the value
of United's international route authority because changes in these agreements
could curtail or terminate United's international rights in the associated
markets.

During 2002, United
sought to expand its access to and presence in Asia.  In response
to United's application for additional frequencies under newly negotiated
rights in the U.S.-Hong Kong bilateral agreement, the DOT awarded United
rights that will allow United to operate a second daily Hong Kong-Tokyo
flight.  United also was awarded an additional code share frequency
to serve Vietnam, which brings the carrier's current pool of Vietnam code
share frequencies to eight.  Although Vietnam holds significant commercial
potential, the absence of an air service treaty between the United States
and Vietnam prohibits U.S. carriers from serving this market directly.

The air services agreement
between the U.S. and Japan provides an unlimited number of frequencies
to certain carriers, including United.  United also holds significant
traffic rights from Japan to other locations within the Pacific. 
These rights and the 2002 opening of Tokyo's Narita airport's second runway
provided United with the opportunity to add service in 2002 between Tokyo
and Taipei.

In connection with
its international services, United is required to make regular filings
with the DOT and, in some cases, to observe rules establishing the tariffs
charged and service provided.  In some cases, fares and schedules
also require the approval of the relevant foreign governments.

The European Union (the "EU")
is taking an increasingly active role in regulating international aviation.
In October of 2002, the European Commission granted antitrust immunity,
subject to certain conditions, to United, Lufthansa and SAS.

In November 2002, the European
Court of Justice issued a ruling that invalidated certain provisions of
aviation agreements between the U.S. and the EU.  The governments
are committed to ensuring that this ruling does not interrupt existing
air service.  This decision paves the way for the EU to negotiate
aviation treaties on behalf of EU Member States with other non-EU countries.

The European Commission continues
its attempts to modify the existing regulation that governs slots at EU
airports.  The most recent proposal, if accepted, would have the effect
of favoring EU airlines and would dramatically alter the manner in which
EU slots are held and allocated. The proposed changes threaten to redefine
the issue of slot ownership and impede the selling and trading of slots.

Starting in late 2001 and
continuing through March 24, 2002, airport authorities and other regulatory
bodies granted United and other international slot holders short-term waivers
from an international rule that ordinarily requires a carrier to forfeit
any slot that it uses less than 80% of the time in any season.  Separately,
the DOT waived through March 31, 2002 its requirement that U.S. carriers
in limited-entry international markets return to the DOT frequencies in
those markets that they do not use more than 90 days. In light of the current
conflict with Iraq, United and other carriers are seeking comparable waivers
of the slot and frequency-of-use requirements from domestic and international
regulatory bodies and airport authorities.

Legislation.

The Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act of 2001 (the
"Stabilization Act") established the federal Air Transportation Stabilization
Board ("ATSB") and made $5 billion in federal grants and $10 billion in
loan guarantees conditionally available to the airline industry. 
The legislation also provides relief from increased insurance premiums,
caps potential liability from the September 11 terrorist attacks, limits
liability for any future terrorist events and creates a federal compensation
fund for attack victims.  In 2001 and 2002, United received $782 million
in grants. On June 24, 2002, UAL submitted an application to the ATSB for
a loan guarantee in connection with a contemplated financing.  After
discussions with the ATSB and subsequent revision to the application, on
December 4, 2002, the ATSB informed the Company that it had not approved
the application.  Notwithstanding the denial of the Company's application
for a pre-petition loan guaranty, UAL has been continuing to work with
the ATSB toward the possible funding of a loan that would provide financing
to the Company upon its exit from bankruptcy.

Separate legislation enacted
in November 2001, the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (the "Aviation
Act"), has had wide-ranging effects on United's operations.  The Aviation
Act makes the federal government responsible for virtually all aspects
of security that United has traditionally provided.  The Aviation
Act created a new government agency, the TSA, responsible for aviation
security. Notably, the Aviation Act required that the security screener
workforce be composed entirely of federal employees by November 2002. 
Regulations under the Aviation Act also require carriers to charge passengers
in the U.S. a security fee of $2.50 per enplanement, capped at $10.00 per
round trip and to remit that fee to the DOT.  The DOT, as provided
in the Aviation Act, also has assessed an additional fee, equal to the
amount paid by carriers for security screening in the year 2000, directly
on air carriers to compensate for the costs of screening activities and
property.  The Aviation Act mandates numerous additional security
measures, including that, as of December 31, 2002, all checked baggage
be screened by explosive detection systems.

Privacy Laws.

An
initiative of significant impact within the EU and elsewhere is the introduction
of privacy standards that apply to companies transmitting private information
from the EU to non-EU countries.  To comply with the privacy directives,
the U.S. Commerce Department and the EU have agreed to safe harbor principles. 
Although the safe harbor principles are voluntary at this time, United
plans to comply with them.  The U.S. Commerce Department and the EU
continue to review the status of voluntary compliance.

Canada, Argentina and Australia
have enacted new privacy laws covering the collection and disclosure of
personally identifiable information.  These laws may have an impact
on the way United collects and transmits personally identifiable information
in these jurisdictions.

Environmental Regulations.

The Company, like others in the airline industry, is subject to federal,
state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations concerning
emissions to the air, discharges to surface and subsurface waters, safe
drinking water, and the management of hazardous substances, oils, and waste
materials.  The Company and the industry are also subject to other
environmental laws and regulations, including those that require the Company
to remediate soil or groundwater to meet certain objectives.  It is
the Company's policy to comply with all environmental laws and regulations,
which can require expenditures.  The Company also conducts voluntary
remediation actions.  These costs are not expected to have a material
adverse effect on the business.

Under the federal Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (commonly known
as "Superfund") and similar environmental clean-up laws, waste generators
can be subject to liability for investigation and remediation costs at
disposal sites that have been identified as requiring response actions. 
The Company has been identified as a potentially responsible party (by
a governmental unit or private party) at certain sites that could result
in future expenditures, including the Mattiace Petrochemical Superfund
Site, the Approved Oil Superfund Site, the Chemsol Inc. Superfund Site,
and the Gibson Environmental Inc. Superfund Site.

There is a dispute primarily
among United, American, and Ogden Services (as well as Northwest Airlines
and Delta) concerning the responsibility for payment of certain clean up
costs for groundwater and soil contamination near terminals 8 and 9 at
New York's JFK Airport.  The parties' views on proper allocation of
the costs differ. This litigation, which was initiated in 2000 in the Supreme
Court of the State of New York, is currently stayed because of the bankruptcy.

The Miami International Airport
has been conducting a long-term project to investigate and remediate soil
and groundwater contamination at the airport.  Recently, the Miami
International Airport has identified a multitude of current and former
tenants it believes should help pay for these remedial measures, and United
is one of these tenants.  While the airport initiated a lawsuit in
2001 against a handful of potentially responsible parties, United is not
one of the parties named in the lawsuit.

In accordance with a June
1999 order issued by the California Regional Water Quality Control Board
("CRWQCB"), United, along with most of the other tenants of the San Francisco
International Airport, has been investigating potential environmental contamination
at the airport and conducting remediation when needed.  Among these
projects is an investigation and remediation project for solvent impacts
to soil and groundwater at the San Francisco Maintenance Center. 
This project is being conducted in accordance with CRWQCB approvals.

In August 2002, the Company
entered into a settlement with the U.S. EPA to address voluntarily disclosed
Clean Air Act violations associated with the requirement that low-sulfur
diesel fuel be used in certain ground support equipment.  This settlement
involves a penalty payment and performance of a Supplemental Environmental
Project (involving the replacement of some older ground support equipment
with new electric-powered equipment).

The U.S. EPA and the State
of California are seeking penalties, and potentially injunctive relief,
from the Company for alleged non-compliance with hazardous waste generator
requirements at United's San Francisco Maintenance Center identified in
1999 and 2001.  The Company has been working with both governmental
entities to resolve this matter.

In addition to the matters
discussed above, from time to time the Company becomes aware of potential
non-compliance with environmental regulations, which have either been identified
by the Company (through its internal environmental compliance auditing
program) or through a governmental entity.  In some instances, these
matters could potentially become the subject of an administrative or judicial
proceeding and could potentially involve monetary sanctions of $100,000
or more.

The Company does not expect
these matters, individually or collectively, to have a material adverse
effect on the Company.

Employees - Labor Matters

As of March 1, 2003, the
Company and its subsidiaries had approximately 72,000 employees, of which
approximately 80% are represented by various labor organizations. 
This number represents a significant reduction from the end of 2001, when
the Company and its subsidiaries had approximately 84,000 employees. 
This reduction was a direct response to the continuing adverse impact on
air travel resulting from the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, reduced
demand for air travel in general, as well as United's concerted efforts
to reduce costs.

The employee groups, number
of employees, labor organization and current contract status for each of
United's collective bargaining groups, as of February 28, 2003, were as
follows:

Collective bargaining agreements
("CBAs") are negotiated under the Railway Labor Act, which governs labor
relations in the transportation industry, and typically do not contain
an expiration date.  Instead, they specify an amendable date, upon
which the contract is considered "open for amendment."  Prior to the
amendable date, neither party is required to agree to modifications to
the bargaining agreement.  Nevertheless, nothing prevents the parties
from agreeing to start negotiations or to modify the agreement in advance
of the amendable date. Contracts remain in effect while new agreements
are negotiated.  During the negotiating period, both the Company and
the negotiating union are required to maintain the status quo.

In order to
meet the earnings covenant under the DIP Financing, United needed to obtain
substantial labor savings from its employees by mid-February 2003. Therefore,
the Company imposed immediate wage reductions on its management and salaried
employees, including officers in December 2002. Additionally, United immediately
began negotiations with all of its unions in early December regarding the
changes to the Company's CBAs necessary to satisfy United's short-term
and long-term financial and business imperatives.

In the event the parties
cannot reach consensual modifications, Section 1113(c) of the Bankruptcy
Code permits the Company to move to reject its CBAs. Under Section 1113(c),
the Company must satisfy several statutorily prescribed substantive and
procedural prerequisites before the Bankruptcy Court will authorize the
Company to reject its CBAs. In order to meet the deadline imposed by the
DIP Financing covenants for reducing its labor costs, United had been prepared
to file a motion to reject its CBAs pursuant to Section 1113(c) of the
Bankruptcy Code by December 26, 2002, if consensual CBA modifications could
not be reached before that date.

As the December 26 deadline
neared, however, United and several of its unions agreed to consensual
interim wage relief from its unions that would allow United and its unions
more time to continue negotiations to reach agreements on the CBA modifications
necessary for United to reorganize successfully while still meeting the
short-term financial imperatives established by the DIP covenants. United
reached agreements with four of its five unions to reduce wages on an interim
basis, effective January 1, 2003 to April 30, 2003. The leadership of the
IAM rejected the Company's proposal and therefore, on December 27, 2002,
United filed a motion with the Bankruptcy Court to impose a wage reduction
for the IAM-represented employees. On January 10, 2003, the Bankruptcy
Court granted the Company's motion.

_______________________


The collective bargaining agreement
between the Company and the AFA provides for negotiated mid-term wage adjustments.

Under the terms of the interim
agreements with its unions, and the relief granted by the Bankruptcy Court
against the IAM, United agreed not to file a motion to reject its CBAs
pursuant to Section 1113(c) before March 15, 2003. In the meantime, United
and its unions continued negotiations. The Company's DIP covenants, however,
still require United to obtain all of the relief sought in its proposed
CBA modifications by May 1, 2003. As a result, on March 17, 2003, United
filed a motion to reject its CBAs pursuant to Section 1113(c) and the Bankruptcy
Court has scheduled hearings on this motion for April 14. March 17 was
the deadline by which such a motion needed to be filed to ensure that the
Company could obtain a ruling on its motion by early May 2003 and stay
in compliance with its DIP Financing covenants.

On March 26, 2003,
the Company reached a tentative agreement with the Air Line Pilots Association,
International ("ALPA") on a restructured CBA. The agreement, which will
become effective May 1, 2003, if ratified by the pilot membership, has
a 6-year duration and would reduce pay and benefits, and improve productivity
(through work rule changes), by an average of approximately $1.1 billion
per year versus the current contract.  As part of these changes, retirement
and medical benefits for pilots would be reduced through a decrease in
the Company's contribution to the pilot defined contribution plan, a reduction
in the formula for their defined benefit plan, and changes to the medical
plan including increases to co-payments.

The tentative agreement
includes a success-sharing program that provides the opportunity for annual
pay-outs tied to the Company's level of profitability and performance. 
The tentative agreement provides for significantly enhanced flexibility
with respect to regional jets, code share arrangements and a low-cost offering. 
Finally, the Company has agreed to include in its plan of reorganization
provisions that pilots would receive a distribution of the equity, securities
or other consideration provided to the general unsecured creditors. 
Additionally, the Company had agreed that any plan of reorganization it
proposes or supports will provide the pilot group with a distribution of
the above-described equity, securities or other consideration (as compared
to the total distribution provided to all employee groups) which matches
the proportion of pilots' contribution to total employee cost reductions.

The pilot contribution
in the tentative agreement represents a significant portion of the overall
labor cost reductions sought by the Company.  Should the Company be
unable to obtain labor cost reductions from any of its union groups (through
consensual agreements or otherwise) which fall below the relief the Company
has articulates as necessary from that group, the Company has agreed to
proportionately reduce ALPA's approximate $1.1 billion contribution.

Corporate Governance and the ESOPs; Sunset

In July 1994, the stockholders
of UAL approved a plan of recapitalization that provided an approximately
55% equity and voting interest in UAL to certain employees of United, in
exchange for wage concessions and work-rule changes.  The employees'
equity interest was allocated to individual employee accounts through the
year 2000 under the Employee Stock Ownership Plans ("ESOPs") created as
part of the recapitalization.  The entire ESOP voting interest is
voted by the ESOP trustee at the direction of, and on behalf of, the employees
participating in the ESOPs through Voting Preferred Stock. For further
background information and a description of the ESOPs see Note 16, "ESOP
Preferred Stock" and Note 19, "Employee Stock Ownership Plans" in the

Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements

.

As part of the recapitalization,
the Company's stockholders approved an elaborate governance structure,
which was contained principally in the Company's Restated Certificate of
Incorporation ("UAL Charter") and the ESOPs.  Among other matters,
the UAL Charter provided that the Company's Board of Directors was to consist
of five public directors, four independent directors and three employee
directors appointed by different classes of stockholders.  A number
of special stockholder, Board and Board Committee voting requirements were
also established which included special Board voting requirements on Extraordinary
Matters (e.g. specified business transaction outside the ordinary course
of business; significant asset dispositions; and most issuances of equity
securities), amendments to the UAL Charter and specified bylaws, repurchases
of common stock, stock sales to employee benefit plans, and business transactions
with labor.

Under the terms of
the UAL Charter, these special governance provisions, except as set forth
below, expired or "Sunset" in all relevant respects on March 7, 2003, when
the (a) common shares issuable upon conversion of outstanding Class 1 and
Class 2 ESOP convertible preferred stock, plus (b) Common Equity (generally
common stock issued or issuable as of July 1995) and common stock held
in the ESOP and any other employee benefit plans sponsored by UAL or any
of its subsidiaries for the benefit of employees, represented, in the aggregate,
less than 20% of Common Equity.  For purposes of measuring the Sunset,
employee ownership was 33.37% at December 31, 2002 and 19.21% on March
7, 2003.  After Sunset, Class P Voting Preferred Stock, Class M Voting
Preferred Stock and Class S Voting Preferred Stock represent the right
to cast in the aggregate the number of votes that is equal to 46.23%, 37.13%
and 16.64%, respectively, of the number of shares of Common Stock issuable
upon conversion of ESOP Preferred Stock outstanding or issuable under the
Supplemental ESOP. The following provisions relating to the Board of Directors
are in effect following Sunset: the three employee directors (representing
ALPA, IAM and salaried and management employees) continue to serve on the
Board; the Board size remains at 12 directors; the Outstanding Public Director
Nominating Committee has the responsibility to nominate up to nine directors;
and the two union directors serve on the Executive Committee and on any
other committees with responsibilities substantially the same as to those
of any committee on which the union directors were serving immediately
prior to Sunset.

This section is intended as a general
summary and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the UAL Charter.

ITEM 2.  PROPERTIES.

Flight Equipment

As of December 31, 2002,
United's operating aircraft fleet totaled 567 jet aircraft, of which 267
were owned and 300 were leased.  These aircraft are listed below:

As of December 31, 2002,
all 267 of the aircraft owned by United were encumbered under debt agreements. 
For additional information on accounting for these aircraft see Note 12,
"Long-Term Debt" and Note 13, "Lease Obligations" in the

Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements

.

United has on firm order
with the manufacturers 42 Airbus A319-100 and A320-200 and one Boeing 777-200
aircraft.  The Company is evaluating these contracts in light of its
financial condition and operational requirements.

In connection with the Company's
bankruptcy reorganization under Chapter 11, United is reassessing its fleet
requirements and is seeking to reduce significantly its aircraft financing
costs. Central to this undertaking is the Company's effort to readjust
lease and mortgage payments for aircraft whose fair market values have
fallen since the execution of the original agreements.  United is
negotiating with a significant number of its aircraft lenders and lessors
to restructure the underlying financings to reflect current market rates. 
Although the Company has reached agreements in principle with respect to
a number of aircraft, there can be no assurance that those tentative arrangements
will be successfully converted to final contracts, or that other comparable
arrangements will be available to the Company.  To the extent United
is unable to reach final agreements at economically attractive terms for
the requisite number of aircraft, its financial and operational performance
may be adversely affected.

Under Section 1110 of the
Bankruptcy Code, the automatic stay lasts for only 60 days with respect
to Section 1110-eligible aircraft, engines and related equipment except
under two conditions. The debtor may extend the 60-day period by agreement
of the relevant financier, with court approval. Alternatively, the debtor
may agree to perform all of the obligations under the applicable financing
and cure any defaults thereunder as required by the Bankruptcy Code. 
In the absence of either such arrangement, the financier may take possession
of the property and enforce any of its contractual rights or remedies to
sell, lease or otherwise retain or dispose of such equipment.

The 60-day period under Section
1110 in UAL's Chapter 11 Case expired on February 7, 2003.  The Company
has reached agreements with a significant number of aircraft financiers
to extend the automatic stay, in exchange in certain instances for United's
agreement to make specified payments.  United also has made elections
with respect to certain other aircraft to cure all existing defaults and
to pay the contract rates as required by the Bankruptcy Code. With respect
to certain aircraft, however, United neither negotiated an extension of
the automatic stay nor agreed to cure and resume payments.  Accordingly,
the financiers of such aircraft may seek to repossess the property. 
Although no such financiers have sought to repossess any United equipment,
and although the Company believes that market conditions for commercial
aircraft make repossession unlikely, there can be no assurance that UAL's
lenders and lessors will not repossess any of the applicable aircraft. 
Any such repossessions could result in substantial disruptions to United's
operations and could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business.

For more information on Section
1110, see Note 1, "Proceedings Under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code"
in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Ground Facilities

United has entered into various
leases relating to its use of airport landing areas, gates, hangar sites,
terminal buildings and other airport facilities in most of the municipalities
it serves.  Major leases expire at San Francisco in 2003 and 2011,
Oakland in 2007, Washington-Dulles in 2014, Chicago O'Hare in 2018, Los
Angeles in 2021, Denver in 2025 and Indianapolis in 2031.  United
intends to exercise its rights under the 2003 San Francisco lease by extending
the term until 2013 pursuant to a 10-year renewal option. United owns a
106-acre complex in suburban Chicago consisting of more than 1,000,000
square feet of office space for its world headquarters, a computer facility
and a training center.  United also owns a flight training center,
located in the City and County of Denver, that can accommodate 36 flight
simulators and more than 90 computer-based training stations.  Both
the Chicago and Denver facilities are fully mortgaged. United owns a limited
number of other properties, including a reservations facility and an office
building in Denver and a crew hotel in Honolulu, Hawaii; all of these facilities
are fully mortgaged.

United's Maintenance Operation
Center at San Francisco International Airport occupies 129 acres of land,
3,000,000 square feet of floor space and 12 aircraft hangar docks under
a lease expiring in 2003, with an option to extend for 10 years. 
United intends to exercise its rights under the lease agreement by extending
the term until 2013 pursuant to the renewal option. United's Indianapolis
Maintenance Center, a major aircraft maintenance and overhaul facility,
is operated under a lease with the Indianapolis Airport Authority that
expires in 2031.  The Indianapolis Maintenance Center occupies 300
acres of land, 1,690,000 square feet of floor space and 12 aircraft hangar
docks. United also leases a major facility at the Oakland, California airport,
dedicated to widebody airframe maintenance.  The Oakland facility
occupies 44 acres of land, 380,000 square feet of floor space and has four
aircraft hangar docks.

United's off-airport leased
properties have included a number of ticketing, sales and general office
space in the downtown and outlying areas of most of the larger cities comprised
in the United system. As part of its restructuring and cost containment
efforts, United has closed, terminated or rejected all of its city ticket
office leases. United continues to lease and operate a number of general
office, reservations, sales and other support facilities.

At December 31, 2002, approximately
$1.7 billion in special facilities revenue bonds ("municipal bonds") originally
issued on behalf of United to build or improve airport-related facilities
were outstanding. The Company leases facilities at airports pursuant to
lease agreements where municipal bonds funded at least some of its airport-related
projects. Pursuant to the financing agreements entered into by United in
connection with such issuance of municipal bonds, the Company is required
to make payments in amounts sufficient to pay the interest semi-annually
with principal payable upon maturity.

United is not permitted under
the Bankruptcy Code to make payments on unsecured pre-petition debt without
providing notice to its creditors and receiving the approval of the Bankruptcy
Court. As United has been advised its municipal bonds are unsecured (or
in certain instances, partially secured) pre-petition debt, United cannot
make payments thereon without first meeting the requirements outlined above.Accordingly,
the Company has classified all of its municipal bonds as liabilities subject
to compromise.

Section 365 of the Bankruptcy
Code requires that the Company timely perform all of its post-petition
obligations under unexpired leases of non-residential real property. The
Company believes that it is in compliance with all payment obligations
under its lease agreements relating to those airports where it has municipal
bonds outstanding. Under certain of the airport lease agreements, however,
the Company may be considered in default due to the non-payment of the
debt and therefore subject to the default provisions of the lease agreements
with the airports. Possible consequences could include loss of the Company's
status as a signatory airline (resulting in increased rents and landing
fees) and loss of the Company's exclusive space agreement.

The Company did not pay certain
rental and landing fees when first due on December 1, 2002 under its airport
use agreement with the City of Chicago with respect to the Chicago O'Hare
International Airport. By letter to the Company dated December 4, 2002,
Corporation Counsel for the City of Chicago asserted that the Company may
have forfeited its exclusive rights to its premises at O'Hare on account
of the Company's non-payment of such rental and landing fees. By letter
to Corporation Counsel for the City of Chicago on December 5, 2002, the
Company confirmed that it had paid, by wire transfer, on December 5, 2002,
the full payment of outstanding rental and landing fee obligations at O'Hare
and that such payment constituted a cure of any delinquency or default
and that the Company's rights under such lease remain unaffected. Likewise,
by letter to Corporation Counsel for the City of Chicago on December 6,
2002, the Company reiterated its position that the December 5

th

payment represented a cure of any rental delinquencies or defaults and
that the City's attempt to modify the Company's exclusive rights was ineffective.
A difference of opinion remains as to whether the City of Chicago's attempt
to change the exclusive nature of the premises at O'Hare has any legal
effect.

The Company did not make
the debt service payments due March 1, 2003 of approximately $3.2 million
on its Chicago O'Hare Series 1999A Bonds and of approximately $1.0 million
on its Miami-Dade Series 2000 Bonds. Additionally, the Company does not
intend to make debt service payments or any other payment due on or after
April 1, 2003 on any of the municipal bond issuances, which include those
referenced above, issued on behalf of the Company and relating to domestic
airport financings.

The Company filed a Complaint
Of Debtor For Declaratory Judgment with the Bankruptcy Court on February
28, 2003 and entered into a Standstill Agreement with the City of Chicago
to seek clarification of its obligations under the municipal bonds and
to protect its rights under its airport lease agreement at Chicago's O'Hare
International Airport until the Bankruptcy Court decides the merits of
the complaint.

On March 21, 2003, the Company
filed other Complaints of Debtor for Declaratory Judgment and, in connection
therewith, corresponding Motions for Temporary Restraining Order with respect
to the municipal bonds issuances relating to the facilities at the Denver
International Airport, the New York City - John F. Kennedy International
Airport, the San Francisco International Airport, and the Los Angeles International
Airport, each seeking a clarification of the Company's obligations under
the applicable municipal bonds, and the protection of its rights under
its underlying airport lease agreements at the applicable airport until
the Bankruptcy Court decides the merits of each of the above complaints.
On March 27, the Bankruptcy Court conducted a hearing on this issue. 
At that time, the Court continued the hearing until March 31, 2003 and
the parties are attempting to negotiate an order that would protect the
Company's rights under its leases by requiring the lessors to give additional
notice of certain alleged defaults.  The Company is unable to predict
what, if any, action might be taken in the future by either the bondholders
or the airport authorities as a result of its failure to pay these obligations
as contractually required.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

In re: UAL Corporation, et. al.

As discussed
above, on the Petition Date, the Company, United and 26 other direct and
indirect wholly owned subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for reorganization
under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the Bankruptcy Court. 
The Chapter 11 Cases are being jointly administered under the caption "In
re UAL Corporation, et al., Case Nos. 02-B-48191 through 02-B-48218." 
As debtors-in-possession, the Debtors are authorized under Chapter 11 to
continue to operate as an ongoing business, but may not engage in transactions
outside the ordinary course of business without the prior approval of the
Bankruptcy Court.  As of the Petition Date, virtually all pending
litigation (including some of the actions described below) is stayed, and
absent further order of the Bankruptcy Court, no party, subject to certain
exceptions, may take any action, again subject to certain exceptions, to
recover on pre-petition claims against the Debtors.  In addition,
Debtors may reject pre-petition executory contracts and unexpired lease
obligations, and parties affected by these rejections may file claims with
the Bankruptcy Court.  At this time, it is not possible to predict
the outcome of the Chapter 11 Cases or their effect on the Company's business.

Summers v. UAL Corporation ESOP, et. al.

The UAL Corporation ESOP
and the ESOP Committee were sued on February 28, 2003, by certain ESOP
participants in a purported class action that alleges that the ESOP Committee
breached its fiduciary duty by not selling UAL stock held by the ESOP from
July 19, 2001 to the present. The complaint cites numerous events and disclosures
that allegedly should have alerted the Committee to the need to sell the
shares. The ESOP committee ultimately appointed State Street to act as
fiduciary, and State Street started selling the shares in September 2002
when the stock was trading between $1 and $5 per share. The Company has
$10 million in fiduciary insurance in place to cover some portion of any
liability and is obligated to indemnify the Committee members beyond that
coverage.

Frank, et al. v. United; EEOC v. United

A class action lawsuit against
United was filed on February 7, 1992 in federal district court in California,
alleging that United's former flight attendant weight program, in effect
from 1989 to 1994, unlawfully discriminated against flight attendants on
the grounds of sex, age and other factors, and seeking monetary relief. 
On April 29, 1994, the class was certified as to the sex and age claims.
Following extensive motion practice, on March 10, 1998, the district court
dismissed all the claims against United.  Following an appeal to the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, a three-judge panel of the
Ninth Circuit, on June 21, 2000, overturned the ruling.  The court
ruled that the plaintiffs were entitled to judgment as a matter of law
on their claims for discrimination based on sex and that a trial was required
for determination on their claims for age discrimination. In addition,
the appellate court reversed the dismissal of all individual class representative
claims of discrimination and the case was remanded to the district court
for further proceedings.  United's petition before the U.S. Supreme
Court was rejected.  Prior to United's Chapter 11 filing, the parties
settled the case to enable plaintiffs to establish the size of their unsecured
claim.  The automatic stay resulting from United's Chapter 11 filing
will be lifted to allow the court to conduct proceedings to allow the finalization
of the settlement as to the class.

Hall d.b.a. Travel Specialists v. United

A North Carolina travel agent
filed an antitrust class action suit against United (and other carriers)
initially in state court and then in federal court in North Carolina following
the reduction by United (and other carriers) in November 1999 of commission
rates payable to travel agents. Plaintiffs allege that United and the other
carrier-defendants conspired to fix travel agent commissions in violation
of the Sherman Act and seek treble damages and injunctive relief. Subsequent
to this initial filing, the case has been expanded by the addition of five
new travel agencies, ARTA, and eight new carrier defendants, including
two Star Alliance carriers. In addition, the court has allowed the addition
of claims related to carriers' commission reduction actions in 1997, 1998,
2001, and 2002. Earlier this year the Court granted plaintiffs' motion
to certify the case as a class action consisting of all U.S. (and its possessions)
travel agencies. Plaintiffs have claimed lost commissions, assuming liability,
in the amount of approximately $13 billion, although United's alleged share
of this amount has not been determined by plaintiffs. Upon UAL's Chapter
11 filing, this case was stayed as against United. Since that date, all
remaining defendants have moved for summary judgment. Those motions are
pending before the court.  Trial has been set for September 2, 2003.

In addition to the Hall case,
United has been named in several other cases filed in the U.S. and Canada,
involving commission rates payable to travel agencies. These cases are
in their early stages. United does not expect the outcome of Hall and the
related cases to have any material effect upon UAL's consolidated financial
position or results of operations.

Litigation Associated with September 11 Terrorism

Approximately 40 lawsuits
have been served on United in the U.S. District Court for the Southern
District of New York related to the September 11 terrorist attacks. 
The suits seek a variety of recoveries, including wrongful death, injury
or property damage, and claim that United and others breached their duty
of care to the passengers and to the ground victims.  A number of
lawsuits have also been filed against American and other defendants. 
Under federal law, United's liability on such claims will be limited to
the amount of United's insurance coverage.  United anticipates the
filing of other lawsuits related to the September 11 attacks in the future. 
Also, a forum was created under federal law to provide, as an alternative
to litigation, an administrative avenue for the payment of compensation
to victims of the terror attacks. United has stipulated that the automatic
stay applicable to these lawsuits under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code will be
lifted for 60 days to permit United's participation in a motion to dismiss
the claims of the ground victims.

ITEM 4.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

No matter was submitted to
a vote of security holders of the Company during the fourth quarter of
2002.

PART II

ITEM 5.  MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED

STOCKHOLDER MATTERS.

The Company's Common Stock,
$.01 par value (the "Common Stock"), is traded principally on the New York
Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") under the symbol UAL, and is also listed on
the Chicago Stock Exchange and the Pacific Stock Exchange.  The following
sets forth for the periods indicated the high and low sales prices of the
Company's Common Stock on the NYSE Composite Tape and dividends paid per
share.

The Company has suspended
the payment of cash dividends on the Common Stock. No assurance can be
given as to when or whether the payment of dividends will resume.

The rights and claims of
the Company's various creditors and security holders will be determined
by any plan of reorganization filed by UAL.  No assurance can be given
as to what values, if any, will be ascribed in the bankruptcy proceedings
to each of these constituencies, and it is possible that UAL's equity or
other securities will be restructured in a manner that will reduce substantially
or eliminate any remaining value. Accordingly, the Company urges that appropriate
caution be exercised with respect to existing and future investments in
any of such securities and claims.

On February 28, 2003, based
on reports by the Company's transfer agent for the Common Stock, there
were 19,665 common stockholders of record.

Continued listing on the
NYSE requires, among other things, compliance with certain quantitative
criteria established by the NYSE. One such requirement is that the stock
price remain, on average, at or above $1. On March 25, 2003, the Company
received notice from the NYSE that the Common Stock was "below criteria"
in this regard in that its average closing price for the preceding 30 consecutive
trading days was less than $1. The Company has determined that it cannot
affirm to the NYSE an intent to cure this deficiency within the prescribed
period of time and, as a result, the NYSE has initiated delisting procedures
of the Common Stock and other NYSE-listed securities of UAL. The Company
expects the last day of trading on the NYSE to be April 2, 2003.

ITEM 6. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA AND OPERATING STATISTICS.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

This section contains various "forward-looking statements"
within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Forward-looking
statements represent the Company's expectations and beliefs concerning
future events, based on information available to the Company on the date
of the filing of this Form 10K, and are subject to various risks and uncertainties.
Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those
referenced in the forward-looking statements are listed in the last paragraph
of the section, "Outlook for 2003." The Company disclaims any intent or
obligation to update or revise any of the forward-looking statements, whether
in response to new information, unforeseen events, changed circumstances
or otherwise.

Chapter 11 Reorganization

On December 9, 2002, the
Debtors filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the United
States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern
District of Illinois, Eastern Division, in Chicago. For further details
regarding the bankruptcy filing, see "Bankruptcy Considerations" under
Item 1.

On the Petition Date, the
Bankruptcy Court gave interim approval for an aggregate of up to $1.5 billion
in DIP Financing. The DIP Financing is structured as a $300 million facility
from Bank One, NA (the "Bank One Facility") and a $1.2 billion facility
provided by a group led by JPMorgan Chase Bank, Citicorp USA, Inc., Bank
One, NA and The CIT Group/Business Credit, Inc. (the "Club Facility"). 
The Company has received commitments of $1.0 billion under the Club Facility
following the completion of the syndication process for that facility;
the balance is conditioned upon the participation of one or more additional
lenders, subject to approval by the existing participants.  The Company
currently has access to the entire Bank One Facility and to $500 million
of the Club Facility. Access to the balance of the Club Facility is subject
to specified terms of that facility.  These terms require that the
Company achieve performance milestones under its business plan, which include
substantial cost savings in the near term.  Final approval of the
DIP Financing was granted by the Bankruptcy Court on December 30, 2002.
For more information on the DIP Financing, see Note 1, "Proceedings Under
Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code" in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements

.

In order to successfully
exit Chapter 11, the Company will need to propose, and obtain confirmation
by the Bankruptcy Court of, a plan of reorganization that satisfies the
requirements of the Bankruptcy Code. A plan of reorganization would resolve,
among other things, the Debtors' pre-petition obligations, set forth the
revised capital structure of the newly reorganized entity and provide for
its corporate governance subsequent to exit from bankruptcy. The timing
of filing a plan of reorganization by the Company will depend on the timing
and outcome of numerous other ongoing matters in the Chapter 11 Cases.
Although the Company expects to file a plan of reorganization that provides
for its emergence from bankruptcy as a going concern, there can be no assurance
at this time that a plan of reorganization will be confirmed by the Bankruptcy
Court, or that any such plan will be implemented successfully.

Under Section 362 of the
Bankruptcy Code, the filing of a bankruptcy petition automatically stays
most actions against a debtor, including most actions to collect pre-petition
indebtedness or to exercise control over the property of the debtor's estate. 
Absent an order of the Bankruptcy Court, substantially all pre-petition
liabilities are subject to settlement under the plan of reorganization. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Debtors' rights to possess and operate
certain qualifying aircraft, aircraft engines and other aircraft-related
equipment that are leased or subject to a security interest or conditional
sale contract are governed by Section 1110 of the Bankruptcy Code ("Section
1110") that specifies different treatment. For further information on Section
1110 and its impact on the Company, see "Properties - Flight Equipment"
under Item 2 and Note 1, "Proceedings Under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy
Code" in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Under Section 365 of
the Bankruptcy Code, the Debtors may assume, assume and assign, or reject
certain executory contracts and unexpired leases, including leases of real
property, aircraft and aircraft engines, subject to the approval of the
Bankruptcy Court and certain other conditions.  In general, rejection
of an unexpired lease or executory contract is treated as a pre-petition
breach of the lease or contract in question. Subject to certain exceptions,
this rejection relieves the Debtors of performing their future obligations
under that lease or contract but entitles the lessor or contract counterparty
to a pre-petition general unsecured claim for damages caused by the deemed
breach. Section 1113(c) of the Bankruptcy Code specified particular treatment
of collective bargaining agreements ("CBAs") which a debtor may move to
reject if the debtor first satisfies a number of statutorily prescribed
substantive and procedural prerequisites and obtains the Bankruptcy Court's
approval of the rejection. See "Employees - Labor Matters" under Item 1
and "Labor Agreements" below for further information.

At this time, it is not possible
to predict accurately the effect of the Chapter 11 reorganization process
on the Company's business or when it may emerge from Chapter 11. 
The Company's future results depend on the timely and successful confirmation
and implementation of a plan of reorganization. The rights and claims of
various creditors and security holders will be determined by the plan as
well.  No assurance can be given as to what values, if any, will be
ascribed in the bankruptcy proceedings to each of these constituencies,
and it is possible that UAL's equity or other securities will be restructured
in a manner that will reduce substantially or eliminate any remaining value.
Accordingly, the Company urges that appropriate caution be exercised with
respect to existing and future investments in any of such securities and
claims.

On February 24, 2003, the
Bankruptcy Court entered a preliminary injunction in order to restrict
the trading of the Company's common stock and debt interests in the Company.
The purpose of the preliminary injunction was to ensure that the Company
did not lose the benefit of its net operating loss ("NOL"). Under federal
and state income tax law, an NOL can be used to offset future taxable income,
and thus is an extremely valuable asset. However, a company can lose the
benefit of its NOLs if the company is deemed to undergo an "ownership change"
under certain very specific tax rules in the Internal Revenue Code. Excessive
trading in a company's stock (or debt when the company is in bankruptcy)
can trigger such an "ownership change," and thus the Company sought to
restrict the trading of the Company's common stock and debt interests.

Under the terms of the preliminary
injunction, no person can buy or sell UAL stock if that person holds more
than 4.8 million shares of UAL common stock or would hold more than 4.8
million shares after the purchase. Any person who holds more than $200
million in debt claims against UAL must register as a "substantial claimholder"
with UAL, and no person may acquire debt claims against UAL if the acquisition
of the claims would cause them to hold more than $200 million in such claims.
See Note 7, "Income Taxes" in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

.

The accompanying consolidated
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with SOP 90-7 and
on a going-concern basis, which contemplates continuity of operations,
realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the ordinary course
of business.  However, as a result of the Debtors' Chapter 11 filing,
such realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities, without substantial
adjustments or changes in ownership, are subject to uncertainty. 
While operating as debtors-in-possession under the protection of Chapter
11 of the Bankruptcy Code and subject to approval of the Bankruptcy Court
or otherwise as permitted in the ordinary course of business, the Debtors
may sell or otherwise dispose of assets, or liquidate and settle liabilities,
for some amounts other than those reflected in the consolidated financial
statements.  Further, a plan of reorganization could materially change
the amounts and classifications in the historical financial statements.

Results of Operations

Summary of Results -

The air travel business
is subject to seasonal fluctuations. United's operations are often adversely
impacted by winter weather and United's first- and fourth-quarter results
normally reflect reduced travel demand. Historically, operating results
are better in the second and third quarters. The events of September 11
and the downturn in the U.S. economy distorted the normal seasonal relationships
in 2001 and 2002. As a result of the U.S. war with Iraq, the typical seasonal
fluctuations may continue to be disrupted in 2003.

During 2000, the Company
experienced significant operational disruptions, as a result of labor-related
delays and cancellations, as well as weather and air traffic control limitations,
which adversely affected both revenue and expense performance. The Company
attempted to mitigate the impact of these operational difficulties by reducing
capacity, particularly in the domestic markets, where most of the problems
were concentrated. The Company estimated the revenue shortfall arising
from these disruptions and associated schedule reductions and cancellations
to be somewhere between $700 and $750 million for the year.

Additionally, beginning
in early 2001, the weakening U.S. economy had a significant impact on the
airline industry as corporations reduced their business travel budgets
and changed their travel behavior. During the first six months of 2001,
the industry began experiencing significant revenue declines as a result
of the decrease in business traffic, which impacted both unit revenues
and yields, particularly in the domestic markets. United's domestic passenger
revenue was down $728 million (12%) in the first six months of 2001 compared
to the same period in 2000, partially driven from a 4% domestic capacity
reduction and a 15% decline in business revenues. Domestic unit revenue
was down 8% from 2000. Domestic business revenue was down $631 million
(15%) in the first six months of 2001, driven by a 13% decline in volume
and a 2% decline in yield.

Historically, there
has been a strong correlation between airline revenues and GDP and corporate
profitability. As corporate profitability dropped during this period, companies
reduced spending on travel. During this period, approximately 65% to 75%
of United's domestic revenues were derived from business travelers, which
resulted in United being disproportionately affected by this decline as
compared to some of United's competitors who rely less heavily on business
travelers.

The terrorist attacks of
September 11, 2001 had a significant negative impact on passenger and cargo
demand for air travel. In a direct response to the adverse impact on air
travel as a result of the terrorist attacks, United reduced its capacity
by 23% based on system-wide available seat miles compared to levels prior
to September 11. This schedule reduction allowed for the early retirement
of the entire B727-200 and B737-200 fleets in 2001. Additionally, United
began the process of furloughing approximately 20,000 employees. During
the fourth quarter 2001, United restructured its aircraft delivery program
with both The Boeing Company and Airbus Industrie to defer deliveries of
new aircraft for 2002 and 2003 from the 67 originally planned to 24 aircraft.
United took delivery of 24 of an original 49 aircraft scheduled for the
year 2002 and will not take delivery of any of the 18 aircraft originally
scheduled for 2003. The remaining 43 aircraft have been deferred into 2004
and beyond. United's future schedule will vary as the Company reacts to
continuing changes in demand and yields, as well as normal factors such
as seasonality and fleet composition.

As part of the Air
Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act of 2001 (the "Act")
enacted in response to the events of September 11, 2001, the federal government
made $5.0 billion in federal grants available to the airline industry.
The Company received a total of $782 million in grants under the Act. This
amount represents the Company's total allocation of grant money under the
Act and is recorded as non-operating income in the

Statements of Consolidated
Operations

. For further discussion of the impact of the attacks, the
Company's response and the Act on the Company's financial statements, see
Note 3, "Special Charges" in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

.

Throughout 2002, the
Company continued to suffer from the weakened revenue environment resulting
from the events of September 11 and the weak U.S. economy. In early 2002,
year-over-year unit revenues had been improving each month from a 14% decline
in January to a 4% decline in May; however, unit revenue growth stalled
in the third and fourth quarters as demand continued to be weak and yields
declined. Industry revenues continue to remain below 1995 levels and United,
in particular, has experienced declines in domestic unit revenue that are
below industry levels. United's unit revenue for 2002 decreased 4% from
the prior year and yields have declined 8% year-over-year.

UAL's loss from operations
was $(2.8) billion in 2002, compared to $(3.8) billion in 2001. UAL's net
loss for 2002 was $(3.2) billion ($(53.55) per share), compared to $(2.1)
billion ($(39.90) per share) before the cumulative effect of an accounting
change in 2001.

The 2002 results include
a special charge of $149 million recorded in connection with the closing
of Avolar ($82 million) and severance related to furloughs ($67 million)
Additionally, the Company recorded a gain of $46 million on the sale of
its investment in Cendant Corporation and recognized $130 million in non-operating
income as compensation under the Act. During 2002, the Company also had
a 0% effective tax rate, as compared to recognizing a $1.2 billion tax
credit in 2001.

During 2001, United recorded
a special charge of $1.3 billion in operating expense and $49 million in
non-operating expense for amounts relating to the September 11 terrorist
attacks and the resulting impact on the Company's schedule and operations.
In addition, through December 31, United has recognized $652 million in
non-operating income as compensation under the Act.

Also during 2001, UAL recognized
a special charge of $116 million for costs associated with a terminated
merger with US Airways Group, Inc., including a $50 million termination
fee. In addition, the Company recorded a gain of $261 million on the sale
of certain investments.

Each of the above special
charges and gains on sales are described more fully in Note 3, "Special
Charges," Note 7, "Income Taxes" and Note 8 "Investments" in the

Notes

2002 Compared with 2001

-

Operating Revenues.

Operating revenues decreased $1.9 billion (12%) and United's revenue per
available seat mile (unit revenue) decreased 4% from 9.76 cents to 9.35
cents. Passenger revenues decreased $1.9 billion (14%) due to a 6% decrease
in revenue passenger miles and an 8% decrease in yield. United's available
seat miles across the system decreased 10% from 2001; however, passenger
load factor increased 2.7 points to 73.5%. The following analysis by market
is based on information reported to the DOT:

Cargo revenues decreased
$31 million (4%) due primarily to a 5% decrease in cargo ton miles, as
cargo yields remained flat year over year. Other operating revenues increased
$95 million (6%) primarily due to increases in Mileage Plus third-party
revenues.

Operating Expenses.

Operating expenses decreased $1.5 billion (8%) and United's cost per available
seat mile (unit cost) increased 0.8% from 11.24 cents to 11.33 cents, excluding
special charges. Salaries and related costs decreased $51 million (1%)
as the impact of furloughing employees was partially offset by contractually
driven salary and benefit enhancements as well as increases to pension
and postretirement expense. Aircraft fuel decreased $555 million (22%)
on a 14% decrease in consumption and a 10% decrease in fuel price. Purchased
services decreased $239 million (15%) primarily as a result of volume-driven
decreases in GDS (global distribution systems) and credit card discount
fees. Depreciation and amortization decreased $66 million (6%) primarily
due to retirements of older aircraft. Aircraft maintenance decreased $141
million (20%) due to retirements of older aircraft and a decrease in engine
and aircraft repair volumes as a result of reduced flying. Commissions
decreased $294 million (41%) as a result of United discontinuing paying
base commissions on all tickets purchased in the U.S. and Canada, effective
March 20, 2002, as well as a decrease in commissionable revenues. Other
operating expenses decreased $157 million (9%) due to decreases in crew
layover expenses and volume-driven food and beverage costs, offset by increased
costs for hull and liability insurance of approximately $100 million.

Other income (expense).

Other non-operating expense amounted to $534 million in 2002 compared to
$450 million in 2001, excluding special charges, reorganization items,
gains on sales and the airline stabilization grant. Interest expense increased
$65 million (12%) due to new debt issuances and increased borrowing rates.
Interest capitalized decreased $54 million (68%) primarily as a result
of lower advance payments outstanding towards future aircraft purchases.
Interest income decreased $45 million (43%) due to lower investment balances
combined with lower interest rates. Miscellaneous, net decreased $64 million
(74%) primarily as a result of lower reserve requirements for legal and
environmental costs.

2001 Compared with 2000 -

Operating Revenues.

Operating revenues decreased $3.2 billion (17%) and United's revenue per
available seat mile (unit revenue) decreased 11% from 11.02 cents to 9.76
cents. Passenger revenues decreased $3.1 billion (19%) due to an 8% decrease
in revenue passenger miles and an 11% decrease in yield. United's available
seat miles across the system decreased 6% from 2000 which, combined with
the decrease in revenue passenger miles, resulted in a decrease to passenger
load factor of 1.5 points to 70.8%. The following analysis by market is
based on information reported to the DOT:

Cargo revenues decreased
$227 million (24%) due to a 24% decrease in cargo ton miles largely as
a result of the September 11 terrorist attacks, as well as the discontinuation
of freighter operations in the fourth quarter 2000. Other operating revenues
grew $157 million (11%) primarily due to a $161 million increase in fuel
sales to third parties.

Operating Expenses.

Operating
expenses decreased $78 million (0.4%) and United's cost per available seat
mile (unit cost) increased 6%, from 10.58 cents to 11.24 cents, excluding
special charges. Salaries and related costs increased $203 million (3%)
due to routine annual salary increases for non-contract employees, contractually-driven
increases for employees represented by ALPA and the estimated costs of
contracts with the IAM, which were partially offset by the reduction in
force implemented after September 11. Commissions decreased $315 million
(31%) as a result of a decrease in commissionable revenues and a change
to the commission structure implemented in August 2001, which reduced the
cap paid on commissions issued in the U.S. for domestic travel from $50
for a round-trip ticket ($25 for a one-way ticket) to $20 and $10, respectively.
Aircraft rent decreased $61 million (7%) as the retirement of older aircraft
reduced the number of aircraft under operating leases. Landing fees and
other rent increased $50 million (5%) primarily due to increased rates
at various airports. Depreciation and amortization increased $38 million
(4%) due to an increase in the number of owned aircraft. Cost of sales
increased $219 million (21%) primarily due to costs associated with fuel
sales to third parties.

Other income (expense).

Other non-operating expense amounted to $450 million in 2001 compared to
$271 million in 2000, excluding special charges, gains on sales and the
airline stabilization grant. Interest expense increased $123 million (31%)
as a result of new debt issuances. Equity in losses of affiliates increased
$11 million (92%) primarily due to losses recorded for the Company's investment
in Orbitz.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The matters described
in "Liquidity and Capital Resources," to the extent that they relate to
future events or expectations, may be significantly affected by the Chapter
11 Cases. Those proceedings will involve, or may result in, various restrictions
on the Company's activities, limitations on financing, the need to obtain
Bankruptcy Court and Creditor's Committee approval for various matters
and uncertainty as to relationships with vendors, suppliers, customers
and others with whom the Company may conduct or seek to conduct business.

Generally, under the Bankruptcy
Code, most of a debtor's liabilities must be satisfied in full before the
debtor's stockholders can receive any distribution on account of such shares.
The rights and claims of the Company's various creditors and security holders
will be determined by any plan of reorganization filed by UAL.  Further,
it is also likely that pre-petition unsecured claims against the Company
will be substantially impaired in connection with the Company's reorganization.
No assurance can be given as to what values, if any, will be ascribed in
the bankruptcy proceedings to each of these constituencies, and it is possible
that UAL's equity or other securities will be restructured in a manner
that will reduce substantially or eliminate any remaining value.

Liquidity -

UAL's total
of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, including restricted
cash (both short- and long-term), was $1.9 billion at December 31, 2002,
compared to $2.6 billion at December 31, 2001. Cash flows used in operations
amounted to $1.1 billion, including the receipt of $130 million in government
grant money.

Property additions,
including aircraft and aircraft spare parts, amounted to $887 million,
including $730 million of vendor-financed purchases. During 2002, United
took delivery of eight A319, twelve A320 and four B777 aircraft. All of
these aircraft were purchased. United also acquired one B757 and nine B737
aircraft off lease during the same period. Additionally, ten owned aircraft
were sold and then leased back under operating leases during the year.

Financing activities
during 2002 included principal payments under debt and capital lease obligations
of $1.3 billion and $220 million, respectively. During 2002, United closed
on a $775 million private debt financing which refinanced certain aircraft
and raised approximately $250 million in additional cash. United also arranged
long-term financing for approximately $314 million in debt that had been
placed in interim financing facilities and refinanced $238 million in long-term
debt through a sale-leaseback transaction that raised approximately $72
million in additional cash. Additionally, United repaid $133 million in
receivables-backed short-term borrowings when certain banks supporting
the borrowing program declined to renew it. In December 2002, United borrowed
$700 million under the DIP Financing.

In June 2002, United
repaid $34 million to the State of Indiana, on behalf of the various parties
to the agreements, for failure to reach its capital targets in connection
with the construction of the Indianapolis Maintenance Center. In addition,
in December 2002, the Company paid $59 million in retroactive pay plus
accrued interest to IAM-represented employees.

During 2002, the Company
received approximately $580 million, net, in income tax refunds, part of
which was a result of changes in the tax laws. In addition, United paid
$290 million in federal transportation taxes that had been deferred under
the Act after the September 11 terrorist attacks.

Also in 2002, the Company
received $137 million in proceeds from the sale of its Cendant Corporation
stock and $130 million in compensation under the Act. In the third quarter
of 2002, the Company received approximately $113 million in cash which
had been held in trust under a services agreement with Galileo International
(now Cendant Corporation).

As of December 31,
2002, the Company had $578 million in restricted cash (including $116 million
in long-term restricted cash) on deposit with various state and local governments.
The cash largely represents security for worker compensation obligations
in states where United self-insures, security deposits for airport leases
and reserves with institutions which process the Company's sales. Prior
to 2002, United met many of these obligations through surety bonds or a
secured letter of credit facility; however, many of the bonds have been
cancelled and the letter of credit facility expired in August of 2002.
As a result, United has been and may, in the future, be required to post
additional collateral in the form of cash deposits to support these types
of obligations.

United's liability insurance
for losses resulting from war perils (terrorism, sabotage, hijacking and
other similar perils) was cancelled effective September 26, 2001. United
obtained replacement coverage, although it was charged significantly higher
premiums for this replacement coverage which was in a substantially reduced
amount for claims not involving aircraft passengers. Additionally, the
FAA began providing supplemental third-party war risk insurance coverage
to commercial carriers for renewable 60-day periods for levels of coverage
not available in the market, which United also obtained.

In November 2002, Congress
passed the Homeland Security Act of 2002, which required the FAA to provide
third party, passenger and hull war risk insurance through August 31, 2003.
This insurance may be extended to December 31, 2003, subject to the federal
government's determination that such coverage is necessary to the national
interest. There can be no assurance, however, that the FAA insurance will
continue to be available. Should the FAA discontinue this coverage, obtaining
replacement insurance from commercial underwriters could result in substantially
higher premiums and more restrictive terms, if it is available at all.

United did not make
any cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plan trusts for U.S.
based employees in 2001 or 2002. In lieu of making cash contributions,
the Company utilized a portion of its credit balance (the cumulative difference
between prior year minimum required contributions and actual contributions)
to meet the minimum required contribution. The Company has a remaining
credit balance that is available to be used in 2003; however, once the
credit balance is fully utilized, substantial contributions may be required.
The Company currently estimates, based on current market conditions and
benefit plans, that it could be required to contribute approximately $5.5
billion to its defined benefit pension plan trusts over the next few years.
However, future funding requirements are dependent upon factors such as
interest rate levels, funded status, regulatory requirements for funding
purposes and the level and timing of asset returns as compared with the
level and timing of expected benefit disbursements. In addition, the Company
is seeking to revise its pension plans, as discussed in "Labor Agreements"
below, which would also impact future funding requirements. As such, it
is not possible to be more specific with respect to required contributions
and actual future contributions may differ materially. As of December 31,
2002, United's defined benefit pension plans were in compliance with all
U.S. government funding requirements.

In conjunction with
the ratification of the contracts for the IAM, the Company has provided
collateral consisting of certain real estate, flight simulators, ground
equipment and spare part assets to support the payment of approximately
$520 million in retroactive wages due under the contracts in eight quarterly
installments commencing December 2002. In December 2002, the Company made
the first payment required under the contract and is currently seeking
release of the additional collateral.

On September 30, 2002,
UAL announced that it was suspending the payment of dividends on its 12.25%
Series B preferred stock and extending the payment of the December 31 distribution
on its 13.25% Trust Originated Preferred Securities ("TOPrS") to March
31, 2003. As a result of its bankruptcy filing, UAL is no longer making
dividend payments on the Series B or paying distributions on the TOPrS.

In connection with
UAL's announcement that it was suspending dividend and distribution payments,
Standard & Poor's ("S&P") downgraded UAL's Series B preferred stock
and TOPrS to D from CC. As a result of the bankruptcy filing, S&P downgraded
United's senior unsecured debt to D. In August 2002, Moody's Investors
Service Inc. downgraded its credit ratings on United's senior unsecured
debt from Caa1 to Ca and its ratings on UAL's Series B preferred stock
and redeemable preferred securities from Ca to C. Downgrades of the Company's
credit ratings during 2002 have resulted in an increase of $2 million in
interest expense for the year.

At December 31, 2002,
commitments for the purchase of property and equipment, principally aircraft,
approximated $1.6 billion, after deducting advance payments. Of this amount,
an estimated $0.1 billion is expected to be spent in 2003. For further
details, see Note 21, "Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Uncertainties"
in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

.

Capital Commitments -

The Company's business
is very capital intensive, requiring significant amounts of capital to
fund the acquisition of assets, particularly aircraft. United has, in the
past, funded the acquisition of aircraft through outright purchase, by
issuing debt, or by entering into capital or operating leases. Similarly,
the Company often enters into long-term lease commitments with airports
to ensure access to terminal, cargo, maintenance and other similar facilities.
As can be seen in the table below, these operating lease commitments (which
are sometimes referred to as "off-balance sheet debt") are significant.

Following is a summary of
the Company's material contractual cash obligations as of December 31,
2002:

As a result of the
bankruptcy filing, the Company is not permitted to make any payments on
its
pre-petition debt and therefore, the amounts have been excluded from the
above table. In addition, as discussed in Note 1, "Proceedings under Chapter
11 of the Bankruptcy Code" and Note 13, "Lease Obligations" in the

Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements

, the Company may assume, assume
and assign or reject certain executory contracts and unexpired leases pursuant
to the Bankruptcy Code. As a result, the Company anticipates that its lease
obligations as currently detailed in the above table will change significantly
in the future.

The pension obligations as
of December 31, 2002 are based on the Company's current pension assumptions
and current labor contracts. Thus, they assume no permanent wage concessions
are achieved, nor any changes to the Company's pension benefit plans are
implemented and that no waivers have been obtained from the government
to spread the minimum cash contributions for pensions over a longer period.
If these changes are effected in the future, the Company's pension funding
obligations could be reduced by approximately $1.9 billion over this same
period.

See Note 12, "Long-Term Debt,"
Note 13, "Lease Obligations," Note 20, "Pension and Postretirement Plans"
and Note 21, "Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Uncertainties" in
the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

for additional discussion
of these items.

Capital Resources -

DIP Financing.

The
DIP Financing consists of two facilities, the Bank One Facility for $300
million and the Club Facility for $1.2 billion. The Company has received
commitments of $1.0 billion under the Club Facility following the completion
of the syndication process for that facility; the balance is conditioned
upon the participation of one or more additional lenders, subject to approval
by the existing participants.

The Bank One Facility
consists of a $300 million term loan with an interest rate option of the
prime rate plus 5.5% or LIBOR plus 6.5% (with a LIBOR floor of 3%). As
of December 31, 2002, the Company had borrowed $300 million at the LIBOR
option which is due in five equal monthly installments beginning in March
2004.

The Club Facility consists
of a revolving credit and letter of credit facility of $800 million and
a term loan of $400 million, which matures on July 1, 2004. The Company
has the option of borrowing under the Club Facility at an interest rate
of the prime rate plus 5.5% or LIBOR plus 6.5% (with a LIBOR floor of 3%).
As of December 31, 2002, the Company had borrowed $400 million under the
term loan at the LIBOR option. In addition, the Company had available a
$100 million letter of credit facility that was drawn down in March 2003.
The remaining $700 million under the revolving credit facility is subject
to stringent availability hurdles as discussed below.

The terms of the DIP
Financing include covenants that require the Company to satisfy monthly
ongoing financial requirements as determined by EBITDAR (earnings before
interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and aircraft rents)
and covenants that limit, among other things, the Debtors' ability to borrow
additional money, make capital expenditures and make additional corporate
investments. In addition, the Company is required to maintain a minimum
unrestricted cash balance, excluding escrowed amounts, of $300 million.

Under the Club Facility,
borrowing availability is determined by a formula based on a percentage
of eligible assets. The eligible assets consist of certain previously unencumbered
aircraft, spare engines, spare parts inventory, certain flight simulators
and quick engine change kits. The underlying value of such assets may fluctuate
periodically due to prevailing market conditions and fluctuations in value
may have an impact on the borrowing availability under the Club Facility.
Availability may be further limited by additional reserves imposed by the
banks in their commercially reasonable discretion.

The remaining $700
million of availability under the Club Facility, subject to the limitation
on borrowing availability discussed above, will be available to the Company
after certain conditions are met, including achieving positive cumulative
EBITDAR; submitting a certified updated business plan; providing updated
appraisals on the collateral and ascertaining there has been no material
adverse change with respect to transferability of routes, gate leaseholds
or slots.

Other Information

Plan for Transformation -

During the
first quarter of 2003, the Company presented to its Board of Directors
and employees information regarding the plan for transformation (the "Plan"),
which outlines the fundamental changes to United's strategic direction.
The Plan, which the Company is working to refine through further collaboration
with its employee and creditor constituencies, seeks to develop a durable
and sustainable business model that will lay the foundation for a company
that is successful and competitive for the long run.

Core objectives of
the Plan are the reduction of United's labor and non-labor costs and the
development of a more comprehensive and compelling portfolio of products.
The Plan is intended to leverage United's strengths, including its industry-leading
global route network, substantial, well-situated hubs and large and loyal
customer base, including its Mileage Plus frequent flyer program. Key operational
elements of the plan include: (1) the preservation and enhancement of United's
extensive mainline service targeted primarily at the business traveler;
(2) the creation of a low-cost offering to compete directly with low-cost
carriers for leisure and price-sensitive travelers; (3) the growth of the
Company's United Express regional operations and (4) the expansion of United's
domestic and international alliances.

Through the Plan, the
Company must:

reduce costs and develop a business model that builds credibility with
the financial and investment community to ensure that United has access
to capital to emerge from Chapter 11;

create clear and compelling value for customers;

maintain and build on United's strong global network by creating a competitive
portfolio of products that allows United to continue to serve our core
business customer, yet offers additional value to cost-conscious fliers
and addresses the threat from low-cost carriers; and

deliver value to employees in a fundamentally changed industry environment.

The Company has already began
making cost reductions through a comprehensive restructuring program that
includes:

reducing union labor costs through interim wage reductions as discussed
below in "Labor Agreements;"

reducing salaried and management costs by $250 million in 2003 through
wage reductions implemented in December 2002, headcount reductions effective
January 2003 and proposed benefit changes;

identifying business transformation initiatives that involve strategic
projects, such as the US Airways code share, and a systematic cost reduction
program to increase revenues and lower costs by over $1 billion in 2003
and $1.4 billion in 2004;

renegotiating aircraft lease and mortgage agreements for approximately
$500 million in estimated savings by 2005; and

reducing capacity by 6% in 2003 and closing all U.S. city ticket offices
and certain reservation call centers

Additionally, in 2003,
the Company has implemented an additional across-the-board reduction to
cut costs by targeting such areas as overhead staffing, food and beverage
costs and technology spending. The Company has also begun a "best practices"
program designed to examine every area of the Company and implement more
efficient practices. This program is expected to result in an additional
$400 million in cost reductions by 2005.

Labor Agreements -

In order to
meet the EBITDAR covenant under the DIP Financing, United needed to obtain
substantial labor savings from its employees by mid-February 2003. Therefore,
the Company imposed immediate wage reductions of between 3% and 11% on
its management and salaried employees, including officers in December 2002.
Additionally, United immediately began negotiations with all of its unions
in early December regarding the changes to the Company's CBAs necessary
to satisfy United's short-term and long-term financial and business imperatives.
The Company's proposed changes to its CBAs involve targeted cost savings
of $2.56 billion annually on a cash basis compared to the current contractual
path. These cost savings are expected to be realized through wage rate
reductions, work rule modifications and reduced benefit levels.

In the event the parties
cannot reach consensual modifications, Section 1113(c) of the Bankruptcy
Code permits the Company to move to reject its CBAs. Under Section 1113(c),
the Company must satisfy several statutorily prescribed substantive and
procedural prerequisites before the Bankruptcy Court will authorize the
Company to reject its CBAs. In order to meet the deadline for reducing
its labor costs and avoid being in default under the terms of the DIP Financing,
United had been prepared to file a motion to reject its CBAs pursuant to
Section 1113(c) of the Bankruptcy Code by December 26, 2002, if consensual
CBA modifications could not be reached before that date.

As the December 26
deadline neared, however, United and several of its unions agreed to consensual
interim wage relief from its unions that would allow United and its unions
more time to continue negotiations to reach agreements on the CBA modifications
necessary for United to successfully reorganize while still meeting the
short-term financial imperatives established by the DIP covenants in the
meantime. United reached agreements with four of its five unions to reduce
wages on an interim basis, effective January 1, 2003 to April 30, 2003,
resulting in a reduction to wages for ALPA-represented employees of 29%,
AFA-represented employees of 9% and PAFCA and TWU-represented employees
of 13%. The leadership of the IAM rejected the Company's proposal and therefore,
on December 27, 2002, United filed a motion with the Bankruptcy Court to
impose a 13% wage reduction for the IAM-represented employees. On January
10, 2003, the Bankruptcy Court granted the Company's motion and the Company
effectively reduced IAM-represented employee wages by 13% (14% from wages
earned after January 10, 2003). These wage reductions, combined with the
wage reductions for the Company's salaried and management employees, are
expected to result in cost savings of approximately $70 million per month
through April 2003.

Under the terms of
the interim agreements with its unions, and the relief granted by the Bankruptcy
Court against the IAM, United agreed not to file a motion to reject its
CBAs pursuant to Section 1113(c) before March 15, 2003. In the meantime,
United and its unions continued negotiations. The Company's DIP covenants,
however, still require United to obtain all of the relief sought in its
proposed CBA modifications by May 1, 2003. As a result, on March 17, 2003,
United
filed a motion to reject its CBAs pursuant to Section 1113(c) and the Bankruptcy
Court has scheduled hearings on this motions for April 14. March 17 was
the deadline by which such a motion needed to be filed to ensure that the
Company could obtain a ruling on its motion by early May 2003 and stay
in compliance with its DIP Financing covenants. Without the full relief
sought by United's proposed CBA modifications becoming effective by early
May, the Company would be unable to meet its covenants, entitling its DIP
lenders to foreclose on substantial assets United needs to operate its
business.

On March 26, 2003,
the Company reached a tentative agreement with the Air Line Pilots Association
on a restructured CBA. The agreement, which will become effective May 1,
2003, if ratified by the pilot membership, has a 6-year duration, includes
provisions for a 30% pay cut (with1.5% increases on May 1, 2006, 2007,
2008 and April 30, 2009) and common pay rates for three groupings of aircraft:
B747-400 and B777 (paid at the B777 rate), B767 and B757 (paid at a blended
rate), and A319/320 and B737 300/500 (paid at the B737 rate). The pilot
defined benefit plan multiplier is reduced to 1.35 and the participation
credit is capped at 30 years. The Company's contribution to the pilot defined
contribution plan is reduced from 11% to 9%. Pilot health benefits will
be adjusted to incorporate mainstream benefit provisions and form the basis
for a common plan among all employees with a 20% co-pay.

The agreement provides
for flexibility with respect to regional jets, domestic and international
code share, cargo, and targeted low-cost operations. The contract no longer
contains a prohibition on furlough or a requirement to maintain a minimum
fleet or level of pilot staffing. Instead, the agreement provides for the
establishment of a single block hours commitment at the time of emergence
from bankruptcy.

As a part of the restructured
CBA, United pilots will participate in a two-part success-sharing program
including an annual incentive plan that aligns the interests of management
and other employees and a pre-tax profit-sharing plan that recognizes the
pilots' level of participation in the overall restructuring. In addition,
the pilot group will have a representative on the UAL board of directors
with ordinary voting power. The pilots additionally will receive equity
securities or other consideration under the plan of reorganization that
fairly reflects the value of the pilot contribution to the reorganization
of the Company.

US Airways Code Share -

On July 24, 2002,
the Company announced a code share agreement with US Airways. The agreement,
which is expected to generate more than $200 million in annual revenue
for United, would allow both carriers to market service on each other's
network, providing significant consumer benefits and bringing new revenue
and customers to their route networks.

United and US Airways
customers have access to each carriers' airport clubs and they are able
to earn and redeem miles on each carriers' frequent flyer program. Additionally,
beginning January 28, 2003, the two carriers began to code share on selected
flights and expect to complete implementation of the code sharing arrangement
by the end of 2003.

Foreign Operations -

United generates revenues
and incurs expenses in numerous foreign currencies. These expenses include
aircraft leases, commissions, catering, personnel expense, advertising
and distribution costs, customer service expenses and aircraft maintenance.
Changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact operating income through
changes in foreign currency-denominated operating revenues and expenses.
Despite the adverse (favorable) effects a strengthening (weakening) foreign
currency may have on U.S. originating traffic, a strengthening (weakening)
of foreign currencies tends to increase (decrease) reported revenue and
operating income because United's foreign currency-denominated operating
revenue generally exceeds its foreign currency-denominated operating expense
for each currency.

With a worldwide network
and significant sales and marketing efforts in the U.S. as well as every
major economic region in the world, United is able to mitigate its exposure
to fluctuations in any single foreign currency. The Company's biggest net
exposures are typically for British pound, Hong Kong dollar, euro and Japanese
yen. The table below sets forth the Company's exposure to various currencies
in 2002:

To reduce the impact of exchange
rate fluctuations on United's financial results, the Company may hedge
some of the risk of exchange rate volatility on its anticipated future
foreign currency revenues by purchasing put options (consisting of Japanese
yen, euro, Canadian dollars, Australian dollars and British pounds) and
selling Hong Kong dollar forwards. To reduce hedging costs, the Company
sells a correlation option in the first five currencies referred to above.
United also attempts to reduce its exposure to transaction gains and losses
by converting excess local currencies generated to U.S. dollars on a timely
basis and by entering into currency forward or exchange contracts. As a
result of the bankruptcy filing, all swaps and forwards were terminated
by the respective counterparties and the Company's ability to enter into
new swaps or forwards may be limited in the future as a result of the bankruptcy
filing.

United's foreign operations
involve insignificant amounts of physical assets; however, the Company
does have sizable intangible assets related to acquisitions of Atlantic
and Latin America route authorities. Operating authorities in international
markets are governed by bilateral aviation agreements between the U.S.
and foreign countries. Changes in U.S. or foreign government aviation policies
can lead to the alteration or termination of existing air service agreements
that could adversely impact the value of United's international route authority.
Significant changes in such policies could also have a material impact
on UAL's operating revenues and results of operations.

Municipal Bonds

-

At December 31, 2002,
approximately $1.7 billion in special facilities revenue bonds ("municipal
bonds") originally issued on behalf of United to build or improve airport-related
facilities were outstanding. The Company leases facilities at airports
pursuant to lease agreements where municipal bonds funded at least some
of its airport-related projects. Pursuant to the financing agreements entered
into by United in connection with such issuance of municipal bonds, the
Company is required to make payments in amounts sufficient to pay the interest
semi-annually with principal payable upon maturity.

United is not permitted
under the Bankruptcy Code to make payments on unsecured pre-petition debt
without providing notice to its creditors and receiving the approval of
the Bankruptcy Court. As United has been advised its municipal bonds are
unsecured (or in certain instances, partially secured) pre-petition debt,
United cannot make payments thereon without first meeting the requirements
outlined above.

Accordingly, the Company has classified all of its
municipal bonds as liabilities subject to compromise.

Section 365 of the
Bankruptcy Code requires that the Company timely perform all of its post-petition
obligations under unexpired leases of non-residential real property. The
Company believes that it is in compliance with all payment obligations
under its lease agreements relating to those airports where it has municipal
bonds outstanding. Under certain of the airport lease agreements, however,
the Company may be considered in default due to the non-payment of the
debt and therefore subject to the default provisions of the lease agreements
with the airports. Possible consequences could include loss of the Company's
status as a signatory airline (resulting in increased rents and landing
fees) and loss of the Company's exclusive space agreement.

The Company did
not make the debt service payments due March 1, 2003 of approximately $3.2
million on its Chicago O'Hare Series 1999A Bonds and of approximately $1.0
million on its Miami-Dade Series 2000 Bonds. Additionally, the Company
does not intend to make debt service payments or any other payment due
on or after April 1, 2003 on any of the municipal bond issuances, which
include those referenced above, issued on behalf of the Company and relating
to domestic airport financings.

The Company filed a
Complaint Of Debtor For Declaratory Judgment with the Bankruptcy Court
on February 28, 2003 and entered into a Standstill Agreement with the City
of Chicago to seek clarification of its obligations under the municipal
bonds and to protect its rights under its airport lease agreement at Chicago's
O'Hare International Airport until the Bankruptcy Court decides the merits
of the complaint.

On March 21, 2003, the Company
filed other Complaints of Debtor for Declaratory Judgment and, in connection
therewith, corresponding Motions for Temporary Restraining Order with respect
to the municipal bonds issuances relating to the facilities at the Denver
International Airport, the New York City - John F. Kennedy International
Airport, the San Francisco International Airport, and the Los Angeles International
Airport, each seeking a clarification of the Company's obligations under
the applicable municipal bonds, and the protection of its rights under
its underlying airport lease agreements at the applicable airport until
the Bankruptcy Court decides the merits of each of the above complaints. 
On March 27, the Bankruptcy Court conducted a hearing on this issue. 
At that time, the Court continued the hearing until March 31, 2003 and
the parties are attempting to negotiate an order that would protect the
Company's rights under its leases by requiring the lessors to give additional
notice of certain alleged defaults.  The Company is unable to predict
what, if any, action might be taken in the future by either the bondholders
or the airport authorities as a result of its failure to pay these obligations
as contractually required.

Airport Rents and Landing Fees -

United is charged facility
rents and/or landing fees at every airport at which it operates. In recent
years, many airports have increased or sought to increase rates charged
to airlines as a means of compensating for increased demands upon airport
revenues. Airlines have challenged certain of these increases through litigation
and, in some cases, have not been successful. However, to the extent the
limitations on such charges are relaxed or the ability of airlines to challenge
such charges is restricted, the rates charged by airports may increase
substantially. Management cannot predict either the likelihood or the magnitude
of any such increase.

Environmental and Legal Contingencies -

United has been named as
a Potentially Responsible Party at certain Environmental Protection Agency
or State Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA or State EPA") cleanup sites
which have been designated as Superfund Sites. United's alleged proportionate
contributions at the sites are minimal; however, at sites where the EPA
or State EPA have commenced litigation or administrative proceedings, potential
liability is joint and several. Additionally, United has participated and
is participating in remediation actions at certain other sites, primarily
airports. The estimated cost of these actions is accrued when it is determined
that it is probable that United is liable. Environmental regulations and
remediation processes are subject to future change, and determining the
actual cost of remediation will require further investigation and additional
progress of the remediation. Therefore, the ultimate disposition cannot
be determined at this time. However, while such cost may vary from United's
current estimate, United believes the difference between its accrued reserve
and the ultimate liability will not be material.

UAL has certain other contingencies
resulting from the above environmental actions and other litigation and
claims incident to the ordinary course of business. Management believes,
after considering a number of factors, including (but not limited to) the
views of legal counsel, the nature of such contingencies and prior experience,
that the ultimate disposition of these contingencies is not likely to materially
affect UAL's financial condition, operating results or liquidity.

As a result of the
Chapter 11 Filing, as of the Petition Date, virtually all pending litigation
is stayed, and absent further order of the Bankruptcy Court, no party,
subject to certain exceptions, may take any action, again subject to certain
exceptions, to recover on pre-petition claims against the Debtors.

Sunset -

In connection
with the July 1994 recapitalization, certain employees of United were granted
an approximate 55% equity and voting interest in UAL in exchange for wage
concessions and work-rule changes. In addition, the Company's stockholders
approved an elaborate governance structure as described in Item 1. Business,
"Corporate Governance and the ESOPs." Under the recapitalization, the governance
structure remained in place and employees maintained 55% of the aggregate
voting power until "Sunset." Sunset occurred on March 7, 2003, resulting
in the elimination of the 55% voting power of the employees, among other
things. (See Note 16, "ESOP Preferred Stock" and Note 19, "Employee Stock
Ownership Plans" in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

,
as well as Item 1. Business, "Corporate Governance and the ESOPs; Sunset.")

Outstanding Income Tax Claims -

The Company has income
tax refund claims ("Refund") against the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS")
of $126 million resulting from tax overpayments attributable to the six
years 1988 to 1993 as well as $262 million resulting from a 2002 net operating
loss that has been carried back to and generates a refund for taxes paid
in 1998 and 1999. However, the U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ") had imposed
an "administrative freeze" that prohibited the IRS from remitting any of
the $388 million to the Company. The DOJ action was in response to the
Company's bankruptcy filing and was based on alleged claims of the U.S.
government that might be subject to setoff against the Refund. After discussions
with the DOJ, the Company reached an agreement with the government to lift
the freeze and permit the IRS to process and remit approximately $365 million
of the Refund. On March 27, 2003, the Bankruptcy Court approved the settlement
and the Company anticipates receiving the funds shortly.

Critical Accounting Policies -

Critical accounting
policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments
and uncertainties and potentially result in materially different results
under different assumptions and conditions. UAL has prepared the accompanying
financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles,
which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
Actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions
or conditions. The Company has identified the following critical accounting
policies utilized in the preparation of these financial statements.

Accounting for Long-Lived
Assets.

The Company has approximately $16 billion in operating
property and equipment at December 31, 2002. In addition to the original
cost of these assets, their recorded value is impacted by a number of policy
elections made by the Company, including the estimation of useful lives,
residual values and in 2001, impairment charges.

The Company records
aircraft at acquisition cost, upon delivery. Depreciable life is determined
by using economic analysis, reviewing existing fleet plans, and comparing
estimated lives to other airlines operating similar fleets. Older generation
aircraft are assigned lives of 25 years which is consistent with the experience
of United and other airlines. As aircraft technology has improved, useful
life has increased. Thus, the Company has estimated the lives of "new generation"
aircraft to be 30 years. Residual values are estimated based on the Company's
historical experience with regards to the sale of both aircraft and spare
parts and are established in conjunction with the estimated useful lives
of the aircraft. Residual values are based on current dollars when the
aircraft are acquired and typically reflect asset values that have not
reached the end of their physical life. Both depreciable lives and residual
values are revised periodically to recognize changes in the Company's fleet
plans and changes in conditions.

The Company recognizes
an impairment charge when an asset's carrying value exceeds its net undiscounted
future cash flows and its fair market value. The amount of the charge is
the difference between the asset's carrying value and fair market value.
Typically, management estimates the undiscounted future cash flows for
its aircraft fleet with models used by the Company in making fleet and
scheduling decisions. These models utilize the Company's projections of
passenger yield, fuel costs, labor costs and other relevant factors for
the markets where the specific aircraft will operate.

In 2001, the Company
recorded an impairment charge of $517 million for the B737-500 and B747-400
aircraft fleets resulting from the anticipated decrease in future cash
flows in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS")
No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived
Assets to be Disposed Of." (See Note 3, "Special Charges" in the

Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements

.) In the fourth quarter of 2002,
the Company evaluated its fleet in accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting
for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets." Utilizing the Company's
current cash flow projections, based on the proposed CBA modifications
and other cost savings as discussed above in "Plan for Transformation"
and "Labor Agreements," and current appraisals of aircraft value, management
determined that no further impairment was necessary.

See Note 2(f), "Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies - Operating Property and Equipment"
in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

for additional
information regarding United's policies on accounting for long-lived assets.

Frequent Flyer Accounting.

United's Mileage Plus frequent flyer program awards miles to passengers
who fly on United, United Express, the Star Alliance carriers and certain
other airlines that participate in the program. Additionally, United sells
mileage credits to participating airline partners in the Mileage Plus program
and ULS sells mileage credits to non-airline business partners. In either
case, the outstanding miles may be redeemed for travel on any airline that
participates in the program. The Company has an obligation to provide this
future travel; therefore, for awards to passengers redeeming on United,
United Express or one of the Mileage Plus partners, the Company recognizes
a liability and corresponding expense for this future obligation. For miles
sold to third parties, a portion of revenue from the sale of mileage is
deferred and recognized when the transportation is provided.

At December 31, 2002,
United's estimated outstanding number of awards was approximately 10.5
million, as compared with 11.1 million at the end of the prior year. United
estimates approximately 8.6 million of these awards will ultimately be
redeemed and, accordingly, the Company has recorded a liability of $717
million, which includes the deferred revenue from the sale of miles to
program participants. The Company utilizes a number of estimates in accounting
for its Mileage Plus program that require management judgment.

Members may not reach
the threshold necessary for a free ticket and outstanding miles may not
always be redeemed for free travel. Therefore, the Company estimates how
many miles will never be used and excludes those miles from its estimate
of the liability. Based on historical data, the difference between the
awards expected to be redeemed and the total awards outstanding arises
because: (1) some awards will never be redeemed, (2) some will be redeemed
for non-travel benefits, and (3) some will be redeemed on partner carriers.
The Company also estimates the number of miles that will be used per award.
If actual miles used are more or less than estimated, the Company must
adjust its liability and corresponding expense.

When a travel award
level is attained, the Company records a liability for the estimated incremental
costs of providing travel, based on expected redemptions. United's incremental
costs include the additional costs of providing service to the award recipient,
such as fuel, meals, insurance and ticketing costs, for what would otherwise
be a vacant seat.  The incremental costs do not include any contribution
to overhead or profit.  A change to these cost estimates could have
a significant impact on the Company's liability in the year of change as
well as in future years.

In each of 2002, 2001 and
2000, 2.0 million Mileage Plus travel awards were used on United. 
This number represents the number of awards for which travel was actually
provided in 2002 and not the number of seats that were allocated to award
travel.  These awards represented 7.8% of United's total revenue passenger
miles in 2002, 8.1% in 2001, and 7.2% in 2000.  Passenger preference
for Saver awards, which have inventory controls, keeps displacement of
revenue passengers at a minimum.  Total miles redeemed for travel
on United in 2002, including awards and upgrades, represented 59% of the
total miles redeemed, of which 70% were used for travel within the U.S.
and Canada.  In addition to the awards issued for travel on United,
approximately 24% of the total miles redeemed in 2002 were used for travel
on partner airlines.

As the Company also
sells mileage credits to participating airline and non-airline partners,
a change to either the time period over which the credits are used or the
estimate of the number or fair value of tickets could have a significant
impact on the Company's revenues in the year of change as well as future
years. Additional information regarding the Mileage Plus frequent flyer
program is included in Note 2(g), "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
- - Mileage Plus Awards" in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

.

Pension Benefits.

The Company accounts for pension benefits using SFAS No. 87, "Employers'
Accounting for Pensions" ("SFAS No. 87.") Under SFAS No. 87, pension expense
is recognized on an accrual basis over employees' approximate service periods
and is generally calculated independent of funding decisions or requirements.
Detailed information regarding the Company's pension plans are included
in Note 20, "Retirement and Postretirement Plans" in the

Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements

. The Company's future funding requirements are
discussed in "Liquidity and Capital Resources" above.

The calculation of
pension expense and pension obligations requires the use of a number of
assumptions, including the assumed discount rate and the expected return
on plan assets. The fair value of plan assets decreased from $7.6 billion
at December 31, 2001 to $6.3 billion at December 31, 2002. Lower investment
returns, higher benefit payments due to recent labor contract amendments
and declining discount rates have increased the difference between the
plans' fair value and accumulated benefit obligations from $1.3 billion
at December 31, 2001 to $4.7 billion at December 31, 2002.

The Company utilized
a discount rate of 6.75% at December 31, 2002, compared to 7.5% at December
31, 2001 and 7.75% at December 31, 2000. The discount rate is based on
the Moody's Aa bond index as of December 31, 2002, adjusted for the duration
of United's pension obligations. Duration is a commonly used measure of
interest rate risk that either assumes that yield changes do not change
the expected cash flows ("modified duration") or assumes that expected
cash flows may change given the fact that the yield changes ("effective
duration"). Since United's pension obligations are generally not satisfied
in a single lump sum distribution, management, with assistance from its
actuary, used the modified duration methodology to determine an acceptable
discount rate by matching the expected cash outflows of United's pension
obligations against available bonds with appropriate maturities.

The Company assumed an expected
rate of return on plan assets of 9.0% at December 31, 2002 compared to
9.75% used at December 31, 2001 and 2000. The expected return on plan assets
is based on an evaluation of the historical behavior of the broad financial
markets and the Company's investment portfolio and taking into consideration
input from the plans' investment consultant and actuary regarding expected
long-term market conditions and investment management performance. The
expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on a target allocation
of assets to the following fund types: 60% equities, 35% fixed income and
5% other with expected long-term rates of return of 11%, 6.5% and 13%,
respectively.

The Company believes
that the long-term asset allocation on average will approximate the targeted
allocation and regularly reviews the actual asset allocation to periodically
rebalance the investments to the targeted allocation when appropriate.
Pension expense is reduced by the expected return on plan assets, which
is measured by assuming the market-related value of plan assets increases
at the expected rate of return. The market-related value is a calculated
value that phases in differences between the expected rate of return and
the actual return over a period of five years.

Actuarial gains or
losses are triggered by changes in assumptions or experience that differ
from the original assumptions. Under SFAS No. 87, those gains and losses
are not required to be recognized currently as pension expense, but instead
may be deferred. If the unrecognized net gain or loss exceeds 10% of the
greater of the projected benefit obligations and the market-related value
of plan assets, the amount outside the 10% corridor is subject to amortization
over the average remaining service life of the covered active employees.
At December 31, 2002, the Company had unrecognized actuarial losses of
$4.5 billion. The recognition of these losses is expected to increase pension
expense by approximately $75 million, $108 million and $157 million in
2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively. Additionally, the Company had unrecognized
prior service costs from past benefit improvements of $1.2 billion, which
will be amortized as a component of pension expense over the average remaining
service life of the covered active employees. The recognition of these
costs is expected to increase pension expense by approximately $91 million
in each of 2003, 2004 and 2005.

Valuation Allowance
for Deferred Tax Assets.

The Company initially recorded a tax valuation
allowance against its deferred tax assets in the third quarter of 2002.
In recording the valuation allowance, management considered whether it
was more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets would
be realized. This analysis included consideration of scheduled reversals
of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, carryback
potential and tax planning strategies, in accordance with SFAS No. 109,
"Accounting for Income Taxes." At December 31, 2002, the Company had recorded
a tax valuation allowance of $1.2 billion against its deferred tax assets.
See also Note 7, "Income Taxes" in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements

for additional information.

New Accounting Pronouncements -

In June 2002, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 146, "Accounting
for Costs Associated with Disposal or Exit Activities" ("SFAS No. 146").
SFAS No. 146 requires that liabilities for costs associated with exit or
disposal activities be recognized when the liabilities are incurred, rather
than when an entity commits to an exit plan. The Company adopted SFAS No.
146 on January 1, 2003. The new rules will change the timing of liability
and expense recognition related to exit or disposal activities, but not
the ultimate amount of such expenses.

In November 2002, the
FASB issued Interpretation 45, "Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements
for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others"
("FIN 45"). FIN 45 requires a guarantor to recognize, at the inception
of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken
in issuing the guarantee. FIN 45 also expands the disclosures required
to be made by a guarantor about its obligations under certain guarantees
that it has issued. Initial recognition and measurement provisions of FIN
45 are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified.
The disclosure requirements are effective immediately and are provided
in Note 21, "Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Uncertainties" in
the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

. The Company does
not expect FIN 45 to have a material effect on its results of operations.

In January 2003, the
FASB issued Interpretation 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities"
("FIN 46"). FIN 46 requires the consolidation of variable interest entities
("VIEs"), as defined. FIN 46 applies to VIEs created after January 31,
2003. The related disclosure requirements are effective immediately and
are provided in Note 21, "Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Uncertainties"
in the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

. The Company is
still evaluating the impact of FIN 46 on its financial statements.

Outlook for 2003 -

The threat of war
with Iraq and subsequent initiation of hostilities has resulted in a significant
decline in revenues for the first quarter and the immediate future. Passenger
unit revenue for January and February 2003 has declined 6% and 11%, respectively,
as compared to the same months of 2002 and future international bookings
in particular, have dropped significantly from the same period last year.
UAL currently expects to report an operating loss of approximately $900
million for the first quarter of 2003.

United's near-term
revenue forecast has deteriorated significantly from recent projections,
as the threat of war became a reality. In recent weeks, the Company has
experienced declines in fuel prices, but due to continued volatility in
the market place, is unable to predict what impact, if any, the war with
Iraq will have on fuel prices in the future. As fuel is a significant expense
to United, changes in fuel price could have a significant impact on the
Company's results of operations.

With the initiation
of military action between the U.S. and Iraq on March 19, the Company immediately
began the implementation of its contingency plan, which involved reducing
the schedule by an additional 8% effective April 6, 2003 and the implementation
of associated reductions in employment levels through placing a portion
of its employees on temporary unpaid leave.

The Company, in participation
with the ATA and other airlines, is in discussions with the U.S. government
regarding the need for financial relief for the industry. Although the
Company will continue to pursue relief from the government and other sources,
given the uncertain situation, further temporary reductions in employee
compensation may be necessary in the future.

The Company's existing fuel
hedges were terminated December 9, 2002 by the counterparties, as the Company's
bankruptcy filing constituted an event of default under the contracts.
The terms of the DIP Financing limit United's ability to post collateral
in connection with fuel hedging. Notwithstanding the above, as market conditions
and its economic outlook change, the Company continually evaluates the
potential economic benefit of entering into fuel hedging arrangements.

Certain statements included
in the above "Outlook" paragraphs, as well as elsewhere throughout

Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

,
are forward-looking and thus reflect the Company's current expectations
and beliefs with respect to certain current and future events and financial
performance. Such forward-looking statements are and will be, as the case
may be, subject to many risks and uncertainties relating to the operations
and business environments of the Company that may cause actual results
to differ materially from any future results expressed or implied in such
forward-looking statements. Factors that could significantly affect net
earnings, revenues, expenses, unit costs, fuel, load factor and capacity
include, without limitation, the following: the Company's ability to continue
as a going concern; the Company's ability to operate pursuant to the terms
of the DIP Financing; the Company's ability to obtain court approval with
respect to motions in the Chapter 11 proceeding prosecuted by it from time
to time; the Company's ability to develop, prosecute, confirm and consummate
one or more plans of reorganization with respect to the Chapter 11 cases;
risks associated with third parties seeking and obtaining court approval
to terminate or shorten the exclusivity period for the Company to propose
and confirm one or more plans of reorganization, for the appointment of
a Chapter 11 trustee or to convert the cases to Chapter 7 cases; the Company's
ability to achieve necessary reductions in labor costs; the Company's ability
to obtain and maintain normal terms with vendors and service providers;
the Company's ability to maintain contracts that are critical to its operations;
the potential adverse impact of the Chapter 11 cases on the Company's liquidity
or results of operations; the costs and availability of financing; the
Company's ability to execute its business plan; the Company's ability to
attract, motivate and/or retain key employees; the Company's ability to
attract and retain customers; demand for transportation in the markets
in which the Company operates; general economic conditions; the effects
of the war in Iraq and any other hostilities or act of war (in the Middle
East or elsewhere) or any terrorist attack; the ability of other air carriers
with whom the Company has alliances or partnerships to provide the services
contemplated by the respective arrangements with such carriers; the costs
and availability of aircraft insurance; the costs of aviation fuel; the
costs associated with existing or future security measures and practices;
competitive pressures on pricing (particularly from lower-cost competitors);
government legislation and regulation; consumer perceptions of the Company's
products; weather conditions; and other risks and uncertainties set forth
from time to time in UAL's reports to the United States Securities and
Exchange Commission. Consequently, the forward-looking statements should
not be regarded as representations or warranties by the Company that such
matters will be realized. The Company disclaims any intent or obligation
to update or revise any of the forward-looking statements, whether in response
to new information, unforeseen events, changed circumstances or otherwise.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Interest Rate Risk -

United's exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates
relates primarily to its debt obligations and short-term investments. United
does not use derivative financial instruments in its investments portfolio.
United's policy is to manage interest rate risk through a combination of
fixed and floating rate debt and entering into swap agreements, depending
upon market conditions. A portion of the borrowings are denominated in
foreign currencies which exposes the Company to risks associated with changes
in foreign exchange rates. To hedge against some of this risk, the Company
has placed foreign currency deposits (primarily for Japanese yen and euros)
to meet foreign currency lease obligations designated in the respective
currencies. Since unrealized mark-to-market gains or losses on the foreign
currency deposits are offset by the losses or gains on the foreign currency
obligations, the Company reduces its overall exposure to foreign currency
exchange rate volatility. The fair value of these deposits is determined
based on the present value of future cash flows using an appropriate swap
rate. The fair value of long-term debt is based on the quoted market prices
for the same or similar issues or the present value of future cash flows
using a U.S. Treasury rate that matches the remaining life of the instrument,
adjusted by a credit spread.

Foreign Currency Risk
- -

United has established a foreign currency hedging program using currency
forwards and options (purchasing put options and selling correlation options)
to hedge exposure to the Japanese yen, Hong Kong dollar, Canadian dollar,
British pound, Australian dollar and the euro. The goal of the hedging
program is to effectively manage risk associated with fluctuations in the
value of the foreign currency, thereby making financial results more stable
and predictable. United does not use currency forwards or currency options
for trading purposes. As of December 31, 2002, United had no outstanding
currency hedges.

Price
Risk (Aircraft Fuel) -

When market conditions indicate risk reduction
is achievable, United enters into fuel option contracts to reduce its price
risk exposure to jet fuel. The option contracts are designed to provide
protection against sharp increases in the price of aircraft fuel. As market
conditions change, so may United's hedging program. As a result of the
bankruptcy filing, all fuel hedges were terminated by the respective counterparties.

Estimated fair values represent the amount
United would pay/receive on December 31, 2002 or December 31, 2001 to terminate
the contracts.

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORTS

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

UAL Corporation

Elk Grove Township, Illinois

We have audited the accompanying consolidated statement of financial
position of UAL Corporation (Debtor-in-Possession) and subsidiaries as
of December 31, 2002, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders' equity, and cash flows for the year then ended. Our audit
also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item
15(a)2 for the year ended December 31, 2002. These consolidated financial
statements ("financial statements") and the financial statement schedule
are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement
schedule based on our audit. The financial statements of the Company and
financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)2 for the
years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, before the change in composition
of its reportable segments and inclusion of disclosures as discussed in
Note 23 and Note 2(k), respectively, were audited by other auditors who
have ceased operations. Those auditors, expressed an unqualified opinion
on those financial statements and financial statement schedule in their
report dated February 20, 2002, and included an explanatory paragraph that
described a change in accounting principle for the measurement of redeemable
preferred ESOP stock and change in accounting principles for revenue recognition.

We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures
in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such 2002 financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of UAL Corporation (Debtor-in-Possession)
and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2002, and the results of their operations
and their cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in
our opinion, the 2002 financial statement schedule, when considered in
relation to the basic 2002 financial statements taken as a whole, presents
fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 1, the Company has filed for reorganization under
Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. The accompanying financial
statements do not purport to reflect or provide for the consequences of
the bankruptcy proceedings. In particular, such financial statements do
not purport to show (a) as to assets, their realizable value on a liquidation
basis or their availability to satisfy liabilities; (b) as to prepetition
liabilities, the amounts that may be allowed for claims or contingencies,
or the status and priority thereof; (c) as to stockholder accounts, the
effect of any changes that may be made in the capitalization of the Company;
or (d) as to operations, the effect of any changes that may be made in
its business.

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that
the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1, as
a result of the bankruptcy filing, realization of assets and satisfaction
of liabilities, without substantial adjustments and/or changes in ownership,
are subject to uncertainty and raise substantial doubt about the Company's
ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plan concerning these
matters is also discussed in Note 1. The financial statements do not include
adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

As discussed above, the financial statements as of and for the years
ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 were audited by other auditors who have
ceased operations. As described in Note 23, the Company changed the composition
of its reportable segments in 2002, and the amounts in the 2001 and 2000
financial statements relating to reportable segments have been restated
to conform to the 2002 composition of reportable segments. We audited the
adjustments that were applied to restate the disclosures for reportable
segments reflected in the 2001 and 2000 financial statements. Our procedures
included (i) comparing the adjusted amounts to the Company's underlying
records obtained from management, and (ii) testing the mathematical accuracy
of the reconciliations of segment amounts to the financial statements.
In our opinion, such adjustments are appropriate and have been properly
applied. However, we were not engaged to audit, review, or apply any procedures
to the 2001 and 2000 financial statements of the Company other than with
respect to such adjustments and, accordingly, we do not express an opinion
or any other form of assurance on the 2001 and 2000 financial statements
taken as a whole.

As described in Note 2(k), these financial statements have been revised
to include the transitional disclosures required by Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," which
was adopted by the Company as of January 1, 2002. Our audit procedures
with respect to the disclosures in Note 2(k) with respect to 2001 and 2000
included (

a

) agreeing the previously reported net earnings (loss)
to the previously issued financial statements

and
the adjustments to reported net earnings (loss) representing amortization
expense (including any related tax effects) recognized in those periods
related to intangible assets that are no longer being amortized

to
the Company's underlying records obtained from management, and (

b

)
testing the mathematical accuracy of the reconciliation of adjusted net
earnings (loss) to reported net earnings (loss), and the related earnings
(loss) per share amounts. In our opinion, the disclosures for 2001 and
2000 in Note 2(k) are appropriate. However, we were not engaged to audit,
review, or apply any procedures to the 2001 and 2000 financial statements
of the Company other than with respect to such disclosures and, accordingly,
we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on the 2001
and 2000 financial statements taken as a whole.

DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP

Chicago, Illinois

March 20, 2003

To the Stockholders and

Board of Directors, UAL Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying statements of consolidated financial
position of UAL Corporation (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiary companies
as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the related statements of consolidated
operations, consolidated cash flows and consolidated stockholders' equity
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001. These
financial statements and the schedule referred to below are the responsibility
of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining,
on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of UAL
Corporation and subsidiary companies as of December 31, 2001 and 2000,
and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2001, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States.

As explained in Note 1(b) of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,
effective January 1, 2001, the Company changed its accounting principles
for the measurement of redeemable preferred ESOP stock as a result of the
adoption of Topic D-98 "Classification and Measurement of Redeemable Securities"
and effective January 1, 2000, the Company changed certain of its accounting
principles for revenue recognition as a result of the adoption of Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 101 "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements."

Our audits were made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic
financial statements taken as a whole. The schedule referenced in Item
14(a) 2 herein is presented for purposes of complying with the Securities
and Exchange Commission's rules and is not part of the basic financial
statements. This schedule has been subjected to the auditing procedures
applied in the audit of the basic financial statements and, in our opinion,
fairly states in all material respects the financial data required to be
set forth therein in relation to the basic financial statements taken as
a whole.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(1)    Proceedings Under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy
Code

Chapter 11 Reorganization.

On
December 9, 2002 ("Petition Date"), UAL Corporation, United Air Lines,
Inc. and 26 direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively,
the "Debtors") filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of
the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court
for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division ("Bankruptcy Court").
The reorganization cases are being jointly administered under the caption
"In re: UAL Corporation, et al., Case No. 02-48191" ("Chapter 11 Cases").
Included in the

Consolidated Financial Statements

are subsidiaries
which have not commenced Chapter 11 cases and are not Debtors. The assets
and liabilities of such non-filing subsidiaries are not considered material
to the

Consolidated Financial Statements

.

The Debtors continue
to operate their businesses as "debtors-in-possession" under the jurisdiction
of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions
of the Bankruptcy Code, the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure and applicable
court orders. In general, as debtors-in-possession, the Debtors are authorized
under Chapter 11 to continue to operate as an ongoing business, but may
not engage in transactions outside the ordinary course of business without
the prior approval of the Bankruptcy Court. At hearings held on December
9, 2002, the Bankruptcy Court granted the Debtors first day motions for
various relief designed to stabilize operations and business relationships
with customers, vendors, employees and others and entered orders granting
authority to the Debtors to, among other things: (a) pay pre-petition and
post-petition employee wages, salaries, benefits and other employee obligations;
(b) honor customer service programs, including United's Mileage Plus frequent
flyer program and ticketing program; and (c) honor obligations arising
prior to the Petition Date related to the Company's interline, clearinghouse,
code sharing and other similar agreements. The Bankruptcy Court also gave
interim approval for the Debtors to access a total of up to $1.5 billion
of debtor-in-possession secured financing ("DIP Financing") provided by
JPMorgan Chase Bank, Citicorp USA, Inc., Bank One, NA and The CIT Group/Business
Credit, Inc. Final approval of the DIP Financing was granted by the Bankruptcy
Court on December 30, 2002. (See "DIP Financing" below.)

Under Section 362 of
the Bankruptcy Code, the filing of the bankruptcy petition automatically
stays most actions against a debtor, including most actions to collect
pre-petition indebtedness or to exercise control over the property of the
debtor's estate. Absent an order of the Bankruptcy Court, substantially
all pre-petition liabilities are subject to settlement under a plan of
reorganization to be approved by the Bankruptcy Court.

Shortly after the Chapter
11 filing, the Debtors began notifying all known current or potential creditors
of the Chapter 11 filing for the purpose of identifying and quantifying
all pre-petition claims against the Debtors. The Chapter 11 filing triggered
defaults on substantially all debt and lease obligations of the Debtors.

Notwithstanding the preceding
general discussion of the automatic stay, the Debtors' rights to possess
and operate certain qualifying aircraft, aircraft engines and other aircraft-related
equipment that are leased or subject to a security interest or conditional
sale contract are governed by a particular provision of the Bankruptcy
Code that specifies different treatment. Section 1110 of the Bankruptcy
Code ("Section 1110") provides that unless the Debtors take certain action,
within 60 days after the Petition Date or such later date as is agreed
by the applicable lessor, secured party, or conditional vendor, the contractual
rights of such financier to take possession of such equipment and to enforce
any of its other rights or remedies under the applicable agreement are
not limited or otherwise affected by the automatic stay or any other provision
of the Bankruptcy Code.

Under Section 1110 of the
Bankruptcy Code, the automatic stay lasts for only 60 days with respect
to Section 1110-eligible aircraft, engines and related equipment except
under two conditions. The debtor may extend the 60-day period by agreement
of the relevant financier, with court approval. Alternatively, the debtor
may agree to perform all of the obligations under the applicable financing
and cure any defaults thereunder as required by the Bankruptcy Code. In
the absence of either such arrangement, the financier may take possession
of the property and enforce any of its contractual rights or remedies to
sell, lease or otherwise retain or dispose of such equipment.

The 60-day period under Section
1110 in the Company's Chapter 11 Case expired on February 7, 2003. The
Company has reached agreements with a significant number of aircraft financiers
to extend the automatic stay, in exchange in certain instances for United's
agreement to make specified payments. United also has made elections with
respect to certain other aircraft to cure all existing defaults and to
pay the contract rates as required by the Bankruptcy Code. With respect
to certain aircraft, however, United neither negotiated an extension of
the automatic stay nor agreed to cure and resume payments. Accordingly,
the financiers of such aircraft may seek to repossess the property. Although
no such financiers have sought to repossess any United equipment, and although
the Company believes that market conditions for commercial aircraft make
repossession unlikely, there can be no assurance that United's lendors
and lessors will not repossess any of the applicable aircraft. Any such
repossessions could result in substantial disruptions to United's operations
and could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business.

Under Section 365 of
the Bankruptcy Code, the Debtors may assume, assume and assign, or reject
certain executory contracts and unexpired leases, including, without limitation,
leases of real property, aircraft and aircraft engines, subject to the
approval of the Bankruptcy Court and certain other conditions. In general,
rejection of an unexpired lease or executory contract is treated as a pre-petition
breach of the lease or contract in question and, subject to certain exceptions,
relieves the Debtors of performing their future obligations under such
lease or contract but entitles the lessor or contract counterparty to a
pre-petition general unsecured claim for damages caused by such deemed
breach. Counterparties to such rejected contracts or leases may file claims
against the Debtors' estate for such damages. Generally, the assumption
of an executory contract or unexpired lease requires the Debtors to cure
most existing defaults under such executory contract or unexpired lease.
In this regard, the Company expects that liabilities subject to compromise
and resolution in the Chapter 11 Cases will arise in the future as a result
of damage claims created by the Debtors' rejection of various executory
contracts and unexpired leases. Conversely, the Company would expect that
the assumption of certain executory contracts and unexpired leases may
convert liabilities shown as subject to compromise to liabilities not subject
to compromise.

Section 1113(c) of
the Bankruptcy Code permits a debtor to move to reject its collective bargaining
agreements ("CBAs") if the debtor first satisfies several statutorily prescribed
substantive and procedural prerequisites and obtains the Bankruptcy Court's
approval of the rejection. After bargaining in good faith and sharing relevant
information with its unions, the debtor must make proposals to modify its
existing CBAs based on the most complete and reliable information available
at the time. The proposed modifications must be necessary to permit the
reorganization of the debtor and must ensure that all the affected parties
are treated fairly and equitably relative to the creditors and the debtor.
Ultimately, rejection is appropriate if the unions refuse to agree to the
debtors necessary proposals "without good cause" and the balance of the
equities favors rejection.

As required by the
Bankruptcy Code, the United States Trustee for the Northern District of
Illinois ("U.S. Trustee") has appointed an official committee of unsecured
creditors (the "Creditors' Committee"). The Creditors Committee and its
legal representatives have a right to be heard on all matters that come
before the Bankruptcy Court with respect to the Debtors. There can be no
assurance that the Creditors' Committee will support the Debtors' positions
or the Debtors' ultimate plan of reorganization, once proposed, and disagreements
between the Debtors and the Creditors' Committee could protract the Chapter
11 Cases, could negatively impact the Debtors' ability to operate during
the Chapter 11 Cases and could delay the Debtors' emergence from Chapter
11.

In order to successfully
exit Chapter 11, the Company will need to propose, and obtain confirmation
by the Bankruptcy Court of, a plan of reorganization that satisfies the
requirements of the Bankruptcy Code. A plan of reorganization would resolve,
among other things, the Debtors' pre-petition obligations, set forth the
revised capital structure of the newly reorganized entity and provide for
its corporate governance subsequent to exit from bankruptcy. On March 21,
2003, the Bankruptcy Court approved the extension of the Company's "exclusivity
period" (during which it is the only party permitted to file a plan of
reorganization) to October 2003, but under certain circumstances, the exclusivity
period could be shortened by two months. The timing of filing a plan of
reorganization by the Company will depend on the timing and outcome of
numerous other ongoing matters in the Chapter 11 Cases. Although the Company
expects to file a plan of reorganization that provides for its emergence
from bankruptcy as a going concern, there can be no assurance at this time
that a plan of reorganization will be confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court,
or that any such plan will be implemented successfully.

Financial Statement
Presentation

.

The accompanying consolidated financial statements
have been prepared in accordance with American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants' Statement of Position 90-7 ("SOP 90-7"), "Financial Reporting
by Entities in Reorganization Under the Bankruptcy Code," and on a going-concern
basis, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets
and satisfaction of liabilities in the ordinary course of business.

SOP 90-7 requires that the
financial statements for periods subsequent to the Chapter 11 filing petition
distinguish transactions and events that are directly associated with the
reorganization from the operations of the business. Accordingly, revenues,
expenses (including professional fees), realized gains and losses, and
provisions for losses directly associated with the reorganization and restructuring
of the business are reported separately in the financial statements. The

Statements
of Consolidated Financial Position

distinguish pre-petition liabilities
subject to compromise from both those pre-petition liabilities that are
not subject to compromise and from post-petition liabilities. Liabilities
subject to compromise are reported at the amounts expected to be allowed,
even if they may be settled for lesser amounts.

In addition, as a result
of the Chapter 11 filing, the realization of assets and satisfaction of
liabilities, without substantial adjustments and/or changes in ownership,
are subject to uncertainty. Given this uncertainty, there is substantial
doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. While
operating as debtors-in-possession under the protection of Chapter 11 of
the Bankruptcy Code and subject to approval of the Bankruptcy Court or
otherwise as permitted in the ordinary course of business, the Debtors,
or some of them, may sell or otherwise dispose of assets and liquidate
or settle liabilities for some amounts other than those reflected in the
consolidated financial statements. Further, a plan of reorganization could
materially change the amounts and classifications in the historical consolidated
financial statements.

Pursuant to the Bankruptcy
Code, the Debtors have filed schedules with the Bankruptcy Court setting
forth the assets and liabilities of the Debtors as of the Petition Date.
Differences between amounts recorded by the Debtors and claims filed by
creditors will be investigated and resolved as part of the Chapter 11 Cases.
The deadline for filing proofs of claim with the Bankruptcy Court is May
12, 2003, with a limited exception for governmental entities, which have
until June 9, 2003 to file proofs of claim. Accordingly, the ultimate number
and allowed amounts of such claims are not presently known.

DIP Financing.

The
DIP Financing consists of two facilities, a $300 million facility provided
by Bank One N.A. ("Bank One Facility") and a $1.2 billion facility provided
by J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, Citicorp USA, Inc., Bank One, N.A. and The CIT
Group/Business Credit, Inc. ("Club Facility"). The Company has received
commitments of $1.0 billion under the Club Facility following the completion
of the syndication process for that facility; the balance is conditioned
upon the participation of one or more additional lenders approved by the
existing participants.

The Bank One Facility
consists of a $300 million term loan with an interest rate option of the
prime rate plus 5.5% or LIBOR plus 6.5% (with a LIBOR floor of 3%). As
of December 31, 2002, the Company had borrowed $300 million at the LIBOR
option which is due in five equal monthly installments beginning in March
2004.

The Club Facility consists
of a revolving credit and letter of credit facility of $800 million and
a term loan of $400 million, which matures on July 1, 2004. The Company
has the option of borrowing under the Club Facility at an interest rate
of the prime rate plus 5.5% or LIBOR plus 6.5% (with a LIBOR floor of 3%).
As of December 31, 2002, the Company had borrowed $400 million under the
term loan at the LIBOR option. In addition, the Company had available a
$100 million letter of credit facility which was not drawn down on in December,
but was fully utilized by March 2003. The remaining $700 million under
the revolving credit facility is subject to stringent availability hurdles
as discussed below.

The DIP Financing is
guaranteed by each of the Debtors and is secured by first priority liens
on all unencumbered present and future assets of the Debtors and by junior
liens on all other assets of the Debtors, other than certain specified
assets, including assets which are subject to financing agreements that
are entitled to the benefits of Section 1110 to the extent such financing
agreements prohibit such junior liens. In addition, the Bank One Facility
is secured by cash collateral collected under the Co-Branded Credit Card
Agreement between Bank One and the Company.

The terms of the DIP
Financing include covenants that require the Company to satisfy ongoing
monthly financial requirements as determined by EBITDAR (earnings before
interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and aircraft rents)
and covenants that limit, among other things, the Debtors' ability to borrow
additional money, make capital expenditures and make additional corporate
investments. In addition, the Company is required to maintain a minimum
unrestricted cash balance, excluding escrowed amounts, of $300 million.

Under the Club Facility,
borrowing availability is determined by a formula based on a percentage
of eligible assets. The eligible assets consist of certain previously unencumbered
aircraft, spare engines, spare parts inventory, certain flight simulators
and quick engine change kits. The underlying value of such assets may fluctuate
periodically due to prevailing market conditions and fluctuations in value
may have an impact on the borrowing availability under the Club Facility.
Availability may be further limited by additional reserves imposed by the
banks in their commercially reasonable discretion.

The remaining $700
million of availability under the Club Facility, subject to the limitation
on borrowing availability discussed above, will be available to the Company
after certain conditions are met, including achieving positive cumulative
EBITDAR; submitting a certified updated business plan; providing updated
appraisals on the collateral and ascertaining there has been no material
adverse change with respect to transferability of routes, gate leaseholds
or slots.

(2) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

(a) Basis of Presentation

- -

UAL is a holding company whose principal subsidiary is United. The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of UAL and all of
its majority-owned affiliates (collectively "the Company"). All significant
intercompany transactions are eliminated. Certain prior-year financial
statement items have been reclassified to conform to the current year's
presentation.

(b) Use of Estimates

- -

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

(c) Airline Revenues

- - Passenger fares and cargo revenues are recorded as operating revenues
when the transportation is furnished. The value of unused passenger tickets
is included in current liabilities as advance ticket sales. In addition,
United has formed bilateral alliances with other airlines which include:
joint frequent flyer participation; code sharing of flight operations;
coordination of reservations, baggage handling and flight schedules and
other resource-sharing activities. Code sharing is an agreement under which
a carrier's flights can be marketed under the two-letter airline designator
code of another carrier. Revenues earned under these arrangements are allocated
between the code share partners based on existing contractual agreements
and airline industry standard pro-ration formulas and are recognized as
passenger revenue when the transportation is provided.

(d) Cash and Cash Equivalents
and Short-Term Investments

-

Cash in excess of operating requirements
is invested in short-term, highly liquid, income-producing investments.
Investments with a maturity of three months or less on their acquisition
date are classified as cash and cash equivalents. Other investments are
classified as short-term investments.

From time to time, United
lends certain of its securities classified as cash and cash equivalents
and short-term investments to third parties. United requires collateral
in an amount exceeding the value of the securities and is obligated to
reacquire the securities at the end of the contract. United accounts for
these transactions as secured borrowings rather than sales and does not
remove the securities from the balance sheet. At December 31, 2002, United
had no secured borrowings outstanding.

At December 31, 2002 and
2001, $402 million and $526 million, respectively, of investments in debt
securities included in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments
were classified as available-for-sale, and $714 million and $2.0 billion,
respectively, were classified as held-to-maturity. Investments in debt
securities classified as available-for-sale are stated at fair value based
on the quoted market prices for the securities, which does not differ significantly
from their cost basis. Investments classified as held-to-maturity are stated
at cost which approximates market due to their short-term maturities. The
gains or losses from sales of available-for-sale securities are included
in interest income for each respective year.

At December 31, 2002, the
Company had $578 million in restricted cash, including $116 million in
long-term restricted cash. The cash largely represents security for worker
compensation obligations in states where United self-insures, security
deposits for airport leases and reserves with institutions which process
the Company's sales.

(e) Aircraft Fuel,
Spare Parts and Supplies

-

Aircraft fuel and maintenance and operating
supplies are stated at average cost. Flight equipment spare parts are stated
at average cost less an obsolescence allowance.

(f) Operating Property
and Equipment

-

Owned operating property and equipment is stated
at cost. Property under capital leases, and the related obligation for
future lease payments, are initially recorded at an amount equal to the
then present value of those lease payments.

Depreciation and amortization
of owned depreciable assets is based on the straight-line method over their
estimated service lives. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the
remaining period of the lease or the estimated service life of the related
asset, whichever is less. Aircraft are depreciated to estimated salvage
values, generally over lives of 25 to 30 years; buildings are depreciated
over lives of 25 to 45 years; and other property and equipment are depreciated
over lives of 3 to 15 years.

Properties under capital
leases are amortized on the straight-line method over the life of the lease
or, in the case of certain aircraft, over their estimated service lives.
Lease terms are 10 to 22 years for aircraft and flight simulators and 29
years for buildings. Amortization of capital leases is included in depreciation
and amortization expense.

Maintenance and repairs,
including the cost of minor replacements, are charged to maintenance expense
accounts as incurred. Costs of additions to and renewals of units of property
are charged to property and equipment accounts.

(g) Mileage Plus Awards

- -

UAL accrues the estimated incremental cost of providing free travel
awards earned under its Mileage Plus frequent flyer program when such award
levels are reached. United sells mileage credits to participating airline
partners in the Mileage Plus program and UAL Loyalty Services ("ULS"),
a wholly owned subsidiary of UAL, sells mileage credits to non-airline
business partners.

A portion of revenue from
the sale of mileage credits is deferred and recognized as passenger revenue
when the transportation is provided. Accordingly, UAL recorded a charge
of $209 million, net of tax, in 2000, for the cumulative effect of a change
in accounting principle to reflect the application of the accounting method
to prior years. This change resulted in a reduction to revenues of approximately
$38 million for 2000.

(h) Deferred Gains

- -

Gains on aircraft sale and leaseback transactions are deferred and
amortized over the lives of the leases as a reduction of rental expense.

(i) United Express

- - United has marketing agreements under which independent regional carriers,
flying under the United Express name, feed passengers to United owned and
operated flights. United pays these carriers on a fee-per-departure basis
and includes the revenues derived from the carriers in passenger revenue,
net of these expenses. United Express revenues (net of expenses) included
in passenger revenues were $(255) million, $(232) million and $(49) million
for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

While the effect on
United's results, taking into account only the United Express flights,
is negative, the Company realizes a significant benefit (not included in
the results shown above) from the traffic provided to United's operations
as a result of these agreements.

United has call options
on 83 regional jets owned or leased by these carriers. The call option
is a standard part of the United Express agreement and is intended to allow
United to secure control over regional jets used for United Express flying
in the event a United Express agreement is terminated. The call option
reduces this risk if the Company determines that a change of United Express
carrier is necessary, particularly due to the significant time lag between
order and delivery of aircraft (such as regional jets made to United's
specifications).

The call options are
only exercisable if United maintains a specified credit rating and the
United Express carrier fails to meet required operating and/or financial
performance levels for a specified period of time. Due to United's current
credit rating, none of the call options are exercisable at this time.

(j) Advertising

- - Advertising costs, which are included in other operating expenses, are
expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $169 million, $217 million
and $269 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000,
respectively.

(k) Intangibles

- - Intangibles consist primarily of route acquisition costs and intangible
pension assets (see Note 20, "Retirement and Postretirement Plans").

Effective January 1, 2002,
UAL adopted SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" ("SFAS
No. 142"). In connection with the adoption of SFAS No. 142, UAL discontinued
$12 million in annual amortization expense on route acquisition costs,
which are indefinite-lived intangible assets. SFAS No. 142 also requires
companies to test intangibles for impairment on an annual basis or on an
interim basis when a triggering event occurs. During the first quarter
of 2002, the Company performed an initial evaluation of its intangibles
and determined that the fair value of its intangibles was in excess of
the book value.

The following information
relates to UAL's intangibles at December 31, 2002:

Slots and gates are
amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the related leases.
Other intangibles are amortized over periods of 3 to 10 years. Total amortization
expense recognized in 2002 was $12 million. The Company expects to record
amortization expense of $8 million in 2003, $7 million in 2004 and 2005,
$6 million in 2006 and $4 million in 2007.

Route authorities are
rights granted by governments to operate flights to and from a particular
country. These authorities are very specific and limited, fixed in nature
and are rarely available in the marketplace. Accordingly, route authorities
are highly valued and sought after assets by all airlines. During 2002,
UAL obtained a third-party appraisal of its route authorities which concluded
that the market value of these assets continues to be considerably in excess
of the book value.

Slots and gates, like
routes, are highly valued assets that do not frequently come into the marketplace.
The Company has no intention to sell these assets and believes that the
market value is in excess of the recorded book value.

Goodwill primarily
relates to UAL Loyalty Services' ("ULS") acquisition of MyPoints.com, which
occurred in July 2001 and is based on the final purchase price allocation.
Management believes that the cash flows of ULS's operation, as reflected
in Note 23, "Segment Information" are sufficient to support the value of
these intangibles and goodwill.

Pro forma results for
the years ended 2001 and 2000 assuming the discontinuation of amortization
are shown below:

(l) Measurement of
Impairments

- Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS
No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets"
("SFAS No. 144"), which addresses the accounting and reporting for the
impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. SFAS No. 144 did not have
an effect on the Company's results of operations.

United's policy is
to recognize an impairment charge when an asset's carrying value exceeds
its net undiscounted future cash flows and its fair market value. The amount
of the charge is the difference between the asset's carrying value and
fair market value.

(m) Stock Option Accounting

- - At December 31, 2002, the Company had certain stock-based employee compensation
plans, as described in Note 18, "Stock Options and Awards." The Company
has elected to continue accounting for those plans under the recognition
and measurement provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
"Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and related Interpretations.
No stock-based employee compensation cost pertaining to stock options is
reflected in the Company's net earnings (loss), as all options granted
under those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the
underlying common stock on the date of grant. If compensation cost for
stock-based employee compensation plans had been determined using the fair
value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation," the Company's net earnings (loss) and earnings (loss) per
share would have instead been reported as the pro forma amounts indicated
below:

(3) Special Charges

2002 -

Avolar.

On
March 22, 2002, UAL announced the orderly shutdown of its wholly owned
subsidiary Avolar, which was formed in early 2001 to operate and sell fractional
ownership interests in premium business aircraft. In connection with the
closing of Avolar, UAL recorded a special charge of $82 million in the
first quarter 2002 which included aircraft deposits and termination fees
($55 million), operating related expenses ($18 million), severance related
costs ($7 million) and other costs ($2 million).

In accordance with
Emerging Issues Task Force No. 94-3, "Liability Recognition for Certain
Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity," the
Company identified those charges which should be recognized at the time
management had committed to an exit plan. The special charge included current
period and future estimated liabilities incurred which would produce no
future economic benefit to UAL.

Specifically, the current
period expenses included in the charge were related to obligations incurred
prior to the commitment date which would not produce any future benefit
to the Company and included costs for promotional flights, consultant fees
for the development of computer systems, advertising in anticipation of
operations and other miscellaneous expenses.

Severance.

During the fourth quarter of 2002, UAL announced the closing of three reservation
centers, a maintenance line and four international stations and the conversion
of five stations in the U.S. to United Express service, which resulted
in the furloughing of a number of employees. Additionally, in connection
with the Company's plan to decrease the airline's flying schedule, as well
as overall cost-saving measures, the Company announced a reduction in employment
levels effective January and February 2003. As a result of the announced
furloughs, the Company recorded a special charge of $67 million in the
fourth quarter of 2002 for severance-related charges.

2001 -

Related to September
11.

During the third quarter of 2001, United recorded a special
charge of $1.3 billion in operating expense and $49 million in non-operating
expense for amounts relating to the September 11 terrorist attacks and
the resulting impact on the Company's schedule and operations.

The special charge
in operating expense was made up of the following (in millions):

After the September
11 terrorist attacks, the Company grounded the B727-200 and B737-200 fleets
and recorded a charge of $271 million, reflecting the write down of the
fleets to fair value.

Due to the changes
implemented to United's operations, the Company reviewed its fleet for
impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 121, as amended by SFAS No. 144.
Management determined that the estimated net undiscounted future cash flows
generated by its B737-500 and B747-400 fleets would be less than their
carrying value. Management estimated the undiscounted future cash flows
with models used by the Company in making fleet and scheduling decisions.
These models utilized the Company's projections of passenger yield, fuel
costs, labor costs and other relevant factors for the markets where these
aircraft will operate. The aircraft in each of these fleets were written
down to their fair market values, as estimated by management using published
sources, third-party appraisals and bids received from third parties. Accordingly,
the special charge includes an impairment charge of $517 million for these
aircraft fleets resulting from the anticipated decrease in future cash
flows.

Also as a result
of the terrorist attacks, the Company furloughed approximately 20,000 employees
across all work groups (pilots, flight attendants, mechanics, ramp service,
customer service and management and salaried employees). In connection
with the furloughs, United accrued severance costs of approximately $217
million, including a one-time curtailment charge relating to the accelerated
recognition of unrecognized prior service costs for certain of the Company's
pension plans.

Also included in the
special charge is $107 million relating to the write-off of capital projects
no longer being pursued. As a direct result of September 11, management
made the decision to terminate all funding and labor resources for numerous
capitalized projects that were in-process prior to September 11 and which
did not provide any immediate economic or long-term safety benefits to
customers or the airline. The projects and related amounts capitalized
that were discontinued following September 11 included computer system
development costs ($48 million), aircraft improvements ($33 million), airport
facility improvements ($21 million) and other miscellaneous projects ($5
million).

After management announced
the furlough and the freeze on all capital expenditures, United determined
that the Company was unlikely to meet certain commitments or provisions
of certain executory contracts with third parties. The executory contracts
are related to agreements with state and local governments ($157 million),
aircraft improvements ($11 million) and facilities and other ($13 million)

Additionally,
the Company recorded a non-operating special charge of $49 million related
to certain non-operating aircraft that were leased to others. The fair
value of these aircraft was significantly impacted by the events of September
11.

As part of the Air
Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act of 2001 (the "Act")
enacted in response to the events of September 11, 2001, the federal government
made $5.0 billion in federal grants available to the airline industry.
The Company received a total of $782 million in grants under the Act, of
which $652 million was received in 2001 and $130 million in 2002. These
amounts represent the Company's total allocation of grant money under the
Act.

Following is a reconciliation
of activity related to the accruals for the reduction in force and early
termination fees:

During 2002, the Company
reversed $44 million of overaccruals pertaining to the reduction in force
as a result of the Company furloughing fewer employees than was initially
anticipated in early 2002.

Through December 31,
2002, the Company had received approximately $58 million related to insurance
recoveries on aircraft destroyed by the September 11 attacks and approximately
$12 million related to other covered expenses.  The Company anticipates
that its liability from claims arising from the events of September 11,
2001 will be significant, after considering the liability protections provided
for by the Act; however, the Company expects that any amounts paid on such
claims will be borne by its insurance carriers as claims are resolved and,
in any event, the Company believes that, under the Act, its liability will
be limited to its insurance coverage.

The Company has not
incurred any material environmental obligations relating to September 11.

US Airways Merger.

During
the second quarter of 2001, UAL recognized a special charge of $116 million
for incremental direct costs incurred related to the potential acquisition
of US Airways Group, Inc. that was ultimately terminated. In addition to
a $50 million termination fee, the Company incurred costs of $29 million
related to integration project management, $16 million in legal fees and
$21 million in other professional fees that were written off.

2000 -

Operating Special
Charges.

The Company recorded the following special charges in
operating expense in 2000:

During 2000, the Company
permanently grounded certain BAe Turbo-Prop aircraft which had been used
in the United Express operation and announced the planned early retirement
of the B727-222 aircraft fleet resulting in an impairment charge of $33
million, in accordance with SFAS No. 121, as amended by SFAS No. 144. In
connection with the grounding of the BAe aircraft, the Company also incurred
a charge of $16 million for losses related to subleases, in accordance
with FASB Technical Bulletin 79-15, "Accounting for Loss on a Sublease
Not Involving the Disposal of a Segment."

The Company also announced
its decision to end its freighter operation effective December 24, 2000,
resulting in the early retirement of four DC10-30 freighter aircraft which
were under lease. Accordingly, the Company recorded a charge of $12 million
in the fourth quarter of 2000. Additionally, the Company permanently grounded
seven leased B747-238 aircraft in the second quarter of 2000 and recorded
a $24 million charge, as the aircraft continued to be leased but were no
longer used for operating purposes beyond 2000.  These charges were
recognized in accordance with EITF 88-10, "Costs Associated with Lease
Modification or Termination," as it was determined that the grounded, leased
aircraft and improvements had no substantive future use or benefit. Accordingly,
the remaining rental payments and capitalized leasehold improvements were
written-off.

Finally, the Company
recorded a charge of $37 million in the second quarter of 2000 when the
Company retired the inflight video system on certain B777-222 aircraft,
which was replaced by an enhanced and more reliable inflight video system.
The Company also recorded an impairment charge of $17 million to reduce
the carrying value of certain equipment no longer used in the Company's
operations as of the fourth quarter 2000, to net realizable value in accordance
with SFAS No. 121.

Priceline.

In
1999, United received 5.5 million warrants convertible into 5.5 million
shares of Priceline common stock at an exercise price of $52.625, which
were recorded at their fair value of $61 million. In the third quarter
of 2000, United recorded an impairment loss of $38 million, net of tax,
in non-operating expense, for the write-down of these warrants to zero.
Subsequent to the third quarter of 2000, the Company sold all of its warrants
in Priceline for less than $1 million in proceeds.

(4) Per Share Amounts

Basic earnings per share
were computed by dividing net earnings (loss) before extraordinary item
and cumulative effect by the weighted-average number of shares of common
stock outstanding during the year and potential participating ESOP preferred
shares in periods where such shares are dilutive using the if-converted
method. In addition, diluted earnings per share amounts include potential
common shares, including common shares issuable upon conversion of ESOP
shares committed to be released.

At December 31, 2002, stock
options to purchase 12,850,750 shares of common stock were outstanding,
but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share,
because the exercise price of these options was greater than the average
market price of the common shares. In addition, 33,857,761 shares of convertible
ESOP preferred stock were not included in the computation of diluted earnings
per share, as the result would be antidilutive.

(5) Comprehensive Income

The following table presents
the tax effect of those items included in other comprehensive income:

Unrealized gains (losses)
on securities primarily represent gains (losses) on the Company's investments
in Galileo and Cendant as discussed in Note 8, "Investments."

The components of accumulated
other comprehensive income (loss) (which are all net of applicable taxes
in 2000 and 2001) are as follows:

(6)  Other Income (Expense) - Miscellaneous

Included in Other income
(expense) - "Miscellaneous, net" was $(13) million, $(21) million and $(22)
million of foreign exchange gains (losses) in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

(7) Income Taxes

In 2002, UAL incurred both
a regular and an alternative minimum tax ("AMT") loss. The carryback of
the AMT loss to 1998 and 1999 will produce a federal tax refund, thereby
reducing AMT credits. The primary differences between UAL's regular tax
loss and AMT loss are the depreciation adjustments and preferences.

In assessing the realizability
of its deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely
than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will be realized.
During 2002, the Company recorded a valuation allowance against its deferred
tax assets.

The provision (credit) for
income taxes is summarized as follows:

The significant components
of the deferred income tax provision (credit) are as follows:

The income tax provision
differed from amounts computed at the statutory federal income tax rate,
as follows:

Temporary differences and
carryforwards that give rise to a significant portion of deferred tax assets
and liabilities for 2002 and 2001 are as follows:

At December 31, 2002, UAL
and its subsidiaries had $294 million of federal AMT credits and $1.6 billion
of federal and state net operating loss ("NOL") credits which may be carried
forward to reduce the tax liabilities of future years. Federal NOL credits
of $218 million expire in 2022 and $1.2 billion expire in 2023.

Current Internal Revenue
Service ("IRS") rules would place the Company's NOLs at risk if an ownership
change occurs during the three years prior to emergence from bankruptcy.
An ownership change is triggered if shareholders owning 5% or more of the
stock change their holdings in the aggregate by at least 50 percentage
points. Consequently, the Bankruptcy Court has entered an injunction preventing
trading in the Company's securities by substantial equity holders and claimholders,
including the ESOP trustee, State Street Bank & Trust.

On March 4, 2003, the
Company announced that it had received a private letter ruling from the
IRS which would permit the Company to allow the additional sale of UAL
common stock held by the ESOP without jeopardizing these tax benefits.
(See Note 16, "ESOP Preferred Stock" and Note 19, "Employee Stock Ownership
Plans" for further details.)

The Company has determined,
based on its history of operating earnings (losses) and current declaration
of bankruptcy, that it is more likely than not that the gross deferred
tax assets, net of valuation allowances at December 31, 2002 are expected
to be realized through the reversals of existing deferred tax credits.

(8) Investments

At December 31, 2000, United
owned 15,940,000 shares (18%) in Galileo, a leading provider of electronic
global distribution services for the travel industry. On October 1, 2001,
Cendant Corporation ("Cendant") acquired all of the outstanding common
stock of Galileo for a combination of stock and cash. Accordingly, United
tendered all of its shares in Galileo for net proceeds of $65 million and
21,168,320 shares in Cendant, resulting in a gain of $244 million. In the
fourth quarter of 2001, United sold 14 million shares of Cendant common
stock for net proceeds of $194 million, resulting in a gain of $17 million.
In January 2002, United sold its remaining investment in Cendant for net
proceeds of $137 million, resulting in a gain of $46 million.

During 2000, 2001 and 2002,
ULS invested approximately $53 million in Orbitz, an Internet travel web
site. ULS owns approximately 22% of Orbitz and accounts for this investment
using the equity method of accounting.

During 1998 and 1999, United
invested approximately $51 million in GetThere.com resulting in a 28% minority
interest consisting of common stock, warrants and options. United accounted
for its investment in GetThere.com using the equity method of accounting.
On October 6, 2000, Sabre Holdings Corporation acquired all of the outstanding
common stock of GetThere.com for $17.75 per share. Accordingly, after converting
its options and warrants, United tendered all of its shares for net proceeds
of $147 million, resulting in a gain of approximately $69 million, net
of tax.

(9) Acquisitions

On July 18, 2001, ULS successfully
completed its cash tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding common
stock of MyPoints.com for $2.60 per share. MyPoints.com is an Internet-based
direct marketing and membership services company, known for its database-driven
loyalty infrastructure. Including the costs related to vested management
stock options, outstanding warrants and transaction-related expenditures,
the aggregate cost of the acquisition was approximately $118 million ($32
million, net of cash acquired). The Company recorded approximately $32
million to goodwill and intangible assets based on the final purchase price
allocation. This transaction is being accounted for under the purchase
method, in accordance with SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations."

(10) Liabilities Subject to Compromise

Liabilities subject
to compromise refers to liabilities incurred prior to the commencement
of the Chapter 11 Cases. These amounts represent the Company's estimate
of known or potential pre-petition claims to be resolved in connection
with the Chapter 11 Cases. Such claims remain subject to future adjustments.
Adjustments may result from negotiations, actions of the Bankruptcy Court,
rejection of executory contracts and unexpired leases, the determination
as to the value of any collateral securing claims, proofs of claim or other
events. It is anticipated that such adjustments may be material. Payment
terms for these amounts will be established in connection with the Chapter
11 Cases.

At December 31, 2002,
the Company had liabilities subject to compromise of approximately $13.8
billion which consisted of the following:

(11) Short-Term Borrowings

At December 31, 2001, United
had outstanding $133 million in short-term borrowings, bearing an average
interest rate of 2.80%. Receivables amounting to $145 million were pledged
by United to secure repayment of such outstanding borrowings. This arrangement
was terminated in May 2002 and the borrowings repaid.

(12) Long-Term Debt

As of December 31, 2002,
all of the Company's pre-petition debt is in default due to the Chapter
11 filing. Pre-petition debt, which is classified as liabilities subject
to compromise as of December 31, consisted of the following:

A summary of long-term debt,
including current maturities, as of December 31 is as follows:

At December 31, 2002, United
had outstanding a total of $3.9 billion of debt at variable rates from
2.03% to 9.52% based on specified spreads over LIBOR.

In December 2002, the
Company borrowed $700 million under the DIP Facility as described more
fully in Note 1, "Proceedings Under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code."

During 2002, the Company
refinanced approximately $525 million in interim financing through a $775
million private debt financing which refinanced certain aircraft. The Company
also arranged long-term financing for approximately $314 million in debt
that had been placed in interim financing facilities and refinanced $238
million in long-term debt through a sale-leaseback transaction.

In July 2000, the Company
issued $921 million in enhanced equipment trust certificates ("EETCs")
to refinance certain owned aircraft and aircraft under operating leases.
Net proceeds after refinancing the operating leases was $622 million. In
December 2000, the Company issued an additional $1.5 billion in EETCs to
finance certain owned aircraft and in August 2001, the Company issued $1.5
billion in EETCs to finance certain owned aircraft. Also during 2001, the
Company issued $1.0 billion in long-term debt to finance the acquisition
of aircraft.

In addition to scheduled
principal payments, in 2000 the Company repaid $116 million in principal
amount of debentures prior to maturity. The debentures were scheduled to
mature at various times through 2021. An extraordinary loss of $6 million,
net of tax benefits of $4 million was recorded, reflecting amounts paid
in excess of the debt carrying value.

At December 31, 2002, United
had recorded $493 million in special facilities revenue bonds to finance
the acquisition and construction of certain facilities at Los Angeles,
San Francisco, Miami and Chicago. United guarantees the payment of these
bonds under various payment and loan agreements. The bond proceeds are
restricted to expenditures on the facilities and unspent amounts are classified
as other assets in the

Statements of Consolidated Financial Position

.

Various assets, principally
aircraft, having an aggregate book value of $11.0 billion at December 31,
2002, were pledged as security under various loan agreements.

The carrying amount
of the Company's borrowings under the DIP Facility approximates the fair
value. The fair value of the Company's debt included in liabilities subject
to compromise cannot be reasonably estimated at December 31, 2002. The
fair value of debt at December 31, 2001 was $6.9 billion.

(13) Lease Obligations

The Company leases aircraft,
airport passenger terminal space, aircraft hangars and related maintenance
facilities, cargo terminals, other airport facilities, real estate, office
and computer equipment and vehicles. As allowed under Section 365 of the
Bankruptcy Code, the Company may assume, assume and assign, or reject certain
executory contracts and unexpired leases, including leases of real property,
aircraft and aircraft engines, subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy
Court and certain other conditions. Consequently, the Company anticipates
that its liabilities pertaining to leases, and the amounts related thereto
as discussed below, will change significantly in the future.

At December 31, 2002, scheduled
future minimum lease payments under capital leases (substantially all of
which are for aircraft) and operating leases having initial or remaining
noncancelable lease terms of more than one year were as follows:

As of December 31, 2002,
United leased 300 aircraft, 59 of which were under capital leases. These
leases have terms of 5 to 26 years, and expiration dates ranging from 2003
through 2018. Under the terms of all leases, United has the right to purchase
the aircraft at the end of the lease term, in some cases at fair market
value and in others at fair market value or a percentage of cost. The theoretical
present value of United's future minimum lease payments under operating
leases for aircraft and non-aircraft was $5.2 billion and $3.5 billion,
respectively, at December 31, 2002.

Certain of the Company's
aircraft lease transactions contain provisions such as put options giving
the lessor the right to require the Company to purchase the aircraft at
lease termination for a certain amount resulting in residual value guarantees.
Leases containing this or similar provisions are recorded as capital leases
on the statement of financial position and, accordingly, any and all residual
value guarantee amounts contained in an aircraft lease are fully reflected
as capital lease obligations on the

Statements of Consolidated Financial
Position

.

In connection with the financing
of certain aircraft accounted for as capital leases, United had on deposit
at December 31, 2002 an aggregate 42 billion yen ($357 million), 387 million
euro ($405 million) and $14 million in certain banks and had pledged an
irrevocable security interest in such deposits to certain of the aircraft
lessors. These deposits will be used to pay off an equivalent amount of
recorded capital lease obligations.

Amounts charged to rent expense,
net of minor amounts of sublease rentals, were $1.5 billion in 2002, $1.4
billion in 2001 and $1.5 billion in 2000. Included in 2002 rental expense
was $11

million in contingent rentals, resulting from changes in
interest rates for operating leases under which the rent payments are based
on variable interest rates.

(14) Company-Obligated Mandatorily Redeemable Preferred Securities
of a Subsidiary Trust

In December 1996, UAL Corporation
Capital Trust I (the "Trust") issued $75 million of its 13 1/4% Trust Originated
Preferred Securities (the "Preferred Securities") in exchange for 2,999,304
depositary shares, each representing 1/1000 of one share of Series B 12
1/4% preferred stock (see Note 15, "Serial Preferred Stock"). Concurrent
with the issuance of the Preferred Securities and the related purchase
by UAL of the Trust's common securities, the Company issued to the Trust
$77 million aggregate principal amount of its 13 1/4% Junior Subordinated
Debentures (the "Debentures") due 2026. The Debentures are and will be
the sole assets of the Trust. The interest and other payment dates on the
Debentures correspond to the distribution and other payment dates on the
Preferred Securities. Upon maturity or redemption of the Debentures, the
Preferred Securities will be mandatorily redeemed. The Debentures are redeemable
at UAL's option, in whole or in part, on or after July 12, 2004, at a redemption
price equal to 100% of the principal amount to be redeemed, plus accrued
and unpaid interest to the redemption date. Upon the repayment of the Debentures,
the proceeds thereof will be applied to redeem the Preferred Securities.

There is a full and unconditional
guarantee by UAL of the Trust's obligations under the securities issued
by the Trust. However, the Company's obligations are subordinate and junior
in right of payment to certain other of its indebtedness. UAL has the right
to defer payments of interest on the Debentures by extending the interest
payment period, at any time, for up to 20 consecutive quarters. If interest
payments on the Debentures are so deferred, distributions on the Preferred
Securities will also be deferred. During any deferral, distributions will
continue to accrue with interest thereon. In addition, during any such
deferral, UAL may not declare or pay any dividend or other distribution
on, or redeem or purchase, any of its capital stock.

As a result of the Chapter
11 filing, the Company is in default to the Trust and is no longer making
interest payments on the Debentures. As a result, the Trust will no longer
have the funds available to pay distributions on the Preferred Securities
and stopped accruing and paying such dividends in October 2002. The Trust
is in default on the Preferred Securities. As the Company is a guarantor
on the outstanding Debentures, as a result of the default, the Company
has become a debtor to the holders of the Preferred Securities directly.
This liability is a pre-petition liability and has been classified as liabilities
subject to compromise. Additionally, the Company is no longer accruing
for distributions on the Preferred Securities.

The fair value of the Preferred
Securities at December 31, 2002 and 2001 was $3 million and $57 million,
respectively.

(15) Serial Preferred Stock

At December 31, 2002, UAL
had outstanding 3,203,177 depositary shares, each representing 1/1000 of
one share of Series B 12 1/4% preferred stock, with a liquidation preference
of $25 per depositary share ($25,000 per Series B preferred share) and
a stated capital of $0.01 per Series B preferred share. Under its terms,
any portion of the Series B preferred stock or the depositary shares is
redeemable for cash after July 11, 2004, at UAL's option, at the equivalent
of $25 per depositary share, plus accrued dividends. The Series B preferred
stock is not convertible into any other securities, has no stated maturity
and is not subject to mandatory redemption.

The Series B preferred stock
ranks senior to all other preferred and common stock outstanding, except
the Preferred Securities, as to receipt of dividends and amounts distributed
upon liquidation. The Series B preferred stock has voting rights only to
the extent required by law and with respect to charter amendments that
adversely affect the preferred stock or the creation or issuance of any
security ranking senior to the preferred stock. Additionally, if dividends
are not paid for six cumulative quarters, the Series B preferred stockholders
are entitled to elect two additional members to the UAL Board of Directors
until all dividends are paid in full. Pursuant to UAL's restated certificate
of incorporation, UAL is authorized to issue a total of 50,000 shares of
Series B preferred stock.

On September 30, 2002, UAL
announced that it was suspending the payment of dividends on the Series
B preferred stock. As a result of the Chapter 11 filing, the Company is
no longer accruing for dividends on the Series B preferred stock.

UAL is authorized to issue
up to 15,986,584 additional shares of serial preferred stock.

(16) ESOP Preferred Stock

The following activity relates
to UAL's outstanding ESOP preferred stocks (see Note 19, "Employee Stock
Ownership Plans" for a description of the ESOPs):

An aggregate of 17,675,345
shares of Class 1 and Class 2 ESOP Preferred Stock were issued to employees
under the ESOPs. Each share of ESOP Preferred Stock is convertible into
four shares of UAL common stock. Shares typically are converted to common
as employees retire or otherwise leave the Company. The stock has a par
value of $0.01 per share and is nonvoting. The Class 1 and Class 2 ESOP
Preferred Stocks have a liquidation value of $126.96 per share. The Class
1 ESOP Preferred Stock provided a fixed annual dividend of $8.8872 per
share, which ceased on March 31, 2000; the Class 2 does not pay a fixed
dividend.

Class P, M and S Voting Preferred
Stocks were established to provide the voting power to the employee groups
participating in the ESOPs. Additional Voting Preferred Stock were issued
as shares of the Class 1 and Class 2 ESOP Preferred Stock were allocated
to employees. In the aggregate, 17,675,345 shares of Voting Preferred Stock
were issued through the year 2000. The Voting Preferred Stock outstanding
at any time commands voting power for approximately 55% of the vote of
all classes of capital stock in all matters requiring a stockholder vote,
other than for the election of members of the Board of Directors. The Voting
Preferred Stock has a par value and liquidation preference of $0.01 per
share. The stock is not entitled to receive any dividends and is convertible
into .0004 shares of UAL common stock.

Class Pilot MEC, IAM, SAM
and I junior preferred stock (collectively "Director Preferred Stocks")
were established to effectuate the election of one or more members to UAL's
Board of Directors. One share each of Class Pilot MEC and Class IAM junior
preferred stock is authorized and issued. The Company is authorized to
issue ten shares each of Class SAM and Class I junior preferred stock.
There were three shares of Class SAM and four shares of Class I issued
at December 31, 2002. Each of the Director Preferred Stocks has a par value
and liquidation preference of $0.01 per share. The stock is not entitled
to receive any dividends and Class I was redeemed automatically upon "Sunset,"
which occurred March 7, 2003, as discussed below.

In September 2002,
State Street Bank and Trust ("State Street") was appointed as an independent
fiduciary for the ESOP. On September 27, 2002, State Street filed a Form
144 "Notice of Proposed Sale of Securities" ("Form 144") with the SEC to
indicate it may sell up to 10,964,700 shares of UAL common stock over the
next three months. On October 25, 2002, November 22, 2002 and December
9, 2002, State Street amended its Form 144 to sell an additional 4,040,758,
10,283,398 and 28,291,896, respectively. The shares of common stock are
issuable upon the conversion of shares of Class 1 and Class 2 ESOP Preferred
Stock held by the plan and are issued on a private placement basis to State
Street. As of December 31, 2002, State Street had converted 6.0 million
shares of ESOP Preferred Stock to an equivalent 24.0 million common shares
and sold them on the open market, pursuant to the Form 144 as amended.

On December 9, 2002,
the Company filed a motion with the Bankruptcy Court to prevent the sale
of UAL common stock by substantial holders of equity or claims in order
to protect its NOLs. (See Note 7, "Income Taxes.") The Bankruptcy Court
issued a temporary injunction but permitted the Company to allow State
Street to sell a certain number of shares. In January 2003, State Street
was allowed to convert an additional 3.2 million shares of ESOP Preferred
Stock to an equivalent 12.8 million common shares and sell them on the
open market. On March 4, 2003, the Company announced it had received a
private letter ruling from the IRS which would allow the Company to permit
State Street to sell an additional 3.9 million shares of UAL common stock
without jeopardizing its NOLs. State Street then converted 0.9 million
shares of ESOP Preferred Stock to an equivalent 3.9 million common shares
and sold them on the open market.

Also in September 2002,
the United Air Lines, Inc. Pension and Welfare Plans Administrative Committee
appointed AON Fiduciary Counselors, Inc. ("AON") as an independent fiduciary
for the UAL Stock Funds offered in the Company's 401(k) plans. On September
27, 2002, AON filed a Form 144 with the SEC to indicate it may sell up
to 10,577,325 shares of UAL common stock in the 401(k) plans. Simultaneous
with the filing of the Form 144, AON directed Fidelity Investments ("Fidelity")
and Frank Russell Trust Company ("Frank Russell") to cease the purchase
of UAL common stock and to raise the amount of cash held in the UAL Stock
Fund to 20% by selling UAL common stock. As of December 31, 2002, Fidelity
and Frank Russell had sold all of the UAL common stock previously held
by the plans.

Employee voting under
the ESOP is determined by Voting Preferred Stock and not by Class 1 and
Class 2 ESOP Preferred Stock. The Voting Preferred Stock will generally
continue to represent approximately 55% of the aggregate voting power until
"Sunset," even though the common stock issuable upon conversion of the
ESOP stock may represent more or less than 55% of the fully diluted common
stock of UAL. Sunset will occur when the common shares issuable upon conversion
of Class 1 and Class 2 ESOP Preferred Stock, plus any common shares held
by any other Company sponsored employee benefit plan, plus any available
unissued ESOP shares held in the ESOPs, equal, in the aggregate, less than
20% of the common equity (generally common stock issued or issuable at
the time of the recapitalization), and available unissued ESOP shares of
UAL. For purposes of measuring the Sunset, employee ownership was approximately
33% at December 31, 2002. As a result of the additional sales of UAL common
stock discussed above, employee ownership was reduced to less than 20%
on March 7, 2003, thus triggering the Sunset.

(17) Common Stockholders' Equity

Changes in the number of
shares of UAL common stock outstanding during the years ended December
31 were as follows

:

During 2000, the Company
repurchased 1,258,263 shares of common stock on the open market at a total
purchase price of $81 million.

(18) Stock Options and Awards

The Company has granted options
to purchase common stock to various officers and employees. The option
price for all stock options is at least 100% of the fair market value of
UAL common stock at the date of grant. Options generally vest and become
exercisable in four equal, annual installments beginning one year after
the date of grant, and generally expire in ten years.

The Company has also awarded
shares of restricted stock to officers and key employees. These shares
generally vest over a five-year period and are subject to certain transfer
restrictions and forfeiture under certain circumstances prior to vesting.
Unearned compensation, representing the fair market value of the stock
at the measurement date for the award, is amortized to salaries and related
costs over the vesting period. During 2002 and 2000, respectively, 175,000
and 23,000 shares of restricted stock were issued from treasury. No shares
were issued in 2001. The amortization of restricted stock resulted in $1
million in compensation expense being recorded in 2002 and $2 million in
each of the years 2001 and 2000. As of December 31, 2002, 263,800 shares
were restricted and unvested.

SFAS No. 123 establishes
a fair value based method of accounting for stock options. As discussed
in Note 2(m), "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Stock Option
Accounting," the Company has elected to continue using the intrinsic value
method of accounting prescribed in Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," as permitted by SFAS
No. 123, as amended by SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation-Transition
and Disclosure."

The weighted-average grant
date fair value of restricted shares issued was $3.03 for shares issued
in 2002 and $51.83 for shares issued in 2000. The fair value of each option
grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing
model with the following assumptions:

The Black-Scholes option
valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded
options which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable.
In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective
assumptions including expected stock price volatility. Because the Company's
stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of
traded options and because changes in the subjective input assumptions
can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management's opinion,
the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure
of the fair value of its stock options.

Stock option activity for
the past three years was as follows:

The following information
relates to stock options outstanding as of December 31, 2002:

(19)  Employee Stock Ownership Plans

On July 12, 1994, the stockholders
of UAL approved a plan of recapitalization to provide an approximately
55% equity interest in UAL to certain employees of United in exchange for
wage concessions and work-rule changes. The employees' equity interest
was allocated to individual employees through the year 2000 under ESOPs
which were created as a part of the recapitalization.

The ESOPs cover employees
represented by ALPA, the IAM and U.S. management and salaried employees
and include a "Leveraged ESOP," a "Non-Leveraged ESOP" and a "Supplemental
ESOP." Both the Leveraged ESOP and the Non-Leveraged ESOP are tax-qualified
plans while the Supplemental ESOP is not a tax-qualified plan.

The equity interests were
delivered to employees through two classes of preferred stock (Class 1
and Class 2 ESOP Preferred Stock, collectively "ESOP Preferred Stock"),
and the voting interests were delivered through three separate classes
of preferred stocks (Class P, M and S Voting Preferred Stock, collectively,
"Voting Preferred Stock"). The Class 1 ESOP Preferred Stock was delivered
to an ESOP trust in seven separate sales under the Leveraged ESOP, the
last of which occurred on January 5, 2000. Based on Internal Revenue Code
Limitations, shares of the Class 2 ESOP Preferred Stock were either contributed
to the Non-Leveraged ESOP or allocated as "book entry" shares to the Supplemental
ESOP annually through the year 2000. The classes of preferred stock are
described more fully in Note 16, "ESOP Preferred Stock."

Shares of ESOP Preferred
Stock were legally released or allocated to employee accounts as of year-end.
The final allocation of shares occurred in March 2001 effective December
31, 2000. During 2002, 88,981 shares of Class 2 ESOP Preferred Stock previously
allocated in book entry form were issued and either contributed to the
qualified plan or converted and sold on behalf of terminating employees.
In addition, during 2002, State Street began converting shares as discussed
in Note 16, "ESOP Preferred Stock."

For the Class 2 ESOP Preferred
Stock committed to be contributed to employees under the Supplemental ESOP,
employees can elect to receive their "book entry" shares in cash upon termination
of employment. At December 31, 2002, there were 360,831 book entry shares
outstanding under the Supplemental ESOP. The estimated fair value of such
shares at December 31, 2002 and 2001 is reflected in the

Statements
of Consolidated Financial Position

.

(20) Retirement and Postretirement Plans

The Company has various retirement
plans, both defined benefit and defined contribution, which cover substantially
all employees. The Company also provides certain health care benefits,
primarily in the U.S., to retirees and eligible dependents, as well as
certain life insurance benefits to retirees. The Company has reserved the
right, subject to collective bargaining agreements, to modify or terminate
the health care and life insurance benefits for both current and future
retirees. The amounts disclosed below do not reflect the impact of any
changes to the benefit plans that might be contemplated as a result of
the bankruptcy filing or negotiations with unions under the collective
bargaining agreements.

The following table sets
forth the reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the benefit
obligation and plan assets, the funded status and the amounts recognized
in the

Statements of Consolidated Financial Position

for the defined
benefit and other postretirement plans as of December 31:

The assumed health care cost
trend rate for gross claims paid was 10.0% for 2003 decreasing to an ultimate
rate of 4.5% in 2009 and 8% for 2002 decreasing to an ultimate rate of
4.5% in 2006.

The net periodic benefit
cost included the following components:

Total pension expense for
all retirement plans (including defined contribution plans) was $683 million
in 2002, $629 million in 2001 and $302 million in 2000.

The projected benefit obligation,
accumulated benefit obligation, and fair value of plan assets for the plans
with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were $12.7
billion, $11.0 billion and $6.3 billion, respectively, as of December 31,
2002 and $10.1 billion, $8.9 billion and $7.6 billion, respectively, as
of December 31, 2001.

Assumed health care cost
trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health
care plan. A one-percentage-point change in assumed health care trend rate
would have the following effects:

(In millions)

1% Increase

1% Decrease

Effect on total service and interest
cost

$ 50

$ (40)

Effect on postretirement benefit
obligation

$ 672

$ (539)

Changes in interest rates
or rates of inflation may impact the assumptions used in the valuation
of pension obligations and postretirement obligations including discount
rates, rates of return on plan assets and rates of increase in compensation,
resulting in increases or decreases in United's pension and postretirement
liabilities and pension and postretirement costs.

The pension obligation
and future pension expense both increase as the discount rate is reduced.
Lowering the discount rate by 0.5% (from 6.75% to 6.25%) would increase
the Company's pension obligation at December 31, 2002 by approximately
$820 million and increase the estimated 2003 pension expense by approximately
$85 million.

Pension expense increases
as the expected rate of return on plan assets decreases. Lowering the expected
long-term rate of return on plan assets by 0.5% (from 9.0% to 8.5%) would
increase the estimated 2003 pension expense by approximately $40 million.

(21) Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Uncertainties

General Guarantees
and Indemnifications.

In the normal course of business, the Company
enters into numerous real estate leasing and aircraft financing arrangements
that have various guarantees included in the contracts. These guarantees
are primarily in the form of indemnities. In both leasing and financing
transactions, the Company typically indemnifies the lessors, and any tax/financing
parties against tort liabilities that arise out of the use, occupancy,
operation or maintenance of the leased premises or financed aircraft. The
Company currently believes that any future payments required under these
guarantees or indemnities would be immaterial, as most tort liabilities
and related indemnities are covered by insurance (subject to deductibles).
Additionally, certain leased premises such as fueling stations or storage
facilities include indemnities of such parties for any environmental liability
that may arise out of or relate to the use of the leased premise.

Financings and
Guarantees.

In addition to common commercial lease transactions,
United also enters into numerous long-term agreements to lease certain
airport and maintenance facilities which are financed through tax-exempt
special facilities revenue bonds and issued by various local municipalities
to build or improve airport and maintenance facilities. Under these lease
agreements, United is required to make rental payments in amounts sufficient
to pay the maturing principal and interest payments on the bonds. At December
31, 2002, $1.2 billion principal amount of such bonds was outstanding.
As of December 31, 2002, UAL and United had jointly guaranteed $35 million
of such bonds and United had guaranteed $1.2 billion of such bonds, including
accrued interest. The payments required to satisfy these obligations are
included in the future minimum lease payments disclosed in Note 13, "Lease
Obligations."

Third Party Guarantees.

In
conjunction with efforts to enhance the Star Alliance, in 1999 United agreed
to guarantee a portion of third-party debt. The guarantee is set to expire
in 2009 when the loan is due in full. United's maximum exposure to the
guaranteed loan is approximately $106 million and will only trigger if
the loan is in default. No liability was recorded by United at the time
of the guarantee. United earns commitment fees on the maximum guaranteed
amount of the loan. In addition, United may also earn drawdown fees on
the outstanding loan balance based on a calculated formula, requiring the
borrower to pay the incremental difference between United's credit rating
and the borrower's. Upon drawdown on the guaranteed loan, United can seek
reimbursement of the paid amount from the borrower plus interest at the
Federal funds rate plus 2%. United has subordinate security interests on
the aircraft purchased with the loan proceeds.

Fuel Consortiums.

United
also participates in numerous fuel consortiums with other carriers at major
airports to reduce the costs of fuel distribution and storage. Interline
agreements govern the rights and responsibilities of the consortium members
and provide for the allocation of the overall costs to operate the consortium
based on usage. The consortiums (and in limited cases, the participating
carriers) have entered into long-term agreements to lease certain airport
fuel storage and distribution facilities that are typically financed through
tax-exempt bonds (either special facilities lease revenue bonds or general
airport revenue bonds), issued by various local municipalities. In general,
the consortium lease agreement requires the consortium to make lease payments
in amounts sufficient to pay the maturing principal and interest payments
on the bonds. As of December 31, 2002, approximately $450 million principal
amount of such bonds are direct indebtedness of fuel consortiums at major
hubs in which United participates. United's maximum exposure is approximately
$210 million principal amount of such bonds based on United's past consortium
participation and will only trigger if the other participating carriers
or consortiums members default on their lease payments. The guarantees
are set to expire when the tax-exempt bonds are paid in full, which ranges
from 2010 to 2028. No liability was recorded by United at the time the
indirect guarantees were made.

In January 2003, the
FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities" ("FIN 46") which requires the consolidation of variable interest
entities ("VIEs"), as defined. The Company is still evaluating whether
special facilities revenue bonds and fuel consortiums should be considered
VIEs under FIN 46.

EETC Debt.

In 1997 and 2000, United issued EETCs to refinance certain owned aircraft
and aircraft under operating leases. A portion of these proceeds are direct
obligations of United and were recognized in the

Statements of Consolidated
Financial Position

while certain proceeds were place in trusts not
owned or affiliated with United. The proceeds placed in off-balance sheet
trusts were used to refinance the remaining bank debt of the lessors in
existing leveraged leases with United. As of December 31, 2002, approximately
$300 million of these proceeds were placed in off-balance sheet trusts.
For one of the trusts, United is the swap provider and pays fixed interest
and receives variable interest which converts the trust's variable rate
assets to fixed rate assets and converts United's variable rate lease payments
to fixed rate lease payments.

The Company is still
evaluating whether or not the EETC trusts are considered VIEs under FIN
46.

Legal and Environmental
Contingencies.

The Company has certain contingencies resulting
from litigation and claims (including environmental issues) incident to
the ordinary course of business. Management believes, after considering
a number of factors, including (but not limited to) the views of legal
counsel, the nature of contingencies to which the Company is subject and
its prior experience, that the ultimate disposition of these contingencies
is not expected to materially affect UAL's consolidated financial position
or results of operations.

UAL records liabilities
for legal and environmental claims against it in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. These amounts are recorded based on the
Company's assessments of the likelihood of their eventual settlements.
The amounts of these liabilities could increase or decrease in the near
term, based on revisions to estimates relating to the various claims. In
addition, as a result of the bankruptcy filing, as of the Petition Date,
virtually all pending litigation is stayed, and absent further order of
the Bankruptcy Court, no party, subject to certain exceptions, may take
any action, again subject to certain exceptions, to recover on pre-petition
claims against the Debtors. Accordingly, the Company has classified certain
of these liabilities as liabilities subject to compromise.

Commitments.

At
December 31, 2002, commitments for the purchase of property and equipment,
principally aircraft, approximated $1.6 billion, after deducting advance
payments. An estimated $0.1 billion will be spent in 2003, $0.3 billion
in 2004, $0.4 billion in 2005, $0.4 billion in 2006 and $0.4 billion in
2007 and thereafter. The major commitments are for the purchase of A319,
A320 and B777 aircraft, which are currently scheduled to be delivered through
2007.

In connection with the construction
of the Indianapolis Maintenance Center, United agreed to spend an aggregate
$800 million on capital investments by the year 2001 and employ at least
7,500 individuals by the year 2004. In the event such targets are not reached,
United may be required to make certain payments to the city of Indianapolis
and state of Indiana. As a result of the events of September 11 and the
subsequent reduction in the Company's operations, headcount and capital
spending, United repaid $34 million to the state and local governments
in June of 2002 and has accrued for the additional estimated liability
for 2004.

Approximately 80% of United's
employees are represented by various labor organizations. The contracts
with ALPA and the IAM become amendable in 2004 and with the AFA in 2006.
The Company is in the process of negotiating with its labor unions to amend
the existing contracts in light of the bankruptcy filing and United's need
to cut costs. As described in Note 1, "Proceedings Under Chapter 11 of
the Bankruptcy Code," Section 1113(c) of the Bankruptcy Code permits the
Company to move to reject its labor contracts. On March 17, 2003, United
filed a motion with the Bankruptcy Court to reject its labor contracts
pursuant to Section 1113(c) and the Company expects to obtain a ruling
on the motion by early May.

(22) Financial Instruments and Risk Management

Derivative Financial
Instruments

-

Effective January 1, 2001, UAL adopted SFAS No. 133,
"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("SFAS No.
133"), as amended. The adoption of SFAS No. 133 resulted in a cumulative
charge of $8 million, net of tax, to 2001 earnings. This primarily related
to the changes in fair values of certain equity warrants that were not
designated as qualifying hedging instruments.

Hedges of Future Cash Flows

Foreign Currency

- -

United enters into forwards and currency swaps to reduce exposure
to currency fluctuations on Japanese yen- and euro-denominated capital
lease obligations. The cash flows of the forwards and swaps mirror those
of the capital leases. These forwards and swaps have been designated as
cash flow hedges of the foreign currency denominated lease payments. For
these forwards and swaps, United excludes changes in fair value resulting
from changes in the forward points in its assessment of effectiveness.
Any gains or losses realized upon early termination of these forwards and
swaps are recorded (net of tax) as a component of other comprehensive income
and recognized in income as the hedged transaction impacts earnings. As
a result of the bankruptcy filing, all swaps and forwards were terminated
by the respective counterparties while out of the money. The outstanding
liabilities for these swaps and forwards are recorded as liabilities subject
to compromise.

The Company hedges some of
the risks of exchange rate volatility on its anticipated future Japanese
yen, euro, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar and British pound revenues
by purchasing put options and on Hong Kong dollar revenues by entering
into forward contracts. These options and forwards have a duration of less
than one year and the amounts are synchronized with the expected cash receipts.
Accordingly, the put options and forwards have been designated as cash
flow hedges of the anticipated cash receipts. Changes in the fair value
of purchased put option contracts, to the extent they are effective, are
recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (net of tax) and
then recognized as a component of passenger revenue when the underlying
hedged revenue is recorded. United excludes, in its assessment of effectiveness,
changes in the fair value of these instruments that are a result of changes
in their time value. As of December 31, 2002, the Company has no outstanding
currency hedges.

Aircraft Fuel

-
From time to time, United uses crude oil and heating oil forwards and options
to hedge a portion of its price risk related to aircraft fuel purchases.
These contracts have maturity dates of less than two years and have been
designated as cash flow hedges of anticipated jet fuel purchases. These
contracts are recorded at fair value with the changes in fair value, to
the extent they are effective, recorded in other comprehensive income (net
of tax), until the underlying hedged fuel is consumed. The Company determines
the ineffective portion of the fuel forwards and options as the change
in the fair value of the hedge contracts compared to the change in expected
cash outflows for the hedged jet fuel. United excludes, in its assessment
of effectiveness, changes in the fair value of these instruments that are
a result of changes in their time value. As a result of the bankruptcy
filing, all fuel hedges were terminated by the respective counterparties.
The gain that resulted from the early termination of the hedges is recorded
as a component of other comprehensive income and will be reclassified into
earnings in the period of the original maturity of the hedges.

Interest Rate -

United
is a party to a series of interest rate swaps that convert floating-rate
operating leases to fixed-rate leases. United has designated these swaps
as cash flow hedges of the floating-rate leases and has recorded these
contracts at fair value with the effective portion recorded as a component
of other comprehensive income (net of tax). As of December 31, 2002, United
had $130 million notional amount of interest rate swaps outstanding with
a fair value to United of $(27) million.

The ineffectiveness resulting
from the changes in fair value of aircraft fuel and interest rate hedge
positions was immaterial. There was no ineffectiveness resulting from the
changes in fair value of foreign currency hedge positions reported in earnings.
Amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness amounted to approximately
$1 million before income taxes and were recorded in "Miscellaneous, net."

The following is a reconciliation
of current period changes of the portion of stockholders' equity relating
to derivatives that qualify as cash flow hedges:

Of this amount, $5 million
in losses is expected to be recorded into earnings within the next twelve
months. At December 31, 2002, the term of derivative instruments hedging
variability in cash flows, except those related to payment of variable
interest on existing financial instruments, was sixteen years.

Other Derivative Instruments Not Designated as Hedges

Foreign Currency -

From
time to time, United enters into Japanese yen forward exchange contracts
to minimize gains and losses on the revaluation of short-term yen-denominated
liabilities. The yen forwards, typically having short-term maturities,
are not designated hedges under SFAS No. 133 and are marked to fair value
through the income statement at the end of each accounting period. The
unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses generally offset the losses
and gains recorded on the yen liabilities.

To reduce hedging costs,
the Company sells a correlation option denominated in Japanese yen, euros,
Canadian dollars, Australian dollars and British pounds. These correlation
options are not designated as a hedge and the changes in the fair market
value of the correlation options are included in "Miscellaneous, net."

(23) Segment Information

In the first quarter
of 2002, the Company made changes to its corporate structure which resulted
in substantially all of UAL's customer loyalty and on-line travel marketing
programs (which were previously the responsibility of United) becoming
owned and operated by ULS. ULS had been United's agent to market and sell
Mileage Plus miles to non-airline business partners beginning in October
of 2000. In the first quarter of 2002, ULS assumed direct responsibility
for these relationships rather than as an agent of United. The above changes
were designed to increase the overall value of UAL's loyalty businesses
by focusing management attention on these activities and enhancing the
range of products and services offered to Mileage Plus members and business
partners. United remains responsible for all Mileage Plus airline partnerships
and the setting of airline mileage accruals and award levels and airline-related
loyalty recognition levels. As both United and ULS remain wholly owned
subsidiaries of UAL, there is no impact to UAL's consolidated results of
operations or statements of financial position for these transactions.

As a result of the
transactions described in the previous paragraph, the Company has adjusted
its segment reporting structure. UAL now has five reportable segments which
reflect the current management of the business: North America, the Pacific,
the Atlantic and Latin America which are part of United, and ULS. Prior
year information has been restated to reflect the change to UAL's reportable
segments; however, the 2001 and 2000 information does not reflect the change
in arrangements between United and ULS which occurred in the first quarter
of 2002.

In accordance with
DOT guidelines, the Company allocates passenger and cargo revenues for
the North America segment based on the actual flown revenue for flights
with an origin and destination in the U.S. Passenger and cargo revenue
for international segments is based on the actual flown revenue for flights
with an origin or destination in that segment. Other revenues that are
not directly associated with a flight (such as Red Carpet Club membership
fees) are allocated based on available seat miles flown in that segment.

The accounting policies
for each of these segments are the same as those described in Note 2, "Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies," except that segment financial information
has been prepared using a management approach which is consistent with
how the Company's management internally disperses financial information
for the purpose of making internal operating decisions. UAL evaluates performance
based on earnings before income taxes, special charges and gains on sales.
A reconciliation of the total amounts reported by reportable segments to
the applicable amounts in the consolidated financial statements follows:

UAL's operations involve
an insignificant level of dedicated revenue producing assets by reportable
segment. The overwhelming majority of United's revenue producing assets
can be deployed in any of the four reportable segments, as any given aircraft
may be used in multiple segments on any given day. Therefore, United allocates
depreciation and amortization expense associated with those assets on the
basis of available seat miles flown in each segment. In addition, UAL has
significant intangible assets related to the acquisition of its Atlantic
and Latin America route authorities. ULS has $379 million in total assets
as of December 31, 2002.

(24) Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows - Supplemental Disclosures

Supplemental disclosures
of cash flow information and non-cash investing and financing activities
were as follows:

(25) Selected Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited)

The sum of quarterly earnings
(loss) per share amounts is not the same as annual earnings (loss) per
share amounts because of changing numbers of shares outstanding.

During the first quarter
of 2002, UAL recorded a special charge of $82 million in connection with
the closing of its wholly owned subsidiary Avolar. Also during the first
quarter of 2002, UAL sold its remaining investment in Cendant Corporation
and recognized a gain of $46 million in non-operating income.

During the second and third
quarters of 2002, United recognized $80 million and $50 million, respectively,
in compensation under the Act as non-operating income.

In the third quarter of 2002,
UAL recorded $418 million in non-cash tax expense to establish a valuation
allowance against its deferred tax asset. Additionally, in the fourth quarter
of 2002, UAL recorded $326 million in additional non-cash tax expense to
achieve a 0% effective tax rate for the full year.

In the fourth quarter of
2002, UAL recorded a special charge of $67 million for severance related
to furloughs announced for various employee groups. In addition, UAL recorded
$10 million in reorganization items related to its bankruptcy filing in
non-operating expense.

During the second quarter
of 2001, UAL recorded a special charge of $116 million for costs associated
with a terminated merger with US Airways Group, Inc.

During the third quarter
of 2001, UAL recorded a special charge of $1.3 billion in operating expense
and $49 million in non-operating expense for amounts relating to the September
11 terrorist attacks. Additionally, in the third and fourth quarters of
2001, UAL recognized $391 million and $261 million, respectively, in compensation
under the Act as non-operating income.

During the fourth quarter
of 2001, United recognized a gain of $261 million on the sale of its investments
in Galileo and Cendant.

Each of the above items is
described more fully in Note 3, "Special Charges."

ITEM 11.  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION.

Director Compensation

UAL does not pay its directors
who are also employees of UAL additional compensation for their services
as directors.  In 2002, compensation for non-employee directors included
the following:

--

annual
retainer of $18,000;

--

$900 for
each board and board committee meeting attended;

--

annual retainer
of $2,700 to committee chairmen (other than chair of Compensation Administration
Committee); the chairs of the CAP and Transaction Committees were only
paid for the quarters in which the Committees were active;

--

expenses
of attending board and committee meetings;

--

400 shares
of common stock; and

--

189 deferred
stock units representing common stock.

Under the Company's stock
ownership guidelines, it is recommended that UAL directors keep the 400
shares they receive each year while they serve are on the Board. 
They may also elect to receive some or all of their cash retainers and
fees in UAL common stock, as well as to defer their stock and cash compensation
for tax purposes.  The deferred stock units are unfunded and are settled
in shares of UAL common stock after the director leaves the Board.

UAL considers it important
for its directors to understand UAL's business and have exposure to UAL's
operations and employees.  For this reason, UAL provides free transportation
and free cargo shipment on United to its directors and their spouses and
eligible dependent children.  UAL reimburses its directors for federal
and state income taxes resulting from actual use of the travel and shipment
privileges.  A director who retires from the Board with at least five
years of UAL creditable service will receive free travel, subject to certain
exceptions.

The cost of this policy in
2002 for each director, including cash payments made in January and October
2002 for income tax liability, was as follows:

(1)  Messrs. Creighton, Dutta and Peterpaul each
ceased to be a director of UAL in 2002.

Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation

Mr. Tilton and Captain Whiteford
serve on the Compensation Committee, but not the Compensation Administration
Committee.  Mr. Tilton, Captain Whiteford and Mr. Canale are employees
of United. Captain Whiteford is also the Chairman of the ALPA-MEC and an
officer of ALPA. ALPA and UAL are parties to a collective bargaining agreement
for its pilots represented by ALPA.  Mr. Canale is President and Directing
General Chairman of the IAM District Lodge 141.  UAL and the IAM are
parties to a collective bargaining agreement for its ramp and stores, public
contact employees, food service, security officers and Mileage Plus employees
represented by the IAM.

Executive Compensation

Summary Compensation Table

________________________________________________________________________________________

(1)    The amounts represented under
"Other Annual Compensation" include payments to the named executive officers
to cover their tax liabilities incurred in connection with the free transportation
and cargo shipment on United that it provides to the officers.  With
respect to Mr. Tilton, the other annual compensation amount for 2002 includes
$43,643 for temporary living expenses and a payment to cover the tax liabilities
incurred in connection with the payment for the temporary living expenses. 
With respect to Mr. Creighton, the other annual compensation does not include
amounts related to temporary living expenses and temporary office space,
which are described below under "Employment Contracts and Arrangements--Mr.
Creighton's Retirement Arrangements."

(2)    The number and value of restricted
stock holdings at December 31, 2002 for each of Messrs. Brace, Dutta, Hacker,
McDonald and Studdert is 25,000 shares and $35,750, respectively. These

number and value of restricted stock holdings at December 31, 2002 is 100,000
shares and $143,000.  This grant vests in four annual installments
beginning on September 2, 2003. With respect to Messrs. Dutta and Studdert,
their restricted shares were forfeited in connection with their recent
termination as executive officers. Dividends are paid on these restricted
shares/units to the extent paid on our common stock.  Ms. Maher elected
to receive a portion of her 2000 incentive award in deferred stock units
under our incentive program.  As a result of this election, she was
credited with a restricted stock unit award in 2001.  These units
are subject to forfeiture if withdrawn prior to January 1, 2006.

(3)    Represents a payment under the UAL
Loyalty Services ("ULS") long-term incentive plan equal to Mr. Hacker's
vested interest in net value created of ULS' asset portfolio upon a liquidating
event involving a sale of a portfolio asset as described in the Executive
Compensation report.

(4)    For Mr. Tilton, amount represents
$4.5 million paid by the Company into three secular trusts on Mr. Tilton's
behalf.  The secular trusts are described in more detail under "Employment
Contracts and Arrangements - Mr. Tilton's Employment Agreement."

(5)    For Mr. Dutta, amount in 2002 includes
$46,041 in split dollar life insurance premiums, $1.6 million as severance
(based on two times his annual salary less $2,000 a month for the term

a payment of $2,000 per month from September 2002 through September 2004
in connection with his resignation from the Company (as described in more
detail under "Employment Contracts and Arrangements - Mr. Dutta's Agreement")
and $91,955 in accrued but unused vacation.

(6)    For Mr. Hacker, amount in 2002 includes

Option Grants in 2002

The table below provides
information about stock options that UAL granted during 2002 to the officers
named in the Summary Compensation Table.  The hypothetical present
values of stock options granted in 2002 are calculated under a modified
Black-Scholes model, a mathematical formula used to value options. 
The actual amount realized upon exercise of stock options will depend upon
the amount by which the market price of common stock on the date of exercise
is greater than the exercise price.  The officers will not be able
to realize a gain from the stock options granted unless, during the exercise
period, the market price of common stock exceeds the exercise price of
the options.

_________________________________________________________________________________

(1)    All options become exercisable
in four equal annual installments commencing February 27, 2003, one year
from the date of grant, except Mr. Tilton's which becomes exercisable in
four equal annual installments commencing on September 2, 2003,  Mr.
Brace's option for 75,000, which becomes exercisable in four equal annual
installments commencing on August 28, 2003, and Mr. McDonald's option for
75,000, which becomes exercisable in four equal annual installments commencing
on October 24, 2003.  The options are transferable, at each officer's
election, to certain family members.

(2)    Messrs. Dutta and Studdert's options
were cancelled on September 13, 2002 in connection with their departure
from UAL.

(3)    To realize hypothetical present
values upon the exercise of the options, the market price would have to
increase to $18.62 for the February 26, 2002 grant; $4.30 for the September
2, 2002 grant; $4.94 for the August 28, 2002 grant; and $3.45 for the October
24, 2002 grant.  The modified Black-Scholes model used to calculate
the hypothetical values at date of grant considers a number of factors
to estimate the option's present value, including the stock's historic
volatility calculated using the monthly closing price of common stock over
a 91 month period ending February 2002, the estimated average holding period
of the option, interest rates and the stock's expected dividend yield. 
The assumptions used in the valuation of the options were: stock price
volatility of .46, holding period of 4 years, interest rate of 4.8%, and
dividend yield of 0%.

There is no
assurance that the hypothetical present values of stock options presented
in the table above represent the actual values of the options, and the
hypothetical values shown should not be viewed as UAL's predictions of
the future value of common stock.

Aggregated 2002 FY-End Option Values (1)

The table below provides
information about stock options held at the end of 2002 by the officers
named in the Summary Compensation Table.  The value of those options
at year-end is based on the difference between the fair market value of
the underlying securities on that date and the option exercise price. 
No options were exercised by these officers in 2002.

______________________

(1)    Options granted prior to July
12, 1994 to Mr. Hacker are exercisable for two shares of common stock and
$84.81.

(2)    All options cancelled on September
13, 2002.

Pension Plan Table

This table is based on retirement
at age 65 and selection of a straight life annuity (other annuity options
are available, which would reduce the amounts shown).  The amount
of the normal retirement benefit under the plan is the product of 1.63%
times years of credited participation in the plan times final average pay
(highest five of last ten years of covered compensation).  The retirement
benefit amount is not offset by the participant's social security benefit.

Compensation used in calculating benefits under the plan includes base
salary and amounts shown as bonus in the Summary Compensation Table. 
Under the qualified plan, years of participation for persons named in the
compensation table are as follows: Mr. Studdert - 7 years; Ms. Maher -
9 years; Mr. Hacker - 9 years; Mr. Brace - 14 years; Mr. Dutta - 17 years;
Mr. McDonald - 31 years.  Mr. Tilton, who joined UAL in September
of 2002, is not eligible to participate in the Company's qualified plan
until October 1, 2003.  The amounts shown do not reflect limitations
imposed by the Internal Revenue Code on retirement benefits that may be
paid under plans qualified under the code.  United has agreed to provide
under non-qualified plans the portion of the retirement benefits earned
under the pension plan that would otherwise be subject to code limitations.

In light of the Company's
recent Chapter 11 filing, UAL is currently considering the adoption of
one pension plan for all of the Company's officers and employees.

If Mr. Hacker is employed
until age 50, he will be credited with additional years of participation
so that his total years of participation will equal 25.4 years.  In
addition, if he is employed during the period between the date he attains
age 50 and the date he attains age 55, he will be credited with an additional
month of participation for each month of participation credited to him
during that period.  If he remains employed past age 55, he will be
credited an additional 1/2 month of participation for each month of participation
credited to him after age 55.

Mr. Dutta and Mr. Studdert
continued to receive participation credit through February 15, 2003.

In connection with the hiring
of Mr. Tilton, UAL agreed to provide a pension make-whole payment, which
is described below.

Employment Contracts and Arrangements

Mr. Tilton's Employment Agreement

Mr. Tilton was elected Chairman,
President and Chief Executive Officer of UAL effective September 2, 2002. 
The Company entered into a five-year employment agreement with Mr. Tilton
effective September 5, 2002, which agreement was amended on December 8,
2002 and again on February 17, 2003 in connection with the Company's bankruptcy
filing.  The amended agreement provides for an annual base salary
of $845,500 (which reflects an 11% reduction from the original amount),
and is subject to increases as part of the normal salary program for the
Company's senior executives.  The agreement provides Mr. Tilton a
$3 million signing bonus, which Mr. Tilton will be required to repay if
he voluntarily resigns other than for good reason or UAL terminates him
for cause on or before the earlier of June 1, 2004 or the date a plan of
reorganization is approved by the Bankruptcy Court.

Under the terms of the agreement,
Mr. Tilton also received options to purchase 1,150,000 shares of UAL common
stock.  The exercise price for the options is $3.03, which was the
average of the high and low sales price of the common stock on the New
York Stock Exchange on August 30 and September 3, 2002.  The options
expire on September 1, 2012.  The Company also agreed to reimburse
Mr. Tilton for his and his family's relocation expenses, including a cash
payment to cover his income tax liability for the relocation reimbursement. 
Under his employment agreement, Mr. Tilton is eligible to receive an annual
incentive bonus with a target percentage equal to 100% of his base salary. 
He is entitled to an additional 100% over this target bonus amount for
superior performance.

If Mr. Tilton's employment
is terminated by UAL without "cause," or by him for "good reason," or if
there is a "change in control," UAL will pay him his base salary as reduced
by the December 8

th

amendment, any annual bonus and any earned
and vested benefits he may be entitled to through the termination date. 
UAL will also pay Mr. Tilton a lump sum payment equal to his base salary
reduced by the December 8

th

amendment and target bonus multiplied
by the greater of (1) the remaining term of his agreement or (2) three
years.  Mr. Tilton's other benefits will be continued for this period. 
All long-term incentive awards will immediately vest on the termination
date, including any unvested stock options or restricted stock awards. 
Under Mr. Tilton's agreement, a "change of control" is defined as: (1)
a merger, consolidation or sale of substantially all the Company's assets
in which the voting securities of the Company immediately before the merger,
consolidation or sale represent less than 80% of the voting power after
the merger, consolidation or sale; (2) the acquisition by a person or group
of 25% or more of the voting securities of the Company; (3) the UAL shareholders
approve any plan or proposal for the liquidation of the Company; (4) a
change in the majority of the Board over a 24-month period (unless the
new directors were approved by a two-thirds majority of prior directors);
or (5) any other event or transaction that the Board of Directors determines
is a change of control.

A "change of control" will
generally not arise as a result of events occurring prior to or on account
of a plan of reorganization of the Company under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy
Code, unless (1) there is a merger with another commercial airline and
the holders of the claims and/or interests in the Company before the merger
have less than 80% of the combined voting power after the merger; or (2)
creditors of the Company with an intent to control the management and policies
of the Company on an on-going basis acquire at least 25% of the voting
securities of the Company; or (3) a sale of the assets of the Company to
another commercial airline, unless the creditors and/or interest holders
in the Company receive, directly or indirectly, at least 80% of the combined
voting power of the acquirer.

In consideration of projected
retirement benefits foregone by Mr. Tilton as a result of his resignation
from his prior employer and acceptance of UAL's employment offer, $4.5
million was paid into three secular trusts on Mr. Tilton's behalf subject
to ratable vesting over three years.  The non-vested portion is to
be forfeited and returned to UAL if Mr. Tilton voluntarily terminates employment
for other than good reason or is terminated for cause.

On February 21, 2003, the
Bankruptcy Court approved UAL's motion to assume Mr. Tilton's amended employment
agreement.

Mr. Creighton's Retirement Arrangements

In connection with Mr. Creighton's
retirement in 2002, UAL agreed that he would remain as an on-call employee
of United through year-end 2002.  Although Mr. Creighton did not receive
a salary and bonus, he received benefits, including medical, dental and
life insurance, through December 31, 2002.  He also received a one-time
cash payment of $250,000 as consideration for his services.

In addition, Mr. Creighton's
temporary living expenses while working at UAL's headquarters in Chicago,
including the cost of a temporary residence (which could not exceed $3,000
per month) and a per diem allowance, continued to be paid by UAL through
November 2002.  Through October 2002, UAL also provided Mr. Creighton
with office space located in the vicinity of his personal residence in
Seattle to be used primarily for UAL business while he was staying at his
personal residence.  The reimbursement for this office space was limited
to $3,000 per month.

Mr. Studdert's Agreement

UAL and Mr. Andrew Studdert
recently entered into an agreement regarding Mr. Studdert's recent termination
as an executive officer of UAL.  Under the terms of the agreement,
Mr. Studdert will remain an on-call employee of UAL and will receive $1,000
per month through September 2004 unless the agreement is terminated earlier. 
During the term of the agreement, Mr. Studdert will continue to provide
services for UAL if UAL reasonably requests such services.  Mr. Studdert
will continue to receive the transportation benefit that UAL provides to
its executive officers, as well as other health and insurance benefits. 
Mr. Studdert has agreed to forfeit all vested and unvested stock options
granted under UAL's equity incentive plans as well as any unvested restricted
stock.  The agreement and Mr. Studdert's employment will terminate
prior to September 2004 if Mr. Studdert voluntarily terminates his employment
or, without the Company's consent, accepts a position with a competitor
of United or he otherwise breaches the agreement.

Mr. Dutta's Agreement

UAL and Mr. Rono Dutta recently
entered into an agreement regarding Mr. Dutta's recent termination as an
executive officer of UAL.  Under the terms of the agreement, Mr. Dutta
will remain an on-call employee of UAL and will receive $2,000 per month
through September 2004 unless the agreement is terminated earlier. 
During the term of the agreement, Mr. Dutta will continue to provide services
for UAL if UAL reasonably requests such services.  Mr. Dutta will
continue to receive the transportation benefit that United provides to
its executive officers, as well as other health and insurance benefits. 
Mr. Dutta has agreed to forfeit all vested and unvested stock options granted
under UAL's equity incentive plans as well as any unvested restricted stock. 
The agreement and Mr. Dutta's employment will terminate prior to September
2004 if Mr. Dutta voluntarily terminates his employment or, without the
Company's consent, accepts a position with a competitor of United or he
otherwise breaches the agreement. UAL has consented to Mr. Dutta serving
on the board of directors of US Airways and to him serving as a consultant
to an investment banking firm that may represent the American Airlines
creditors' committee in the event that airline were to file for bankruptcy
protection.

ITEM 12.  SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND
MANAGEMENT.

Equity Compensation Plan Information

The following table sets
forth information as of December 31, 2002 regarding the number of shares
of UAL common stock that may be issued under UAL's equity compensation
plans.

_________________

(1)       Includes shares
and other awards under the following plans that have not been approved
by UAL's stockholders:  1995 Director's Plan; United Employees Performance
Incentive Plan; an option issued to a former CEO and 2002 Share Incentive
Plan.  The material terms of each of these plans is described following
the table.

(2)       The weighted-average
exercise price was calculated based on 800,000 options granted to Mr. Greenwald
at an exercise price of $22.53 and 650,000 options granted to Mr. Tilton
at an exercise price of $3.03.  The remaining 136,168 shares do not
have an exercise price.

(3)        Includes
11,942,366 shares available for future issuance under the 2002 Incentive
Share Plan and 41,372 shares available for issuance under the 1995 Directors
Plan.  The number of shares available for future issuance does not
include any shares issuable under outstanding awards or the 2002 Share
Incentive Plan that are subsequently forfeited, expired or canceled without
the delivery of shares of common stock or withheld by UAL to satisfy any
applicable tax withholding obligations, which are available again for issuance
under the 2002 Share Incentive Plan.

(4)       The total weighted-average
exercise price does not include the 136,168 shares referred to in footnote
2, for which there is no exercise price.

1995 Directors Plan

Under the 1995 Directors
Plan, each outside director is granted 400 shares of common stock and 189
deferred stock units (each unit representing the right to receive a share
of common stock at a future date) during each year that he or she is an
outside director of UAL.  If any outside director is not a director
for the entire calendar year, such director's award of deferred stock units
will be prorated.  Each outside director may elect to forego the receipt
of all or any portion of cash fees payable to him or her for service as
a director (i.e., meeting fees and committee fees) and instead receive
shares of common stock equivalent in value to the cash fees based on the
fair market value of a share of common stock on the date the cash fee is
payable to the director.  The outside directors may also elect to
defer the receipt of cash fees payable to the director as well as the stock
award and the deferred stock units to be granted to the director in any
year, which deferral may be paid after the director leaves the Board, either
as a lump sum or in ten or less annual payments.  The 1995 Directors
Plan authorizes the issuance of up to 400,000 shares of common stock (either
through use of treasury shares or open market purchases) and, as of December
31, 2002, 41,372 shares remained available for future awards.

2002 Share Incentive Plan

The 2002 Share Incentive
Plan permits the award of nonqualified stock options and restricted shares
to participants as well as stock appreciation rights.  The exercise
price of a nonqualified stock option cannot be less than the fair market
value of a share of UAL common stock on the date of grant and the exercise
period cannot exceed ten years.  Restricted shares issued under the
2002 Share Incentive Plan vest over a time period established by the applicable
committee (not to exceed ten years) and are subject to certain transfer
restrictions and forfeiture under certain circumstances prior to vesting. 
In addition, the Compensation Committee or the Compensation Administration
Committee may grant to participants other awards, including dividends and
dividend equivalents and other awards that are valued in whole or part
by reference to, or are otherwise based on, the fair market value of shares
of UAL common stock.  The 2002 Share Incentive Plan authorizes the
issuance of 12,500,000 shares of common stock as well as 267,366 shares
that were available for issuance as awards under the 1998 Restricted Stock
Plan as of July 31, 2002 and, as of December 31, 2002, approximately 11,942,366
shares remained available for future awards under the 2002 Share Incentive
Plan.  Only treasury shares may be issued under the 2002 Share Incentive
Plan.  The terms of the 2002 Share Incentive Plan also provides that
any shares awarded under the 1998 Restricted Stock Plan or the 2002 Share
Incentive Plan that are subsequently forfeited, expired or canceled without
the delivery of shares of common stock or withheld by UAL to satisfy any
applicable tax withholding obligations will be available again for issuance
under the plan.

Gerald Greenwald Option Shares

On July 12, 1994, UAL entered
into an employment agreement with Gerald Greenwald, UAL's then Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer.  Pursuant to the agreement, Mr. Greenwald
received options to acquire 800,000 shares of UAL common stock (post-stock
split).  The exercise price for the options is $22.53, which was the
fair market value for the UAL common stock on July 12, 1994.  The
options were to vest over a five-year period, but vested earlier in connection
with the termination of Mr. Greenwald's employment with UAL.  To date,
all 800,000 of the options received by Mr. Greenwald are outstanding. 
The options are due to expire on July 11, 2004.

United Employees Performance Incentive Plan

Under the terms of the United
Employees Performance Incentive Plan (referred to as PIP), participants
may receive additional cash compensation if the Company meets specified
performance criteria and the employee's individual performance warrants
additional compensation.  Prior to the beginning of each year, the
Company's Compensation Committee establishes a threshold level of pre-tax
profit margin that the Company must obtain before any award may be made
under the PIP for that year.  The Compensation Committee also determines
the appropriate individual performance objectives for each year that are
related to specified areas, including financial performance, operational
performance or customer satisfaction.

Under the PIP, an incentive
award is typically paid in cash following the end of a calendar year; however,
certain key employees are allowed to elect to defer receipt of their incentive
award and can elect to receive their deferred incentive award in UAL common
stock (treasury shares or shares purchased in the open market).  The
amount of the stock to be paid to each employee is equal to the amount
of the incentive award divided by the fair market value of the stock (using
a five-day average share price) determined as of the date the incentive
award would have been paid in cash but for the deferral election. 
Under the PIP, any employee who defers his or her receipt of the incentive
award for five or more years will also be credited with an additional amount
equal to the 20% of the incentive award.  The Compensation Administration
Committee administers the plan with respect to any "officer" as defined
in the Exchange Act rules and the Compensation Committee administers the
plan with respect to all other participants.  There is no fixed number
of shares available for issuance under this plan.  In 2000, UAL's
shareholders approved the portion of the PIP relating to any "covered award"
that could result in the application of Section 162(m) of the Code.

Within the 90-day period
prior to the filing of this report, an evaluation was carried out under
the supervision and with the participation of the Company's management,
including the Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and Chief Financial Officer

procedures.  Based on that evaluation, the Company's CEO and CFO have
concluded that UAL's disclosure controls and procedures are effective to
ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that
we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in
Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms.  Subsequent to
the date of their evaluation, there were no significant changes in UAL's
internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect the
disclosure controls, including any corrective actions with regard to significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses.
