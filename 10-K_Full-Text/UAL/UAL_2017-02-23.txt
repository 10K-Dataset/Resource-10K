PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS.

Overview

United Continental Holdings, Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, “UAL” or the “Company”) is a holding company and its
principal, wholly-owned subsidiary is United Airlines, Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, “United”). As UAL consolidates United for financial statement purposes, disclosures that relate to activities of United also apply to
UAL, unless otherwise noted. United’s operating revenues and operating expenses comprise nearly 100% of UAL’s revenues and operating expenses. In addition, United comprises approximately the entire balance of UAL’s assets, liabilities
and operating cash flows. When appropriate, UAL and United are named specifically for their individual contractual obligations and related disclosures and any significant differences between the operations and results of UAL and United are
separately disclosed and explained. We sometimes use the words “we,” “our,” “us,” and the “Company” in this report for disclosures that relate to all of UAL and United.

UAL was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on December 30, 1968. Our principal executive office is located at 233 South Wacker
Drive, Chicago, Illinois 60606 (telephone number

(872) 825-4000).

The Company’s website is
www.unitedcontinentalholdings.com. The information contained on or connected to the Company’s website is not incorporated by reference into this annual report on

Form 10-K

and should not be
considered part of this or any other report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Through this website, the Company’s filings with the SEC, including annual reports on

Form 10-K,

quarterly reports on

Form 10-Q,

current reports on

Form 8-K,

and all amendments to those reports, as
well as our proxy statement for our annual meeting of stockholders, are accessible without charge, as soon as reasonably practicable, after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC. Such filings are also available on the
SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.

Operations

The Company transports people and cargo through its mainline and regional operations. With key global aviation rights in North America, Asia-Pacific, Europe, Middle East and Latin America, UAL has the
world’s most comprehensive global route network. UAL, through United and its regional carriers, operates more than 4,500 flights a day to 339 airports across five continents from the Company’s hubs at Newark Liberty International Airport
(“Newark”), Chicago O’Hare International Airport (“Chicago O’Hare”), Denver International Airport (“Denver”), George Bush Intercontinental Airport (“Houston Bush”), Los Angeles International Airport
(“LAX”), A.B. Won Pat International Airport (“Guam”), San Francisco International Airport (“SFO”) and Washington Dulles International Airport (“Washington Dulles”).

All of the Company’s domestic hubs are located in large business and population centers, contributing to a large amount of “origin and
destination” traffic. The hub and spoke system allows us to transport passengers between a large number of destinations with substantially more frequent service than if each route were served directly. The



hub system also allows us to add service to a new destination from a large number of cities using only one or a limited number of aircraft. As discussed under

Alliances

below, United
is a member of Star Alliance, the world’s largest alliance network.

Financial information on the Company’s operating revenues by
geographic regions, as reported to the U.S. Department of Transportation (the “DOT”), can be found in Note 17 to the financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report.

Regional.

The Company has contractual relationships with various regional carriers to provide regional jet and
turboprop service branded as United Express. These regional operations are an extension of the Company’s mainline network. This regional service complements our operations by carrying traffic that connects to our mainline service and allows
flights to smaller cities that cannot be provided economically with mainline aircraft. Republic Airlines (“Republic”), Champlain Enterprises, LLC d/b/a CommutAir (“CommutAir”), ExpressJet Airlines (“ExpressJet”), GoJet
Airlines (“GoJet”), Mesa Airlines (“Mesa”), Shuttle America (“Shuttle”), SkyWest Airlines (“SkyWest”) and Trans States Airlines (“Trans States”) are all regional carriers, which operate most of their
capacity contracted to United under capacity purchase agreements (“CPAs”) with United. Under these CPAs, the Company pays the regional carriers contractually agreed fees (carrier-controlled costs) for operating these flights plus a
variable reimbursement (incentive payment for operational performance) based on agreed performance metrics. The fees for carrier-controlled costs are based on specific rates for various operating expenses of the regional carriers, such as crew
expenses, maintenance and aircraft ownership, some of which are multiplied by specific operating statistics (e.g., block hours, departures) while others are fixed monthly amounts. Under these CPAs, the Company is responsible for all fuel costs
incurred as well as landing fees, facilities rent and other costs, which are either passed through by the regional carrier to the Company without any markup or directly incurred by the Company. In return, the regional carriers operate this capacity
exclusively for United, on schedules determined by the Company. The Company also determines pricing and revenue management, assumes the inventory and distribution risk for the available seats and permits mileage accrual and redemption for regional
flights through its MileagePlus

®

loyalty program.

Alliances.

United is a member of Star Alliance, a global integrated airline network and the largest and most comprehensive airline alliance in the world. As of January 1, 2017, Star
Alliance carriers served 1,300 airports in 190 countries with 18,450 daily departures. Star Alliance members, in addition to United, are Adria Airways, Aegean Airlines, Air Canada, Air China, Air India, Air New Zealand, All Nippon Airways
(“ANA”), Asiana Airlines, Austrian Airlines, Avianca, Avianca Brasil, Brussels Airlines, Copa Airlines, Croatia Airlines, EGYPTAIR, Ethiopian Airlines, EVA Air, LOT Polish Airlines, Lufthansa, SAS Scandinavian Airlines, Shenzhen Airlines,
Singapore Airlines, South African Airways, SWISS, TAP Portugal, THAI Airways International and Turkish Airlines. In October 2016, Star Alliance announced the future inclusion of Juneyao Airlines as a new connecting partner.

United has a variety of bilateral commercial alliance agreements and obligations with Star Alliance members, addressing, among other
things, reciprocal earning and redemption of frequent flyer miles, access to airport lounges and, with certain Star
Alliance

members, codesharing of flight operations
(whereby one carrier’s selected flights can be marketed under the brand name of another carrier). In addition to the alliance agreements with Star Alliance members, United currently maintains independent marketing alliance agreements with other
air carriers, including Aeromar, Aer Lingus, Air Dolomiti, Azul, Cape Air, Eurowings, Germanwings, Great Lakes Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines, Island Air, Jet Airways and Silver Airways. In addition to the marketing alliance agreements with air
partners, United also offers a

train-to-plane

codeshare and frequent flyer alliance with Amtrak from Newark on select city pairs in the northeastern United States.

United also participates in three passenger joint ventures, one with Air Canada and the Lufthansa Group (which includes Lufthansa and its
affiliates Austrian Airlines, Brussels Airlines, Eurowings and SWISS) covering transatlantic routes, one with ANA covering certain transpacific routes and one with Air New Zealand covering certain routes between the United States and New Zealand.
These passenger joint ventures enable the participating carriers to integrate the services they provide in the respective regions, capturing revenue synergies and delivering highly competitive flight schedules, fares and services. United has also
begun implementation of a



cargo joint venture with ANA for transpacific cargo services. This cargo joint venture offers expanded and more seamless access to cargo space across the carriers’ respective combined
networks.

Loyalty Program.

United’s MileagePlus program builds customer loyalty by offering awards, benefits and services
to program participants. Members in this program earn miles for flights on United, United Express, Star Alliance members and certain other airlines that participate in the program. Members can also earn miles by purchasing the goods and services of
our network of

non-airline

partners, such as credit card issuers, retail merchants, hotels and car rental companies. Members can redeem miles for free (other than taxes and government imposed fees), discounted
or upgraded travel and

non-travel

awards.

The Company has an agreement with Chase Bank USA, N.A.
(“Chase”), pursuant to which members of the Company’s MileagePlus loyalty program who are residents of the United States can earn miles for making purchases using a MileagePlus credit card issued by Chase. The agreement also provides
for joint marketing and other support for the MileagePlus credit card and provides Chase with other benefits such as permission to market to the Company’s customer database.

Approximately 5.2 million and 5.0 million MileagePlus flight awards were used on United in 2016 and 2015, respectively. These awards represented 7.7% and 7.5% of United’s total revenue
passenger miles in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Total miles redeemed for flights on United in 2016, including

class-of-service

upgrades, represented approximately 84% of
the total miles redeemed. In addition, excluding miles redeemed for flights on United, MileagePlus members redeemed miles for approximately 2.0 million other awards in 2016 as compared to 1.8 million in 2015. These awards include United
Club memberships, car and hotel awards, merchandise and flights on other air carriers.

Our operational and financial results can be significantly impacted by changes in the price and availability of aircraft
fuel. To provide adequate supplies of fuel, the Company routinely enters into purchase contracts that are customarily indexed to market prices for aircraft fuel, and the Company generally has some ability to cover short-term fuel supply and
infrastructure disruptions at some major demand locations. The price of aircraft fuel has fluctuated substantially in the past several years and in order to lower its exposure to unpredictable increases in the market prices of aircraft fuel, the
Company has historically hedged a portion of its planned fuel requirements. As of December 31, 2016, the Company did not have any outstanding fuel hedging contracts. The Company’s current strategy is to not enter into transactions to hedge
its fuel consumption, although the Company regularly reviews its strategy based on market conditions and other factors.

Third-Party
Business.

United generates third-party business revenue that includes frequent flyer award

non-air

redemptions, maintenance services, catering and ground handling. Third-party business revenue is
recorded in Other operating revenue. Expenses associated with third-party business are recorded in Other operating expenses.

Distribution Channels.

The Company’s airline seat inventory and fares are distributed through the Company’s direct channels,
traditional travel agencies and

on-line

travel agencies. The use of the Company’s direct sales website, united.com, the Company’s mobile applications and alternative distribution systems,
provides the Company with an opportunity to

de-commoditize

its services, better present its content, make more targeted offerings, better retain its customers, enhance its brand and lower its ticket
distribution costs. Agency sales are



primarily sold using global distribution systems (“GDS”). United has developed capabilities to sell certain ancillary products through the GDS channel to provide an enhanced buying
experience for customers who purchase in that channel. To increase the Company’s opportunities to sell its full range of products and services and lower distribution costs, the Company will continue to develop new selling capabilities in
third-party channels and expand the capabilities of its website and mobile applications.

Industry Conditions

Domestic Competition.

The domestic airline industry is highly competitive and dynamic. The Company’s competitors consist primarily of
other airlines and, to a certain extent, other forms of transportation. Currently, any U.S. carrier deemed fit by the DOT is free to operate scheduled passenger service between any two points within the United States. Competition can be direct, in
the form of another carrier flying the exact

non-stop

route, or indirect, where a carrier serves the same two cities

non-stop

from an alternative airport in that city or
via an itinerary requiring a connection at another airport. Air carriers’ cost structures are not uniform and there are numerous factors influencing cost structure. Carriers with lower costs may offer lower fares to passengers, which could have
a potential negative impact on the Company’s revenues. Decisions on domestic pricing are based on intense competitive pressure exerted on the Company by other U.S. airlines. In order to remain competitive and maintain passenger traffic levels,
we often find it necessary to match competitors’ discounted fares. Since we compete in a dynamic marketplace, attempts to generate additional revenue through increased fares oftentimes fail.

International Competition.

Internationally, the Company competes not only with U.S. airlines, but also with foreign carriers. International
competition has increased and may increase in the future as a result of airline mergers and acquisitions, joint ventures, alliances, restructurings, liberalization of aviation bilateral agreements and new or increased service by competitors,
including government subsidized competitors from certain Middle East countries. Competition on international routes is subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation. The Company’s ability to compete successfully with

non-U.S.

carriers on international routes depends in part on its ability to generate traffic to and from the entire United States via its integrated domestic route network and its ability to overcome business and
operational challenges across its network worldwide. Foreign carriers currently are prohibited by U.S. law from carrying local passengers between two points in the United States and the Company generally experiences comparable restrictions in
foreign countries. Separately, “fifth freedom rights” allow the Company to operate between points in two different foreign countries and foreign carriers may also have fifth freedom rights between the U.S. and another foreign country. In
the absence of fifth freedom rights, or some other extra-bilateral right to conduct operations between two foreign countries, U.S. carriers are constrained from carrying passengers to points beyond designated international gateway cities. To
compensate partially for these structural limitations, U.S. and foreign carriers have entered into alliances, joint ventures and marketing arrangements that enable these carriers to exchange traffic between each other’s flights and route
networks. See

Alliances,

above, for additional information.

Seasonality.

The air travel business is subject to seasonal
fluctuations. Historically, demand for air travel is higher in the second and third quarters, driving higher revenues, than in the first and fourth quarters, which are periods of lower travel demand.

Industry Regulation

Domestic
Regulation

All carriers engaged in air transportation in the United States are subject to regulation by the DOT. Absent an exemption,
no air carrier may provide air transportation of passengers or property without first being issued a DOT certificate of public convenience and necessity. The DOT also grants international route authority, approves international codeshare
arrangements and regulates methods of competition. The DOT regulates consumer protection and maintains jurisdiction over advertising, denied boarding compensation, tarmac delays, baggage liability and other areas and may add additional expensive
regulatory burdens in the future. The DOT has



launched investigations or claimed rulemaking authority to regulate commercial agreements among carriers or between carriers and third parties in a wide variety of contexts.

Airlines are also regulated by the Federal Aviation Administration (the “FAA”), an agency within the DOT, primarily in the areas of flight
safety, air carrier operations and aircraft maintenance and airworthiness. The FAA issues air carrier operating certificates and aircraft airworthiness certificates, prescribes maintenance procedures, oversees airport operations, and regulates pilot
and other employee training. From time to time, the FAA issues directives that require air carriers to inspect or modify aircraft and other equipment, potentially causing the Company to incur substantial, unplanned expenses. The airline industry is
also subject to numerous other federal laws and regulations. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) has jurisdiction over virtually every aspect of civil aviation security. The Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice
(“DOJ”) has jurisdiction over certain airline competition matters. The U.S. Postal Service has authority over certain aspects of the transportation of mail by airlines. Labor relations in the airline industry are generally governed by the
Railway Labor Act (“RLA”), a federal statute. The Company is also subject to investigation inquiries by the DOT, FAA, DOJ, DHS and other U.S. and international regulatory bodies.

Airport Access.

Access to landing and

take-off

rights, or “slots,” at several major U.S. airports and many foreign airports served by the Company
are, or recently have been, subject to government regulation. Federally mandated domestic slot restrictions that limit operations and regulate capacity currently apply at Reagan National Airport in Washington, D.C. and at John F. Kennedy
International Airport and LaGuardia Airport in the New York City metropolitan region. Additional restrictions on airline routes and takeoff and landing slots at these and other airports may be proposed in the future that could affect the
Company’s rights of ownership and transfer. In April 2016, the FAA announced that it was lifting slot controls at Newark as of the winter 2016 season. This change may result in additional congestion at Newark and in the New York City
metropolitan region airspace as a whole. If slots are eliminated at an airport, or if the number of hours of operation governed by slots is reduced at an airport, the lack of controls on takeoffs and landings could result in greater congestion both
at the affected airport or in the regional airspace (e.g., the New York City metropolitan airspace) and could significantly impact the Company’s operations.

Legislation

. The airline industry is subject to legislative activity that may have an impact on operations and costs. In 2017, the U.S. Congress will continue to consider legislation to reauthorize
the FAA, which encompasses all significant aviation tax and policy-related issues. As with previous reauthorization legislation, the U.S. Congress may consider a range of policy changes that could impact operations and costs. Finally, aviation
security continues to be the subject of legislative and regulatory action, requiring changes to the Company’s security processes, potentially increasing the cost of its security procedures and affecting its operations.

International Regulation

International air transportation is subject to extensive government regulation. In connection with the Company’s international services, the Company
is regulated by both the U.S. government and the governments of the foreign countries the Company serves. In addition, the availability of international routes to U.S. carriers is regulated by aviation agreements between the U.S. and foreign
governments, and in some cases, fares and schedules require the approval of the DOT and/or the relevant foreign governments.

Legislation.

Foreign countries are increasingly enacting passenger protection laws, rules and regulations that meet or exceed U.S. requirements. In cases where this activity exceeds U.S. requirements, additional burden and liability may be placed on the
Company. Certain countries have regulations requiring passenger compensation and/or enforcement penalties from the Company in addition to changes in operating procedures due to canceled and delayed flights.

Airport Access.

Historically, access to foreign markets has been tightly controlled through bilateral agreements between the U.S. and each foreign
country involved. These agreements regulate the markets served, the number of carriers allowed to serve each market and the frequency of carriers’ flights. Since the early 1990s, the U.S. has pursued a policy of “Open Skies” (meaning
all U.S.-flag carriers have access to the destination), under which the



U.S. government has negotiated a number of bilateral agreements allowing unrestricted access between U.S. and foreign markets. Currently, there are more than 100 Open Skies agreements in effect.
However, even with Open Skies, many of the airports that the Company serves in Europe, Asia and Latin America maintain slot controls. A large number of these slot controls exist due to congestion, environmental and noise protection and reduced
capacity due to runway and air traffic control (“ATC”) construction work, among other reasons. London Heathrow International Airport, Frankfurt Rhein-Main Airport, Shanghai Pudong International Airport, Beijing Capital International
Airport, Sao Paulo Guarulhos International Airport and Tokyo Haneda International Airport are among the most restrictive foreign airports due to slot and capacity limitations.

The Company’s ability to serve some foreign markets and expand into certain others is limited by the absence of aviation agreements between the U.S. government and the relevant foreign governments.
Shifts in U.S. or foreign government aviation policies may lead to the alteration or termination of air service agreements. Depending on the nature of any such change, the value of the Company’s international route authorities and slot rights
may be materially enhanced or diminished.

Environmental Regulation

The airline industry is subject to increasingly stringent federal, state, local and international environmental requirements, including those regulating emissions to air, water discharges, safe drinking
water and the use and management of hazardous substances and wastes.

Climate Change

. There is an increasing global regulatory focus on
greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions and their potential impacts relating to climate change. In October 2013, the International Civil Aviation Organization (“ICAO”), a United Nations body, agreed to develop a global market based
measure to address carbon emissions from international aviation, which was adopted in October 2016. The program, the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (“CORSIA”), is intended to create a single global
market-based measure to achieve carbon-neutral growth for international aviation after 2020, which will be achieved through airline purchases of carbon offset credits. Certain CORSIA program details remain to be developed and the impact of CORSIA
cannot be fully predicted, but CORSIA is expected to increase operating costs for airlines that operate internationally. In 2016, ICAO also adopted a carbon dioxide (“CO2”) emission standard for aircraft and the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency has started the process required to adopt the standard. While the precise timing and final form of these various programs and requirements continue to evolve, the Company is taking various actions that are expected to help to
reduce its CO2 emissions over time such as fleet renewal, aircraft retrofits and the commercialization of aviation alternative fuels.

Other
Regulations

. Our operations are subject to a variety of other environmental laws and regulations both in the United States and internationally. These include noise-related restrictions on aircraft types and operating times, which have or could
in the future, result in curtailments in services, increased operating costs or limits on expansion. Certain foreign airports and/or governments either have or are seeking to establish environmental fees applicable to carbon emissions, local air
quality pollutants and/or noise. In the United States, new regulations affecting underground storage tanks became effective in 2015, which are expected to affect certain airport fuel hydrant systems, potentially impacting operating costs. The
implementation of revised national ambient air quality standards for ozone by individual affected states, scheduled for early 2020, is expected to trigger restrictions on mobile sources such as cars, trucks and airport ground support equipment in
those jurisdictions where ozone levels exceed the new standards. Finally, environmental cleanup laws can require the Company to undertake or subject the Company to liability for investigation and remediation costs at owned or leased locations or
third party disposal locations.

Until applicability of new regulations to our specific operations is better defined and/or when new
regulations are finalized, future costs to comply with such regulations will remain uncertain but are likely to increase our operating costs over time. While we continue to monitor these developments, the precise nature of future requirements
and their applicability to the Company are difficult to predict, but the financial impact to the Company and the aviation industry could be significant.



Employees

As of December 31, 2016, UAL, including its subsidiaries, had approximately 88,000 employees. Approximately 80% of the Company’s employees were represented by various U.S. labor organizations as
of December 31, 2016.

Collective bargaining agreements between the Company and its represented employee groups are negotiated under the
RLA. Such agreements typically do not contain an expiration date and instead specify an amendable date, upon which the agreement is considered “open for amendment.” In 2016, the Company finalized new or extension agreements with all 11 of
its U.S. employee groups, including joint collective bargaining agreements with its flight attendants and technicians and related employees.

The following table reflects the Company’s represented employee groups, the number of employees per represented group, union representation for each

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS.

The following risk
factors should be read carefully when evaluating the Company’s business and the forward-looking statements contained in this report and other statements the Company or its representatives make from time to time. Any of the following risks could
materially and adversely affect the Company’s business, operating results, financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made in this report.

Global economic, political and industry conditions constantly change and unfavorable conditions may have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s business and results of operations.

The Company’s business and results of operations are significantly impacted by
global economic and industry conditions. The airline industry is highly cyclical, and the level of demand for air travel is correlated to the strength of the U.S. and global economies. The Company is a global business with operations outside of the
United States from which it derives significant operating revenues. The Company’s international operations are a vital part of its worldwide airline network. Volatile economic, political and market conditions in these international regions may
have a negative impact on the Company’s operating results and its ability to achieve its business objectives.

Robust demand for the
Company’s air transportation services depends largely on favorable economic conditions, including the strength of the domestic and foreign economies, low unemployment levels, strong consumer confidence levels and the availability of consumer
and business credit. Air transportation is often a discretionary purchase that leisure travelers may limit or eliminate during difficult economic times. In addition, during periods of unfavorable economic conditions, business travelers usually
reduce the volume of their travel, either due to cost-saving initiatives or as a result of decreased business activity requiring travel. During such periods, the Company’s business and results of operations may be adversely affected due to
significant declines in industry passenger demand, particularly with respect to the Company’s business and premium cabin travelers, and a reduction in fare levels.

Stagnant or weakening global economic conditions either in the United States or in other geographic regions, and any future volatility in U.S. and global financial and credit markets may have a material
adverse effect on the Company’s revenues, results of operations and liquidity. If such economic conditions were to disrupt capital markets in the future, the Company may be unable to obtain financing on acceptable terms (or at all) to refinance
certain maturing debt and to satisfy future capital commitments.

Recently, United Kingdom (“UK”) voters voted for the UK to exit the
European Union (the “EU”), a

non-binding

referendum that, if passed into law, could adversely affect European and worldwide economic and market conditions and could contribute to instability in
global financial and foreign exchange markets, including volatility in the value of the British pound and European euro, additional travel restrictions on passengers traveling between the UK and other EU countries and legal uncertainty and
potentially divergent national laws and regulations. These adverse effects in European market conditions could negatively impact the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.

In addition, significant or volatile changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies may have a material adverse impact upon the
Company’s liquidity, revenues, costs and operating results.

The airline industry is highly competitive and susceptible to price
discounting and changes in capacity, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company.

The U.S. airline industry is
characterized by substantial price competition including from

low-cost

carriers. The significant market presence of

low-cost

carriers, which engage in substantial price
discounting, may diminish our ability to achieve sustained profitability on domestic and international routes.

Airlines also compete for
market share by increasing or decreasing their capacity, including route systems and the number of markets served. Several of the Company’s domestic and international competitors have increased



their international capacity by including service to some destinations that the Company currently serves, causing overlap in destinations served and therefore increasing competition for those
destinations. This increased competition in both domestic and international markets may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.

Terrorist attacks or international hostilities, or the fear of terrorist attacks or hostilities, even if not made directly on the airline industry,
could negatively affect the Company and the airline industry.

The terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001 involving commercial
aircraft severely and adversely impacted the Company’s financial condition and results of operations, as well as the prospects for the airline industry. Among the effects experienced from the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks were
substantial flight disruption costs caused by the

FAA-imposed

temporary grounding of the U.S. airline industry’s fleet, significantly increased security costs and associated passenger inconvenience,
increased insurance costs, substantially higher ticket refunds and significantly decreased traffic and passenger revenue.

Additional terrorist
attacks, even if not made directly on the airline industry, or the fear of or the precautions taken in anticipation of such attacks (including elevated national threat warnings or selective cancellation or redirection of flights) could materially
and adversely affect the Company and the airline industry. Wars and other international hostilities could also have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. The Company’s
financial resources may not be sufficient to absorb the adverse effects of any future terrorist attacks or other international hostilities.

Increasing privacy and data security obligations or a significant data breach may adversely affect the Company’s business.

The Company is subject to increasing legislative, regulatory and customer focus on privacy issues and data security. Also, a number of the Company’s
commercial partners, including credit card companies, have imposed data security standards that the Company must meet and these standards continue to evolve. The Company will continue its efforts to meet its privacy and data security obligations;
however, it is possible that certain new obligations may be difficult to meet and could increase the Company’s costs. Additionally, the Company must manage evolving cybersecurity risks. The loss, disclosure, misappropriation of or access to
customers’, employees’ or business partners’ information or the Company’s failure to meet its obligations could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties. A significant data breach or the
Company’s failure to meet its obligations may adversely affect the Company’s reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.

The Company relies heavily on technology and automated systems to operate its business and any significant failure or disruption of the technology or these systems could materially harm its
business.

The Company depends on automated systems and technology to operate its business, including computerized airline reservation
systems, flight operations systems, revenue management systems, accounting systems, telecommunication systems and commercial websites, including www.united.com. United’s website and other automated systems must be able to accommodate a high
volume of traffic, maintain secure information and deliver important flight and schedule information, as well as process critical financial transactions. These systems could suffer substantial or repeated disruptions due to various events, some of
which are beyond the Company’s control, including natural disasters, power failures, terrorist attacks, equipment or software failures, computer viruses or cyber security attacks. Substantial or repeated systems failures or disruptions,
including failures or disruptions related to the Company’s complex integration of systems, could reduce the attractiveness of the Company’s services versus those of its competitors, materially impair its ability to market its services and
operate its flights, result in the unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, result in increased costs, lost revenue and the loss or compromise of important data, and may adversely affect the Company’s business,
results of operations and financial condition.



Current or future litigation and regulatory actions, or failure to comply with the terms of any
settlement, order or arrangement relating to these actions, could have a material adverse impact on the Company.

From time to time, we
are subject to litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings relating to our business or investigations or other actions by governmental agencies, including as described in Part I, Item 3 “Legal Proceedings” of this annual report
on Form

10-K.

No assurances can be given that the results of these or new matters will be favorable to us. An adverse resolution of lawsuits, arbitrations, investigations or other proceedings or actions could
have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, including as a result of

non-monetary

remedies. Defending ourselves in these matters may be time-consuming, expensive and
disruptive to normal business operations and may result in significant expense and a diversion of management’s time and attention from the operation of our business, which could impede our ability to achieve our business objectives.
Additionally, any amount that we may be required to pay to satisfy a judgment, settlement, fine or penalty may not be covered by insurance. If we fail to comply with the terms contained in any settlement, order or agreement with a governmental
authority relating to these matters, we could be subject to criminal or civil penalties, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company. Under our charter and certain indemnification agreements that we have entered into (and may in the
future enter into) with our officers, directors and certain third parties, we could be required to indemnify and advance expenses to them in connection with their involvement in certain actions, suits, investigations and other proceedings. There can
be no assurance that any of these payments will not be material.

Disruptions to the Company’s regional network and United Express
flights provided by third-party regional carriers could adversely affect the Company’s operations and financial condition.

The
Company has contractual relationships with various regional carriers to provide regional jet and turboprop service branded as United Express. These regional operations are an extension of the Company’s mainline network and complement the
Company’s operations by carrying traffic that connects to mainline service and allows flights to smaller cities that cannot be provided economically with mainline aircraft. The Company’s business and operations are dependent on its
regional flight network, with regional capacity accounting for approximately 11% of the Company’s total capacity as of December 31, 2016.

Although the Company has agreements with its regional carriers that include contractually agreed performance metrics, the Company does not control the operations of these carriers. A number of factors may
impact the Company’s regional network, including weather-related effects and seasonality. In addition, the decrease in qualified pilots driven by federal regulations has adversely impacted and could continue to affect the Company’s
regional flying. For example, the FAA’s expansion of minimum pilot qualification standards, including a requirement that a pilot have at least 1,500 total flight hours, as well as the FAA’s revised pilot flight and duty time rules,
effective January 2014, have contributed to a smaller supply of pilots available to regional carriers. The decrease in qualified pilots resulting from the regulations as well as factors including a decreased student pilot population and a shrinking
U.S. military from which to hire qualified pilots, could adversely impact the Company’s operations and financial condition, and also require the Company to reduce regional carrier flying.

If a significant disruption occurs to the Company’s regional network or flights or if one or more of the regional carriers with which the Company has relationships is unable to perform their
obligations over an extended period of time, there could be a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and operations.

The Company’s business relies extensively on third-party service providers. Failure of these parties to perform as expected, or interruptions in the Company’s relationships with these
providers or their provision of services to the Company, could have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial position and results of operations.

The Company has engaged third-party service providers to perform a large number of functions that are integral to its business, including regional operations, operation of customer service call centers,
distribution and sale of airline seat inventory, provision of information technology infrastructure and services, transmitting or uploading of data, provision of aircraft maintenance and repairs, provision of various utilities and performance of
aircraft



fueling operations, among other vital functions and services. The Company does not directly control these third-party service providers, although it does enter into agreements with most of them
that define expected service performance. Any of these third-party service providers, however, may materially fail to meet their service performance commitments to the Company, may suffer disruptions to their systems that could impact their
services, or the agreements with such providers may be terminated. For example, flight reservations booked by customers and travel agencies via third-party GDSs may be adversely affected by disruptions in the business relationships between the
Company and GDS operators. Such disruptions, including a failure to agree upon acceptable contract terms when contracts expire or otherwise become subject to renegotiation, may cause the Company’s flight information to be limited or unavailable
for display, significantly increase fees for both the Company and GDS users and impair the Company’s relationships with its customers and travel agencies. The failure of any of the Company’s third-party service providers to perform their
service obligations adequately, or other interruptions of services, may reduce the Company’s revenues and increase its expenses, prevent the Company from operating its flights and providing other services to its customers or result in adverse
publicity or harm to its brand. In addition, the Company’s business and financial performance could be materially harmed if its customers believe that its services are unreliable or unsatisfactory.

Orders for new aircraft typically must be placed years in advance of scheduled deliveries, and changes in the Company’s route network over
time may make aircraft on order less economic for the Company, but any modification or termination of such orders could result in material liability for the Company.

The Company’s orders for new aircraft are typically made years in advance of actual delivery of such aircraft, and the financial commitment required for purchases of new aircraft is substantial. At
December 31, 2016, the Company had firm commitments to purchase 257 new aircraft from The Boeing Company (“Boeing”), Airbus S.A.S (“Airbus”) and Embraer S.A. (“Embraer”), as well as related agreements with engine
manufacturers, maintenance providers and others. At December 31, 2016, the Company’s commitments relating to the acquisition of aircraft and related spare engines, aircraft improvements and other related obligations aggregated
$23.6 billion.

Subsequent to the Company placing an order for new aircraft, the Company’s route network may change, such that the
aircraft on order become less economic to operate flights in the Company’s network. As a result, the Company’s preference for a particular aircraft that it has ordered, often years in advance, may be decreased or eliminated. If the Company
were to seek to modify or terminate its existing aircraft order commitments, it may be responsible for material obligations to its counterparties arising from any such change. However, the Company expects that any such change that it makes would be
in the long-term best economic interest of the Company.

The Company could experience adverse publicity, harm to its brand, reduced
travel demand and potential tort liability as a result of an accident, catastrophe, or incident involving its aircraft, the aircraft of its regional carriers or the aircraft of its codeshare partners, which may result in a material adverse effect on
the Company’s results of operations or financial position.

An accident, catastrophe, or incident involving an aircraft that the
Company operates, or an aircraft that is operated by a codeshare partner or one of the Company’s regional carriers, could have a material adverse effect on the Company if such accident, catastrophe, or incident created a public perception that
the Company’s operations, or the operations of its codeshare partners or regional carriers, are not safe or reliable, or are less safe or reliable than other airlines. Such public perception could in turn result in adverse publicity for the
Company, cause harm to the Company’s brand and reduce travel demand on the Company’s flights, or the flights of its codeshare partners or regional carriers.

In addition, any such accident, catastrophe, or incident could expose the Company to significant tort liability. Although the Company currently maintains liability insurance in amounts and of the type the
Company believes to be consistent with industry practice to cover damages arising from any such accident or catastrophe, and the Company’s codeshare partners and regional carriers carry similar insurance and generally indemnify the



Company for their operations, if the Company’s liability exceeds the applicable policy limits or the ability of another carrier to indemnify it, the Company could incur substantial losses
from an accident, catastrophe or incident which may result in a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations or financial position.

If we experience changes in, or are unable to retain, our senior management team or other key employees, our operating results could be adversely affected.

Much of our future success depends on the continued availability of skilled personnel with industry experience and knowledge, including our senior
management team and other key employees. If we are unable to attract and retain talented, highly qualified senior management and other key employees, or if we are unable to effectively provide for the succession of senior management, our business
may be adversely affected.

High and/or volatile fuel prices or significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel could have a
material adverse impact on the Company’s strategic plans, operating results, financial position and liquidity.

Aircraft fuel is
critical to the Company’s operations and is one of its single largest operating expenses. The timely and adequate supply of fuel to meet operational demand depends on the continued availability of reliable fuel supply sources, as well as
related service and delivery infrastructure. Although the Company has some ability to cover short-term fuel supply and infrastructure disruptions at some major demand locations, it can neither predict nor guarantee the continued timely availability
of aircraft fuel throughout the Company’s system. The Company generally sources fuel at prevailing market prices.

Aircraft fuel has
historically been the Company’s most volatile operating expense due to the highly unpredictable nature of market prices for fuel. Market prices for aircraft fuel have historically fluctuated substantially in short periods of time and continue
to be highly volatile due a dependence on a multitude of unpredictable factors beyond the Company’s control. These factors include changes in global crude oil prices, the balance between aircraft fuel supply and demand, natural disasters,
prevailing inventory levels and fuel production and transportation infrastructure. Prices of fuel are also impacted by indirect factors that may potentially impact fuel supply or demand balance, such as geopolitical events, economic growth
indicators, fiscal/monetary policies, fuel tax policies, environmental concerns and financial investments in energy markets. Both actual changes in these factors, as well as changes in market expectations of these factors can potentially drive rapid
changes in fuel price levels in short periods of time.

Given the highly competitive nature of the airline industry, the Company may not be
able to increase its fares and fees sufficiently to offset the full impact of increases in fuel prices, especially if these increases are significant, rapid and sustained. Further, such fare and fee increases may not be sustainable, may reduce the
general demand for air travel and may also eventually impact the Company’s strategic growth and investment plans for the future. In addition, decreases in fuel prices for an extended period of time may result in increased industry capacity,
increased competitive actions for market share and lower fares or surcharges in general. If fuel prices were to then subsequently rise quickly, there may be a lag between the rise in fuel prices and any improvement of the revenue environment.

To protect against increases in the market prices of fuel, the Company may hedge a portion of its future fuel requirements. However, the
Company’s hedging program may not be successful in mitigating higher fuel costs, and any price protection provided may be limited due to choice of hedging instruments and market conditions, including breakdown of correlation between hedging
instrument and market price of aircraft fuel and failure of hedge counterparties. To the extent that the Company decides to hedge a portion of its future fuel requirements and uses hedge contracts that have the potential to create an obligation to
pay upon settlement if fuel prices decline significantly, such hedge contracts may limit the Company’s ability to benefit fully from lower fuel costs in the future. If fuel prices decline significantly from the levels existing at the time the
Company enters into a hedge contract, the Company may be required to post collateral (margin) beyond certain thresholds. There can be no assurance that the Company’s hedging arrangements will provide any particular level of protection against



rises in fuel prices or that its counterparties will be able to perform under the Company’s hedging arrangements. Additionally, deterioration in the Company’s financial condition could
negatively affect its ability to enter into new hedge contracts in the future.

See Note 10 to the financial statements included in Part II,
Item 8 of this report for additional information on the Company’s hedging activities.

Union disputes, employee strikes or
slowdowns, and other labor-related disruptions could adversely affect the Company’s operations and could result in increased costs that impair its financial performance.

United is a highly unionized company. As of December 31, 2016, the Company and its subsidiaries had approximately 88,000 active employees, of whom approximately 80% were represented by various U.S.
labor organizations.

There is a risk that unions or individual employees might pursue judicial or arbitral claims arising out of changes
implemented as a result of the Company entering into collective bargaining agreements with its represented employee groups. There is also a possibility that employees or unions could engage in job actions such as slowdowns,

work-to-rule

campaigns, sick-outs or other actions designed to disrupt the Company’s normal operations, in an attempt to pressure the Company in collective bargaining
negotiations. Although the RLA makes such actions unlawful until the parties have been lawfully released to self-help, and the Company can seek injunctive relief against premature self-help, such actions can cause significant harm even if ultimately
enjoined. In addition, collective bargaining agreements with the Company’s represented employee groups increase the Company’s labor costs, which increase could be material for any applicable reporting period.

See Notes 15 and 16 to the financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information on labor negotiations and costs.

An outbreak of a disease or similar public health threat could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, financial
position and results of operations.

An outbreak of a disease or similar public health threat that affects travel demand or travel
behavior, or travel restrictions or reduction in the demand for air travel caused by an outbreak of a disease or similar public health threat in the future, could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, financial condition and
results of operations.

Extensive government regulation could increase the Company’s operating costs and restrict its ability to
conduct its business.

Airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal oversight. Compliance with U.S. and international
regulations imposes significant costs and may have adverse effects on the Company. Laws, regulations, taxes and airport rates and charges, both domestically and internationally, have been proposed from time to time that could significantly increase
the cost of airline operations or reduce airline revenue.

United provides air transportation under certificates of public convenience and
necessity issued by the DOT. If the DOT altered, amended, modified, suspended or revoked these certificates, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business. The FAA regulates the safety of United’s operations. United
operates pursuant to an air carrier operating certificate issued by the FAA. In January 2014, the FAA’s more stringent pilot flight and duty time requirements under Part 117 of the Federal Aviation Regulations took effect, which has increased
costs for all carriers. In July 2014, minimum qualifications took effect for air carrier first officers. These regulations will continue to impact the industry and the Company for years to come, as they have caused mainline airlines to hire regional
pilots, while simultaneously significantly reducing the pool of new pilots from which regional carriers themselves can hire. Although this is an industry issue, it directly affects the Company and requires it to reduce regional partner flying, as
several regional partners have experienced difficulty flying their schedules due to reduced pilot availability. From time to time, the FAA also issues orders, airworthiness



directives and other regulations relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft that require material expenditures or operational restrictions by the Company. These FAA orders and
directives could include the temporary grounding of an entire aircraft type if the FAA identifies design, manufacturing, maintenance or other issues requiring immediate corrective action. These FAA directives or requirements could have a material
adverse effect on the Company.

In addition, the Company’s operations may be adversely impacted due to the existing antiquated ATC system
utilized by the U.S. government. During peak travel periods in certain markets, the current ATC system’s inability to handle ATC demand has led to short-term capacity constraints imposed by government agencies and resulted in delays and
disruptions of air traffic. In addition, the current system will not be able to effectively handle projected future air traffic growth. Imposition of these ATC constraints on a long-term basis may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
operations. Failure to update the ATC system in a timely manner, and the substantial funding requirements of a modernized ATC system that may be imposed on air carriers may have an adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition or results
of operations.

Access to landing and

take-off

rights, or “slots,” at several major U.S.
airports and many foreign airports served by the Company are, or recently have been, subject to government regulation. Certain of the Company’s major hubs are among the most congested airports in the United States and have been or could be
the subject of regulatory action that might limit the number of flights and/or increase costs of operations at certain times or throughout the day. The FAA may limit the Company’s airport access by limiting the number of departure and arrival
slots at high density traffic airports, which could affect the Company’s ownership and transfer rights, and local airport authorities may have the ability to control access to certain facilities or the cost of access to their facilities, which
could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business. The FAA historically has taken actions with respect to airlines’ slot holdings that airlines have challenged; if the FAA were to take actions that adversely affect the Company’s
slot holdings, the Company could incur substantial costs to preserve its slots or may lose slots. If slots are eliminated at an airport, or if the number of hours of operation governed by slots is reduced at an airport, the lack of controls on
takeoffs and landings could result in greater congestion both at the affected airport or in the regional airspace (e.g., the New York City metropolitan region airspace) and could significantly impact the Company’s operations. Further, the
Company’s operating costs at airports, including the Company’s major hubs, may increase significantly because of capital improvements at such airports that the Company may be required to fund, directly or indirectly. Such costs could be
imposed by the relevant airport authority without the Company’s approval and may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition.

The ability of carriers to operate flights on international routes between the United States and other countries may be subject to change. Applicable arrangements between the United States and foreign
governments may be amended from time to time, government policies with respect to airport operations may be revised, and the availability of appropriate slots or facilities may change. The Company currently operates a number of flights on
international routes under government arrangements, regulations or policies that designate the number of carriers permitted to operate on such routes, the capacity of the carriers providing services on such routes, the airports at which carriers may
operate international flights, or the number of carriers allowed access to particular airports. Any further limitations, additions or modifications to such arrangements, regulations or policies could have a material adverse effect on the
Company’s financial position and results of operations. Additionally, a change in law, regulation or policy for any of the Company’s international routes, such as Open Skies, could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s
financial position and results of operations and could result in the impairment of material amounts of related tangible and intangible assets. In addition, competition from revenue-sharing joint ventures and other alliance arrangements by and among
other airlines could impair the value of the Company’s business and assets on the Open Skies routes. The Company’s plans to enter into or expand U.S. antitrust immunized alliances and joint ventures on various international routes are
subject to receipt of approvals from applicable U.S. federal authorities and obtaining other applicable foreign government clearances or satisfying the necessary applicable regulatory requirements. There can be no assurance that such approvals
and clearances will be granted or will continue in effect upon further regulatory review or that changes in regulatory requirements or standards can be satisfied.



Many aspects of the Company’s operations are also subject to increasingly stringent federal, state,
local and international laws protecting the environment. Future environmental regulatory developments, such as climate change regulations in the United States and abroad could adversely affect operations and increase operating costs in the airline
industry. In addition, there is the potential for additional regulatory actions in regard to the emission of GHGs by the aviation industry. The precise nature of future requirements and their applicability to the Company are difficult to predict,
but the financial impact to the Company and the aviation industry would likely be adverse and could be significant.

In 2017, the U.S. Congress
will continue to consider legislation to reauthorize the FAA, which encompasses all significant aviation tax and policy related issues. As with previous reauthorization legislation, the U.S. Congress may consider a range of policy changes that could
impact the Company’s operations and costs.

See Part I, Item 1, Business—Industry Regulation, of this report for additional
information on government regulation impacting the Company.

The airline industry may undergo further change with respect to alliances
and joint ventures or due to consolidations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company.

The Company faces and
may continue to face strong competition from other carriers due to the modification of alliances and formation of new joint ventures. Carriers may improve their competitive positions through airline alliances, slot swaps and/or joint ventures.
Certain types of airline joint ventures further competition by allowing multiple airlines to coordinate routes, pool revenues and costs, and enjoy other mutual benefits, achieving many of the benefits of consolidation. “Open Skies”
agreements, including the agreements between the United States and the EU and between the United States and Japan, may also give rise to better integration opportunities among international carriers. Movement of airlines between current global
airline alliances could reduce joint network coverage for members of such alliances while also creating opportunities for joint ventures and bilateral alliances that did not exist before such realignment. There is ongoing speculation that further
airline and airline alliance consolidations or reorganizations could occur in the future, especially if new “Open Skies” agreements between Brazil and the United States are fully implemented. The Company routinely engages in analysis and
discussions regarding its own strategic position, including current and potential alliances, asset acquisitions and divestitures and may have future discussions with other airlines regarding strategic activities. If other airlines participate in
such activities, those airlines may significantly improve their cost structures or revenue generation capabilities, thereby potentially making them stronger competitors of the Company and potentially impairing the Company’s ability to realize
expected benefits from its own strategic relationships.

Insufficient liquidity may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
financial position and business.

The Company has a significant amount of financial leverage from fixed obligations, including aircraft
lease and debt financings, leases of airport property and other facilities, and other material cash obligations. In addition, the Company has substantial noncancelable commitments for capital expenditures, including for the acquisition of new
aircraft and related spare engines.

Although the Company’s cash flows from operations and its available capital, including the proceeds
from financing transactions, have been sufficient to meet these obligations and commitments to date, the Company’s future liquidity could be negatively affected by the risk factors discussed in this Item 1A., including, but not limited to,
substantial volatility in the price of fuel, adverse economic conditions, disruptions in the global capital markets and catastrophic external events.

If the Company’s liquidity is materially diminished due to the various risk factors noted in this Item 1A. or otherwise, the Company might not be able to timely pay its leases and debts or comply
with certain operating and financial covenants under its financing and credit card processing agreements or with other material provisions of its contractual obligations. Certain of these covenants require the Company or United, as applicable, to
maintain minimum liquidity and/or minimum collateral coverage ratios. The Company’s or United’s ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond its control, including the overall industry revenue environment, the
level of fuel costs and the appraised value of the collateral.



If the Company does not timely pay its leases and debts or comply with such covenants, a variety of adverse
consequences could result. These potential adverse consequences include an increase of required reserves under credit card processing agreements, withholding of credit card sale proceeds by its credit card service providers, loss of undrawn lines of
credit, the occurrence of one or more events of default under the relevant agreements, the acceleration of the maturity of debt and/or the exercise of other remedies by its creditors and equipment lessors that could result in a material adverse
effect on the Company’s financial position and results of operations. The Company cannot provide assurance that it would have sufficient liquidity to repay or refinance such debt if it were accelerated. In addition, an event of default or
acceleration of debt under certain of its financing agreements could result in one or more events of default under certain of the Company’s other financing agreements due to cross default and cross acceleration provisions.

Furthermore, insufficient liquidity may limit the Company’s ability to withstand competitive pressures and downturns in the travel business and the
economy in general.

The Company’s substantial level of indebtedness and

non-investment

grade
credit rating, as well as market conditions and the availability of assets as collateral for loans or other indebtedness, may make it difficult for the Company to raise additional capital if needed to meet its liquidity needs on acceptable terms, or
at all.

See Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of this report for
additional information regarding the Company’s liquidity.

Increases in insurance costs or reductions in insurance coverage may
materially and adversely impact the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.

The Company could be exposed to
significant liability or loss if its property or operations were to be affected by a natural catastrophe or other event, including aircraft accidents. If the Company is unable to obtain sufficient insurance (including but not limited to terrorism,
aviation hull and liability, workers’ compensation and property and business interruption insurance) with acceptable terms or if the coverage obtained is insufficient relative to actual liability or losses that the Company experiences, whether
due to insurance market conditions or otherwise, its results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.

The Company’s results of operations fluctuate due to seasonality and other factors associated with the airline industry.

Due to greater demand for air travel during the spring and summer months, revenues in the airline industry in the second and third quarters of the year
are generally stronger than revenues in the first and fourth quarters of the year, which are periods of lower travel demand. The Company’s results of operations generally reflect this seasonality, but have also been impacted by numerous other
factors that are not necessarily seasonal including, among others, the imposition of excise and similar taxes, extreme or severe weather, ATC congestion, geological events, natural disasters, changes in the competitive environment due to industry
consolidation, general economic conditions and other factors. As a result, the Company’s quarterly operating results are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire year and historical operating results in a quarterly or
annual period are not necessarily indicative of future operating results.

The Company may never realize the full value of its
intangible assets or its long-lived assets causing it to record impairments that may negatively affect its financial position and results of operations.

In accordance with applicable accounting standards, the Company is required to test its indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if conditions indicate that
an impairment may have occurred. In addition, the Company is required to test certain of its other assets for impairment if conditions indicate that an impairment may have occurred.

The Company may be required to recognize impairments in the future due to, among other factors, extreme fuel price volatility, tight credit markets, a decline in the fair value of certain tangible or
intangible assets,



unfavorable trends in historical or forecasted results of operations and cash flows and an uncertain economic environment, as well as other uncertainties. The Company can provide no assurance
that a material impairment charge of tangible or intangible assets will not occur in a future period. The value of the Company’s aircraft could be impacted in future periods by changes in supply and demand for these aircraft. Such changes in
supply and demand for certain aircraft types could result from grounding of aircraft by the Company or other carriers. An impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position and results of operations.

The Company’s ability to use its net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income for U.S. federal income tax
purposes may be significantly limited due to various circumstances, including certain possible future transactions involving the sale or issuance of UAL common stock, or if taxable income does not reach sufficient levels.

As of December 31, 2016, UAL reported consolidated federal net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards of approximately $4.4 billion.

The Company’s ability to use its NOL carryforwards may be limited if it experiences an “ownership change” as defined in
Section 382 (“Section 382”) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. An ownership change generally occurs if certain stockholders increase their aggregate percentage ownership of a corporation’s stock by more than 50
percentage points over their lowest percentage ownership at any time during the testing period, which is generally the three-year period preceding any potential ownership change.

There is no assurance that the Company will not experience a future ownership change under Section 382 that may significantly limit or possibly eliminate its ability to use its NOL carryforwards.
Potential future transactions involving the sale or issuance of UAL common stock, including the exercise of conversion options under the terms of any convertible debt that UAL may issue in the future, the repurchase of such debt with UAL common
stock, any issuance of UAL common stock for cash, and the acquisition or disposition of such stock by a stockholder owning 5% or more of UAL common stock, or a combination of such transactions, may increase the possibility that the Company will
experience a future ownership change under Section 382.

Under Section 382, a future ownership change would subject the Company to
additional annual limitations that apply to the amount of

pre-ownership

change NOLs that may be used to offset post-ownership change taxable income. This limitation is generally determined by multiplying the
value of a corporation’s stock immediately before the ownership change by the applicable long-term

tax-exempt

rate. Any unused annual limitation may, subject to certain limits, be carried over to later
years, and the limitation may under certain circumstances be increased by

built-in

gains in the assets held by such corporation at the time of the ownership change. This limitation could cause the
Company’s U.S. federal income taxes to be greater, or to be paid earlier, than they otherwise would be, and could cause all or a portion of the Company’s NOL carryforwards to expire unused. Similar rules and limitations may apply for state
income tax purposes. The Company’s ability to use its NOL carryforwards will also depend on the amount of taxable income it generates in future periods. Its NOL carryforwards may expire before the Company can generate sufficient taxable income
to use them in full.

Our significant investments in airlines in other parts of the world and the commercial relationships that we have
with those carriers may not produce the returns or results we expect.

An important part of our strategy to expand our global network
includes making significant investments in airlines in other parts of the world and expanding our commercial relationships with these carriers. In 2015, we made a $100 million investment in Azul Linhas Aéreas Brasileiras S.A.
(“Azul”) and enhanced our commercial arrangements with Azul. We expect to continue exploring similar

non-controlling

investments in, and entering into joint ventures, commercial agreements, loan
transactions and strategic alliances with, other carriers as part of our global business strategy. These transactions and relationships (including our strategic partnership with, and investment in, Azul) involve significant challenges and risks,
including that we may not realize a satisfactory return on our investment, that we may not receive repayment of invested funds, that they may distract



management from our operations or that they may not generate the expected revenue synergies. These events could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition.

In addition, we are dependent on these other carriers for significant aspects of our network in the regions in which they operate. While we
work closely with these carriers, we do not have control over their operations or business methods. We may be subject to consequences from any improper behavior of joint venture partners, including for failure to comply with anti-corruption laws
such as the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Furthermore, our relationships with these carriers may be subject to the laws and regulations of

non-U.S.

jurisdictions in which these carriers are
located or conduct business. Any political or regulatory change in these jurisdictions that negatively impact or prohibit our arrangements with these carriers could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. To the
extent that the operations of any of these carriers are disrupted over an extended period of time or their actions subject us to the consequences of failure to comply with laws and regulations, our results of operations may be adversely affected.

Firm Order and Option Aircraft

As of December 31, 2016, United had firm commitments
and options to purchase aircraft from Boeing, Embraer and Airbus presented in the table below:

Aircraft Type

Commitments
(a)

Airbus A350-1000

Boeing

777-300ER


Boeing

787-8/-9/-10


Embraer E175


(a) United also has options and purchase rights for additional aircraft.

In 2016, United announced a modification to its then-existing narrow body order book by converting its original order for
65 Boeing

737-700

aircraft into four

737-800s

to be delivered in 2017 and 61 Boeing 737MAX aircraft with delivery dates to be determined.

The aircraft listed in the table above are scheduled for delivery from 2017 through 2027. In 2017, United expects to take delivery of four Boeing 737NG
aircraft, three Boeing

787-9

aircraft, 12 Boeing

777-300ER

aircraft, 24 Embraer aircraft and six used Airbus A319s. In addition, up to 14 additional used Airbus
A319s may be delivered between 2018 and 2021, subject to certain conditions. To the extent the Company and the aircraft manufacturers with whom the Company has existing orders for new aircraft agree to modify the contracts governing those orders,
the amount and timing of the Company’s future capital commitments could change. See Notes 11 and 15 to the financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information.

Facilities

United’s principal
facilities relate to leases of airport facilities, gates, hangar sites, terminal buildings and other facilities in the municipalities it serves. United has major terminal facility leases at SFO, Washington Dulles, Chicago O’Hare, LAX, Denver,
Newark, Houston Bush, Hopkins International Airport and Guam with expiration dates ranging from 2018 to 2041. Substantially all of these facilities are leased on a

net-rental

basis, resulting in the
Company’s responsibility for maintenance, insurance and other facility-related expenses and services.

United also maintains
administrative offices, catering, cargo, training facilities, maintenance facilities and other facilities to support operations in the cities served. United also has multiple leases, which expire from 2017 through 2029 for its principal executive
office and operations center in downtown Chicago, and certain administrative offices in downtown Houston.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

On June 30,
2015, UAL received a Civil Investigative Demand (“CID”) from the Antitrust Division of the DOJ seeking documents and information from the Company in connection with a DOJ investigation related to statements and decisions about airline
capacity. The Company is working with the DOJ and has completed its response to the CID. The Company is not able to predict what action, if any, might be taken in the future by the DOJ or other governmental authorities as a result of the
investigation. Beginning on July 1, 2015, subsequent to the announcement of the CID, UAL and United were named as defendants in multiple class action lawsuits that



asserted claims under the Sherman Antitrust Act, which have been consolidated in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The complaints generally allege collusion among
U.S. airlines on capacity impacting airfares and seek treble damages. The Company intends to vigorously defend against the class action lawsuits.

On October 13, 2015, United received a CID from the Civil Division of the DOJ. The CID requested documents and oral testimony from United in connection with an industry-wide DOJ investigation
related to delivery scan and other data purportedly required for payment for the carriage of mail under United’s International Commercial Air Contracts with the United States Postal Service. The Company has been responding to the DOJ’s
request and cooperating in the investigation since that time. On November 8, 2016, the DOJ Criminal Division met with representatives from the Company and advised they are conducting an industry-wide investigation into the same matter. The
Company is also cooperating with the government in this aspect of their investigation and on December 21, 2016 representatives from the Company met with both the Civil and Criminal Divisions to provide additional information. The Company cannot
predict what action, if any, might be taken in the future by the DOJ or other governmental authorities as a result of these investigations.

As
disclosed in the Company’s prior two Annual Reports on Form

10-K

for fiscal years 2014 and 2015, the Company and certain of its current and former executive officers and employees received federal grand
jury subpoenas requesting records and testimony related to certain individuals formerly associated with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and related operations of the Company. As announced on September 8, 2015, certain of the
Company’s executives stepped down in connection with its related internal investigation. The Company cooperated with the investigation by the USAO in respect of the Port Authority matter and, as announced on July 14, 2016, the Company
reached a resolution in the form of a

Non-Prosecution

Agreement with the USAO. As announced on December 2, 2016, the Company also resolved the previously disclosed related investigation by the SEC in
respect of the Port Authority matter.

Other Legal Proceedings

The Company is involved in various other claims and legal actions involving passengers, customers, suppliers, employees and government agencies arising in the ordinary course of business. Additionally,
from time to time, the Company becomes aware of potential

non-compliance

with applicable environmental regulations, which have either been identified by the Company (through internal compliance programs such
as its environmental compliance audits) or through notice from a governmental entity. In some instances, these matters could potentially become the subject of an administrative or judicial proceeding and could potentially involve monetary sanctions.
After considering a number of factors, including (but not limited to) the views of legal counsel, the nature of contingencies to which the Company is subject and prior experience, management believes that the ultimate disposition of these other
claims and legal actions will not materially affect its consolidated financial position or results of operations. However, the ultimate resolutions of these matters are inherently unpredictable. As such, the Company’s financial condition
and results of operations could be adversely affected in any particular period by the unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters.

Based on reports by the Company’s transfer agent for UAL common stock, as of February 13, 2017, there were 8,049
holders of record of UAL common stock.

UAL did not pay any dividends in 2016 or 2015. Under the restricted payment provisions of the
Company’s Credit and Guaranty Agreement, dated as of March 27, 2013 (the “Credit Agreement”), and certain indentures, UAL’s ability to pay dividends on or repurchase UAL’s common stock is subject to limits on the amount
of such payments and to certain conditions, including that no default or event of default exists under those instruments and that after giving effect to the making of any such payments, UAL would be in compliance with a minimum fixed charge coverage
ratio. Any future determination regarding dividend or distribution payments will be at the discretion of the UAL Board of Directors, subject to the foregoing limits and applicable limitations under Delaware law.

United paid dividends of $2.6 billion and $1.2 billion to UAL in 2016 and 2015, respectively.

The following graph shows the cumulative total stockholder return for UAL’s common stock during the period from December 31, 2011 to
December 31, 2016. The graph also shows the cumulative returns of the Standard and Poor’s (“S&P”) 500 Index and the NYSE Arca Airline Index (“AAI”) of 15 investor-owned airlines. The comparison assumes $100 was
invested on December 31, 2011 in UAL common stock.



Note:

The stock price performance shown in the graph above should not be considered indicative of
potential future stock price performance. The foregoing performance graph is being furnished as part of this report solely in accordance with the requirement under Rule

14a-3(b)(9)

to furnish our stockholders
with such information, and therefore, shall not be deemed to be filed or incorporated by reference into any filings by the Company under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act.

(a) In 2016, UAL repurchased approximately 50 million shares of UAL common stock for $2.6 billion. In July 2016,
UAL’s Board of Directors authorized a $2 billion share repurchase program to acquire UAL’s common stock. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had approximately $1.8 billion remaining to purchase shares under its share
repurchase program. UAL may repurchase shares through the open market, privately negotiated transactions, block trades or accelerated share repurchase transactions from time to time in accordance with applicable securities laws.

(b) The table does not include shares withheld from employees to satisfy certain tax obligations due upon the vesting of restricted stock units. The
United Continental Holdings, Inc. 2008 Incentive Compensation Plan provides for the withholding of shares to satisfy tax obligations due upon the vesting of restricted stock units. However, this plan does not specify a maximum number of shares that
may be withheld for this purpose. A total of 502 shares were withheld under this plan in the fourth quarter of 2016 at an average share price of $62.50. These shares of common stock withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations may be deemed to be
“issuer purchases” of shares that are required to be disclosed pursuant to this Item.

(c) Average price paid per share is calculated
on a settlement basis and excludes commission.

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

Overview

United Continental Holdings,
Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, “UAL” or the “Company”) is a holding company and its principal, wholly-owned subsidiary is United Airlines, Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries,
“United”). As UAL consolidates United for financial statement purposes, disclosures that relate to activities of United also apply to UAL, unless otherwise noted. United’s operating revenues and operating expenses comprise nearly 100%
of UAL’s revenues and operating expenses. In addition, United comprises approximately the entire balance of UAL’s assets, liabilities and operating cash flows. When appropriate, UAL and United are named specifically for their individual
contractual obligations and related disclosures and any significant differences between the operations and results of UAL and United are separately disclosed and explained. We sometimes use the words “we,” “our,” “us,”
and the “Company” in this report for disclosures that relate to all of UAL and United.

2016 Financial Highlights

•

2016 net income was $2.3 billion, or $6.85 diluted earnings per share.

•

United’s consolidated PRASM decreased 5.4% in 2016 compared to 2015.

•

Aircraft fuel cost decreased 23% year-over-year due mainly to lower fuel prices.

•

2016 CASM decreased 2.9% year-over-year on a consolidated capacity increase of 1.4%.

•

In 2016, UAL repurchased approximately 50 million shares of UAL common stock for $2.6 billion. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had
approximately $1.8 billion remaining to purchase shares under its share repurchase program.

•

UAL ended the year with $5.8 billion in unrestricted liquidity, which consisted of unrestricted cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and
available capacity under the revolving credit facility of the Company’s Credit Agreement.

Operational Highlights

•

Consolidated RPMs for 2016 increased 0.8% as compared to 2015, and consolidated ASMs increased 1.4% from the prior year, resulting in a consolidated
load factor of 82.9% in 2016 versus 83.4% in 2015.

•

For 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded a DOT

on-time

arrival rate of 81.3% and 78.1%, respectively, and a
system completion factor of 99.0% and 98.7%, respectively.

•

The Company took delivery of five new Boeing

787-9

Dreamliners, eight new Boeing

737-900ERs,

seven new Boeing

737-800s,

two new Boeing

777-300ERs

and six used Airbus A319s. United exited from scheduled service
four Boeing

757-200s,

16 Embraer ERJ 145s and two Boeing

747-400s.

The Company took delivery of the first Boeing

777-300ER

in the
Company’s fleet, named the “New Spirit of United,” featuring the

all-new

United Polaris business class seat.

•

The Company introduced new products to its industry-leading existing portfolio of products such as United Polaris service and announced Basic Economy
fares which will expand its customers’ options.

•

During 2016, the Company reached new agreements with every domestic unionized work group.

Outlook

Set forth below
is a discussion of the principal matters that we believe could impact our financial and operating performance and cause our results of operations in future periods to differ materially from our historical



operating results and/or from our anticipated results of operations described in the forward-looking statements in this report. See Part I, Item 1A., Risk Factors, of this report and the factors
described under “Forward-Looking Information” below for additional discussion of these and other factors that could affect us.

The
Company is committed to improving the efficiency and quality of all aspects of its business in 2017. In order to continue improving operational performance in 2017, our top focus will be on further improvements in completion factor, departure
performance and baggage handling.

As outlined at our 2016 Investor Day presentation, the Company expects to drive significant incremental
value by 2020 relative to 2015. United anticipates capturing this value through a variety of initiatives including a

re-fleeting

and upgauge program, additional customer choice through segmentation,
improvements to the revenue management systems, ongoing sensible cost management, realizing our full network potential through improved schedule quality and enhancements to the MileagePlus program. In addition, the Company will continue to focus on
improving reliability while increasing the efficiency of the operation.

Economic Conditions.

The economic outlook for the
aviation industry in 2017 is characterized by moderate U.S. and global economic growth. In such conditions, we expect a moderate increase in the demand for air travel. Continuing economic uncertainty, along with the strengthening U.S. dollar, is
providing uncertainty in key Asian, South American and European markets, and continued political and socioeconomic tensions may result in diminished demand for air travel.

Capacity.

In 2017, the Company expects consolidated ASMs to grow between 1% and 2% year-over-year.

Fuel.

The Company’s average aircraft fuel price per gallon including related taxes was $1.49 in 2016 as compared to $1.94 in 2015. Since 2014, the price of jet fuel has declined
and remains volatile. Based on projected fuel consumption in 2017, a one dollar change in the price of a barrel of crude oil would change the Company’s annual fuel expense by approximately $95 million.

Labor.

As of December 31, 2016, United had approximately 80% of employees represented by unions. In 2016, United reached contract
extensions with its pilots and dispatchers, amended collective bargaining agreements with its IAM represented employees, reached a five-year contract with the AFA covering all of its flight attendants and reached a

six-year

contract with the IBT covering its technicians and related employees. Additionally, the Company will be increasing pay for its pilots in order to align with a recently implemented contract of another
airline. The costs associated with all these agreements is expected to add approximately $900 million of costs for full-year 2017. The Company cannot predict the outcome of future negotiations with its unionized employee groups. Increases in
the pay and benefits resulting from new collective bargaining agreements could have a material financial impact on the Company.

Consolidated passenger revenue decreased $1.3 billion, or 4.1%, in 2016 as
compared to 2015. Consolidated PRASM decreased 5.4% in 2016 as compared to 2015. The decline in PRASM was driven by factors including a competitive domestic fare environment, lower surcharges, a strong U.S. dollar and reductions from energy-related
corporate travel.

Cargo revenue decreased $61 million, or 6.5%, in 2016 as compared to 2015 due to lower freight yields and lower mail
volumes year-over-year, partially offset by an increase in freight volumes. Freight yields were negatively impacted as air freighter competitors increased capacity in response to lower fuel prices. Another contributing factor to the year-over-year
decrease was a U.S. West Coast port labor dispute that resulted in an increase in air freight results in the first quarter of 2015. The labor dispute was resolved during the first quarter of 2015.

Salaries and related costs increased $562 million, or 5.8%, in 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily due to higher pay
rates and benefit expenses driven by new and extended collective bargaining agreements, an increase in employee incentive expenses due to improvements in operational performance and a 2.2% increase in average full-time equivalent employees,
partially offset by a reduction in profit sharing expense in 2016 as compared to 2015, a reduction in medical and dental costs and the results of certain costs savings initiatives in 2016.

The decrease in aircraft fuel expense was primarily attributable to decreased fuel prices and a reduction in fuel hedge losses, partially offset by the impact of a 1.4% increase in capacity. 2016 fuel
expense includes the benefit of a $20 million fuel tax refund. The table below presents the significant changes in aircraft fuel cost per gallon for the year ended December 31 (in millions, except percentage changes):

Depreciation and amortization increased $158 million, or 8.7%, in 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily due to additions
of new aircraft, conversions of operating leases to capital leases, aircraft improvements, accelerated depreciation of certain assets related to several fleet types and increases in information technology assets.

Aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs increased $98 million, or 5.9%, in 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily due to a year-over-year
increase in airframe maintenance visits as a result of the cyclical timing of these visits and volume-driven increases in component costs, partially offset by a reduction in costs due to the timing of maintenance on certain engines.

Aircraft rent decreased $74 million, or 9.8%, in 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily due to lease expirations, the purchase or capital lease
conversion of several operating leased aircraft and lower lease renewal rates for certain aircraft.

See Note 16 to the financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information.

Other operating expenses increased $343 million, or 6.8%, in 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily due to increases in ground handling costs, food and
technology costs associated with the Company’s enhanced customer experience initiatives, rate-driven increases in hotel expenses for crews, increases in marketing expenses related to the 2016 Summer Olympics and volume-driven increases in cargo
costs.

The decrease in interest expense of $55 million, or 8.2%, in 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily due to the
prepayment of certain debt issuances in 2015 and declining balances of other debt, partially offset by interest expense on debt issued for the acquisition of new aircraft, the conversion of certain operating leases to capital leases and certain
constructed airport assets accounted for as capital leases.

In 2015, Miscellaneous, net included losses of $80 million from fuel
derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting. Foreign currency losses were approximately $43 million and $129 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Foreign currency results included $8 million and $61 million of foreign
exchange losses for 2016 and 2015, respectively, related to the Company’s cash holdings in Venezuela. Miscellaneous, net for 2015 also includes a $134 million special charge related to the

write-off

of unamortized

non-cash

debt discounts for the early redemption of the 6% Notes due 2026 (the “2026 Notes”) and the 6% Notes due 2028 (the “2028 Notes”).

Consolidated passenger revenue in 2015 decreased $977 million, or
2.9%, as compared to 2014 primarily due to a decrease in consolidated yield of 4.3% year-over-year. Yields were impacted by a competitive domestic fare environment, unfavorable foreign currency results due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar,
international surcharge declines, travel reductions from corporate customers in the energy sector and increased industry capacity in certain regions. The decline in yields was partially offset by a 1.5% year-over-year increase in traffic.

$463 million increase in profit sharing costs as a result of improved profitability, higher pay rates driven by new collective bargaining agreements, an increase in medical and dental costs and an increase in pension expense resulting from
changes in actuarial assumptions.

The decrease in aircraft fuel expense was primarily attributable to decreased fuel prices partially offset
by losses from fuel hedging activity and a 1.6% increase in capacity. The table below presents the significant changes in aircraft fuel cost per gallon for the year ended December 31 (in millions, except percentage changes):

Depreciation and amortization increased $140 million, or 8.3%, in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to additions
in owned property and equipment, specifically related to new aircraft, information technology assets and several aircraft capital lease conversions from operating leases.

Aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs decreased $128 million, or 7.2%, in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to a year-over-year decrease in significant airframe maintenance visits
as a result of the cyclical timing of these visits, improvements in the efficiency of

in-house

maintenance programs, a reduced volume of seat and landing gear maintenance and a reduction of flying hours under
certain

power-by-the-hour

engine maintenance agreements, partially offset by increases in expenses related to aircraft
reliability projects and

Wi-Fi

systems maintenance.

Aircraft rent decreased $129 million or 14.6%
in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to lease expirations, the purchase or capital lease conversion of several operating leased aircraft and lower lease renewal rates for certain aircraft.

Miscellaneous, net included losses of $80 million and $462 million from fuel derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Foreign currency losses were
approximately $129 million and $41 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Foreign currency results included $61 million and $10 million of foreign exchange losses for 2015 and 2014, respectively, related to the Company’s

Liquidity and Capital Resources

As of December 31, 2016, the Company had $4.4 billion in unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, a decrease of $0.8 billion from December 31, 2015. The Company
had its entire commitment capacity of $1.35 billion under the Credit Agreement available for letters of credit or borrowings as of December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had $124 million of restricted cash and
cash equivalents, which is primarily collateral for letters of credit and estimated future workers’ compensation claims. We may be required to post significant additional cash collateral to provide security for obligations. Restricted cash and
cash equivalents at December 31, 2015 totaled $206 million.

We have a significant amount of fixed obligations, including debt,
aircraft leases and financings, leases of airport property and other facilities and pension funding obligations. At December 31, 2016, the Company had



approximately $11.7 billion of debt and capital lease obligations, including $1.0 billion that are due within the next 12 months. In addition, we have substantial noncancelable
commitments for capital expenditures, including the acquisition of new aircraft and related spare engines. As of December 31, 2016, our current liabilities exceeded our current assets by approximately $5.0 billion. However, approximately
$5.9 billion of our current liabilities are related to our advance ticket sales and frequent flyer deferred revenue, both of which largely represent revenue to be recognized for travel in the near future and not actual cash outlays. The deficit
in working capital does not have an adverse impact to our cash flows, liquidity or operations. The Company made principal payments of debt and capital lease obligations totaling $1.4 billion in 2016.

The Company will continue to evaluate opportunities to prepay its debt, including open market repurchases, to reduce its indebtedness and related
interest.

For 2017, the Company expects between $4.2 billion and $4.4 billion of gross capital expenditures. See Notes 11 and 15 to
the financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information on commitments.

As of December 31, 2016, a
substantial portion of the Company’s assets, principally aircraft, route authorities, airport slots and loyalty program intangible assets, was pledged under various loan and other agreements. We must sustain our profitability and/or access the
capital markets to meet our significant long-term debt and capital lease obligations and future commitments for capital expenditures, including the acquisition of aircraft and related spare engines. See Note 11 to the financial statements included
in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information on assets provided as collateral by the Company.

The following is a discussion of
the Company’s sources and uses of cash from 2014 through 2016.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities

2016 compared to 2015

Cash flow provided
by operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $5.5 billion compared to $6.0 billion in the same period in 2015. Working capital changes reduced cash flow from operations by $0.5 billion year-over-year in 2016 as compared
to 2015. The following were significant working capital items in 2016:

•

Frequent flyer and advance purchase of miles decreased $0.6 billion due to increased utilization of

pre-purchased

miles.

•

Other assets, including spare parts, increased by $0.3 billion as part of the Company’s efforts to improve fleet reliability.

•

Accounts payable increased $0.2 billion, driven by the timing of payments.

2015 compared to 2014

Cash flow
provided by operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $6.0 billion compared to $2.6 billion in the same period in 2014. The $3.4 billion increase is primarily attributable to an increase of $3.1 billion in income
before income taxes and a $0.4 billion increase in

non-cash

items for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the same period in 2014. Working capital changes reduced cash flow from
operations by $0.1 billion year-over-year in 2015 as compared to 2014. The following were significant working capital items in 2015:

•

Cash flow increased by $0.2 billion from the return of hedge collateral net of the impact of changes in fuel derivative positions.

•

Other liabilities, including accrued wages, decreased $0.2 billion, which included $0.8 billion in pension contributions offset by
$0.7 billion in profit sharing accruals.

•

Frequent flyer deferred revenue and advanced purchase of miles decreased $0.2 billion.



Cash Flows from Investing Activities

2016 compared to 2015

The Company’s capital expenditures were $3.2 billion and
$2.7 billion in 2016

and 2015, respectively. The Company’s capital expenditures for both years were primarily attributable to the purchase of aircraft, facility and fleet-related costs and the purchase of information technology
assets.

2015 compared to 2014

The Company’s capital expenditures were $2.7 billion and $2.0 billion in 2015

and 2014, respectively. The Company’s capital
expenditures for both years were primarily attributable to the purchase of aircraft, facility and fleet-related costs. In 2015, the Company announced a strategic partnership with Azul. Through a wholly-owned subsidiary, the Company invested
$100 million for an economic stake of approximately five percent in Azul, Brazil’s largest carrier by cities served, which provides a range of customer benefits including codesharing of flights, joint loyalty program participation and
expanded connection opportunities on routes between the U.S. and Brazil, a key market for United, in addition to other points in North and South America.

Cash Flows from Financing Activities

Significant financing events in 2016 were as
follows:

Share Repurchases

The Company used $2.6 billion of cash to purchase 50 million shares of its common stock during 2016 under its share repurchase programs. As of December 31, 2016, the Company has
$1.8 billion remaining to spend under its share repurchase program.

Debt Issuances

In 2016, United completed two enhanced equipment trust certificate (“EETC”) offerings for a total principal amount of
$2.0 billion. Of the $2.0 billion, United received and recorded $708 million of proceeds as debt as of December 31, 2016 to finance the purchase of 17 aircraft. United expects to receive all proceeds from the pass-through trusts
by the end of the second quarter of 2017.

In 2016, United borrowed approximately $369 million aggregate principal amount
from various financial institutions to finance the purchase of several aircraft delivered in 2016.

Debt and Capital Lease Principal
Payments

During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company made debt and capital lease principal payments of $1.4 billion.

Significant financing events in 2015 were as follows:

Share Repurchases

21 million shares of its common stock during 2015 under its share repurchase programs.

Debt Issuances

During 2015, United issued $1.4 billion of debt related to EETC offerings to finance aircraft.

In 2015, United borrowed approximately $590 million aggregate principal amount from various financial institutions to finance the
purchase of several aircraft delivered in 2015.



Debt and Capital Lease Principal Payments

During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company made debt and capital lease principal payments of $2.3 billion, including the following prepayments:

•

Contractual Obligations.

The Company’s business is capital intensive, requiring significant amounts of
capital to fund the acquisition of assets, particularly aircraft. In the past, the Company has funded the acquisition of aircraft through outright purchase, by issuing debt, by entering into capital or operating leases, or through vendor financings.
The Company also often enters into long-term lease commitments with airports to ensure access to terminal, cargo, maintenance and other required facilities.

The table below provides a summary of the Company’s material contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016 (in billions):

(a)

Long-term debt presented in the Company’s financial statements is net of $124 million of debt discount, premiums and debt issuance costs which are being
amortized over the debt terms. Contractual payments are not net of the debt discount, premiums and debt issuance costs.

(b)

Includes interest portion of capital lease obligations of $67 million in 2017, $57 million in 2018, $50 million in 2019, $47 million in 2020,
$44 million in 2021 and $339 million thereafter. Future interest payments on variable rate debt are estimated using estimated future variable rates based on a yield curve.



(c)

Represents our estimates of future minimum noncancelable commitments under our CPAs and does not include the portion of the underlying obligations for aircraft and
facility rent that is disclosed as part of aircraft and nonaircraft operating leases. Amounts also exclude a portion of United’s capital lease obligation recorded for certain of its CPAs. See Note 13 to the financial statements included in
Part II, Item 8 of this report for the significant assumptions used to estimate the payments.

(d)

Amounts represent postretirement benefit payments, net of subsidy receipts, through 2026. Benefit payments approximate plan contributions as plans are substantially
unfunded.

(e)

Represents estimate of the minimum funding requirements as determined by government regulations for United’s material pension plans. Amounts are subject to change
based on numerous assumptions, including the performance of assets in the plan and bond rates. See Critical Accounting Policies, below, for a discussion of our current year assumptions regarding United’s pension plans.

(f)

Represents contractual commitments for firm order aircraft, spare engines and other capital purchase commitments. See Note 15 to the financial statements included in
Part II, Item 8 of this report for a discussion of our purchase commitments.

Off-Balance

Sheet Arrangements.

An

off-balance

sheet
arrangement is any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has (1) made guarantees, (2) a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets, (3) an
obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity, or (4) any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support, or that engages
in leasing, hedging or research and development arrangements. The Company’s primary

off-balance

sheet arrangements include operating leases, which are summarized in the contractual obligations table in

Contractual Obligations,

above,

and certain municipal bond obligations, as discussed below.

As of December 31, 2016, United
had cash collateralized $72 million of letters of credit. United also had $383 million of surety bonds securing various obligations at December 31, 2016. Most of the letters of credit have evergreen clauses and are expected to be
renewed on an annual basis and the surety bonds have expiration dates through 2021.

As of December 31, 2016, United is the guarantor of
approximately $1.9 billion in aggregate principal amount of

tax-exempt

special facilities revenue bonds and interest thereon. These bonds, issued by various airport municipalities, are payable solely
from rentals paid under long-term agreements with the respective governing bodies. The leasing arrangements associated with a majority of these obligations are accounted for as operating leases. The leasing arrangements associated with a portion of
these obligations are accounted for as capital leases. The annual lease payments for those obligations accounted for as operating leases are included in the operating lease payments in the contractual obligations table above.

As of December 31, 2016, United is the guarantor of $168 million of aircraft mortgage debt issued by one of United’s regional carriers. The
aircraft mortgage debt is subject to increased cost provisions and the Company would potentially be responsible for those costs under the guarantees. The increased cost provisions in the $168 million of aircraft mortgage debt are similar to
those in certain of the Company’s debt agreements. See Note 15 to the financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information on increased cost provisions related to the Company’s debt.

EETCs.

In June 2016 and September 2016, United completed two separate EETC offerings for a total principal amount of $2.0 billion.
United has received and recorded $708 million of the proceeds from these offerings as debt as of December 31, 2016. See Notes 11 and 14 to the financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information on
EETC pass-through trusts and variable interest entity consideration.

Increased Cost Provisions.

See Note 15 to the financial
statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information on increased cost provisions related to the Company’s debt.

Fuel Consortia.

United participates in numerous fuel consortia with other air carriers at major airports to reduce the costs of fuel distribution and storage. Interline agreements
govern the rights and responsibilities of the consortia members and provide for the allocation of the overall costs to operate the consortia based on usage. The consortia (and in limited cases, the participating carriers) have entered into long-term
agreements to lease certain airport fuel storage and distribution facilities that are typically financed through

tax-exempt

bonds (either special facilities lease revenue bonds or general airport revenue
bonds), issued by various local municipalities. In general, each consortium lease agreement requires the consortium to make lease payments in amounts sufficient



to pay the maturing principal and interest payments on the bonds. As of December 31, 2016, approximately $1.5 billion principal amount of such bonds were secured by significant fuel
facility leases in which United participates, as to which United and each of the signatory airlines has provided indirect guarantees of the debt. As of December 31, 2016, the Company’s contingent exposure was approximately
$234 million principal amount of such bonds based on its recent consortia participation. The Company’s contingent exposure could increase if the participation of other air carriers decreases. The guarantees will expire when the

tax-exempt

bonds are paid in full, which ranges from 2017 to 2049. The Company did not record a liability at the time these indirect guarantees were made. See Note 15 to the financial statements included in Part II,
Item 8 of this report for additional information related to the Company’s fuel consortia.

Critical Accounting Policies

Critical accounting policies are defined as those that are affected by significant judgments and uncertainties which potentially could
result in materially different accounting under different assumptions and conditions. The Company has prepared the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”),
which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The Company has identified the
following critical accounting policies that impact the preparation of the financial statements.

Revenue Recognition.

The Company
records passenger ticket sales and tickets sold by other airlines for use on United as passenger revenue when the transportation is provided or upon estimated breakage. The value of unused passenger tickets is included in current liabilities as
Advance ticket sales. Tickets sold by other airlines are recorded at the estimated values to be billed to the other airlines. Differences between amounts billed and the actual amounts may be rejected and rebilled or written off if the amount
recorded was different from the original estimate. When necessary, the Company records a reserve against its interline billings and payables if historical experience indicates that these amounts are different.

Non-refundable

tickets generally expire on the date of the intended flight, unless the date is extended by notification from the customer on or before the intended flight date.

Fees charged in association with changes or extensions to

non-refundable

tickets are recorded as other revenue at
the time the fee is incurred. The fare on the changed ticket, including any additional collection of fare, is deferred and recognized in accordance with our transportation revenue recognition policy at the time the transportation is provided. Change
fees related to

non-refundable

tickets are considered a separate transaction from the air transportation because they represent a charge for the Company’s additional service to modify a previous sale.
Therefore, the pricing of the change fee and the initial customer order are separately determined and represent distinct earnings processes.

The Company records an estimate of breakage revenue on the flight date for tickets that will expire unused. These estimates are based on the evaluation of
actual historical results and forecasted trends. Refundable tickets expire after one year from the date of issuance.

The Financial Accounting
Standards Board (“FASB”) amended the FASB Accounting Standards Codification and created a new Topic 606,

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

. This amendment prescribes that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer
of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The amendment supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605,

Revenue Recognition,

and most industry-specific guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the Accounting Standards Codification. The Company currently plans to use the full-retrospective approach in adopting this standard on January 1,
2018. Under the new standard, certain airline ancillary fees directly related to passenger revenue tickets, such as ticket change fees and baggage fees, are likely to no longer be considered distinct performance obligations separate from the
passenger travel component. In addition, the ticket change fees which were previously recognized when received and booking fees when paid, will likely be recognized when transportation is provided. The Company



has previously recorded ancillary fees and change fees in other operating revenue but will record these in passenger revenue under the new standard. The Company is evaluating other possible
impacts from the new standard on its consolidated financial statements.

Frequent Flyer Accounting.

The Company’s
MileagePlus program is designed to increase customer loyalty. Program participants earn miles by flying on United and certain other participating airlines. Program participants can also earn miles through purchases from other

non-airline

partners that participate in the Company’s loyalty program. We sell miles to these partners, which include credit card issuers, retail merchants, hotels, car rental companies and our participating
airline partners. Miles can be redeemed for free (other than taxes and government imposed fees), discounted or upgraded air travel and

non-travel

awards. The Company records its obligation for future award
redemptions using a deferred revenue model.

When frequent flyers earn miles for flights, the Company recognizes a portion of the ticket sales
as revenue when the air transportation occurs and defers a portion of the ticket sale representing the value of the related miles as a multiple-deliverable revenue arrangement. The Company determines the estimated selling price of air transportation
and miles as if each element is sold on a separate basis. The total consideration from each ticket sale is then allocated to each of these elements, individually, on a pro rata basis. The miles are recorded in Frequent flyer deferred revenue on the
Company’s consolidated balance sheet and recognized into revenue when the transportation is provided.

The Company’s estimated
selling price of miles is based on an equivalent ticket value less fulfillment discount, which incorporates the expected redemption of miles, as the best estimate of selling price for these miles. The equivalent ticket value is based on the prior 12
months’ weighted average equivalent ticket value of similar fares as those used to settle award redemptions while taking into consideration such factors as redemption pattern, cabin class, loyalty status and geographic region. The estimated
selling price of miles is adjusted by a fulfillment discount that considers a number of factors, including redemption patterns of various customer groups.

United has a significant contract to sell MileagePlus miles to its

co-branded

credit card partner, Chase. United identified the following significant revenue
elements in its Second Amended and Restated

Co-Branded

Card Marketing Services Agreement (the

“Co-Brand

Agreement”): the air transportation element represented
by the value of the mile (generally resulting from its redemption for future air transportation and whose fair value is described above); use of the United brand and access to MileagePlus member lists; advertising; and other travel related benefits.

The fair value of the elements is determined using management’s estimated selling price of each element. The objective of using the
estimated selling price based methodology is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand-alone basis. Accordingly, we determine our best estimate of selling price by considering multiple
inputs and methods including, but not limited to, discounted cash flows, brand value, volume discounts, published selling prices, number of miles awarded and number of miles redeemed. The Company estimated the selling prices and volumes over the
term of the

Co-Brand

Agreement in order to determine the allocation of proceeds to each of the multiple elements to be delivered. We also evaluate volumes on an annual basis, which may result in a change in
the allocation of estimated selling price on a prospective basis.

The Company records passenger revenue related to the air transportation
element when the transportation is delivered. The other elements are generally recognized as Other operating revenue when earned.

The Company
accounts for miles sold and awarded that will never be redeemed by program members, which we refer to as breakage. The Company reviews its breakage estimates annually based upon the latest available information regarding redemption and expiration
patterns. Miles expire after 18 months of member account inactivity. The Company’s estimate of the expected expiration of miles requires significant management judgment. Current and future changes to expiration assumptions or to the expiration
policy, or to program rules and program redemption opportunities, may result in material changes to the deferred revenue balance as well as recognized revenues from the programs.

Long-Lived Assets.

The net book value of operating property and equipment for the Company was
$23 billion and $22 billion at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The assets’ recorded value is impacted by a number of accounting policy elections, including the estimation of useful lives and residual values and, when
necessary, the recognition of asset impairment charges.

The Company records assets acquired, including aircraft, at acquisition cost.
Depreciable life is determined through economic analysis, such as reviewing existing fleet plans, obtaining appraisals and comparing estimated lives to other airlines that operate similar fleets. As aircraft technology has improved, useful life has
increased and the Company has generally estimated the lives of those aircraft to be 30 years. Residual values are estimated based on historical experience with regard to the sale of both aircraft and spare parts and are established in
conjunction with the estimated useful lives of the related fleets. Residual values are based on when the aircraft are acquired and typically reflect asset values that have not reached the end of their physical life. Both depreciable lives and
residual values are revised periodically as facts and circumstances arise to recognize changes in the Company’s fleet plan and other relevant information. A

one-year

increase in the average depreciable
life of the Company’s flight equipment would reduce annual depreciation expense on flight equipment by approximately $57 million.

The Company evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets and intangible assets subject to amortization whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that an impairment may exist. For purposes of this testing, the Company has generally identified the aircraft fleet type as the lowest level of identifiable cash flows for purposes of testing aircraft for impairment. An impairment charge is
recognized when the asset’s carrying value exceeds its net undiscounted future cash flows and its fair market value. The amount of the charge is the difference between the asset’s carrying value and fair market value.

In 2016, the Company determined that the FAA’s action impaired the entire value of its Newark slots because the slots no longer were the mechanism
that governed

take-off

and landing rights, and the Company recorded a special charge to write off the intangible asset. See Notes 16 to the financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for
additional information.

Defined Benefit Plan Accounting.

We sponsor defined benefit pension plans for eligible employees and
retirees. The most critical assumptions impacting our defined benefit pension plan obligations and expenses are the weighted average discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on the plan assets.

United’s pension plans’ under-funded status was $1.9 billion at December 31, 2016. Funding requirements for

tax-qualified

defined benefit pension plans are determined by government regulations. In 2017, we anticipate contributing at least $400 million to our pension plans. The fair value of the plans’ assets was
$3.4 billion at December 31, 2016.

When calculating pension expense for 2017, the Company assumed that its plans’ assets would
generate a long-term rate of return of approximately 7.0%. The expected long-term rate of return assumption was developed based on historical experience and input from the trustee managing the plans’ assets.

The expected long-term
rate of return on plan assets is based on a target allocation of assets, which is based on a goal of earning the highest rate of return while maintaining risk at acceptable levels. Our projected long-term rate of return reflects the active
management of our plans’ assets. The plans strive to have assets sufficiently diversified so that adverse or unexpected results from one security class will not have an unduly detrimental impact on the entire portfolio. Plan
fiduciaries regularly review actual asset allocation and the pension plans’ investments are periodically rebalanced to the targeted allocation when considered appropriate.



The defined benefit pension plans’ assets consist of return generating investments and risk mitigating
investments which are held through direct ownership or through interests in common collective trusts. Return generating investments include primarily equity securities, fixed-income securities and alternative investments (e.g. private equity
and hedge funds). Risk mitigating investments include primarily U.S. government and investment grade corporate fixed-income securities. The allocation of assets was as follows at December 31, 2016:

Percent of Total

Expected Long-Term

Rate of Return

Equity securities

35  %

9.5  %

Fixed-income securities


5.0

Alternatives


7.3

Other


7.0

Pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on plan assets decreases. Lowering the expected long-term
rate of return on plan assets by 50 basis points (from 7.0% to 6.5%) would increase estimated 2017 pension expense by approximately $17 million. Future pension obligations for United’s plans were discounted using a weighted average rate of
4.18% at December 31, 2016. The Company selected the discount rate for substantially all of its plans by using a hypothetical portfolio of high quality bonds at December 31, 2016 that would provide the necessary cash flows to match the
projected benefit payments. The pension liability and future pension expense both increase as the discount rate is reduced. Lowering the discount rate by 50 basis points (from 4.18% to 3.68%) would increase the pension liability at
December 31, 2016 by approximately $575

million and increase the estimated 2017 pension expense by approximately $73 million. Future changes in plan asset returns, plan provisions, assumed discount rates, pension funding law
and various other factors related to the participants in our pension plans will impact our future pension expense and liabilities. We cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be in the future.

Actuarial gains or losses are triggered by changes in assumptions or experience that differ from the original assumptions. Under the applicable accounting
standards for defined benefit pension plans, those gains and losses are not required to be recognized currently as pension benefit expense, but instead may be deferred as part of accumulated other comprehensive income and amortized into expense over
the average remaining service life of the covered active employees. All gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income are amortized to expense over the remaining years of service of the covered active employees. At December 31,
2016 and 2015, the Company had unrecognized actuarial losses for pension benefit plans of $1.5 billion and $844 million, respectively, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income.

Other Postretirement Benefit Plan Accounting.

United’s postretirement plan provides certain health care benefits, primarily in the
United States, to retirees and eligible dependents, as well as certain life insurance benefits to certain retirees reflected as “Other Benefits.” United also has retiree medical programs that permit retirees who meet certain age and
service requirements to continue medical coverage between retirement and Medicare eligibility. Eligible employees are required to pay a portion of the costs of their retiree medical benefits, which in some cases may be offset by accumulated
unused sick time at the time of their retirement. Plan benefits are subject to

co-payments,

deductibles and other limits as described in the plans.

The Company accounts for other postretirement benefits by recognizing the difference between plan assets and obligations, or the plan’s funded status, in its financial statements. Other
postretirement benefit expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees’ approximate service periods and is generally calculated independently of funding decisions or requirements. United has not been required to

pre-fund

its plan obligations, which has resulted in a significant net obligation, as discussed below. The Company’s benefit obligation was $1.7 billion and $2.0 billion for the other postretirement
benefit plans at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.



The calculation of other postretirement benefit expense and obligations requires the use of a number of
assumptions, including the assumed discount rate for measuring future payment obligations and the health care cost trend rate. The Company determines the appropriate discount rate for each of the plans based on current rates on high quality
corporate bonds that would generate the cash flow necessary to pay plan benefits when due. The Company’s weighted average discount rate to determine its benefit obligations as of December 31, 2016 was 4.07%, as compared to 4.49% for
December 31, 2015. The health care cost trend rate assumed for 2016 was 6.75%, declining to 5.0% in 2023, as compared to assumed trend rate for 2017 of 6.50%, declining to 5.0% in 2023. A 1% increase in assumed health care trend rates would
increase the Company’s total service and interest cost for the year ended December 31, 2016 by $13 million; whereas, a 1% decrease in assumed health care trend rates would decrease the Company’s total service and interest cost
for the year ended December 31, 2016 by $11 million. A one percentage point decrease in the weighted average discount rate would increase the Company’s postretirement benefit liability by approximately $181 million and increase
the estimated 2016 benefits expense by approximately $11 million.

Actuarial gains or losses are triggered by changes in assumptions or
experience that differ from the original assumptions and prior service credits result from a retroactive reduction in benefits due under the plans. Under the applicable accounting standards for postretirement welfare benefit plans, actuarial gains
and losses and prior service credits are not required to be recognized currently, but instead may be deferred as part of accumulated other comprehensive income and amortized into expense over the average remaining service life of the covered active
employees or the average life expectancy of inactive participants. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company had unrecognized actuarial gains for postretirement welfare benefit plans of $384 million and $236 million, respectively,
recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income.

Income Taxes.

The Company has a net deferred tax asset totaling
$655 million as of December 31, 2016, including $1.6 billion of federal and state NOL carryforwards and $108 million of alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards, net of a $8 million valuation allowance, which do not
expire. The federal NOL carryforwards will expire beginning in 2026 if unused. In addition, the majority of tax benefits of the state net operating losses of $56 million, net of a $36 million valuation allowance, will expire over a five to

20-year

period. At the end of 2016, the Company maintained a valuation allowance of $68 million against certain state and local NOLs and credit carryforwards which will expire unused due to limited
carryforward periods.

The Company periodically assesses whether it is more likely than not that it will generate sufficient taxable income to
realize its deferred income tax assets. The Company establishes valuation allowances if it is not likely it will realize its deferred income tax assets. In making this determination, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence
and makes certain assumptions. The Company considers, among other things, projected future taxable income, scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, the overall business environment, the Company’s historical financial results and tax
planning strategies. In evaluating the likelihood of utilizing the Company’s net deferred income tax assets, the significant factors that the Company considers include (1) the Company’s recent history and forecasted profitability;
(2) growth in the U.S. and global economies; and (3) future impact of taxable temporary differences. During 2015, after considering all positive and negative evidence and the four sources of taxable income, the Company concluded that its
deferred income tax assets were more likely than not to be realized. Therefore, the Company released almost all of its valuation allowance in 2015, resulting in a $3.1 billion benefit in its provision for income taxes.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.

Interest Rates.

Our net income (loss) is affected by fluctuations in interest rates (e.g. interest expense on variable rate debt and interest income earned on short-term investments). The
Company’s policy is to manage interest rate risk through a combination of fixed and variable rate debt. The following table summarizes information related to the Company’s interest rate market risk at December 31 (in millions):

Impact of 100 basis point increase in market rates on fair value

(340)

(369)

A change in market interest rates would also impact interest income earned on our cash, cash equivalents and short-term
investments. Assuming our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments remain at their average



2016 levels, a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in a corresponding increase in the Company’s interest income of approximately $47 million during 2017.

Commodity Price Risk (Aircraft Fuel).

The price level of aircraft fuel can significantly affect the Company’s operations, results of
operations, financial position and liquidity. Since 2014, the price of jet fuel has declined but remains volatile.

Our operational and
financial results can be significantly impacted by changes in the price and availability of aircraft fuel. To provide adequate supplies of fuel, the Company routinely enters into purchase contracts that are customarily indexed to market prices for
aircraft fuel, and the Company generally has some ability to cover short-term fuel supply and infrastructure disruptions at some major demand locations. The price of aircraft fuel has fluctuated substantially in the past several years and in order
to lower its exposure to unpredictable increases in the market prices of aircraft fuel, the Company has historically hedged a portion of its planned fuel requirements. As of December 31, 2016, the Company did not have any outstanding fuel
hedging contracts. The Company’s current strategy is to not enter into transactions to hedge its fuel consumption, although the Company regularly reviews its policy based on market conditions and other factors. The Company’s 2017
forecasted fuel consumption is presently approximately four billion gallons, and based on this forecast, a one dollar change in the price of a barrel of crude oil would change the Company’s annual fuel expense by approximately $95 million.

Foreign Currency.

The Company generates revenues and incurs expenses in numerous foreign currencies. Changes in foreign currency
exchange rates impact the Company’s results of operations through changes in the dollar value of foreign currency-denominated operating revenues and expenses. Some of the Company’s more significant foreign currency exposures include the
Canadian dollar, Chinese renminbi, European euro, British pound and Japanese yen. The Company’s current strategy is to not enter into transactions to hedge its foreign currency sales, although the Company regularly reviews its policy based on
market conditions and other factors. As of December 31, 2016, the Company did not have any foreign currency derivative contracts outstanding. The last of the Company’s foreign currency derivatives expired in December 2016.

The result of a uniform 10 percent strengthening in the value of the U.S. dollar from December 31, 2016 levels relative to each of the
currencies in which the Company has foreign currency exposure would result in a decrease in

pre-tax

income of approximately $239 million for the year ending December 31, 2017. This sensitivity
analysis was prepared based upon projected 2017 foreign currency-denominated revenues and expenses as of December 31, 2016.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and
Stockholders

United Continental Holdings, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of United Continental Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related statements of
consolidated operations, comprehensive income (loss), cash flows, and stockholders’ equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at
Item 15(a). These financial statements and the financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company at December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016, in conformity
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material
respects, the information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (2013 Framework) and our report dated February 23, 2017, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company at

UNITED CONTINENTAL HOLDINGS, INC.

UNITED AIRLINES, INC.

COMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Overview

United Continental Holdings, Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, “UAL” or the “Company”) is a holding
company and its principal, wholly-owned subsidiary is United Airlines, Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, “United”). As UAL consolidates United for financial statement purposes, disclosures that relate to activities of
United also apply to UAL, unless otherwise noted. United’s operating revenues and operating expenses comprise nearly 100% of UAL’s revenues and operating expenses. In addition, United comprises approximately the entire balance of
UAL’s assets, liabilities and operating cash flows. When appropriate, UAL and United are named specifically for their individual contractual obligations and related disclosures and any significant differences between the operations and results
of UAL and United are separately disclosed and explained. We sometimes use the words “we,” “our,” “us,” and the “Company” in this report for disclosures that relate to all of UAL and United.

NOTE 1 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

(a)

Use of Estimates—

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
(“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

(b)

Revenue Recognition—

The Company records passenger ticket sales and tickets sold by other airlines for use on United as passenger revenue when the
transportation is provided or upon estimated breakage. The value of unused passenger tickets is included in current liabilities as Advance ticket sales. Tickets sold by other airlines are recorded at the estimated values to be billed to the other
airlines. Differences between amounts billed and the actual amounts may be rejected and rebilled or written off if the amount recorded was different from the original estimate. When necessary, the Company records a reserve against its interline
billings and payables if historical experience indicates that these amounts are different.

Non-refundable

tickets generally expire on the date of the intended flight, unless the date is extended by
notification from the customer on or before the intended flight date.

Fees charged in association with changes
or extensions to

non-refundable

tickets are recorded as other revenue at the time the fee is incurred. The fare on the changed ticket, including any additional collection of fare, is deferred and recognized in
accordance with our transportation revenue recognition policy at the time the transportation is provided. Change fees related to

non-refundable

tickets are considered a separate transaction from the air
transportation because they represent a charge for the Company’s additional service to modify a previous sale. Therefore, the pricing of the change fee and the initial customer order are separately determined and represent distinct earnings
processes.

The Company records an estimate of breakage revenue on the flight date for tickets that will expire unused. These
estimates are based on the evaluation of actual historical results and forecasted trends. Refundable tickets expire after one year from the date of issuance.

The Company recognizes cargo and other revenue as service is provided.

Under our
capacity purchase agreements (“CPAs”) with regional carriers, we purchase all of the capacity related to aircraft covered by the contracts and are responsible for selling all of the related seat inventory. We record the passenger revenue
and related expenses as separate operating revenue and expense in the consolidated statement of operations.

Accounts
receivable primarily consist of amounts due from credit card companies and customers of our aircraft maintenance and cargo transportation services. We provide an allowance for uncollectible



accounts equal to the estimated losses expected to be incurred based on historical write-offs and other specific analyses. Bad debt expense and write-offs were not material for the years ended
December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.

(c)

Frequent Flyer Accounting—

United’s MileagePlus

®

program builds customer loyalty by offering awards, benefits and services to program participants. Members in this program earn miles for flights on United, United
Express, Star Alliance members and certain other airlines that participate in the program. Members can also earn miles by purchasing the goods and services of our network of

non-airline

partners. We sell miles
to these partners, which include credit card issuers, retail merchants, hotels, car rental companies and our participating airline partners. Miles can be redeemed for free (other than taxes and government imposed fees), discounted or upgraded air
travel and

non-travel

awards. The Company records its obligation for future award redemptions using a deferred revenue model.

Miles Earned in Conjunction with Flights

When frequent flyers earn miles for flights, the Company recognizes a portion of the ticket sales as revenue when the air transportation occurs and defers a portion of the ticket sale representing the
value of the related miles as a multiple-deliverable revenue arrangement. The Company determines the estimated selling price of air transportation and miles as if each element is sold on a separate basis. The total consideration from each ticket
sale is then allocated to each of these elements, individually, on a pro rata basis. The miles are recorded in Frequent flyer deferred revenue on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet and recognized into revenue when the transportation is
provided.

The Company’s estimated selling price of miles is based on an equivalent ticket value less fulfillment
discount, which incorporates the expected redemption of miles, as the best estimate of selling price for these miles. The equivalent ticket value is based on the prior 12 months’ weighted average equivalent ticket value of similar fares as
those used to settle award redemptions while taking into consideration such factors as redemption pattern, cabin class, loyalty status and geographic region. The estimated selling price of miles is adjusted by a fulfillment discount that considers a
number of factors, including redemption patterns of various customer groups.

Co-branded

Credit Card Partner Mileage Sales

United has a significant contract, the Second Amended and Restated

Co-Branded

Card Marketing
Services Agreement (the

“Co-Brand

Agreement”), to sell MileagePlus miles to its

co-branded

credit card partner, Chase Bank USA, N.A. (“Chase”).
United identified the following significant revenue elements in the

Co-Brand

Agreement: the air transportation element represented by the value of the mile (generally resulting from its redemption for future
air transportation and whose fair value is described above); use of the United brand and access to MileagePlus member lists; advertising; and other travel related benefits.

The fair value of the elements is determined using management’s estimated selling price of each element. The objective of using the estimated selling price based methodology is to determine the price
at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand-alone basis. Accordingly, we determine our best estimate of selling price by considering multiple inputs and methods including, but not limited to, discounted cash
flows, brand value, volume discounts, published selling prices, number of miles awarded and number of miles redeemed. The Company estimated the selling prices and volumes over the term of the

Co-Brand

Agreement in order to determine the allocation of proceeds to each of the multiple elements to be delivered. We also evaluate volumes on an annual basis, which may result in a change in the allocation of estimated selling price on a prospective
basis.

The Company records passenger revenue related to the air transportation element when the transportation is delivered.
The other elements are generally recognized as Other operating revenue when earned.



Expiration of Miles

The Company accounts for miles sold and awarded that will never be redeemed by program members, which we refer to as breakage. The Company
reviews its breakage estimates annually based upon the latest available information regarding redemption and expiration patterns. Miles expire after 18 months of member account inactivity.

The Company’s estimate of the expected expiration of miles requires significant management judgment. Current and future changes to
expiration assumptions or to the expiration policy, or to program rules and program redemption opportunities, may result in material changes to the deferred revenue balance as well as recognized revenues from the programs.

(d)

Cash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash—

Highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less on their acquisition date are classified as
cash and cash equivalents.

Restricted cash primarily includes cash collateral associated with workers’
compensation obligations and reserves for institutions that process credit card ticket sales. Restricted cash is classified as short-term or long-term in the consolidated balance sheets based on the expected timing of return of the assets to the
Company.

The following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash reported within the
consolidated balance sheets that sum to the total of the same such amounts shown in the statements of consolidated cash flows:

(e)

Short-term Investments—

Short-term investments are classified as

available-for-sale

and are stated at fair value. Realized gains and losses on sales of investments are reflected in nonoperating income (expense) in the consolidated
statements of operations. Unrealized gains and losses on

available-for-sale

securities are reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

(f)

Aircraft Fuel, Spare Parts and Supplies—

The Company accounts for aircraft fuel, spare parts and supplies at average cost and provides an obsolescence
allowance for aircraft spare parts with an assumed residual value of 10% of original cost.

(g)

Property and Equipment—

The Company records additions to owned operating property and equipment at cost when acquired. Property under capital leases and the
related obligation for future lease payments are recorded at an amount equal to the initial present value of those lease payments. Modifications that enhance the operating performance or extend the useful lives of airframes or engines are
capitalized as property and equipment. It is the Company’s policy to record compensation from delays in delivery of aircraft as a reduction of the cost of the related aircraft.

Depreciation and amortization of owned depreciable assets is based on the straight-line method over the assets’ estimated useful
lives. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the remaining term of the lease, including estimated facility renewal options when renewal is reasonably assured at key airports, or the estimated useful life of the related asset, whichever is less.
Properties under capital leases are amortized on the straight-line method over the life of the lease or, in the case of certain aircraft, over their estimated useful lives, whichever is shorter. Amortization of capital lease assets is included in
depreciation and amortization expense. The estimated useful lives of property and equipment are as follows:

Estimated Useful Life (in years)

Aircraft and related rotable parts

25 to 30

Buildings

25 to 45

Other property and equipment

3 to 15

Computer software


Building improvements

1 to 40

As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company had a carrying value of computer software of
$356 million and $279 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company’s depreciation expense related to computer software was $108 million, $93 million and $81 million,
respectively. Aircraft and aircraft spare parts were assumed to have residual values of approximately 10% of original cost, and other categories of property and equipment were assumed to have no residual value.

(h)

Maintenance and Repairs—

The cost of maintenance and repairs, including the cost of minor replacements, is charged to expense as incurred, except for costs
incurred under our

power-by-the-hour

(“PBTH”) engine maintenance agreements. PBTH contracts transfer certain risk to
third-party service providers and fix the amount we pay per flight hour or per cycle to the service provider in exchange for maintenance and repairs under a predefined maintenance program. Under PBTH agreements, the Company recognizes expense at a
level rate per engine hour, unless the level of service effort and the related payments during the period are substantially consistent, in which case the Company recognizes expense based on the amounts paid.

(i)

Lease Fair Value Adjustments—

Lease fair value adjustments, which arose from recording operating leases at fair value under fresh start or business
combination accounting, are amortized on a straight-line basis over the related lease term.

(j)

Regional Capacity Purchase—

Payments made to regional carriers under CPAs are reported in Regional capacity purchase in our consolidated statements of
operations.



(k)

Advertising—

Advertising costs, which are included in Other operating expenses, are expensed as incurred. Advertising expenses were $220 million,
$201 million and $179 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

(l)

Intangibles—

The Company has finite-lived and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including goodwill. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their
estimated useful lives. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. Goodwill and indefinite-lived
assets are reviewed for impairment on an annual basis as of October 1, or on an interim basis whenever a triggering event occurs. See Note 2 of this report for additional information related to intangibles.

(m)

Long-Lived Asset Impairments—

The Company evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets subject to amortization whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. For purposes of this testing, the Company has generally identified the aircraft fleet type as the lowest level of identifiable cash flows. An impairment charge is recognized when the asset’s
carrying value exceeds its net undiscounted future cash flows and its fair market value. The amount of the charge is the difference between the asset’s carrying value and fair market value. See Note 16 of this report for additional information
related to asset impairments.

(n)

Share-Based Compensation—

The Company measures the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date
fair value of the award. The resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award, usually the vesting period. Obligations for cash-settled restricted stock units
(“RSUs”) are remeasured at fair value throughout the requisite service period on the last day of each reporting period based upon UAL’s stock price. In addition to the service requirement, certain RSUs have performance metrics that
must be achieved prior to vesting. These awards are accrued based on the expected level of achievement at each reporting period. A cumulative adjustment is recorded on the last day of each reporting period to adjust compensation expense based on
both UAL’s stock price and the then current level of expected performance achievement for the performance-based awards. See Note 5 of this report for additional information on UAL’s share-based compensation plans.

(o)

Ticket Taxes—

Certain governmental taxes are imposed on the Company’s ticket sales through a fee included in ticket prices. The Company collects these
fees and remits them to the appropriate government agency. These fees are recorded on a net basis (excluded from operating revenue).

(p)

Retirement of Leased Aircraft—

The Company accrues for estimated lease costs over the remaining term of the lease at the present value of future minimum
lease payments, net of estimated sublease rentals (if any), in the period that aircraft are permanently removed from service. When reasonably estimable and probable, the Company estimates maintenance lease return condition obligations for items such
as minimum aircraft and engine conditions specified in leases and accrues these amounts over the lease term while the aircraft are operating, and any remaining unrecognized estimated obligations are accrued in the period that an aircraft is removed
from service.

(q)

Uncertain Income Tax Positions—

The Company has recorded reserves for income taxes and associated interest that may become payable in future
years. Although management believes that its positions taken on income tax matters are reasonable, the Company nevertheless has established tax and interest reserves in recognition that various taxing authorities may challenge certain of the
positions taken by the Company, potentially resulting in additional liabilities for taxes and interest. The Company’s uncertain tax position reserves are reviewed periodically and are adjusted as events occur that affect its estimates, such as
the availability of new information, the lapsing of applicable statutes of limitation, the conclusion of tax audits, the measurement of additional estimated liability, the identification of new tax matters, the release of administrative tax guidance
affecting its estimates of tax liabilities, or the rendering of relevant court decisions. The Company records penalties and interest relating to uncertain tax positions in Other operating expense and Interest expense, respectively, in its



consolidated statements of operations. The Company has not recorded any material expense or liabilities related to interest or penalties in its consolidated financial statements.

(r)

Labor Costs—

The Company records expenses associated with amendable labor agreements when the amounts are probable and estimable. These include costs
associated with lump sum cash payments that would be made in conjunction with the ratification of labor agreements. To the extent these upfront costs are in lieu of future pay increases, they would be capitalized and amortized over the term of the
labor agreements. If not, these amounts would be expensed.

(s)

Third-Party Business—

The Company has third-party business revenue that includes fuel sales, catering, ground handling, maintenance services and frequent
flyer award

non-air

redemptions, and third-party business revenue is recorded in Other operating revenue. The Company also incurs third-party business expenses, such as maintenance, ground handling and
catering services for third parties, fuel sales and

non-air

mileage redemptions, and those third-party business expenses are recorded in Other operating expenses.

(t)

Recently Issued Accounting Standards—

The Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) amended the FASB Accounting Standards Codification and
created a new Topic 606,

Revenue from Contracts with Customers.

This amendment prescribes that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration
to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The amendment supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605,

Revenue Recognition

, and most industry-specific guidance throughout the Industry
Topics of the Accounting Standards Codification. The Company currently plans to use the full-retrospective approach in adopting this standard on January 1, 2018. Under the new standard, certain airline ancillary fees directly related to
passenger revenue tickets, such as ticket change fees and baggage fees, are likely to no longer be considered distinct performance obligations separate from the passenger travel component. In addition, the ticket change fees which were previously
recognized when received and booking fees when paid, will likely be recognized when transportation is provided. The Company has previously recorded ancillary fees and change fees in other operating revenue but will record these in passenger revenue
under the new standard. The Company is evaluating other possible impacts from the new standard on its consolidated financial statements.

In 2016, the FASB amended the FASB Accounting Standards Codification and created a new Topic 842,

Leases

(“Topic 842”). The guidance requires lessees to recognize a

right-of-use

asset and a lease liability for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases) at the commencement date and recognize expenses on their income statements
similar to the current Topic 840,

Leases

. It is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and early adoption is permitted. Lessees and lessors are required to adopt Topic 842 using a modified
retrospective approach for all leases existing at or commencing after the date of initial application with an option to use certain practical expedients. The Company is evaluating the impact the adoption of this standard will have on its
consolidated financial statements and believes this standard will have a significant impact on its consolidated balance sheets.

In 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update

No. 2016-09,

Improvements to Employee
Share-Based Payment Accounting

(“ASU

2016-09”)

.

The update requires excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies, which arise due to differences between the measure of compensation expense and
the amount deductible for tax purposes, to be recorded directly through earnings as a component of income tax expense. Under current GAAP, these differences are generally recorded in additional

paid-in

capital
and thus have no impact on net income. The change in treatment of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies will also impact the computation of diluted earnings per share and the cash flows associated with those items will be classified as operating
activities on the statements of consolidated cash flows. Additionally, entities will be permitted to make an accounting policy election for the impact of forfeitures on the recognition of expense for share-based payment awards. Forfeitures can be
estimated, as required under current GAAP, or recognized when they occur. The amendments in this update are



effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU

2016-09

to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

In 2016, the
FASB issued Accounting Standards Update

No. 2016-15,

Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments

(“ASU

2016-15”).

The update amends the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification 230,

Statement of Cash Flows

(“ASC 230”), and clarifies how entities should classify certain cash receipts
and cash payments on the statement of cash flows with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice related to eight specific cash flow issues. The Company adopted ASU

2016-15

as of
December 31, 2016 and the standard did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

In 2016, the
FASB issued Accounting Standards Update

No. 2016-18,

Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash

. The update amends ASC 230 to add guidance on the classification and presentation of
restricted cash in the statement of cash flows. Furthermore, a reconciliation between the statement of financial position and the statement of cash flows must be disclosed when the statement of financial position includes more than one line item for
cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and restricted cash equivalents. The Company adopted this standard as of December 31, 2016 and included $124 million, $206 million and $320 million of restricted cash in the total of cash,
cash equivalents and restricted cash in its statements of consolidated cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. A reconciliation of restricted cash for each period of the Company’s balance sheet to its
statement of consolidated cash flows is included in Note 1(d) Cash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash of this report.

The FASB issued Accounting Standards Update

No. 2015-07,

Fair Value Measurement (Topic
820): Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent)

. Under the standard, investments for which fair value is measured at net asset value (“NAV”) per share (or its
equivalent) using the practical expedient are no longer categorized in the fair value hierarchy. The Company adopted this standard on January 1, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had approximately $182 million of such
investments as part of Short-term investments on its consolidated balance sheets. In addition, pension plan investments measured at NAV per share are no longer categorized within the fair value hierarchy. As of December 31, 2016, the Company
had approximately $1.8 billion of such investments.

2017, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021 is $79 million, $70 million, $64 million, $58 million and $53 million, respectively.

See Note 16 of this report for additional information related to impairment of intangible assets.

NOTE 3 - COMMON STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY AND PREFERRED SECURITIES

In 2016, UAL repurchased approximately 50 million shares of UAL common stock for $2.6 billion. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had approximately $1.8 billion remaining to purchase
shares under its share program. UAL may repurchase shares through the open market, privately negotiated transactions, block trades or accelerated share repurchase transactions from time to time in accordance with applicable securities laws. UAL may
repurchase shares of UAL common stock subject to prevailing market conditions, and may discontinue such repurchases at any time. See Part II, Item 5, “Market for registrant’s common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases
of equity securities” of this report for additional information.

In 2016, the Company retired 70 million treasury shares that were
originally acquired at an average cost of approximately $53 per share.

At December 31, 2016, approximately 5 million shares of
UAL’s common stock were reserved for future issuance related to the issuance of equity-based awards under the Company’s incentive compensation plans.

As of December 31, 2016, UAL had two shares of junior preferred stock (par value $0.01 per share) outstanding. In addition, UAL is authorized to issue 250 million shares of preferred stock
(without par value) under UAL’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation.

NOTE 5 - SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS

UAL maintains several share-based compensation plans. These plans provide for grants of qualified and

non-qualified

stock options, stock appreciation rights,
restricted stock awards, RSUs, performance compensation awards, performance units, cash incentive awards and other types of equity-based and equity-related awards.

All awards are recorded as either equity or a liability in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The

share-based

compensation expense is directly recorded
in salaries and related costs or integration-related expense.

During 2016, UAL granted share-based compensation awards pursuant to the United
Continental Holdings, Inc. 2008 Incentive Compensation Plan. These share-based compensation awards include approximately 1.9 million RSUs, 0.4 million shares of restricted stock and 0.4 million stock options. The time-vested RSUs and
the restricted stock awards vest in

one-third

increments over the first three anniversaries of the date of grant. The time-vested RSUs are generally stock-settled for domestic employees and cash-settled for
international employees based on the

20-day

average closing price of UAL common stock immediately prior to the vesting date. The remainder of the RSUs are performance-based and vest based on the Company’s
return on invested capital and the Company’s relative improvement in

pre-tax

margin for the three years ending December 31, 2018. If the applicable performance conditions are achieved, cash payments
will be made after the end of the performance period based on the

20-day

average closing price of UAL common stock immediately prior to the vesting date. The stock options vest in

one-third

increments over either (i) the first three anniversaries of the date of grant (for seven-year term options) or (ii) the fourth, fifth and sixth anniversaries of the date of grant (for

ten-year

term options).

The fair value of RSUs and restricted stock that vested in 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $80 million, $92 million and
$97 million, respectively. The fair value of the restricted stock awards was based upon the UAL common stock price on the date of grant. These awards are accounted for as equity awards. The fair value of the RSUs was based on the UAL common
stock price as of the last day preceding the settlement date. These awards were accounted for as either equity or liability awards based on their method of settlement. Restricted stock vesting and the recognition of the expense is similar to the
stock option vesting described below.

Stock Options

. During 2016, UAL granted 0.1 million stock options with exercise prices equal
to the fair market value of UAL’s common stock on the date of grant and an additional 0.3 million stock options with exercise prices at a 25% premium of the grant date fair market value resulting in a weighted-average exercise price of
$56.19 and a weighted-average grant date fair value of approximately $2.3 million. Prior to 2016, UAL had not granted any stock options since 2010. Expense related to each portion of an option grant is recognized on a straight-line basis over
the specific vesting period for those options.

The Company determined the fair value of stock options at the grant date using a Black Scholes
option pricing model, which requires the use of several assumptions. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. treasury yield curve in effect for the expected term of the option at the time of grant. The dividend yield on UAL’s common
stock was assumed to be zero since UAL did not have any plans to pay dividends at the time of the option grants. The volatility assumptions were based upon historical volatilities of UAL using daily stock price returns equivalent to the expected
term of the option. The expected lives of the options were determined based upon a simplified assumption that the option will be exercised evenly from vesting to expiration due to the Company’s lack of relevant historical data.

As of December 31, 2016, there were approximately 0.5 million outstanding stock option awards, 0.1 million of which were exercisable, with
weighted-average exercise prices of $46.83 and $18.58, respectively, intrinsic values of $14 million and $7 million, respectively, and weighted-average remaining contractual lives (in years) of 6.3 and 1.6, respectively.

Miscellaneous, net

(a) Income tax expense for these items was offset by the Company’s valuation allowance.

(b) Prior service credits increased by $30 million, $0 million and $3 million and actuarial gains (losses) increased (decreased) by approximately $560 million, $78 million and
$(1.1) billion for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

(c) Deferred tax balance was offset by the Company’s valuation allowance.

(d) This AOCI component is included in the computation of net periodic pension and other postretirement costs (see Note 8 of this report for
additional information).

Prior to the release of the deferred income tax valuation allowance in the third quarter of 2015, the Company
recorded approximately $465 million of valuation allowance adjustments in AOCI. Subsequent to the release of



the deferred income tax valuation allowance in 2015, the $465 million debit remained within AOCI, of which $180 million related to losses on fuel hedges designated for hedge accounting
and $285 million related to pension and other postretirement liabilities. Accounting rules required the adjustments to remain in AOCI as long as the Company had fuel derivatives designated for cash flow hedge accounting and the Company
continues to provide pension and postretirement benefits. In 2016, we settled all of our fuel hedges and have not entered into any new fuel derivative contracts for hedge accounting. Accordingly, the Company reclassified the $180 million to
income tax expense in 2016.

The Company’s effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 differed from the federal statutory rate
of 35% primarily because of the

non-cash

income tax expense of $180 million that was related to losses on fuel derivatives designated for hedge accounting. Subsequent to the release of the valuation
allowance in 2015, this deferred income tax expense of $180 million remained in AOCI until all fuel derivatives were settled in December 2016. The change in the effective tax rate each period is impacted by a number of factors, including the
relative mix of domestic and state income tax expense in the U.S., adjustments to the valuation allowances and discrete items.

United and its domestic consolidated subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return with UAL. Under an
intercompany tax allocation policy, United and its subsidiaries compute, record and pay UAL for their own tax liability as if they were separate companies filing separate returns. In determining their own tax liabilities, United and each of its
subsidiaries take into account all tax credits or benefits generated and utilized as separate companies and they are each compensated for the aforementioned tax benefits only if they would be able to use those benefits on a separate company basis.

The Company’s federal and state NOL carryforwards relate to prior years’ NOLs, which may be used to reduce tax liabilities in future
years. These tax benefits are mostly attributable to federal

pre-tax

NOL carryforwards of $4.4 billion for UAL. If not utilized these federal

pre-tax

NOLs will
expire as follows (in billions): $0.5 in 2026, $1.4 in 2027 and $2.5 after 2028. In addition, the majority of tax benefits of the state net operating losses of $56 million, net of a valuation allowance of $36 million, for UAL will expire
over a five to

20-year

period. Additionally, the Company has $108 million of AMT credit carryforwards, net of a valuation allowance of $8 million, which do not expire.

The Company periodically assesses whether it is more likely than not that it will generate sufficient taxable income to realize its deferred income tax
assets. The Company establishes valuation allowances if it is not likely it will realize its deferred income tax assets. In making this determination, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence and makes certain assumptions.
The Company considers, among other things, projected future taxable income, scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, the overall business environment, the Company’s historical financial results and tax planning strategies. In evaluating
the likelihood of utilizing the Company’s net deferred income tax assets, the significant factors that the Company considers include (1) the Company’s recent history and forecasted profitability; (2) growth in the U.S. and global
economies; and (3) future impact of taxable temporary differences. In 2015, the Company concluded that its deferred income tax assets were more likely than not to be realized and released almost all of its valuation allowance in 2015, resulting
in a $3.1 billion benefit in its provision for income taxes. The valuation allowance recorded in AOCI in prior years was released through the income statement.



The Company has a valuation allowance of $68 million for certain state and local NOLs and credit
carryforwards. The Company expects these NOLs and credits will expire unused due to limited carryforward periods. The ability to utilize these state NOLs and credits will be evaluated on a quarterly basis to determine if there are any
significant events or any prudent and feasible tax planning strategies that would affect the Company’s ability to realize these deferred tax assets.

The Company’s unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions were $74 million, $24 million and $9 million at 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Included in the ending
balance at 2016 is $20 million that would affect the Company’s effective tax rate if recognized. The changes in unrecognized tax benefits relating to settlements with taxing authorities, unrecognized tax benefits as a result of tax
positions taken during a prior period and unrecognized tax benefits relating from a lapse of the statute of limitations were immaterial during 2016, 2015 and 2014. The Company does not expect significant increases or decreases in their unrecognized
tax benefits within the next 12 months.

There are no material amounts included in the balance at December 31, 2016 for tax positions for
which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility.

The
Company’s federal income tax returns for tax years after 2002 remain subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and state taxing jurisdictions. Currently, there are no ongoing examinations of the Company’s
prior year tax returns being conducted by the IRS.

NOTE 8 - PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS

The following summarizes the significant pension and other postretirement plans of United:

Pension Plans

United maintains two primary defined benefit pension plans, one covering
certain pilot employees and another covering certain U.S.

non-pilot

employees. Each of these plans provide benefits based on a combination of years of benefit accruals service and an employee’s final
average compensation. Additional benefit accruals are frozen under the plan covering certain pilot employees and management and administrative employees. Benefit accruals for certain

non-pilot

employees
continue. United maintains additional defined benefit pension plans, which cover certain international employees.

Other Postretirement
Plans

United maintains postretirement medical programs which provide medical benefits to certain retirees and eligible dependents, as well
as life insurance benefits to certain retirees participating in the plan. Benefits provided are subject to applicable contributions,

co-payments,

deductibles and other limits as described in the specific plan
documentation.

Actuarial assumption changes are reflected as a component of the net actuarial gains/(losses) during 2016 and 2015. These
amounts will be amortized over the average remaining service life of the covered active employees or the average life expectancy of inactive participants and will impact 2016 and 2015 pension and retiree medical expense as described below.

As part of the ratified contract with the Association of Flight Attendants (“AFA”) in 2016, the Company amended
two of its flight attendant postretirement medical plans. The amendments triggered curtailment accounting, resulting in the recognition of a

one-time

$47 million gain for accelerated recognition of a
prior service credit in one of the plans. Also, as part of the ratified contract with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (the “IBT”) in 2016, the Company amended some of its technicians and related employees’ postretirement
medical plans. The amendments triggered curtailment accounting, resulting in the recognition of a

one-time

$60 million gain for accelerated recognition of a prior service credit in one of the plans.

The Company used the Society of Actuaries’ 2014 mortality tables, modified to reflect the Social Security
Administration Trustee’s Report on current projections regarding expected longevity improvements.

The Company selected the 2016 discount
rate for substantially all of its plans by using a hypothetical portfolio of high quality bonds at December 31, 2016, that would provide the necessary cash flows to match projected benefit payments.

We develop our expected long-term rate of return assumption for our defined benefit plans based on historical experience and by evaluating input from the
trustee managing the plans’ assets.

Our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for these plans is based on a target allocation of assets, which is based on our goal of earning the highest rate of return while maintaining
risk at acceptable levels. The plans strive to have assets sufficiently diversified so that adverse or unexpected results from one security class will not have an unduly detrimental impact on the entire portfolio. Plan fiduciaries
regularly review our actual asset allocation and the pension plans’ investments are periodically rebalanced to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate. United’s plan assets are allocated within the following guidelines:

Fair Value Information.

Accounting standards require us to use valuation techniques to measure
fair value that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. These inputs are prioritized as follows:

Level 1

Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for assets or liabilities identical to those to be reported at fair value

Level 2

Other inputs that are observable directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities or market-corroborated inputs

Level 3

Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data and which require us to develop our own assumptions about how market participants would price the assets or
liabilities

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are based on the valuation techniques identified in the tables below. The
valuation techniques are as follows:

(a)

Market approach.

Prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions
involving identical or comparable assets and liabilities; and

(b)

Income approach.

Techniques to convert future amounts to a single
current value based on market expectations (including present value techniques, option-pricing and excess earnings models).

Defined Contribution Plans

Depending upon the employee group, employer contributions consist of matching contributions and/or

non-elective

employer contributions. United’s employer
contribution percentages vary from 1% to 16% of eligible earnings depending on the terms of each plan. United recorded contributions to its defined contribution plans of $592 million, $522 million and $503 million in the years ended
December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.



Multi-Employer Plans

United’s participation in the IAM National Pension Plan (“IAM Plan”) for the annual period ended December 31, 2016 is outlined in the table below. There have been no significant
changes that affect the comparability 2016 and 2015 contributions. The risks of participating in these multi-employer plans are different from single-employer plans, as United may be subject to additional risks that others do not meet their
obligations, which in certain circumstances could revert to United. The IAM Plan reported $395 million in employers’ contributions for the year ended December 31, 2015. For 2015, the Company’s contributions to the IAM Plan
represented more than 5% of total contributions to the IAM Plan.

Fair value of the financial instruments included in the tables above was determined as follows:

Description

Fair Value Methodology

Cash and cash equivalents

The carrying amounts approximate fair value because of the short-term maturity of these assets.

Short-term investments

and Restricted cash

Fair value is based on (a) the trading prices of the investment or similar instruments, (b) an income approach, which uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts
into a single present amount based on current market expectations about those future amounts when observable trading prices are not available, (c) internally-developed models of the expected future cash flows related to the securities, or
(d) broker quotes obtained by third-party valuation services.

Fuel derivatives

Derivative contracts are privately negotiated contracts and are not exchange traded. Fair value measurements are estimated with option pricing models that employ observable inputs.
Inputs to the valuation models include contractual terms, market prices, yield curves, fuel price curves and measures of volatility, among others.

Debt

Fair values were based on either market prices or the discounted amount of future cash flows using our current incremental rate of borrowing for similar
liabilities.

NOTE 10—HEDGING ACTIVITIES

Fuel Derivatives

As of December 31, 2016, the Company did not have any fuel
hedging contracts outstanding to hedge its fuel consumption. The last of the Company’s fuel hedge derivatives designated for cash flow hedge accounting expired in December 2016. The Company’s current strategy is to not enter into
transactions to hedge its fuel consumption, although the Company regularly reviews its strategy based on market conditions and other factors.

The Company records each derivative instrument as a derivative asset or liability (on a gross basis) in its consolidated balance sheets

,

and,
accordingly, records any related collateral on a gross basis. The table below presents the fair value amounts of fuel derivative assets and liabilities and the location of amounts recognized in the Company’s financial statements.

As of December 31, 2016, a substantial portion of the Company’s assets, principally aircraft, route authorities,
airport slots and loyalty program intangible assets, was pledged under various loan and other agreements. As of December 31, 2016, UAL and United were in compliance with their respective debt covenants. Continued compliance depends on many
factors, some of which are beyond the Company’s control, including the overall industry revenue environment and the level of fuel costs.

Secured debt

2013 Credit
and Guaranty Agreement.

United and UAL are parties to a Credit and Guaranty Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) as the borrower and guarantor, respectively. The Credit Agreement consists of a $900 million term loan due April
2019 (of which $866 million was outstanding as of December 31, 2016) (the “Term Loan due 2019”), a $500 million term loan due September 2021 (of which $192 million was outstanding as of December 31, 2016) (the
“Term Loan due 2021”) and a $1.35 billion revolving credit facility, with $1.35 billion being available for drawing until April 2018 and $1.315 billion being available for drawing until January 2019.

Borrowings under the revolving credit facility of the Credit Agreement bear interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus a margin of 3.0% per annum, or
another rate based on certain market interest rates, plus a margin of 2.0% per annum. The principal amount of the term loans must be repaid in consecutive quarterly installments of 0.25% of the original principal amount thereof, with any unpaid
balance due, in the case of the Term Loan due 2019, on April 1, 2019 and, in the case of the Term Loan due 2021, on September 15, 2021. United may prepay all or a portion of the term loans from time to time, at par plus accrued and unpaid
interest. United pays a commitment fee equal to 0.75%

per-annum

on the undrawn amount available under the revolving credit facility.

The Term Loan due 2021 ranks pari passu with the Term Loan due 2019 that United originally borrowed under the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement requires United to repay the term loans and any other
outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement at par plus accrued and unpaid interest if certain changes of control of UAL occur.

As of
December 31, 2016, United had its entire capacity of $1.35 billion available under the revolving credit facility of the Company’s Credit Agreement.

As of December 31, 2016, United had cash collateralized $72 million of letters of credit. United also had $383 million of surety bonds securing various obligations at December 31,
2016. Most of the letters of credit have evergreen clauses and are expected to be renewed on an annual basis and the surety bonds have expiration dates through 2021.

EETCs.

United has $7.5 billion principal amount of equipment notes outstanding issued under EETC financings included in notes payable in the table of outstanding debt above. Generally,
the structure of these EETC financings consists of pass-through trusts created by United to issue pass-through certificates, which represent fractional undivided interests in the respective pass-through trusts and are not obligations of United. The
proceeds of the issuance of the pass-through certificates are used to purchase equipment notes which are issued



by United and secured by its aircraft. The payment obligations under the equipment notes are those of United. Proceeds received from the sale of pass-through certificates are initially held by a
depositary in escrow for the benefit of the certificate holders until United issues equipment notes to the trust, which purchases such notes with a portion of the escrowed funds. These escrowed funds are not guaranteed by United and are not reported
as debt on United’s consolidated balance sheet because the proceeds held by the depositary are not United’s assets.

In September
2016 and June 2016, United created separate EETC pass-through trusts, each of which issued pass-through certificates. The proceeds of the issuance of the pass-through certificates are used to purchase equipment notes issued by United and secured by
its aircraft. The Company records the debt obligation upon issuance of the equipment notes rather than upon the initial issuance of the pass-through certificates. United expects to receive all proceeds from the September 2016 and June 2016
pass-through trusts by the end of the second quarter of 2017. Certain details of the pass-through trusts with proceeds received from issuance of debt in 2016 are as follows (in millions, except stated interest rate):

In 2016, United borrowed approximately $369 million aggregate principal amount from various financial institutions to
finance the purchase of several aircraft delivered in 2016. The notes evidencing these borrowings, which are secured by the related aircraft, have maturity dates ranging from 2026 to 2028 and have interest rates comprised of the LIBOR plus a
specified margin.

Unsecured debt

5% Senior Notes due 2024.

In January 2017, United issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of 5% Senior Notes due February 1, 2024 (the “5% Senior Notes due 2024”).
These notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed and recorded by United on its balance sheet as debt. The indenture for the 5% Senior Notes due 2024 requires UAL to offer to repurchase the notes for cash if certain changes of control of UAL
occur at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest.



The collateral, covenants and cross default provisions of the Company’s principal debt instruments that
contain such provisions are summarized in the table below:

Debt Instrument

Collateral, Covenants and Cross 
Default Provisions

customary for aircraft financing, including in certain cases cross default to other related aircraft.

Credit Agreement

Secured by certain of United’s
international route authorities, specified

take-off

and landing slots at certain airports and certain other assets.

The Credit Agreement requires the Company to maintain at least $3.0 billion of unrestricted liquidity at all times, which includes unrestricted cash,
short-term investments and any undrawn amounts under any revolving credit facility, and to maintain a minimum ratio of appraised value of collateral to the outstanding obligations under the Credit Agreement of 1.67 to 1.0 at all times. The Credit
Agreement contains covenants that, among other things, restrict the ability of UAL and its restricted subsidiaries (as defined in the Credit Agreement) to incur additional indebtedness and to pay dividends on or repurchase stock, although the
Company currently has ample ability under these restrictions to repurchase stock under the Company’s share repurchase program.

The Credit Agreement contains events of default customary for this type of financing, including a cross default and cross acceleration provision to
certain other material indebtedness of the Company.

stock under the Company’s share repurchase program.

NOTE 12 - ADVANCED PURCHASE OF MILES

United previously sold MileagePlus miles to Chase which United recorded as Advanced purchase of miles. The remaining balance of

pre-purchased

miles is eligible to
be allocated by Chase to MileagePlus members’ accounts in 2017. The Company has recorded these amounts as Advanced purchase of miles in the liabilities section of the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The

Co-Brand

Agreement contains termination penalties that may require United to make certain payments and repurchase outstanding

pre-purchased

miles in cases such as
United’s insolvency, bankruptcy or other material breaches.



NOTE 13 - LEASES AND CAPACITY PURCHASE AGREEMENTS

United leases aircraft, airport passenger terminal space, aircraft hangars and related maintenance facilities, cargo terminals, other airport facilities,
other commercial real estate, office and computer equipment and vehicles.

At December 31, 2016, United’s scheduled future minimum
lease payments under operating leases having initial or remaining noncancelable lease terms of more than one year, aircraft leases, including aircraft rent under CPAs and capital leases (substantially all of which are for aircraft) were as follows

As of December 31, 2016, United’s aircraft capital lease minimum payments relate to leases of 38 mainline and 29
regional aircraft as well as to leases of nonaircraft assets. Imputed interest rate ranges are 3.5% to 20.8%.

Aircraft operating leases have
initial terms of five to 26 years, with expiration dates ranging from 2017 through 2028. Under the terms of most leases, United has the right to purchase the aircraft at the end of the lease term, in some cases at fair market value, and in others,
at fair market value or a percentage of cost. United has facility operating leases that extend to 2041.

During 2015, the Company reached an
agreement with AerCap Holdings N.V., a major aircraft leasing company, to lease used Airbus S.A.S (“Airbus”) A319s. Five such aircraft are expected to be delivered in 2017. In addition, up to 14 more aircraft may be delivered over the next
four years subject to certain conditions.

United is the lessee of real property under long-term operating leases at a number of airports where
we are also the guarantor of approximately $1.4 billion of underlying debt and interest thereon as of December 31, 2016. These leases are typically with municipalities or other governmental entities, which are excluded from the
consolidation requirements concerning a variable interest entity (“VIE”). To the extent United’s leases and related guarantees are with a separate legal entity other than a governmental entity, United is not the primary
beneficiary because the lease terms are consistent with market terms at the inception of the lease and the lease does not include a residual value guarantee, fixed-price purchase option, or similar feature.

In 2016, United signed a seven year lease extension through 2024 with the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority to continue its use of terminals at
Washington Dulles International Airport.

United’s nonaircraft rent expense was approximately $1.2 billion, $1.3 billion and
$1.4 billion for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

In addition to nonaircraft rent and aircraft rent,
which is separately presented in the consolidated statements of operations, United had aircraft rent related to regional aircraft operating leases, which is included as part of Regional capacity purchase expense in United’s consolidated
statement of operations, of $439 million, $461 million and $442 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.



In connection with UAL Corporation’s and United Air Lines, Inc.’s fresh-start reporting
requirements upon their exit from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2006 and the Company’s acquisition accounting adjustments related to the Company’s merger transaction in 2010, lease valuation adjustments for operating leases were
initially recorded in the consolidated balance sheet, representing the net present value of the differences between contractual lease rates and the fair market lease rates for similar leased assets at the time. An asset (liability) results when the
contractual lease rates are more (less) favorable than market lease terms at the valuation date. The lease valuation adjustment is amortized on a straight-line basis as an increase (decrease) to rent expense over the individual applicable remaining
lease terms, resulting in recognition of rent expense as if United had entered into the leases at market rates. The related remaining lease terms, primarily related to aircraft which make up the majority of the fair value lease adjustment balance,
are one to eight years for United. The lease valuation adjustments are classified within other noncurrent liabilities and the net accretion amounts are $82 million, $107 million and $160 million for the years ended
December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Regional CPAs

United has CPAs with certain regional carriers. We purchase all of the capacity from the flights covered by the CPA at a negotiated price. We pay the regional carrier a predetermined rate, subject to
annual inflation adjustments, primarily for block hours flown (the hours from gate departure to gate arrival) and other operating factors and reimburse the regional carrier for various pass-through expenses related to the flights. Under the CPAs, we
are responsible for the cost of providing fuel for all flights and for paying aircraft rent for all of the aircraft covered by the CPAs. Generally, the CPAs contain incentive bonus and rebate provisions based upon each regional carrier’s
operational performance. United’s CPAs are for 494 regional aircraft, and the CPAs have terms expiring through 2029. Aircraft operated under CPAs include aircraft leased directly from the regional carriers and those owned by United or leased
from third-party lessors and operated by the regional carriers. See Part I, Item 2, “Properties” of this report for additional information.

In 2016 and 2015, Republic Airline Inc. (“Republic”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Republic Airways Holdings (“Republic Airways”), purchased and took delivery of 16 new

76-seat

Embraer S.A. (“Embraer”) E175 aircraft, and placed these aircraft into service under the United Express brand. Subsequent to the Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing by Republic Airways and certain of its
subsidiaries in the first quarter of 2016, United entered into amendments to its CPA with Republic in 2016 for Republic to operate a total of 28 Embraer E175 aircraft, 16 of which were delivered as previously described and 12 of which remain to be
delivered in 2017. In connection with the amended CPA, United will own the 12 remaining Embraer E175 aircraft.

In 2016, United agreed to
purchase 12 new Embraer E175 aircraft that were previously expected to be purchased by one of its United Express operators, and in the first quarter of 2017, United entered into a CPA amendment with Mesa Air Group, Inc. (“Mesa Air Group”)
and Mesa Airlines, Inc. (“Mesa”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mesa Air Group, for Mesa to operate these 12 additional Embraer E175 aircraft under the United Express brand. As of December 31, 2016, all 12 of these aircraft are
expected to be delivered in 2017.

In 2015, United entered into amendments to the CPA with SkyWest Airlines, Inc. (“SkyWest”), a
wholly-owned subsidiary of SkyWest, Inc., to operate an additional 25 new

76-seat

Embraer E175 aircraft under the United Express brand. SkyWest purchased all of these

76-seat

aircraft directly from the manufacturer with seven deliveries remaining in 2017.

In 2015,
United entered into a new CPA with Champlain Enterprises, LLC d/b/a CommutAir (“CommutAir”), pursuant to which CommutAir will operate 40 used Embraer ERJ145 aircraft under the United Express brand that are currently being operated by a
different United Express regional carrier, with transfers that are continuing through 2018. As of December 31, 2016, 28 aircraft are still pending transfer.

Our future commitments under our CPAs are dependent on numerous variables, and are therefore difficult to predict. The most important of these variables is the number of scheduled block
hours. Although we are not required to purchase a minimum number of block hours under certain of our CPAs, we have set forth below estimates of our future payments under the CPAs based on our assumptions. United’s estimates of its
future



payments under all of the CPAs do not include the portion of the underlying obligation for any aircraft leased to a regional carrier or deemed to be leased from other regional carriers and
facility rent that are disclosed as part of aircraft and nonaircraft operating leases. For purposes of calculating these estimates, we have assumed (1) the number of block hours flown is based on our anticipated level of flight activity or
at any contractual minimum utilization levels if applicable, whichever is higher, (2) that we will reduce the fleet as rapidly as contractually allowed under each CPA, (3) that aircraft utilization, stage length and load factors will
remain constant, (4) that each carrier’s operational performance will remain at historic levels and (5) an annual projected inflation rate. These amounts exclude variable pass-through costs such as fuel and landing fees, among others.
Based on these assumptions as of December 31, 2016, our future payments through the end of the terms of our CPAs are presented in the table below (in billions):

After 2021

The actual amounts we pay to our regional operators under CPAs could differ materially from these estimates. For
example, a 10% increase or decrease in scheduled block hours for all of United’s regional operators (whether as a result of changes in average daily utilization or otherwise) in 2017 would result in a corresponding change in annual cash
obligations under the CPAs of approximately $147 million.

NOTE 14 - VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

Variable interests are contractual, ownership or other monetary interests in an entity that change with fluctuations in the fair value of the
entity’s net assets exclusive of variable interests. A VIE can arise from items such as lease agreements, loan arrangements, guarantees or service contracts. An entity is a VIE if (a) the entity lacks sufficient equity or (b) the
entity’s equity holders lack power or the obligation and right as equity holders to absorb the entity’s expected losses or to receive its expected residual returns. Therefore, if the equity owners as a group do not have the power to direct
the entity’s activities that most significantly impact its economic performance, the entity is a VIE.

If an entity is determined to be a
VIE, the entity must be consolidated by the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary is the holder of the variable interests that has the power to direct the activities of a VIE that (i) most significantly impact the VIE’s economic
performance and (ii) has the obligation to absorb losses of or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. Therefore, the Company must identify which activities most significantly impact the
VIE’s economic performance and determine whether it, or another party, has the power to direct those activities.

The Company’s
evaluation of its association with VIEs is described below:

Aircraft Leases

. We are the lessee in a number of operating
leases covering the majority of our leased aircraft. The lessors are trusts established specifically to purchase, finance and lease aircraft to us. These leasing entities meet the criteria for VIEs. We are generally not the primary
beneficiary of the leasing entities if the lease terms are consistent with market terms at the inception of the lease and do not include a residual value guarantee, fixed-price purchase option or similar feature that obligates us to absorb decreases
in value or entitles us to participate in increases in the value of the aircraft. This is the case for many of our operating leases; however, leases of 37 mainline jet aircraft contain a fixed-price purchase option that allow United to purchase
the aircraft at predetermined prices on specified dates during the lease term. Additionally, leases covering 192 leased



regional jet aircraft contain an option to purchase the aircraft at the end of the lease term at prices that, depending on market conditions, could be below fair value. United has not
consolidated the related trusts because, even taking into consideration these purchase options, United is still not the primary beneficiary. United’s maximum exposure under these leases is the remaining lease payments, which are reflected
in future lease commitments in Note 13 of this report.

EETCs.

United evaluated whether the pass-through trusts formed for its
EETC financings, treated as either debt or aircraft operating leases, are VIEs required to be consolidated by United under applicable accounting guidance, and determined that the pass-through trusts are VIEs. Based on United’s analysis as
described below, United determined that it does not have a variable interest in the pass-through trusts.

The primary risk of the pass-through
trusts is credit risk (i.e. the risk that United, the issuer of the equipment notes, may be unable to make its principal and interest payments). The primary purpose of the pass-through trust structure is to enhance the credit worthiness of
United’s debt obligation through certain bankruptcy protection provisions, a liquidity facility (in certain of the EETC structures) and improved

loan-to-value

ratios for more senior debt classes. These credit enhancements lower United’s total borrowing cost. Pass-through trusts are established to receive principal and interest payments on the equipment notes purchased by the pass-through trusts from
United and remit these proceeds to the pass-through trusts’ certificate holders.

United does not invest in or obtain a financial interest
in the pass-through trusts. Rather, United has an obligation to make interest and principal payments on its equipment notes held by the pass-through trusts. United did not intend to have any voting or

non-voting

equity interest in the pass-through trusts or to absorb variability from the pass-through trusts. Based on this analysis, the Company determined that it is not required to consolidate the
pass-through trusts.

NOTE 15 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Commitments.

As of December 31, 2016, United had firm commitments and options to purchase aircraft from The Boeing Company (“Boeing”), Embraer and Airbus presented in the
table below:

Aircraft Type

Number of Firm

Commitments (a)

Airbus A350-1000


Boeing 737NG/737MAX


Boeing

777-300ER


Boeing

Embraer E175


(a) United also has options and purchase rights for additional aircraft.

The aircraft listed in the table above are scheduled for delivery from 2017 through 2027. To the extent the Company and
the aircraft manufacturers with whom the Company has existing orders for new aircraft agree to modify the contracts governing those orders, the amount and timing of the Company’s future capital commitments could change.



The table below summarizes United’s commitments as of December 31, 2016, which primarily relate to
the acquisition of aircraft and related spare engines, aircraft improvements and include other capital purchase commitments for the years ended December 31 (in billions). Any new firm aircraft orders, including through the exercise of purchase
options and purchase rights, will increase the total future capital commitments of the Company.

In the first quarter of 2017, the Company announced that it will retire its fleet of Boeing 747 aircraft from scheduled
service by the end of 2017. The Company does not expect there to be a material impact to depreciation and amortization expense.

As of
December 31, 2016, United had $1.3 billion in financing available through EETC transactions for the financing of all of its aircraft deliveries scheduled in the first half of 2017. See Note 11 of this report for additional information on
aircraft financing. The Company has also secured backstop financing commitments from certain of its aircraft manufacturers for a limited number of its future aircraft deliveries, subject to certain customary conditions. Financing may be necessary to
satisfy the Company’s capital commitments for its firm order aircraft and other related capital expenditures.

Legal and
Environmental.

The Company has certain contingencies resulting from litigation and claims incident to the ordinary course of business. As of December 31, 2016, management believes, after considering a number of factors, including (but
not limited to) the information currently available, the views of legal counsel, the nature of contingencies to which the Company is subject and prior experience, that the ultimate disposition of the litigation and claims will not materially affect
the Company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations. The Company records liabilities for legal and environmental claims when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. These amounts are recorded based on the Company’s
assessments of the likelihood of their eventual disposition.

Guarantees and Indemnifications.

In the normal course of business,
the Company enters into numerous real estate leasing and aircraft financing arrangements that have various guarantees included in the contracts. These guarantees are primarily in the form of indemnities under which the Company typically indemnifies
the lessors and any tax/financing parties against tort liabilities that arise out of the use, occupancy, operation or maintenance of the leased premises or financed aircraft. Currently, the Company believes that any future payments required under
these guarantees or indemnities would be immaterial, as most tort liabilities and related indemnities are covered by insurance (subject to deductibles). Additionally, certain leased premises such as fueling stations or storage facilities include
indemnities of such parties for any environmental liability that may arise out of or relate to the use of the leased premises.

As of
December 31, 2016, United is the guarantor of approximately $1.9 billion in aggregate principal amount of

tax-exempt

special facilities revenue bonds and interest thereon. These bonds, issued by
various airport municipalities, are payable solely from rentals paid under long-term agreements with the respective governing bodies. The leasing arrangements associated with $1.4 billion of these obligations are accounted for as operating
leases with the associated expense recorded on a straight-line basis resulting in ratable accrual of the lease obligation over the expected lease term. These

tax-exempt

special facilities revenue bonds are
included in our lease commitments disclosed in Note 13 of this report. The leasing arrangements associated with $400 million of these obligations are accounted for as capital leases. All of these bonds are due between 2017 and 2038.



In United’s financing transactions that include loans, United typically agrees to reimburse lenders for
any reduced returns with respect to the loans due to any change in capital requirements and, in the case of loans in which the interest rate is based on LIBOR, for certain other increased costs that the lenders incur in carrying these loans as a
result of any change in law, subject, in most cases, to obligations of the lenders to take certain limited steps to mitigate the requirement for, or the amount of, such increased costs. At December 31, 2016, the Company had $2.6 billion of
floating rate debt and $90 million of fixed rate debt, with remaining terms of up to 12 years, that are subject to these increased cost provisions. In several financing transactions involving loans or leases from

non-U.S.

entities, with remaining terms of up to 12 years and an aggregate balance of $2.6

billion, the Company bears the risk of any change in tax laws that would subject loan or lease payments
thereunder to

non-U.S.

entities to withholding taxes, subject to customary exclusions.

As of
December 31, 2016, United is the guarantor of $168 million of aircraft mortgage debt issued by one of United’s regional carriers. The aircraft mortgage debt is subject to similar increased cost provisions as described above for the
Company’s debt and the Company would potentially be responsible for those costs under the guarantees.

Fuel Consortia.

United participates in numerous fuel consortia with other air carriers at major airports to reduce the costs of fuel distribution and storage. Interline agreements govern the rights and responsibilities of the consortia members and provide
for the allocation of the overall costs to operate the consortia based on usage. The consortia (and in limited cases, the participating carriers) have entered into long-term agreements to lease certain airport fuel storage and distribution
facilities that are typically financed through

tax-exempt

bonds (either special facilities lease revenue bonds or general airport revenue bonds), issued by various local municipalities. In general, each
consortium lease agreement requires the consortium to make lease payments in amounts sufficient to pay the maturing principal and interest payments on the bonds. As of December 31, 2016, approximately $1.5 billion principal amount of such
bonds were secured by significant fuel facility leases in which United participates, as to which United and each of the signatory airlines has provided indirect guarantees of the debt. As of December 31, 2016, the Company’s contingent
exposure was approximately $234 million principal amount of such bonds based on its recent consortia participation. The Company’s contingent exposure could increase if the participation of other air carriers decreases. The guarantees will
expire when the

tax-exempt

bonds are paid in full, which ranges from 2017 to 2049. The Company did not record a liability at the time these indirect guarantees were made.

Regional Capacity Purchase.

As of December 31, 2016, United had 223 call options to purchase regional jet aircraft being operated by
certain regional carriers. At December 31, 2016, none of the call options were exercisable because none of the required conditions to make an option exercisable by United was met.

Credit Card Processing Agreements.

The Company has agreements with financial institutions that process customer credit card transactions for the sale of air travel and other services. Under
certain of the Company’s credit card processing agreements, the financial institutions in certain circumstances have the right to require that the Company maintain a reserve equal to a portion of advance ticket sales that has been processed by
that financial institution, but for which the Company has not yet provided the air transportation. Such financial institutions may require additional cash or other collateral reserves to be established or additional withholding of payments related
to receivables collected if the Company does not maintain certain minimum levels of unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments (collectively, “Unrestricted Liquidity”). The Company’s current level of Unrestricted
Liquidity is substantially in excess of these minimum levels.

Labor Negotiations.

As of December 31, 2016, United,
including its subsidiaries, had approximately 88,000 employees. Approximately 80% of United’s employees were represented by various U.S. labor organizations as of December 31, 2016

.

In January 2016, United’s pilots, represented
by the Air Line Pilots Association, International (“ALPA”), agreed to extend their contract through January 31, 2019. In March 2016, the Company’s dispatchers, represented by the Professional Airline Flight Control Association,
agreed to extend their current contract through 2021. In April 2016, the fleet service, passenger service, storekeeper and other employees represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (“IAM”) ratified
seven new contracts with the Company which extended the contracts through 2021. In August 2016, United’s



flight attendants, represented by the AFA, ratified a five-year joint collective bargaining agreement through 2021. In December 2016, the technicians and related employees, represented by the
IBT, ratified a

six-year

joint collective bargaining agreement which extended the contract through 2022. The agreements with ALPA and IBT contain provisions that require the Company to align contract terms
with other airlines’ workgroups under certain conditions.

In April 2016, the Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) announced that it will designate Newark Liberty International Airport (“Newark”) as a Level 2 schedule-facilitated
airport under the International Air Transport Association Worldwide Slot Guidelines effective October 30, 2016. The designation was associated with an updated demand and capacity analysis of Newark by the FAA. In 2016, the Company
determined that the FAA’s action impaired the entire value of its Newark slots because the slots are no longer the mechanism that governs

take-off

and landing rights. Accordingly, the Company recorded a
$412 million special charge ($264 million net of taxes) to write off the intangible asset.

In 2016, the City of Cleveland agreed to
amend the Company’s lease, which runs through 2029, associated with certain excess airport terminal space (principally Terminal D) and related facilities at Hopkins International Airport (“Cleveland”). The Company recorded an accrual
for remaining payments under the lease for facilities that the Company no longer uses and will continue to incur costs under the lease without economic benefit to the Company. This liability was measured and recorded at its fair value when the
Company ceased its right to use such facilities leased to it pursuant to the lease. The Company recorded a net charge of $74 million ($47 million net of taxes) related to the amended lease.

The fleet service, passenger service, storekeeper and other employees represented by the IAM ratified seven new contracts with the Company which extended
the contracts through 2021. The technicians and related employees represented by the IBT ratified a

six-year

joint collective bargaining agreement which extended the contract through 2022. During 2016, the
Company recorded $171 million ($110 million net of taxes) of special charges primarily for payments in conjunction with the IAM and IBT agreements described above. As part of the ratified



contract with the IBT, the Company amended some of its technicians and related employees’ postretirement medical plans. The amendments triggered curtailment accounting, resulting in the
recognition of a

one-time

$60 million gain ($38 million net of taxes) for accelerated recognition of a prior service credit in one of the plans. Also, as part of the ratified contract with the AFA,
the Company amended two of its flight attendant postretirement medical plans. The amendments triggered curtailment accounting, resulting in the recognition of a

one-time

$47 million gain ($30 million
net of taxes) for accelerated recognition of a prior service credit.

During 2016, the Company recorded $37 million ($24 million net
of taxes) of severance and benefit costs related to a voluntary

early-out

program for the Company’s flight attendants and other severance agreements. In 2014, more than 2,500 flight attendants elected to
voluntarily separate from the Company for a severance payment, with a maximum value of $100,000 per participant, based on years of service, with retirement dates through the end of 2016.

During 2016, the Company recorded gains and losses on sale of assets and other special charges of $51 million ($33 million net of taxes). In addition, the Company recorded $8 million
($5 million net of taxes) of losses due to exchange rate changes in Venezuela applicable to funds held in local currency and recorded a $9 million ($6 million net of taxes) gain on the sale of an affiliate.


During its annual
assessment in the fourth quarter, the Company recorded $33 million ($22 million net of related income tax benefit) related to the impairment of its indefinite-lived intangible assets (certain domestic slots and international Pacific
routes), $8 million for the

write-off

of unexercised aircraft purchase options and $7 million for inventory held for sale. For the full-year 2015, the Company also recorded other impairments,
including $10 million for discontinued internal software projects and $10 million for the impairment of several engines held for sale.

The Company recorded $107 million of severance and benefit costs primarily related to a voluntary

early-out

program for its flight attendants. In 2014, more than 2,500 flight attendants elected to voluntarily separate from the Company for a severance payment, with a maximum value of $100,000 per participant, based on years of service, with retirement
dates through the end of 2016.

During 2015, the Company also recorded $18 million related to collective bargaining agreements,
$60 million of integration-related costs primarily related to systems integration and training for employees, $32 million related to charges for settlements in connection with legal matters, $16 million for the cease use of an
aircraft under lease and $14 million for losses on the sale of aircraft and other miscellaneous gains and losses.

The Company recorded
$202 million of losses as part of Nonoperating income (expense): Miscellaneous, net due primarily to the

write-off

of $134 million related to the unamortized

non-cash

debt discount from the extinguishment of the 6% Notes due 2026 and the 6% Notes due 2028. During 2015, the Company also recorded a $61 million foreign exchange loss related to its cash holdings
in Venezuela. The Venezuelan government has maintained currency controls and fixed official exchange rates (i.e. Sistema Complementario de Administracion de Divisas (“SICAD”), and Sistema Marginal de Divisas (“SIMADI”)) for many
years. Previously, airlines were permitted to use the more favorable SICAD rate (13.5 Venezuelan bolivars to one U.S. dollar) if repatriating profits and for payments of local goods and services in Venezuela. During 2015, many of the payments
for local goods and services transitioned to utilizing the SIMADI rate (200 Venezuelan bolivars to one U.S. dollar) or were required to be paid in U.S. dollars. Furthermore, the Venezuelan government has not permitted the exchange and repatriations
of local currency since

mid-2014. As

a result, the Company changed the exchange rate from historical SICAD rates to a combination of SIMADI and SICAD rates based on projections of future cash
payments. Including this adjustment, the Company’s resulting cash balance held in Venezuelan bolivars at December 31, 2015 was approximately $13 million.




The Company recorded a charge of $16 million ($10 million net of related income tax benefits) related to its annual assessment of impairment of its indefinite-lived intangible assets (certain
international Pacific routes). The Company also recorded $33 million for charges related primarily to impairment of its flight equipment held for disposal associated with its Boeing

737-300

and

737-500

fleets.

The Company recorded $141 million of severance and benefit costs related primarily to a
voluntary

early-out

program for its flight attendants. More than 2,500 participants elected a

one-time

opportunity to voluntarily separate from the Company for a
severance payment, with a maximum value of $100,000 per participant, based on years of service, with retirement dates through the end of 2016. In addition, the Company recorded $58 million of severance and benefits primarily related to
reductions of management and front-line employees, including from Cleveland, as part of its cost savings initiatives.

The Company recorded
$66 million for the permanent grounding of 21 of the Company’s Embraer ERJ 135 regional aircraft under lease through 2018, which included an accrual for remaining lease payments and an amount for maintenance return conditions. The Company
decided to permanently ground these 21 Embraer ERJ 135 aircraft as a result of new Embraer E175 regional jet deliveries, the impact of pilot shortages at regional carriers and fuel prices. The Company also recorded $33 million for losses on the
sale of assets and other special charges. In addition, $96 million of integration-related costs included compensation costs related to systems integration, training, severance and relocation for employees.

United used cash to retire, at par, the entire $248 million principal balance of the 6% Convertible Debentures and the 6% Convertible Preferred
Securities, Term Income Deferrable Equity Securities (TIDES) and incurred $64 million of expense primarily associated with the

write-off

of the related

non-cash

debt discounts. The Company also recorded $10 million of foreign exchange losses in Venezuela in 2014.

NOTE 17 - SEGMENT INFORMATION

Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise with separate financial information, which are evaluated regularly by the chief operating
decision maker and are used in resource allocation and performance assessments.



The Company deploys its aircraft across its route network through a single route scheduling system to
maximize its value. When making resource allocation decisions, the Company’s chief operating decision maker evaluates flight profitability data, which considers aircraft type and route economics. The Company’s chief operating decision
maker makes resource allocation decisions to maximize the Company’s consolidated financial results. Managing the Company as one segment allows management the opportunity to maximize the value of its route network.

The Company’s operating revenue by principal geographic region (as defined by the U.S. Department of Transportation) for the years ended
December 31 is presented in the table below (in millions):

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation
of Disclosure Control and Procedures

UAL and United each maintain controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted by UAL and United to the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified by the SEC’s rules and
forms, and is accumulated and communicated to management including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The management of UAL and United, including the
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, performed an evaluation to conclude with reasonable assurance that UAL’s and United’s disclosure controls and procedures were designed and operating effectively to report the information
each company is required to disclose in the reports they file with the SEC on a timely basis. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of UAL and United have concluded that as of December 31, 2016,
disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting during the Quarter Ended
December 31, 2016

During the three months ended December 31, 2016, there was no change in UAL’s or United’s
internal control over financial reporting during their most recent fiscal quarter that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, their internal control over financial reporting.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

United Continental Holdings, Inc.

We have
audited United Continental Holdings, Inc.’s (the “Company”) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the “COSO criteria”). The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting in Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control
over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based
on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2016 of the Company and our report dated February 23, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Exchange Act Rules

Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial

ITEM 14.

PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT FEES AND SERVICES.

The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors has adopted a policy on

pre-approval

of services of the
Company’s independent registered public accounting firm. As a wholly-owned subsidiary of UAL, United’s audit services are determined by UAL. The policy provides that the Audit Committee shall

pre-approve

all audit and

non-audit

services to be provided to UAL and its subsidiaries and affiliates by its independent auditors. The process by which this is carried
out is as follows:

For recurring services, the Audit Committee reviews and

pre-approves

the
independent registered public accounting firm’s annual audit services in conjunction with the annual appointment of the outside auditors. The reviewed materials include a description of the services along with related fees. The Audit Committee
also reviews and

pre-approves

other classes of recurring services along with fee thresholds for

pre-approved

services. In the event that the additional services are
required prior to the next scheduled Audit Committee meeting,

pre-approvals

of additional services follow the process described below.

Any requests for audit, audit related, tax and other services not contemplated with the recurring services approval described above must be submitted to the Audit Committee for specific

pre-approval

and cannot commence until such approval has been granted. Normally,

pre-approval

is provided at regularly scheduled meetings. However, the authority to grant
specific

pre-approval

between meetings, as necessary, has been delegated to the Chair of the Audit Committee. The Chair must update the Audit Committee at the next regularly scheduled meeting of any services
that were granted specific

pre-approval.

On a periodic basis, the Audit Committee reviews the status
of services and fees incurred

year-to-date

and a list of newly

pre-approved

services since its last regularly scheduled meeting.
The Audit Committee has considered whether the 2016 and 2015

non-audit

services provided by Ernst & Young LLP, the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, are compatible with
maintaining auditor independence.

All of the services in 2016 and 2015 under the Audit Fees, Audit Related Fees, Tax Fees and All Other Fees
categories below have been approved by the Audit Committee pursuant to paragraph (c)(7) of Rule

2-01

of Regulation

S-X

of the Exchange Act.

The aggregate fees billed for professional services rendered by the Company’s independent auditors in 2016 and 2015 are as follows (in thousands):

effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting of United Continental Holdings, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Audit fees also include the audit of the consolidated financial statements of United, employee benefit plan audits,
attestation services required by statute or regulation, comfort letters, consents, assistance with and review of documents filed with the SEC, and accounting and financial reporting consultations and research work necessary to comply with generally
accepted auditing standards.



AUDIT RELATED FEES

For 2016 and 2015, fees for audit related services consisted of professional services related to due diligence and understanding key process changes and identifying and testing changes in the internal
control environment prior to implementation of system conversions.

TAX FEES

Tax fees for 2016 and 2015 include professional services provided for foreign and state tax returns, research and consultations regarding tax accounting,
and tax compliance matters and assistance in assembling data to prepare for and respond to governmental reviews of past tax filings, exclusive of tax services rendered in connection with the audit.
