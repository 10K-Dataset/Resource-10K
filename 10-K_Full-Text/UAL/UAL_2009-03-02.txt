PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS.

UAL Corporation (together with its consolidated subsidiaries,
    “UAL”), a holding company whose principal subsidiary
    is United Air Lines, Inc. (together with its primary
    subsidiaries, “United”), was incorporated under the
    laws of the State of Delaware on December 30, 1968. We
    sometimes use the words “we,” “our,”
    “us,” and the “Company” in this

Form 10-K

for disclosures that relate to both UAL and United. Our world
    headquarters is located at 77 W. Wacker Drive,
    Chicago, Illinois 60601. The mailing address is
    P.O. Box 66919, Chicago, Illinois 60666 (telephone
    number

(312) 997-8000).

This Annual Report on

Form 10-K

is a combined report of UAL and United. Unless otherwise noted,
    this information applies to both UAL and United. As UAL
    consolidates United for financial statement purposes,
    disclosures that relate to activities of United also apply to
    UAL. Most of UAL’s revenue and expenses in 2008 were from
    United’s airline operations. United transports people and
    cargo through its mainline operations, which utilize full-sized
    jet aircraft exceeding 70 seats in size, and its regional
    operations, which utilize smaller aircraft not exceeding
    70 seats in size that are operated under contract by United
    Express

United Airlines operates nearly 3,000 flights a day on United
    and United Express to more than 200 U.S. domestic and
    international destinations from its hubs in Los Angeles,
    San Francisco, Denver, Chicago and Washington, D.C.,
    based on its annual flight schedule as of January 1, 2009.

This

Form 10-K

contains various “forward-looking statements” within
    the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933,
    as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act
    of 1934, as amended. Forward-looking statements represent the
    Company’s expectations and beliefs concerning future
    events, based on information available to the Company on the
    date of the filing of this

Form 10-K,

and are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Factors that
    could cause actual results to differ materially from those
    referenced in the forward-looking statements are listed in
    Item 1A, Risk Factors and in Item 7, Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations. The Company disclaims any intent or obligation to
    update or revise any of the forward-looking statements, whether
    in response to new information, unforeseen events, changed
    circumstances or otherwise.

Company
    Operational Plans

During 2008, UAL’s management and its Board of Directors
    were active in adjusting the Company’s operational plans in
    response to difficult industry conditions and the weakening
    global economy. Unprecedented increases in jet fuel prices
    during 2008 had a significant negative impact on our results of
    operations and were one of the leading factors that prompted the
    development of the Company’s operational plans, as
    described in Note 2, “Company Operational Plans,”
    in

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

.

The Company is taking actions to return to profitability and to
    strengthen liquidity, including the permanent removal of 100
    aircraft from United’s mainline fleet; the elimination of
    the Ted product for leisure markets and the reconfiguration of
    Ted aircraft to include United First seating; the development of
    new revenue sources through delivery of new products and
    services valued by our customers; the streamlining of operations
    and corporate functions with a reduction of approximately 9,000
    positions during 2008 and 2009; and the formation of a strategic
    alliance with Continental Airlines, all as further discussed in
    Item 7,

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

During 2008, the Company ceased operations to Ft. Lauderdale and
    West Palm Beach, Florida, two markets served by Ted, which uses
    an all-economy seating configuration to serve primarily leisure
    markets. In addition, during 2008, as part of its operational
    plans the Company ceased operations in certain non-Ted markets
    and also reduced frequencies in several Ted and non-Ted markets.
    In light of these planned capacity reductions and other factors,
    the Company also determined that it would eliminate its entire
    B737 fleet by the end of 2009. With the reduced need for Ted
    aircraft in leisure markets and an increased need for narrow
    body aircraft in non-Ted markets due to the elimination of the
    B737 fleet, the Company decided to reconfigure the entire Ted
    fleet of all-economy Airbus aircraft to include first class, as
    well as Economy Plus and economy seats. The reconfigured Airbus
    aircraft will provide United a consistent product offering for
    our customers and employees, and increases our fleet flexibility
    to redeploy aircraft onto former Ted and other narrow body
    routes as market conditions change.

Overall, the Company has characterized its business approach as
    “Focus on Five,” a comprehensive set of priorities
    that focus on the fundamentals of running a good airline: one
    that runs on time, with clean planes and courteous employees,
    that delivers industry-leading revenues and competitive costs
    and does so safely. Building on this foundation, United aims to
    regain its industry-leading position in key metrics reported by
    the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”) as
    well as industry-leading revenue driven by products, services,
    schedules and routes that are valued by the Company’s
    customers. The goal



of this approach is intended to enable United to achieve

best-in-class

safety performance, exceptional customer satisfaction and
    experience and industry-leading margin and cash flow.

Bankruptcy
    of Predecessor Company

On December 9, 2002 (the “Petition Date”), UAL,
    United, and 26 direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries
    (collectively, the “Debtors”) filed voluntary
    petitions to reorganize their businesses under Chapter 11
    of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States
    Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern
    Division (the “Bankruptcy Court”). On January 20,
    2006, the Bankruptcy Court confirmed the Debtors’ Second
    Amended Joint Plan of Reorganization Pursuant to Chapter 11
    of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the “Plan of
    Reorganization”). The Plan of Reorganization became
    effective and the Debtors emerged from bankruptcy protection on
    February 1, 2006 (the “Effective Date”). On the
    Effective Date, the Company implemented fresh-start reporting in
    accordance with American Institute of Certified Public
    Accountants’ Statement of Position

90-7,

Financial Reporting by Entities in Reorganization under the
    Bankruptcy Code

(“SOP 90-7”),

resulting in significant changes as compared to the historical
    financial statements.

During the course of its Chapter 11 proceedings, the
    Company successfully reached settlements with most of its
    creditors and resolved most pending claims against the Debtors.
    However, certain significant matters remain to be resolved in
    the Bankruptcy Court. For further details, see Note 4,
    “Voluntary Reorganization Under
    Chapter 11—Significant Matters Remaining to be
    Resolved in Chapter 11 Cases,” in

Combined Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements

.

Operations

Segments.

The Company operates its
    businesses through two reporting segments: Mainline and United
    Express. The Company manages its business as an integrated
    network with assets deployed across integrated mainline and
    regional carrier networks. This focus on managing the business
    seeks to maximize the profitability of the overall airline
    network. Financial information on the Company’s reporting
    segments and operating revenues by geographic regions, as
    reported to the DOT, can be found in Note 10, “Segment
    Information,” in

Combined Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements

.

Mainline.

The Company’s mainline
    operating revenues were $17.1 billion, $17.0 billion
    and $16.4 billion in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. As
    of December 31, 2008, mainline domestic operations served
    over 80 destinations primarily throughout the U.S. and
    Canada and operated hubs at Chicago O’Hare International
    Airport (“O’Hare”), Denver International Airport
    (“Denver”), Los Angeles International Airport
    (“LAX”), San Francisco International Airport
    (“SFO”) and Washington Dulles International Airport
    (“Washington Dulles”). Mainline international
    operations serve the Pacific, Atlantic and Latin America
    regions. The Pacific region includes non-stop service to
    Beijing, Hong Kong, Osaka, Seoul, Shanghai, Sydney and Tokyo and
    direct service to Bangkok, Seoul, Singapore and Taipei via
    Tokyo; direct service to Ho Chi Minh City and Singapore via Hong
    Kong and to Melbourne via Sydney. The Atlantic region includes
    non-stop service to Amsterdam, Brussels, Dubai, Frankfurt,
    Kuwait City, London, Munich, Paris, Rome and Zurich. The Latin
    American region offers non-stop service to Buenos Aires, Rio de
    Janeiro (seasonal non-stop) and Sao Paulo. The Latin American
    region also serves various Mexico destinations including Cancun,
    Cozumel (seasonal), Ixtapa/Zihuatanejo (seasonal), Mexico City,
    Puerto Vallarta and San Jose del Cabo; various Caribbean
    points including Aruba and seasonal service to Montego Bay,
    Punta Cana, and St. Maarten; and Central America including
    Liberia, Costa Rica (seasonal).

UAL’s operating revenues attributed to mainline domestic
    operations were $9.7 billion in 2008, $10.9 billion in
    2007 and $10.0 billion in 2006. Operating revenues
    attributed to mainline international operations were
    $7.4 billion in 2008, $6.1 billion in 2007 and
    $6.4 billion in 2006. For purposes of the Company’s
    geographic revenue reporting, the Company considers destinations
    in Mexico and the Caribbean to be part of the Latin America
    region as opposed to the North America region.



The mainline segment operated 409 aircraft as of
    December 31, 2008, and produced 135.8 billion
    available seat miles (“ASMs”) and 110.1 billion
    revenue passenger miles (“RPMs”) during 2008; in 2007,
    the mainline segment produced 141.9 billion ASMs and
    117.4 billion RPMs.

United Express.

United Express operating
    revenues were $3.1 billion in both 2008 and 2007 and
    $2.9 billion in 2006. United has contractual relationships
    with various regional carriers to provide regional jet and
    turboprop service branded as United Express. United Express is
    an extension of the United mainline network. Chautauqua
    Airlines, Colgan Airlines, Go Jet Airlines, Mesa Airlines,
    Shuttle America, SkyWest Airlines and Trans States Airlines are
    all United Express carriers, most of which operate under
    capacity purchase agreements. Under these agreements, United
    pays the regional carriers contractually-agreed fees
    (carrier-controlled costs) for operating these flights plus a
    variable reimbursement (incentive payment) based on agreed
    performance metrics. The carrier-controlled costs are based on
    specific rates for various operating expenses of the United
    Express carriers, such as crew expenses, maintenance and
    aircraft ownership, some of which are multiplied by specific
    operating statistics (e.g., block hours, departures) while
    others are fixed monthly amounts. The incentive payment is a
    markup applied to the carrier-controlled costs for superior
    operational performance. Under these capacity agreements, United
    is responsible for all fuel costs incurred as well as landing
    fees, facilities rent and deicing costs, which are passed
    through without any markup. In return, the regional carriers
    operate this capacity on schedules determined by United. United
    also determines pricing, revenues and inventory levels and
    assumes the inventory and distribution risk for the available
    seats.

The capacity agreements which United has entered into with
    United Express carriers do not include the provision of ground
    handling services. As a result, United Express sources ground
    handling support from a variety of third-party providers as well
    as by utilizing internal United resources in some cases.

While the regional carriers operating under capacity purchase
    agreements comprise over 95% of United Express flying, the
    Company also has limited prorate agreements with Colgan Airlines
    and SkyWest Airlines. Under these prorate agreements, United and
    its prorate partners agree to divide revenue collected from each
    passenger according to a formula, while both United and the
    prorate partners are individually responsible for their own
    costs of operations. United also collects a program fee from
    Colgan Airlines to cover certain marketing and distribution
    costs such as credit card transaction fees, global distribution
    systems (“GDS”) transaction fees and frequent flyer
    costs. Unlike capacity purchase agreements, these prorate
    agreements require the regional carrier to retain the control
    and risk of scheduling, market selection, seat pricing and
    inventory for its flights.

United Express carriers operated 280 aircraft as of
    December 31, 2008, and produced 16.2 billion ASMs and
    12.1 billion RPMs during 2008, while producing
    16.3 billion ASMs and 12.6 billion RPMs in 2007.

United Cargo.

United Cargo offers both
    domestic and international shipping through a variety of
    services including United Small Package Delivery, Express and
    General cargo services. Freight shipments comprise approximately
    85% of United Cargo’s volumes, with mail comprising the
    remainder. During 2008, United Cargo accounted for approximately
    4% of the Company’s operating revenues by generating
    $854 million in freight and mail revenue, an 11% increase
    versus 2007.

United Services.

United Services is a
    global airline support business offering customers comprehensive
    aircraft maintenance, repair and overhaul (“MRO”)
    services which include engine and line maintenance services.
    United Services brings nearly 80 years of experience to
    serve over 100 airline customer contracts worldwide. During 2008
    and 2007, United Services generated approximately
    $167 million and $183 million, respectively, in
    third-party revenue.

Fuel.

The price and availability of jet
    fuel significantly affects the Company’s results of
    operations. Fuel has been the Company’s largest operating
    expense for the last several years. The Company has a risk
    management strategy to hedge a portion of its price risk related
    to projected jet fuel requirements. The Company utilizes various
    types of hedging instruments including purchased calls, collars,
    3-way collars and 4-way collars. A collar involves the purchase
    of fuel call options with the simultaneous sale of



fuel put options with identical expiration dates. If fuel prices
    rise above the ceiling of the collar, the Company’s
    counterparties are required to make settlement payments to the
    Company, while if fuel prices fall below the floor of the
    collars, the Company is required to make settlement payments to
    its fuel hedge counterparties. In addition, the Company has been
    and may in the future be further required to provide
    counterparties with cash collateral prior to settlement of the
    hedge positions.

In both 2008 and 2007, an increase in jet fuel prices was the
    primary reason for higher mainline and United Express fuel
    expense and aircraft fuel cost per gallon, as highlighted in the
    table below. The price of crude oil reached a record high of
    approximately $145 per barrel in July 2008 and then dramatically
    decreased in the second half of the year to approximately $45
    per barrel at December 31, 2008. This significant fuel
    price volatility drove the Company’s total fuel hedge
    losses of more than $1.1 billion in 2008. A significant
    portion of these losses were unrealized as of December 31,
    2008 and could increase or decrease in future periods based on
    future changes in market prices before the related hedge
    contracts settle. While the Company’s results of operations
    should benefit significantly from lower fuel prices on its
    unhedged fuel consumption, in the near term lower fuel prices
    could also significantly and negatively impact liquidity based
    on the amount of cash settlements and collateral that may be
    required.

The Company accounts for the majority of its fuel derivative
    contracts as economic hedges, which are

marked-to-market

with gains and losses classified as fuel expense. Remaining fuel
    derivative contracts which do not qualify for economic hedge
    accounting are

marked-to-market

with gains and losses classified as nonoperating expense. See
    Item 7A,

“Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
    About Market Risk”

and Note 13, “Fair Value
    Measurements and Derivative Instruments,” in

Combined
    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

for additional
    details regarding gains and losses from settled and open
    positions, cash settlements, unrealized amounts at the end of
    the period and hedge collateral. Derivative gains and losses
    from contracts qualifying for economic hedge accounting are
    recorded in mainline fuel expense and are not allocated to
    United Express fuel expense.

To ensure adequate supplies of fuel and to provide a measure of

    significant reduction in the availability of jet fuel, a number
    of factors make predicting fuel prices and fuel availability
    uncertain, including changes in world energy demand,
    geopolitical uncertainties affecting energy supplies from
    oil-producing nations, industrial accidents, threats of
    terrorism directed at oil supply infrastructure, extreme weather
    conditions causing temporary shutdowns of production and
    refining capacity, as well as changes in relative demand for
    other petroleum products that may impact the quantity and price
    of jet fuel produced from period to period.



Alliances.

United has a number of
    bilateral and multilateral alliances with other airlines, which
    enhance travel options for customers seeking access to markets
    that United does not serve directly. These marketing alliances
    typically include one or more of the following features: joint
    frequent flyer program participation; codesharing of flight
    operations (whereby seats on one carrier’s selected flights
    can be marketed under the brand name of another carrier);
    coordination of reservations, ticketing, passenger check-in,
    baggage handling and flight schedules; and other
    resource-sharing activities.

The most significant of these arrangements is the Star Alliance,
    a global integrated airline network co-founded by United in
    1997. As of February 1, 2009, Star Alliance carriers serve
    approximately 900 destinations in 159 countries with over 16,500
    average daily flights. Current Star Alliance partners, in
    addition to United, are Air Canada, Air China, Air New Zealand,
    All Nippon Airways, Asiana, the Austrian Airlines Group, bmi,
    EgyptAir, LOT Polish Airlines, Lufthansa, SAS, Shanghai
    Airlines, Singapore Airlines, South African Airways, Spanair,
    Swiss, TAP Portugal, THAI, Turkish Airlines and US Airways.
    Regional member carriers are Adria Airways (Slovenia), Blue1
    (Finland) and Croatia Airlines. Air India, Brussels Airlines,
    Continental Airlines and TAM Airlines are expected to become
    future members of the Star Alliance.

United also has independent marketing agreements with other air
    carriers including Aer Lingus, Air One, Great Lakes Aviation,
    Gulfstream International, Hawaiian, Island Air, Qatar Airways,
    TACA Group and Virgin Blue.

Continental Alliance.

In 2008, United
    and Continental announced their plan to form a new alliance
    partnership that will link the airlines’ networks and
    services worldwide to the benefit of customers, employees and
    shareholders, creating new revenue opportunities, cost savings
    and other efficiencies. In addition, Continental plans to join
    United and its 20 other partners in the Star Alliance, the most
    comprehensive airline alliance in the world. During 2008,
    United, Continental and eight other airlines submitted a request
    to the DOT and applicable foreign authorities to allow
    Continental to join United, Air Canada, Lufthansa and six other
    carriers in their already established anti-trust immunized
    alliance. If approved, the immunity will enable United, Air
    Canada, Continental and Lufthansa to implement a joint venture
    covering transatlantic routings that would deliver highly
    competitive flight schedules, fares and service. In the
    U.S. market, where antitrust immunity would not apply,
    customers will benefit as United and Continental plan to begin
    broad codesharing, which eases travel for customers flying on
    itineraries using both carriers, and cooperation on frequent
    flyer programs and airport lounges, subject to regulatory notice
    and Continental exiting certain of its current alliance
    relationships. In addition, United and Continental are also
    exploring opportunities to capture important cost savings in the
    areas of information technology, frequent flyer programs,
    airport operations, lounges, procurement and sales and marketing.

Continental’s and United’s route networks are highly
    complementary, with little overlap, so they add value to each
    other and to customers who are planning domestic and
    international travel. Under codesharing, customers will benefit
    from a coordinated process for reservations/ticketing, check-in,
    flight connections and baggage transfer. Frequent flyer
    reciprocity will allow members of Continental’s OnePass
    program and United’s Mileage Plus program to earn miles in
    their accounts when flying on either partner airline and redeem
    awards on both carriers. Continental’s plans to join the
    Star Alliance and other planned cooperation are subject to
    certain regulatory and other approvals and the termination of
    certain contractual relationships, including Continental’s
    existing agreements with SkyTeam members that restrict its
    participation in another global alliance.

Mileage Plus.

Mileage Plus builds
    customer loyalty by offering awards and services to frequent
    travelers. Mileage Plus members can earn mileage credit for
    flights on United, United Express, Ted, members of the Star
    Alliance and certain other airlines that participate in the
    program. Miles can also be earned by purchasing the goods and
    services of our non-airline partners, such as hotels, car rental
    companies and credit card issuers. Mileage credits can be
    redeemed for free, discounted or upgraded travel and non-travel
    awards. There are more than 54 million members enrolled in
    Mileage Plus. In 2008, 2.3 million Mileage Plus travel
    awards were used on United, as compared to 2.2 million in



and 2.3 million in 2006. These amounts represent the number
    of awards for which travel was provided and not the number of
    available seats that were allocated to award travel. These
    awards represented 9.1% of United’s total revenue passenger
    miles in 2008, 8.0% in 2007 and 8.1% in 2006. In addition,
    Mileage Plus members redeemed miles for approximately 613,000

non-United

awards in 2008 as compared to 928,000 in 2007.

Non-United

awards include awards such as Red Carpet club memberships, car
    and hotel awards, merchandise and travel solely on another air
    carrier. Total miles redeemed for travel on United in 2008,
    including travel awards and

class-of-service

upgrades, represented 89% of the total miles redeemed (for both
    completed and future travel). The Company expanded its offering
    of merchandise available for awards in 2009, which may increase
    the amount of non-travel awards.

    Mileage Plus program activity, which was changed to a deferred
    revenue model upon the adoption of fresh-start reporting on the
    Effective Date, see

UAL Loyalty Services, LLC
    (“ULS”).

ULS focuses on expanding
    the non-core marketing businesses of United and building airline
    customer loyalty. ULS operates substantially all United-branded
    travel distribution and customer loyalty

e-commerce

activities, such as united.com. In addition, ULS owns and
    operates Mileage Plus, being responsible for member
    relationships, communications and account management; while
    United is responsible for other aspects of Mileage Plus,
    including elite membership programs such as Global Services,
    Premier, Premier Executive and Premier Executive 1K, and the
    establishment of award mileage redemption programs and
    airline-related customer loyalty recognition policies. United is
    also responsible for managing relationships with its Mileage
    Plus airline partners, while ULS manages relationships with
    non-airline business partners, such as the Mileage Plus Visa
    Card, hotels, car rental companies and dining programs, among
    others.

Distribution Channels.

The majority of
    United’s airline seat inventory continues to be distributed
    through the traditional channels of travel agencies and GDS,
    such as Sabre and Galileo. The growing use of alternative
    distribution systems, including

www.united.com

and GDS
    new entrants, provides United with an opportunity to lower its
    ticket distribution costs. To encourage customer use of
    lower-cost channels and capitalize on these cost-saving
    opportunities, the Company will continue to expand the
    capabilities of its website.

Industry
    Conditions

Seasonality.

The air travel business is
    subject to seasonal fluctuations. The Company’s operations
    can be adversely impacted by severe weather and the first and
    fourth quarter results of operations normally reflect lower
    travel demand. Historically, results of operations are better in
    the second and third quarters which reflect higher levels of
    travel demand.

Domestic Competition.

The domestic
    airline industry is highly competitive and dynamic. In domestic
    markets, new and existing carriers are generally free to
    initiate service between any two points within the United
    States. United’s competitors consist primarily of other
    airlines, a number of whom are low-cost carriers
    (“LCCs”) with cost structures lower than
    United’s, and, to a lesser extent, other forms of
    transportation.

The rate of capacity increases in the domestic market has slowed
    in the past several years, but LCCs have continued expanding
    into markets where United flies. United has extensive experience
    competing directly with LCCs in its markets and believes it is
    well positioned to compete effectively. In response to the
    adverse economic conditions in 2008, United and many of its
    competitors implemented significant capacity reductions in both
    domestic and international markets.



United’s capacity increases (decreases) for 2008 and its
    forecasted 2009 capacity decreases, as compared to the year-ago
    periods, are summarized in the following table:

Mainline

Consolidated

Domestic

International

Fourth Quarter 2008

(10.6)%

Full-year 2008

Full-year 2009

(8.0)% to (7.0)%

(12.5)% to (11.5)%

(6.0)% to (5.0)%

During 2008, several smaller carriers entered into either
    bankruptcy liquidation or reorganization proceedings. Carriers
    that reorganize through bankruptcy proceedings may be able to
    improve their cost structure making them more competitive with
    the rest of the industry. In addition, Delta Airlines completed
    its acquisition of Northwest Airlines Corporation in late 2008.
    This merger may enable the combined airline to improve its
    revenue and cost performance relative to peers and thus enhance
    its competitive position within the industry. It is also
    possible that other airline mergers or acquisitions may occur in
    the future.

Domestic pricing decisions are largely affected by the need to
    be competitive with other U.S. airlines. Fare discounting
    by competitors has historically had a negative effect on the
    Company’s financial results because United often finds it
    necessary to match competitors’ fares to maintain passenger
    traffic. Attempts by United and other network airlines to raise
    fares often fail due to lack of competitive matching by LCCs;
    however, because of capacity constraint, the pressure of higher
    fuel prices and other industry conditions, some fare increases
    have occurred in recent years. Because of different cost
    structures, low ticket prices that may generate a profit for a
    LCC may have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial
    results. Also, additional revenue from fuel-related fare
    increases may not completely offset the Company’s increased
    cost of fuel.

International Competition.

In
    United’s international networks, the Company competes not
    only with U.S. airlines, but also with foreign carriers.
    Competition on specified international routes is subject to
    varying degrees of governmental regulations. Recently the
    U.S. and European Union (“EU”) implemented an
    agreement to reduce restrictions on flight operations between
    the two entities. This agreement has increased competition on
    United’s transatlantic network from both U.S. and
    European airlines. In our Pacific operations, competition will
    be increasing as the governments of the U.S. and China
    permit more U.S. and Chinese airlines to fly new routes
    between the two countries, although the commencement of some new
    services to China has been recently postponed due to the weak
    global economy. See

Industry Regulation

, below. Part of
    United’s ability to successfully compete with

non-U.S. carriers

on international routes is its ability to generate traffic from
    and to the entire U.S. via its integrated domestic route
    network. Foreign carriers are currently prohibited by
    U.S. law from carrying local passengers between two points
    in the U.S. and United experiences comparable restrictions
    in many foreign countries. In addition, U.S. carriers are
    often constrained from carrying passengers to points beyond
    designated international gateway cities due to limitations in
    air service agreements or restrictions imposed unilaterally by
    foreign governments. To compensate for these structural
    limitations, U.S. and foreign carriers have entered into
    alliances and marketing arrangements that allow these carriers
    to exchange traffic between each other’s flights and route
    networks (see

Alliances,

above, for further details).

Economic Conditions.

Airlines are
    highly susceptible to negative financial impacts caused by major
    changes in the global economy that drive sudden severe swings in
    costs or revenues. During 2008, the combined forces of high fuel
    prices, extensive competition and a severe global recession
    drove numerous U.S. and international carriers to file for
    bankruptcy and, in some cases, to liquidate. While fuel costs
    have significantly fallen since reaching historic highs in the
    summer of 2008, overall demand for airline services has
    decreased, and may decrease further, and the depth of, and
    recovery from, the global recession continues to be uncertain.
    As discussed further in Item 1A,

Risk Factors

, and
    in Item 7,

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations,

the current



economic conditions have had, and may continue to have, negative
    impacts on passenger demand, revenues, the level of credit card
    sales activity and our cargo operations. In response to these
    economic conditions, United and other carriers in the industry
    implemented significant reductions in domestic and international
    capacity, which are expected to continue into 2009.

Insurance.

United carries hull and
    liability insurance of a type customary in the air
    transportation industry, in amounts that the Company deems
    appropriate, covering passenger liability, public liability and
    damage to United’s aircraft and other physical property.
    United also maintains other types of insurance such as property,
    directors and officers, cargo, workers’ compensation,
    automobile and the like, with limits and deductibles that are
    standard within the industry. After the September 11, 2001
    terrorist attacks, the Company’s insurance premiums
    increased significantly but have since been reduced reflecting
    the market’s perception of risk, as well as the
    Company’s ongoing capacity reductions. Additionally, after
    September 11, 2001, commercial insurers canceled
    United’s liability insurance for losses resulting from war
    and associated perils (terrorism, sabotage, hijacking and other
    similar events). The U.S. government subsequently agreed to
    provide commercial war-risk insurance for U.S. based
    airlines and has renewed this coverage on a periodic basis. The
    current war-risk policy is effective until March 31, 2009
    and covers losses to employees, passengers, third parties and
    aircraft. The Secretary of Transportation may extend this
    coverage until May 31, 2009. If the U.S. government
    does not extend this coverage beyond March 31, 2009,
    obtaining comparable coverage from commercial underwriters could
    result in substantially higher premiums and more restrictive
    terms, if it is available at all. See “Increases in
    insurance costs or reductions in insurance coverage may
    adversely impact the Company’s operations and financial
    results” in Item 1A,

Risk Factors

, below.

Industry
    Regulation

Domestic
    Regulation.

General.

All carriers engaged in air
    transportation in the U.S. are subject to regulation by the
    DOT. Among its responsibilities, the DOT issues certificates of
    public convenience and necessity for domestic air transportation
    (no air carrier, unless exempted, may provide air transportation
    without a DOT certificate of public convenience and necessity),
    grants international route authorities, approves international
    code share agreements, regulates methods of competition and
    enforces certain consumer protection regulations, such as those
    dealing with advertising, denied boarding compensation and
    baggage liability.

Airlines also are regulated by the Federal Aviation
    Administration (“FAA”), a division of the DOT,
    primarily in the areas of flight operations, maintenance and
    other safety and technical matters. The FAA has authority to
    issue air carrier operating certificates and aircraft
    airworthiness certificates, prescribe maintenance procedures and
    regulate pilot and other employee training, among other
    responsibilities. From time to time, the FAA issues rules that
    require air carriers to take certain actions, such as the
    inspection or modification of aircraft and other equipment, that
    may cause the Company to incur substantial, unplanned expenses.
    The airline industry is also subject to various other federal
    laws and regulations. The U.S. Department of Homeland
    Security (“DHS”) has jurisdiction over virtually all
    aspects of civil aviation security. See

Legislation

,
    below. The U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) has
    jurisdiction over certain airline competition matters. The
    U.S. Postal Service has authority over certain aspects of
    the transportation of mail. Labor relations in the airline
    industry are generally governed by the Railway Labor Act
    (“RLA”). The Company is also subject to inquiries by
    the DOT, FAA and other U.S. and international regulatory
    bodies.

Airport Access.

Access to landing and take-off
    rights, or “slots,” at several major
    U.S. airports and many foreign airports served by United
    are, or recently have been, subject to government regulation.

Domestic slot restrictions currently apply at Washington Reagan
    National Airport in Washington D.C., John F. Kennedy Airport and
    La Guardia Airport, both in New York, and Newark Airport in
    New Jersey. Slot restrictions at O’Hare ceased to apply as
    of November 2008. In 2008, the FAA issued new rules related to
    slots at the three New York City-area airports named above.
    These rules provide for



government confiscation of a portion of slots at each airport
    from incumbent airlines and establish a process whereby those
    slots will be auctioned over the course of five years. The
    confiscation and auction provisions are controversial and are
    currently the subject of litigation in federal appellate court,
    in which carriers serving those airports and the Port Authority
    of New York and New Jersey claim that the FAA lacks legal
    authority to conduct slot auctions. On December 8, 2008,
    the federal appellate court in Washington D.C. stayed the
    auction pending a decision on the challenges to the auction
    process. It is difficult to predict the outcome of that
    litigation. If the slot auction provisions remain in effect,
    United will likely lose a small number of slots at each of the
    three New York City-area airports, however the exact number is
    not yet known. It is not yet clear what impact this might have
    on United’s operations at those airports.

Also in 2008, the DOT finalized amendments to its rates and
    charges policy that grant new authority to U.S. airports to
    implement forms of congestion pricing. The Air Transport
    Association has filed a legal challenge to the amended policy.
    We are currently unaware of any action by an airport to change
    pricing based on the new authority. It is difficult to predict
    whether any given airport might seek to implement this new
    authority and what impact on revenues or costs a change in
    airport charges arising from this policy might have on United.

At the end of 2008, the DOT proposed new regulations intended to
    enhance air passenger protection. If made final as proposed, the
    new regulations would create new areas of regulation and
    potentially permit passengers to sue air carriers should the
    carriers fail to meet certain service performance criteria.

Legislation.

The airline industry is also
    subject to legislative activity that can have an impact on
    operations and costs. Specifically, the law that authorizes
    federal excise taxes and fees assessed on airline tickets
    expired in September 2007 was extended to February 28,
    2008, and extended again until March 31, 2009. Congress is
    currently attempting to pass comprehensive reauthorization
    legislation to impose a new funding structure and make other
    changes to FAA operations. Past aviation reauthorization bills
    have affected a wide range of areas of interest to the industry,
    including air traffic control operations, capacity control
    issues, airline competition issues, aircraft and airport
    technology requirements, safety issues, taxes, fees and other
    funding sources. There also exists the possibility that Congress
    may pass other legislation that could increase labor and
    operating costs. Legislation is expected to focus on outsourced
    maintenance, Family and Medical Leave Act changes and other work
    rules. Climate change legislation, which would regulate
    green-house gas emissions, is also likely to be a significant
    area of legislative and regulatory focus and could adversely
    impact fuel costs. Customer service issues have remained active
    areas for both Congress and DOT regulators during 2008. In
    addition to DOT-proposed customer service regulations discussed
    above, legislation imposing more specific customer service
    requirements is likely to be approved by Congress in 2009,
    though what those requirements might be is unclear at this time.
    The DOT has also proceeded with regulatory changes in this area,
    including proposals regarding treatment of and payments to
    passengers involuntarily denied boarding, domestic baggage
    liability, proposals regarding flight delay reporting
    requirements and airline scheduling practices. Additionally,
    since September 11, 2001, aviation security has been and
    continues to be a subject of frequent legislative and regulatory
    action, requiring changes to the Company’s security
    processes and frequently increasing the cost of its security
    procedures.

International
    Regulation.

General.

International air transportation is
    subject to extensive government regulation. In connection with
    United’s international services, the Company is regulated
    by both the U.S. government and the governments of the
    foreign countries United serves. In addition, the availability
    of international routes to U.S. carriers is regulated by
    aviation agreements between the U.S. and foreign
    governments, and in some cases, fares and schedules require the
    approval of the DOT

and/or

the
    relevant foreign governments.



Airport Access.

Historically, access to
    foreign markets has been tightly controlled through bilateral
    agreements between the U.S. and each foreign country
    involved. These agreements regulate the markets served, the
    number of carriers allowed to serve each market and the
    frequency of carriers’ flights. Since the early 1990s, the
    U.S. has pursued a policy of “open skies”
    (meaning all carriers have access to the destination), under
    which the U.S. government has negotiated a number of
    bilateral agreements allowing unrestricted access between
    U.S. and foreign markets. Additionally, all of the airports
    that United serves in Europe and Asia maintain slot controls,
    and many of these are restrictive due to congestion at these
    airports. London Heathrow, Frankfurt and Tokyo Narita are among
    the most restrictive due to capacity limitations. United has
    significant operations at these locations.

United’s ability to serve some foreign markets and expand
    into certain others is limited by the absence altogether of
    aviation agreements between the U.S. government and the
    relevant governments. Shifts in U.S. or foreign government
    aviation policies can lead to the alteration or termination of
    air service agreements. Depending on the nature of any such
    change, the value of United’s international route
    authorities and slot rights may be materially enhanced or
    diminished.

The U.S./EU open skies agreement became effective in March 2008.
    This agreement replaced the bilateral arrangements between the
    U.S. government and the 27 EU member states. Based on the
    U.S. open skies model, it provides U.S. and EU
    carriers with expansive rights that have increased competition
    in transatlantic markets. For example, U.S. and EU carriers
    now have the right to operate between any point in the
    U.S. and the EU. The Agreement has no direct impact on
    airport slot rights nor does it provide for a reallocation of
    existing slots, including those at London Heathrow. London
    Heathrow currently remains subject to both slot and facility
    constraints.

The agreement provides United with additional commercial
    opportunities since it triggered the effectiveness of
    United’s anti-trust immunity with British carrier bmi,
    creating the potential for increased cooperation between the two
    carriers in the transatlantic market. The DOT had previously
    conditioned the carriers’ immunity upon the entry into
    force of an open skies agreement with the U.K. and the U.S./EU
    agreement satisfies this condition. Because of the diverse
    nature of potential impacts on United’s business, however,
    the overall future impact of the U.S./EU agreement on
    United’s business cannot be predicted with certainty.

Also in 2008, the EU adopted interpretive guidance and
    legislation that will impact the Company. The Commission has
    officially sanctioned secondary slot trading, a current practice
    among carriers that involves the sale, purchase or lease of
    slots. This action resolves disputes about the legality of slot
    exchanges at EU airports including Heathrow. In addition, the EU
    has adopted legislation to include aviation within the EU’s
    existing greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme effective in
    2012. There are significant questions that remain as to the
    legality of applying the scheme to non-EU airlines and the
    U.S. and other governments are considering filing a legal
    challenge to the EU’s unilateral inclusion of non-EU
    carriers. While such a measure could significantly increase the
    costs of carriers operating in the EU, the precise cost to
    United is difficult to calculate with certainty due to a number
    of variables, and it is not clear whether the scheme will
    withstand legal challenge.

Environmental
    Regulation.

The airline industry is subject to increasingly stringent
    federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and
    regulations concerning emissions to the air, discharges to
    surface and subsurface waters, safe drinking water and the
    management of hazardous substances, oils and waste materials.
    New regulations surrounding the emission of greenhouse gases
    (such as carbon dioxide) are being considered for promulgation
    both internationally and within the United States. United is
    carefully evaluating the potential impact of such proposed
    regulations. Other areas of developing regulations include the
    State of California rule-makings regarding air emissions from
    ground support equipment and a federal

rule-making

concerning the discharge of deicing fluid. The airline industry
    is also subject to other environmental laws and regulations,
    including those that require the Company to remediate soil or
    groundwater to meet certain objectives. Compliance with all
    environmental laws and regulations can



require significant expenditures. Under the federal
    Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability
    Act, commonly known as “Superfund,” and similar
    environmental cleanup laws, generators of waste materials and
    owners or operators of facilities, can be subject to liability
    for investigation and remediation costs at locations that have
    been identified as requiring response actions. The Company also
    conducts voluntary environmental assessment and remediation
    actions. Environmental cleanup obligations can arise from, among
    other circumstances, the operation of aircraft fueling
    facilities and primarily involve airport sites. Future costs
    associated with these activities are currently not expected to
    have a material adverse affect on the Company’s business.

Employees

As of December 31, 2008, the Company and its subsidiaries
    had approximately 50,000 active employees, of whom approximately
    83% were represented by various U.S. labor organizations.

During 2008, United’s
    mechanics and related employees elected to change their union
    representation from the Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association
    to the Teamsters. The Teamsters assumed the existing collective
    bargaining agreement between United and this employee group on
    April 1, 2008.

Collective bargaining agreements are negotiated under the RLA,
    which governs labor relations in the air transportation
    industry, and such agreements typically do not contain an
    expiration date. Instead, they specify an amendable date, upon
    which the contract is considered “open for amendment.”
    Contracts remain in effect while new agreements are negotiated.
    During the negotiation period, both the Company and the
    negotiating union are required to maintain the status quo. The
    Company plans to begin negotiations with its labor groups in
    2009.



ITEM 1A.

RISK
    FACTORS.

The following risk factors should be read carefully when
    evaluating the Company’s business and the forward-looking
    statements contained in this report and other statements the
    Company or its representatives make from time to time. Any of
    the following risks could materially adversely affect the
    Company’s business, operating results, financial condition
    and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking
    statements are made in this report.

Risks
    Related to the Company’s Business

The
    Company may be unable to continue to comply with certain
    covenants in its Amended Credit Facility and other agreements
    which, if not complied with, could accelerate repayment of the
    Amended Credit Facility and similarly impact the Company’s
    obligations under certain other agreements, thereby materially
    and adversely affecting the Company’s
    liquidity.

In February 2007, the Company entered into an Amended and
    Restated Revolving Credit, Term Loan and Guaranty Agreement
    dated as of February 2, 2007 with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A,
    Citicorp USA, Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Citigroup
    Global Markets, Inc. and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (the
    “Amended Credit Facility”) after prepaying
    $972 million of its then outstanding credit facility debt.
    The Amended Credit Facility requires compliance with certain
    covenants, which were further amended in May 2008. A summary of
    the current financial covenants includes the following:

The Company must maintain a ratio of EBITDAR to the sum of the
    following fixed charges for such period: (a) cash interest
    expense and (b) cash aircraft operating rental expense.
    EBITDAR represents earnings before interest expense net of
    interest income, income taxes, depreciation, amortization,
    aircraft rent and certain cash and non-cash charges as further
    defined by the Amended Credit Facility. The other adjustments to
    EBITDAR include items such as foreign currency transaction gains
    or losses, increases or decreases in our deferred revenue
    obligation, share-based compensation expense, non-recurring or
    unusual losses, any non-cash non-recurring charge or non-cash
    restructuring charge, a limited amount of cash restructuring
    charges, certain cash transaction costs incurred with financing
    activities and the cumulative effect of a change in accounting
    principle. The requirement to meet this ratio was suspended for
    the four quarters beginning with the second quarter of 2008 and
    ending with the first quarter of 2009, but such requirement
    resumes beginning in the second quarter of 2009. The required
    ratio for the periods ended June 30, 2009,
    September 30, 2009 and December 31, 2009 shall be
    computed based on three months ended June 30, 2009, the six
    months ended September 30, 2009 and the nine months ended
    December 31, 2009, respectively; and, the required ratio in
    subsequent quarters shall be computed based on the twelve months
    preceding each quarter-end. The Company must also maintain a
    minimum unrestricted cash balance of $1.0 billion at any
    time.

Failure to comply with any applicable covenants in effect for
    any reporting period could result in a default under the Amended
    Credit Facility. Additionally, the Amended Credit Facility
    contains a

cross-default

provision with respect to other credit arrangements that exceed
    $50 million. Although the Company was in compliance with
    all required financial covenants as of December 31, 2008,
    and the Company is not required to comply with a fixed charge
    coverage ratio until the three month period ending June 30,
    2009, continued compliance depends on many factors, some of
    which are beyond the Company’s control, including the
    overall industry revenue environment and the level of fuel
    costs. There are no assurances that the Company will continue to
    comply with its Amended Credit Facility covenants. Failure to
    comply with applicable covenants in any reporting period would
    result in a default under the Amended Credit Facility, which
    could have a material adverse impact on the Company depending on
    the Company’s ability to obtain a waiver of, or otherwise
    mitigate, the impact of the default.



The
    Company may be unable to continue to comply with certain
    covenants in agreements with financial institutions that process
    customer credit card transactions which, if not complied with,
    could materially and adversely affect the Company’s
    liquidity.

The Company has agreements with financial institutions that
    process customer credit card transactions for the sale of air
    travel and other services. Under certain of the Company’s
    card processing agreements, the financial institutions either
    require, or have the right to require, that United maintain a
    reserve equal to a portion of advance ticket sales that have
    been processed by that financial institution, but for which the
    Company has not yet provided the air transportation (referred to
    as “relevant advance ticket sales”). As of
    December 31, 2008, the Company had advance ticket sales of
    approximately $1.5 billion of which approximately
    $1.3 billion relates to credit card sales.

In November 2008, United entered into an amendment for its card
    processing agreement with Paymentech and JPMorgan Chase Bank
    (the “Amendment”) that suspends until January 20,
    2010 the requirement for United to maintain additional cash
    reserves with this processor of bank cards (above the current
    cash reserve of $25 million at December 31,
    2008) if United’s month-end balance of unrestricted
    cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments falls below
    $2.5 billion. In exchange for this benefit, United has
    granted the processor a security interest in certain of
    United’s owned aircraft with a current appraised value of
    at least $800 million. United also has agreed that such
    security interest collateralizes not only United’s
    obligations under the processing agreement, but also
    United’s obligations under United’s Amended and
    Restated Co-Branded Card Marketing Services Agreement. United
    has an option to terminate the Amendment prior to
    January 20, 2010, in which event the parties’ prior
    credit card processing reserve arrangements under the processing
    agreement will go back into effect.

After January 20, 2010, or in the event United terminates
    the Amendment, and in addition to certain other risk protections
    provided to the processor, the amount of any such reserve will
    be determined based on the amount of unrestricted cash held by
    the Company as defined under the Amended Credit Facility. If the
    Company’s unrestricted cash balance is more than
    $2.5 billion as of any calendar month-end measurement date,
    its required reserve will remain at $25 million. However,
    if the Company’s unrestricted cash is less than
    $2.5 billion, its required reserve will increase to a
    percentage of relevant advance ticket sales as summarized in the
    following table:

Required % of

Total Unrestricted Cash Balance(a)

Relevant Advance Ticket Sales

Less than $2.5 billion


%

Less than $2.0 billion


%

Less than $1.0 billion


%

(a)

Includes unrestricted cash, cash
    equivalents and short-term investments at month-end, including
    certain cash amounts already held in reserve, as defined by the
    agreement.

If the November 2008 Amendment had not been in effect as of
    December 31, 2008, the Company would have been required to
    post an additional $132 million of reserves based on an
    actual unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term
    investments balance of between $2.0 billion and
    $2.5 billion at December 31, 2008.

United’s card processing agreement with American Express
    expired on February 28, 2009 and was replaced by a new
    agreement on March 1, 2009 which has an initial five year
    term. As of December 31, 2008, there were no required
    reserves under this card agreement, and no reserves were
    required up through the date of expiration.

Under the new agreement, in addition to certain other risk
    protections provided to American Express, the Company will be
    required to provide reserves based primarily on its unrestricted
    cash



balance and net current exposure as of any calendar month-end
    measurement date, as summarized in the following table:

Required % of

Total Unrestricted Cash Balance(a)

Net Current Exposure(b)

Less than $2.4 billion


%

Less than $2.0 billion


%

Less than $1.35 billion


%

Less than $1.2 billion


%

(a)

Includes unrestricted cash, cash
    equivalents and short-term investments at month-end, including
    certain cash amounts already held in reserve, as defined by the
    agreement.

(b)

Net current exposure equals
    relevant advance ticket sales less certain exclusions, and as
    adjusted for specified amounts payable between United and the
    processor, as further defined by the agreement.

The new agreement permits the Company to provide certain
    replacement collateral in lieu of cash collateral, as long as
    the Company’s unrestricted cash is above
    $1.35 billion. Such replacement collateral may be pledged
    for any amount of the required reserve up to the full amount
    thereof, with the stated value of such collateral determined
    according to the agreement. Replacement collateral may be
    comprised of aircraft, slots and routes, real estate or other
    collateral as agreed between the parties.

In the near term, the Company will not be required to post
    reserves under the new American Express agreement as long as
    unrestricted cash as measured at each month-end, and as defined
    in the agreement, is equal to or above $2.0 billion.

If the terms of the new agreement had been in place at
    December 31, 2008, and ignoring the near term protection in
    the preceding sentence, the Company would have been required to
    provide collateral of approximately $40 million.

An increase in the future reserve requirements as provided by
    the terms of either or both the Company’s material card
    processing agreements could materially reduce the Company’s
    liquidity.

The
    Company may not be able to maintain adequate
    liquidity.

While the Company’s cash flows from operations and its
    available capital have been sufficient to meet its current
    operating expenses, lease obligations and debt service
    requirements to date, the Company’s future liquidity could
    be negatively impacted by many factors including, but not
    limited to, substantial volatility in the price of fuel,
    declines in passenger and cargo demand associated with the weak
    global economy and deterioration of global financial systems.
    During 2008, particularly in the fourth quarter, the Company
    experienced weaker demand for its services due to the current
    economic conditions. Decreases in passenger and cargo demand
    resulting from a weak global economy have resulted in both lower
    passenger volumes and lower ticket fares, which have adversely
    impacted our liquidity and are expected to adversely impact our
    results of operations and liquidity in 2009. In addition, the
    Company’s 2008 and planned 2009 capacity cuts may not be
    sufficient to address lower demand from a weak global economy.
    See “Economic and industry conditions constantly change and
    continued or worsening negative economic conditions in the
    United States and elsewhere may have a material adverse effect
    on our business and results of operations,” below, for
    further discussion of the adverse impacts of a weak economy on
    our operations.

In 2008, fuel price changes had a more significant impact on
    liquidity than changes in demand for the Company’s products
    and services. For example, the crude oil spot price rose to a
    record high of approximately $145 per barrel in July 2008. The
    Company’s consolidated fuel cost, including the impact of
    fuel hedges, increased by more than $3.1 billion for the
    full year of 2008 as compared to 2007 primarily due to increased
    fuel prices, resulting in a significant negative impact on
    liquidity. Furthermore, fuel prices continue to be extremely
    volatile which may negatively impact the Company’s
    liquidity. Additionally, the Company’s fuel hedges require
    that it post cash collateral with applicable counterparties if
    crude oil prices change by specified amounts. The Company
    provided cash collateral of



$965 million to its fuel derivative counterparties as of
    December 31, 2008, which decreased to $780 million as
    of January 19, 2009 primarily due to the settlement of
    December 2008 contracts. For more information on our aircraft
    fuel hedges, see Note 13, “Fair Value Measurements and
    Derivative Instruments,” in

Combined Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements

and Item 7A,

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market
    Risk.

The Company’s current plans to address increased fuel
    prices and the weak global economy may not be successful in
    improving its results of operations and liquidity. In addition,
    the implementation of certain of these plans require the use of
    cash for such items as severance payments, lease termination
    fees, conversion of Ted aircraft and facility closure costs,
    among others. These cash requirements reduce the Company’s
    cash available for its ongoing operations. In addition, the
    economic downturn may have an adverse impact on travel demand,
    which may result in a negative impact on revenues and liquidity.

As described above, the Company is required to comply with
    certain financial covenants under its Amended Credit Facility
    and certain of its credit card processing agreements. The
    factors noted above, among other things, may impair the
    Company’s ability to comply with these covenants or could
    allow certain of our credit card processors to increase the
    required reserves on our advance ticket sales, which could have
    an adverse impact on the Company’s financial position and
    liquidity, depending on its ability to obtain a waiver of, or
    otherwise mitigate, the impact of the default. If a default
    occurs under our Amended Credit Facility, the cost to cure any
    such default may adversely impact our financial position and
    liquidity.

Our level of indebtedness, our non-investment grade credit
    rating and the current unfavorable credit market conditions may
    make it difficult for us to raise capital to meet liquidity
    needs and may increase our cost of borrowing. A higher cost of
    capital could negatively impact our results of operations,
    financial position and liquidity.

See Item 7,

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations

for further
    information regarding the Company’s liquidity.

Economic
    and industry conditions constantly change and continued or
    worsening negative economic conditions in the United States and
    elsewhere may have a material adverse effect on our business and
    results of operations.

Our business and results of operations are significantly
    impacted by general economic and industry conditions.
    Industry-wide passenger air travel varies from year to year.
    Robust demand for our air transportation services depends
    largely on favorable general economic conditions, including the
    strength of the global and local economies, low unemployment
    levels, strong consumer confidence levels and the availability
    of consumer and business credit. For leisure travelers, air
    transportation is often a discretionary purchase that those
    consumers can eliminate from their spending in difficult
    economic times. In addition, during periods of poor economic
    conditions, businesses usually reduce the volume of their
    business travel, either due to cost-savings initiatives or as a
    result of decreased business activity requiring travel. The
    overall demand for air transportation in the U.S. has been
    negatively impacted by adverse changes and continued
    deterioration in the health of the U.S. and global
    economies which negatively impacted our results of operations
    for the year ended December 31, 2008, and could continue to
    have a significant negative impact on our future results of
    operations for an extended period of time. Since the end of
    2008, the outlook for key economic indicators has deteriorated
    and credit card activity and advance bookings have not been as
    strong as in the prior year. These factors are expected to
    negatively impact the Company’s 2009 passenger and cargo
    revenues. In addition, decreases in cargo revenues due to lower
    demand have a disproportionate impact on our operating results
    as our cargo revenues generally have higher margins as compared
    to our passenger revenues. Continuation or worsening of the
    current global recession may lead the Company and other carriers
    to further reduce domestic or international capacity and may
    have a material adverse effect on the Company’s revenues,
    results of operations and liquidity.



Continued
    periods of historically high fuel costs or significant
    disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel could have a material
    adverse impact on the Company’s operating
    results.

The Company’s operating results have been, and continue to
    be, significantly impacted by changes in the supply or price of
    aircraft fuel, both of which are impossible to predict. The
    record-high fuel prices each year from 2005 through 2007
    increased in 2008 to new record highs with the crude oil spot
    price reaching highs of approximately $145 per barrel in July of
    2008. At times, United has not been able to increase its fares
    when fuel prices have risen due to the highly competitive nature
    of the airline industry, and it may not be able to do so in the
    future and such increases may not be sustainable in the highly
    competitive environment. In addition, fare increases may not
    totally offset the fuel price increase and may also reduce
    demand for air travel. From time to time, the Company enters
    into hedging arrangements to protect against rising fuel costs.
    The Company’s hedging programs may use significant amounts
    of cash due to posting of cash collateral in some circumstances,
    may not be successful in controlling fuel costs and may be
    limited due to market conditions and other factors. See
    Note 13, “Fair Value Measurements and Derivative
    Instruments,” in

Combined Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements

for additional information on the
    Company’s hedging programs.

Additional
    terrorist attacks or the fear of such attacks, even if not made
    directly on the airline industry, could negatively affect the
    Company and the airline industry.

The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 involving
    commercial aircraft severely and adversely impacted the
    Company’s financial condition and results of operations, as
    well as prospects for the airline industry generally. Among the
    effects experienced from the September 11, 2001 terrorist
    attacks were substantial flight disruption costs caused by the
    FAA-imposed temporary grounding of the U.S. airline
    industry’s fleet, significantly increased security costs
    and associated passenger inconvenience, increased insurance
    costs, substantially higher ticket refunds and significantly
    decreased traffic and revenue per revenue passenger mile
    (“yield”).

Additional terrorist attacks, even if not made directly on the
    airline industry, or the fear of or the precautions taken in
    anticipation of such attacks (including elevated national threat
    warnings or selective cancellation or redirection of flights)
    could materially and adversely affect the Company and the
    airline industry. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and
    additional international hostilities, including heightened
    terrorist activity, could also have a material adverse impact on
    the Company’s financial condition, liquidity and results of
    operations. The Company’s financial resources might not be
    sufficient to absorb the adverse effects of any further
    terrorist attacks or other international hostilities involving
    the United States or U.S. interests.

The
    airline industry is highly competitive, susceptible to price
    discounting and may undergo further bankruptcy restructuring or
    industry consolidation.

The U.S. airline industry is characterized by substantial
    price competition, especially in domestic markets. Some of our
    competitors have substantially greater financial resources or
    lower-cost structures than United does, or both. In recent
    years, the market share held by low-cost carriers has increased
    significantly. Large network carriers, like United, have often
    had a lack of pricing power within domestic markets.

During 2008, Aloha Airlines, ATA Airlines, Eos Airlines, Inc.,
    Frontier Airlines and Skybus Airlines all filed for bankruptcy
    protection. Other domestic and international carriers could
    restructure in bankruptcy or threaten to do so to reduce their
    costs. Carriers operating under bankruptcy protection can
    operate in a manner that could be adverse to the Company and
    could emerge from bankruptcy as more vigorous competitors.

During 2008, the U.S. airline industry underwent
    consolidation with the merger of Delta Airlines, Inc. and
    Northwest Airlines. There is ongoing speculation that further
    airline industry consolidation could occur in the future. United
    routinely monitors changes in the competitive landscape and
    engages in analysis and discussions regarding its strategic
    position, including alliances, asset acquisitions and



divestitures and business combinations. In 2008, the Company
    announced its agreement to form a strategic alliance with
    Continental Airlines. This alliance may not realize all of the
    benefits of a merger. The Company may have future discussions
    with other airlines regarding mergers

and/or

other
    strategic alternatives. If other airlines participate in merger
    activity, and United does not, those airlines may significantly
    improve their cost structures or revenue generation
    capabilities, thereby potentially making them stronger
    competitors of United.

In addition, United and certain of its competitors announced
    significant capacity reductions during 2008. The Company may not
    achieve necessary increases in unit revenue from the announced
    capacity reductions and unit costs may be adversely impacted by
    capacity reductions. Further, certain of the Company’s
    competitors may not reduce capacity or may increase capacity,
    thereby diminishing our expected benefit from capacity
    reductions. The poor economic environment may have an adverse
    impact on travel demand, which may result in a negative impact
    on revenues.

Additional
    security requirements may increase the Company’s costs and
    decrease its revenues and traffic.

Since September 11, 2001, the DHS and the Transportation
    Security Administration have implemented numerous security
    measures that affect airline operations and costs and are likely
    to implement additional measures in the future. In addition,
    foreign governments have also instituted additional security
    measures at foreign airports United serves. A substantial
    portion of the costs of these security measures is borne by the
    airlines and their passengers, increasing the Company’s
    costs

and/or

reducing its revenue and traffic. Additional measures taken to
    enhance either passenger or cargo security procedures

and/or

to
    recover associated costs in the future may result in similar
    adverse effects on United’s results of operations.

Extensive
    government regulation could increase the Company’s
    operating costs and restrict its ability to conduct its
    business.

Airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal
    compliance requirements that result in significant costs. In
    addition to the enactment of the Aviation Security Act, laws,
    regulations, taxes and airport rates and charges have been
    proposed from time to time that could significantly increase the
    cost of airline operations or reduce airline revenue. The FAA
    from time to time also issues directives and other regulations
    relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft that
    require significant expenditures by United. The Company expects
    to continue incurring material expenses to comply with the
    regulations of the FAA and other agencies.

United operates under a certificate of public convenience and
    necessity issued by the DOT. If the DOT altered, amended,
    modified, suspended or revoked our certificate, it could have a
    material adverse effect on the Company’s business. The FAA
    can also limit United’s airport access by limiting the
    number of departure and arrival slots at “high density
    traffic airports” and local airport authorities may have
    the ability to control access to certain facilities or the cost
    of access to such facilities, which could have an adverse effect
    on the Company’s business.

In addition, access to landing and take-off rights or
    “slots” at several major U.S. airports and many
    foreign airports served by United are, or recently have been,
    subject to government regulation. As passenger travel has
    continued to increase in recent years, many U.S. and
    foreign airports have become increasingly congested. Certain of
    United’s major hubs are among the more congested airports
    in the U.S. and have been or could be the subject of
    regulatory action that might limit the number of flights

and/or

increase costs of operations at certain times or throughout the
    day.

In addition, the Company’s operations may be adversely
    impacted due to the existing outdated air traffic control
    (“ATC”) system utilized by the U.S. government.
    During peak travel periods in certain markets the current ATC
    system’s inability to handle existing travel demand has led
    to short-term capacity constraints imposed by government
    agencies, as discussed above, and has also resulted in delays
    and disruptions of traffic using the ATC system. In addition,
    the current system will not be able to effectively handle
    projected future air traffic growth. Therefore, imposition of
    these ATC constraints on



a long-term basis may have a material adverse effect on our
    results of operations. Failure to update the ATC system in a
    timely manner, and the substantial funding requirements of a
    modernized ATC system that may be imposed on carriers like
    United, may have an adverse impact on the Company’s
    financial condition or results of operations.

Many aspects of United’s operations are also subject to
    increasingly stringent federal, state and local laws protecting
    the environment. Future environmental regulatory developments,
    such as in regard to climate change, in the U.S. and abroad
    could adversely affect operations and increase operating costs
    in the airline industry. There are a few climate change laws and
    regulations that have gone into effect that apply to United,
    including environmental taxes for certain international flights,
    some limited greenhouse gas reporting requirements and some
    land-based planning laws which could apply to airports and
    ultimately impact airlines depending upon the circumstances. In
    addition, the EU has adopted legislation to include aviation
    within the EU’s existing greenhouse gas emission trading
    scheme effective in 2012. There are significant questions that
    remain as to the legality of applying the scheme to non-EU
    airlines and the U.S. and other governments are considering
    filing a legal challenge to the EU’s unilateral inclusion
    of non-EU carriers. While such a measure could significantly
    increase the costs of carriers operating in the EU, the precise
    cost to United is difficult to calculate with certainty due to a
    number of variables, and it is not clear whether the scheme will
    withstand legal challenge. There may be future regulatory
    actions taken by the U.S. government, state governments
    within the U.S., foreign governments, the International Civil
    Aviation Organization, or through a new climate change treaty to
    regulate the emission of greenhouse gases by the aviation
    industry. Such future regulatory actions are uncertain at this
    time (in terms of either the regulatory requirements or their
    applicability to United), but the impact to the Company and its
    industry would likely be adverse and could be significant
    including the potential for increased fuel costs, carbon taxes
    or fees or a requirement to purchase carbon credits.

The ability of U.S. carriers to operate international
    routes is subject to change because the applicable arrangements
    between the United States and foreign governments may be amended
    from time to time, or because appropriate slots or facilities
    may not be made available. United currently operates on a number
    of international routes under government arrangements that limit
    the number of carriers, capacity, or the number of carriers
    allowed access to particular airports. If an open skies policy
    were to be adopted for any of these routes, such an event could
    have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial
    position and results of operations and could result in the
    impairment of material amounts of related tangible and
    intangible assets.

Certain aspects of United’s proposed cooperation with
    Continental through broad revenue and codesharing and other
    commercial cooperation and Continental’s entry into the
    Star Alliance is subject to receipt of certain regulatory and
    other approvals and the termination of certain contractual
    relationships, including Continental’s existing agreements
    with SkyTeam members that restrict its participation in another
    global alliance. The parties may not be successful in obtaining
    regulatory approval or the timing for termination of existing
    contractual relationships may be delayed.

The Company’s plans to enter into or expand antitrust
    immunized joint ventures for various international regions,
    involving Continental, United and other members of the Star
    Alliance are subject to receipt of approvals from applicable
    national authorities or otherwise satisfying applicable
    regulatory requirements, and there can be no assurances that
    such approvals will be granted or applicable regulatory
    requirements will be satisfied. Other air carriers are also
    seeking to initiate or expand antitrust immunity for joint
    ventures which, if approved, could adversely affect the
    Company’s financial position and results of operations.

Further, the Company’s operations in foreign countries are
    subject to a variety of laws and regulations in those countries.
    The Company cannot provide any assurance that current laws and
    regulations, or laws or regulations enacted in the future, will
    not adversely affect its financial condition or results of
    operations.



The
    Company’s results of operations fluctuate due to
    seasonality and other factors associated with the airline
    industry.

Due to greater demand for air travel during the summer months,
    revenues in the airline industry in the second and third
    quarters of the year are generally stronger than revenues in the
    first and fourth quarters of the year. The Company’s
    results of operations generally reflect this seasonality, but
    have also been impacted by numerous other factors that are not
    necessarily seasonal including, among others, the imposition of
    excise and similar taxes, extreme or severe weather, air traffic
    control congestion, changes in the competitive environment due
    to industry consolidation and other factors and general economic
    conditions. As a result, the Company’s quarterly operating
    results are not necessarily indicative of operating results for
    an entire year and historical operating results in a quarterly
    or annual period are not necessarily indicative of future
    operating results.

The
    Company may never realize the full value of its intangible
    assets or our long-lived assets causing it to record impairments
    that may negatively affect its results of
    operations.

In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

(“SFAS 142”) and Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 144,

Accounting for the
    Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,

(“SFAS 144”), the Company is required to test
    certain of its intangible assets for impairment on an annual
    basis on October 1 of each year, or more frequently if
    conditions indicate that an impairment may have occurred. In
    addition, the Company is required to test certain of its
    tangible assets for impairment if conditions indicate that an
    impairment may have occurred.

During the second quarter of 2008, the Company performed an
    interim impairment test of its goodwill, all indefinite-lived
    intangible assets and certain of its long-lived assets
    (principally aircraft and related spare engines and spare parts)
    due to events and changes in circumstances that indicated an
    impairment might have occurred. Factors deemed by management to
    have collectively constituted a potential impairment triggering
    event included record high fuel prices, significant losses in
    2008, a softening U.S. economy, analyst downgrade of UAL
    common stock, rating agency changes in outlook for the
    Company’s debt instruments from stable to negative, the
    announcement in 2008 of the planned removal from UAL’s
    fleet of 100 aircraft and a significant decrease in the fair
    value of the Company’s outstanding equity and debt
    securities during 2008, including a decline in UAL’s market
    capitalization to significantly below book value.

During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company performed its
    annual impairment test of intangible assets and determined that
    no additional impairment had occurred. In addition, due to
    certain conditions similar to those which triggered the second
    quarter 2008 impairment testing, in the fourth quarter of 2008,
    the Company tested its B737 and B747 aircraft for additional
    impairment during the fourth quarter, including evaluating the
    fair value of those aircraft already removed from service, which
    resulted in additional impairment charges being recorded in the
    fourth quarter.

As a result of the impairment testing performed in the second
    and fourth quarters of 2008, the Company recorded goodwill and
    tangible and intangible asset impairment charges totaling
    approximately $2.6 billion during 2008. The Company
    determined that goodwill was completely impaired. However, the
    Company still has book values at December 31, 2008 of
    approximately $10.3 billion of operating property and
    equipment and $2.7 billion of intangible assets that could
    be subject to future impairment charges. We may be required to
    recognize additional impairments in the future due to, among
    other factors, extreme fuel price volatility, tight credit
    markets, a decline in the fair value of certain tangible or
    intangible assets, unfavorable trends in historical or
    forecasted operating or cash flow losses and the uncertain
    economic environment, as well as other uncertainties. The
    Company can provide no assurance that a material impairment
    charge of tangible or intangible assets will not occur in a
    future period. The value of our aircraft could be impacted in
    future periods by changes in the market for these aircraft. Such
    changes could result in a greater supply and lower demand for
    certain aircraft types as other



carriers are also grounding aircraft. An impairment charge could
    have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial
    position and results of operations in the period of recognition.

The
    Company’s initiatives to improve the delivery of its
    products and services to its customers, reduce costs, increase
    its revenues and increase shareholder value, including the
    operational plans recently initiated by the Company, may not be
    adequate or successful.

The Company continues to identify and implement improvement
    programs to enhance the delivery of its products and services to
    its customers, reduce its costs and increase its revenues. In
    response to the unprecedented increase in fuel prices during
    2008 and the weakening U.S. and global economies, the
    Company began implementing certain operational plans. The
    Company’s efforts are focused on cost savings in areas such
    as telecommunications, airport services, catering, maintenance
    materials, aircraft ground handling and regional affiliates
    expenses, among others. In addition, the Company is
    significantly reducing mainline domestic and consolidated
    capacity and is removing 100 aircraft from its mainline fleet,
    including its entire B737 fleet of 94 aircraft and six B747
    aircraft. United is also eliminating its Ted product and
    reconfiguring that fleet’s 56 A320s to include United First
    class seats. See Item 7,

Management’s Discussion
    and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

for further information regarding the Company’s
    capacity reductions. The Company will continue to review the
    deployment of all of our aircraft in various markets and the
    overall composition of our fleet to ensure that we are using our
    assets appropriately to provide the best available return. In
    connection with the capacity reductions, the Company is further
    streamlining its operations and corporate functions in order to
    match the size of its workforce to the size of its operations.
    The Company currently estimates a reduction of approximately
    9,000 positions during 2008 and 2009, through a combination of
    furloughs and furlough-mitigation plans, such as early-out
    options. There can be no assurance that the Company’s
    initiatives to reduce costs and increase revenues will be
    successful.

The Company is taking additional actions beyond the operational
    plans discussed above, including increased cost reductions, new
    revenue sources and other actions. Certain of the Company’s
    plans to improve its performance require the use of significant
    cash for such items as severance payments, lease termination
    fees, conversion of Ted aircraft and facility closure costs,
    among others. The Company is also reviewing strategic
    alternatives to maximize the value of its assets and its
    businesses, which may include a possible sale of all, or part
    of, these assets or operations. There can be no assurance that
    any transactions with respect to these assets or operations will
    occur, nor are there any assurances with respect to the form or
    timing of any such transactions or their actual effect on
    shareholder value. A number of the Company’s ongoing
    initiatives involve significant changes to the Company’s
    business that it may be unable to implement successfully. In
    addition, revenue and other initiatives may not be successful
    due to the competitive landscape of the industry and the
    reaction of our competitors to certain of our initiatives. The
    adequacy and ultimate success of the Company’s programs and
    initiatives to improve the delivery of its products and services
    to its customers, reduce its costs and increase both its
    revenues and shareholder value cannot be assured.

Union
    disputes, employee strikes and other labor-related disruptions
    may adversely affect the Company’s operations and impair
    its financial performance.

Approximately 83% of the employees of UAL are represented for
    collective bargaining purposes by U.S. labor unions. These
    employees are organized into six labor groups represented by six
    different unions.

Relations between air carriers and labor unions in the United
    States are governed by the RLA. Under the RLA, a carrier must
    maintain the existing terms and conditions of employment
    following the amendable date through a multi-stage and usually
    lengthy series of bargaining processes overseen by the National
    Mediation Board (“NMB”). This process continues until
    either the parties have reached agreement on a new collective
    bargaining agreement or the parties are released to
    “self-help” by the NMB. Although in most circumstances
    the RLA prohibits strikes, shortly after release by the NMB,
    carriers and unions are free to engage in self-help measures
    such as strikes and lock-outs. All six of the



Company’s U.S. labor agreements become amendable in
    January 2010, with negotiations between the Company and the
    labor unions scheduled to commence during 2009. The Company can
    provide no assurance that a successful or timely resolution of
    labor negotiations for all amendable agreements will be
    achieved. There is also a risk that dissatisfied employees,
    either with or without union involvement, could engage in
    illegal slow-downs, work stoppages, partial work stoppages,
    sick-outs or other actions short of a full strike that could
    individually or collectively harm the operation of the airline
    and materially impair its financial performance.

Increases
    in insurance costs or reductions in insurance coverage may
    adversely impact the Company’s operations and financial
    results.

The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 led to a
    significant increase in insurance premiums and a decrease in the
    insurance coverage available to commercial airlines.
    Accordingly, the Company’s insurance costs increased
    significantly and its ability to continue to obtain certain
    types of insurance remains uncertain. The Company has obtained
    third-party war risk (terrorism) insurance through a special
    program administered by the FAA, resulting in lower premiums
    than if it had obtained this insurance in the commercial
    insurance market. Should the government discontinue this
    coverage, obtaining comparable coverage from commercial
    underwriters could result in substantially higher premiums and
    more restrictive terms, if it is available at all. If the
    Company is unable to obtain adequate war risk insurance, its
    business could be materially and adversely affected.

If any of United’s aircraft were to be involved in an
    accident, the Company could be exposed to significant liability.
    The insurance it carries to cover damages arising from any
    future accidents may be inadequate. If the Company’s
    insurance is not adequate, it may be forced to bear substantial
    losses from an accident.

The
    Company relies heavily on automated systems to operate its
    business and any significant failure of these systems could harm
    its business.

The Company depends on automated systems to operate its
    business, including its computerized airline reservation
    systems, flight operations systems, telecommunication systems
    and commercial websites, including united.com. United’s
    website and reservation systems must be able to accommodate a
    high volume of traffic and deliver important flight and schedule
    information, as well as process critical financial transactions.
    Substantial or repeated website, reservations systems or
    telecommunication systems failures could reduce the
    attractiveness of United’s services versus its competitors
    and materially impair its ability to market its services and
    operate its flights.

The
    Company’s business relies extensively on third-party
    providers. Failure of these parties to perform as expected, or
    unexpected interruptions in the Company’s relationships
    with these providers or their provision of services to the
    Company, could have an adverse effect on its financial condition
    and results of operations.

The Company has engaged a growing number of third-party service
    providers to perform a large number of functions that are
    integral to its business, such as operation of United Express
    flights, operation of customer service call centers, provision
    of information technology infrastructure and services, provision
    of aircraft maintenance and repairs, provision of various
    utilities and performance of aircraft fueling operations, among
    other vital functions and services. The Company does not
    directly control these third-party providers, although it does
    enter into agreements with many of them that define expected
    service performance. Any of these third-party providers,
    however, may materially fail to meet their service performance
    commitments to the Company. The failure of these providers to
    adequately perform their service obligations, or other
    unexpected interruptions of services, may reduce the
    Company’s revenues and increase its expenses or prevent
    United from operating its flights and providing other services
    to its customers. In addition, the Company’s business and
    financial performance could be materially harmed if its
    customers believe that its services are unreliable or
    unsatisfactory.



The
    Company’s high level of fixed obligations could limit its
    ability to fund general corporate requirements and obtain
    additional financing, could limit its flexibility in responding
    to competitive developments and could increase its vulnerability
    to adverse economic and industry conditions.

The Company has a significant amount of financial leverage from
    fixed obligations, including its amended credit facility,
    aircraft lease and debt financings, leases of airport property
    and other facilities, and other material cash obligations. In
    addition, as of December 31, 2008, the Company had pledged
    a substantial amount of its assets as collateral to secure its
    various fixed obligations. The Company’s high level of
    fixed obligations, a downgrade in the Company’s credit
    ratings or poor credit market conditions could impair its
    ability to obtain additional financing, if needed, and reduce
    its flexibility to conduct its business. Certain of the
    Company’s existing indebtedness also requires it to meet
    covenants and financial tests to maintain ongoing access to
    those borrowings. See Note 12, “Debt Obligations and
    Card Processing Agreements,” in

Combined Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements

for further details
    related to the Company’s credit agreements and assets
    pledged as collateral. A failure to timely pay its debts or
    other material uncured breach of its contractual obligations
    could result in a variety of adverse consequences, including the
    acceleration of the Company’s indebtedness, the withholding
    of credit card sale proceeds by its credit card service
    providers and the exercise of other remedies by its creditors
    and equipment lessors that could result in material adverse
    effects on the Company’s operations and financial
    condition. In such a situation, it is unlikely that the Company
    would be able to fulfill its obligations to repay the
    accelerated indebtedness, make required lease payments, or
    otherwise cover its fixed costs.

The
    Company’s net operating loss carry forward may be limited
    or possibly eliminated.

As of December 31, 2008, the Company had a net operating
    loss (“NOL”) carry forward tax benefit of
    approximately $2.6 billion for federal and state income tax
    purposes that primarily originated before UAL’s emergence
    from bankruptcy and will expire over a five to twenty year
    period. This tax benefit is mostly attributable to federal
    pre-tax NOL carry forwards of $7.0 billion. If the Company
    were to have a change of ownership within the meaning of
    Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, under certain
    conditions, its annual federal NOL utilization could be limited
    to an amount equal to its market capitalization at the time of
    the ownership change multiplied by the federal long-term tax
    exempt rate. A change of ownership under Section 382 of the
    Internal Revenue Code is defined as a cumulative change of
    50 percentage points or more in the ownership positions of
    certain stockholders owning 5% or more of the Company’s
    common stock over a three year rolling period.

To reduce the risk of a potential adverse effect on the
    Company’s ability to utilize its NOL carry forward for
    federal income tax purposes, UAL’s restated certificate of
    incorporation contains a “5% Ownership Limitation,”
    applicable to all stockholders except the Pension Benefit
    Guaranty Corporation (“PBGC”). The 5% Ownership
    Limitation remains effective until February 1, 2011. The 5%
    Ownership Limitation prohibits (i) the acquisition by a
    single stockholder of shares representing 5% or more of the
    common stock of UAL Corporation and (ii) any acquisition or
    disposition of common stock by a stockholder that already owns
    5% or more of UAL Corporation’s common stock, unless prior
    written approval is granted by the UAL Board of Directors. The
    percentage ownership of a single stockholder can be computed by
    dividing the number of shares of common stock held by the
    stockholder by the sum of the shares of common stock issued and
    outstanding plus the number of shares of common stock still held
    in reserve for payment to unsecured creditors under the Plan of
    Reorganization. For additional information regarding the 5%
    Ownership Limitation, please refer to UAL’s restated
    certificate available on its website.

While the purpose of these transfer restrictions is to prevent a
    change of ownership from occurring within the meaning of
    Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (which ownership
    change might materially and adversely affect the Company’s
    ability to utilize its NOL carry forward or other tax
    attributes), no assurance can be given that such an ownership
    change will not occur, in which case the availability of the
    Company’s substantial NOL carry forward and other federal
    income tax attributes might be significantly limited or possibly
    eliminated. Any transfers of common stock that are made in
    violation of the restrictions set forth above will be void and,
    pursuant to UAL’s restated certificate of



incorporation, will be treated as if such transfer never
    occurred. This provision may prevent a sale of common stock by a
    stockholder or adversely affect the price at which a stockholder
    can sell common stock and consequently make it more difficult
    for a stockholder to sell shares of common stock. In addition,
    this limitation may have the effect of delaying or preventing a
    change in control of UAL, creating a perception that a change in
    control cannot occur or otherwise discouraging takeover attempts
    that some stockholders may consider beneficial, which could also
    adversely affect the prevailing market price of the common
    stock. UAL cannot predict the effect that this provision in the
    UAL restated certificate of incorporation may have on the market
    price of the common stock.

The
    Company is subject to economic and political instability and
    other risks of doing business globally.

The Company is a global business with operations outside of the
    United States from which it derives approximately one-third of
    its operating revenues, as measured and reported to the DOT. The
    Company’s operations in Asia, Latin America, the Middle
    East and Europe are a vital part of its worldwide airline
    network. Volatile economic, political and market conditions in
    these international regions may have a negative impact on the
    Company’s operating results and its ability to achieve its
    business objectives. In addition, significant or volatile
    changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other
    currencies, and the imposition of exchange controls or other
    currency restrictions, may have a material adverse impact upon
    the Company’s liquidity, revenues, costs and operating
    results.

The
    Company could be adversely affected by an outbreak of a disease
    that affects travel behavior.

An outbreak of a disease that affects travel demand or travel
    behavior, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
    (“SARS”) or avian flu, or other illness, could have a
    material adverse impact on the Company’s business,
    financial condition and results of operations.

Certain
    provisions of UAL’s Governance Documents could discourage
    or delay changes of control or changes to the Board of Directors
    of UAL.

Certain provisions of the amended and restated certificate of
    incorporation and amended and restated bylaws of UAL (the
    “Governance Documents”) may make it difficult for
    stockholders to change the composition of UAL’s Board of
    Directors and may discourage takeover attempts that some of its
    stockholders may consider beneficial.

Certain provisions of the Governance Documents may have the
    effect of delaying or preventing changes in control if
    UAL’s Board of Directors determines that such changes in
    control are not in the best interests of UAL and its
    stockholders.

These provisions of the Governance Documents are not intended to
    prevent a takeover, but are intended to protect and maximize the
    value of UAL’s stockholders’ interests. While these
    provisions have the effect of encouraging persons seeking to
    acquire control of UAL to negotiate with the UAL Board of
    Directors, they could enable the Board of Directors to prevent a
    transaction that some, or a majority, of its stockholders might
    believe to be in their best interests and, in that case, may
    prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent
    directors.

The
    issuance of UAL’s contingent senior unsecured notes could
    adversely impact results of operations, liquidity and financial
    position and could cause dilution to the interests of its
    existing stockholders.

In connection with the Company’s emergence from
    Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, UAL is obligated under an
    indenture to issue to the PBGC 8% senior unsecured notes
    with an aggregate principal amount of up to $500 million in
    up to eight equal tranches of $62.5 million (with no more
    than one tranche issued as a result of each issuance trigger
    event) upon the occurrence of certain financial triggering
    events. An issuance trigger event occurs when the Company’s
    EBITDAR (as defined in the indenture) exceeds $3.5 billion
    over the prior twelve months ending June 30 or December 31 of
    any applicable fiscal year, beginning with the fiscal year
    ending December 31, 2009 and ending with the fiscal year
    ending December 31, 2017. However, if the issuance of a
    tranche would cause a default under any



other securities then existing, UAL may satisfy its obligations
    with respect to such tranche by issuing UAL common stock having
    a market value equal to $62.5 million. The issuance of
    these notes could adversely impact the Company’s results of
    operations because of increased interest expense related to the
    notes and adversely impact its financial position or liquidity
    due to increased cash required to meet interest and principal
    payments. If common stock is issued in lieu of debt, this could
    cause additional dilution to existing UAL stockholders. See
    Risks Related to UAL’s Common Stock, below, for additional
    information regarding other risks related to our common stock.

Risks
    Related to UAL’s Common Stock

The
    issuance of additional shares of UAL’s common stock,
    including upon conversion of its convertible notes, could cause
    dilution to the interests of its existing
    stockholders.

In connection with the Company’s emergence from
    Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, UAL issued approximately
    $150 million in convertible 5% notes and subsequently
    issued approximately $726 million in convertible
    4.5% notes on July 25, 2006. Holders of these
    securities may convert them into shares of UAL’s common
    stock according to their terms. See Note 12, “Debt
    Obligations and Card Processing Agreements,” in

Combined
    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

for further
    information regarding these instruments.

UAL’s certificate of incorporation authorizes up to one
    billion shares of common stock. In certain circumstances, UAL
    can issue shares of common stock without stockholder approval.
    In the fourth quarter of 2008, the UAL Board of Directors
    approved the issuance of $200 million of common stock as
    part of an ongoing equity offering by the Company. UAL issued
    11.2 million shares of common stock during 2008 and
    4.0 million shares during 2009, resulting in gross proceeds
    of $172 million, and may issue additional shares during
    2009 until it reaches $200 million in proceeds. In
    addition, the UAL Board of Directors is authorized to issue up
    to 250 million shares of preferred stock without any action
    on the part of UAL’s stockholders. The UAL Board of
    Directors also has the power, without stockholder approval, to
    set the terms of any series of shares of preferred stock that
    may be issued, including voting rights, conversion rights,
    dividend rights, preferences over UAL’s common stock with
    respect to dividends or if UAL liquidates, dissolves or winds up
    its business and other terms. If UAL issues preferred stock in
    the future that has a preference over its common stock with
    respect to the payment of dividends or upon its liquidation,
    dissolution or winding up, or if UAL issues preferred stock with
    voting rights that dilute the voting power of its common stock,
    the rights of holders of its common stock or the market price of
    its common stock could be adversely affected. UAL is also
    authorized to issue, without stockholder approval, other
    securities convertible into either preferred stock or, in
    certain circumstances, common stock. In the future UAL may
    decide to raise additional capital through offerings of its
    common stock, securities convertible into its common stock, or
    rights to acquire these securities or its common stock. The
    issuance of additional shares of common stock or securities
    convertible into common stock could result in dilution of
    existing stockholders’ equity interests in UAL. Issuances
    of substantial amounts of its common stock, or the perception
    that such issuances could occur, may adversely affect prevailing
    market prices for UAL’s common stock and UAL cannot predict
    the effect this dilution may have on the price of its common
    stock.

UAL’s
    certificate of incorporation limits voting rights of certain
    foreign persons.

UAL’s restated certificate of incorporation limits the
    total number of shares of equity securities held by persons who
    are not “citizens of the United States,” as defined in
    Section 40102(a)(15) of Title 49 United States Code,
    to no more than 24.9% of the aggregate votes of all equity
    securities outstanding. This restriction is applied pro rata
    among all holders of equity securities who fail to qualify as
    “citizens of the United States,” based on the number
    of votes the underlying securities are entitled to.

Ground
    Facilities

United is a party to various leases relating to its use of
    airport landing areas, gates, hangar sites, terminal buildings
    and other airport facilities in most of the municipalities it
    serves. Major terminal facility leases expire at SFO in 2011 and
    2013, Washington Dulles in 2014, O’Hare in 2018, LAX in



and Denver in 2025. The Company also leases approximately
    250,000 square feet of office space through 2022 for its
    corporate headquarters in downtown Chicago.

In January 2009, the Company entered into an amendment to its
    O’Hare cargo building site lease with the City of Chicago.
    The Company agreed to vacate its current cargo facility at
    O’Hare to allow the land to be used for the development of
    a future runway. In January 2009, the Company received
    approximately $160 million from O’Hare in accordance
    with the terms of the lease amendment. In addition, the lease
    amendment requires that the City of Chicago provide the Company
    with another site at O’Hare upon which a replacement cargo
    facility could be constructed.

The Company owns a 66.5-acre complex in suburban Chicago
    consisting of more than 1 million square feet of office
    space for its Operations Center, a computer operations facility
    and a training center. United also owns a flight training
    center, located in Denver, which accommodates 36 flight
    simulators and more than 90 computer-based training stations.
    The Company owns a limited number of other properties, including
    a crew hotel in Honolulu which is mortgaged.

During 2008, the Company completed its process of relocating
    employees from several of its other suburban Chicago facilities
    into either the new headquarters or the Operations Center
    consistent with the Company’s goals of achieving additional
    cost savings and operational efficiencies.

The Company’s Maintenance Operation Center at SFO occupies
    130 acres of land, 2.9 million square feet of floor
    space and nine aircraft hangar bays under a lease expiring in
    2013. The Company has options to renew the lease through 2023.

United’s off-airport leased properties historically
    included a number of ticketing, sales and general office
    facilities in the downtown and suburban areas of most of the
    larger cities within the United system. As part of the
    Company’s restructuring and cost containment efforts,
    United closed, terminated or rejected in bankruptcy all of its
    former domestic city ticket office leases. United continues to
    lease and operate a number of administrative, reservations,
    sales and other support facilities worldwide. United
    continuously evaluates opportunities to reduce or modify
    facilities occupied at its airports and off-airport locations.



ITEM 3.

LEGAL
    PROCEEDINGS.

In re:
    UAL Corporation, et. al.

As discussed above, on the Petition Date the Debtors filed
    voluntary petitions to reorganize their businesses under
    Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. On October 20,
    2005, the Debtors filed the Debtor’s First Amended Joint
    Plan of Reorganization Pursuant to Chapter 11 of the United
    States Bankruptcy Code and the Disclosure Statement. Commencing
    on October 27, 2005, all eligible classes of creditors had
    the opportunity to vote to accept or reject the Debtors proposed
    Plan of Reorganization. After a hearing on confirmation, on
    January 20, 2006, the Bankruptcy Court confirmed the Plan
    of Reorganization. The Plan of Reorganization became effective
    and the Debtors emerged from bankruptcy protection on the
    Effective Date.

Numerous pre-petition claims still await resolution in the
    Bankruptcy Court due to the Company’s objections to either
    the existence of liability or the amount of the claim. The
    process of determining whether liability exists and liquidating
    such claims will continue in 2009. Additionally, certain
    significant matters remain to be resolved in the Bankruptcy
    Court. For details see Note 4, “Voluntary
    Reorganization Under Chapter 11,” in

Combined Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Air
    Cargo/Passenger Surcharge Investigations

In February 2006, the European Commission (the
    “Commission”) and the U.S. Department of Justice
    (“DOJ”) commenced an international investigation into
    what government officials described as a possible price fixing
    conspiracy relating to certain surcharges included in tariffs
    for carrying air cargo. DOJ issued a grand jury subpoena to
    United and the Commission conducted an inspection at the
    Company’s offices in Frankfurt. In June 2006, United
    received a second subpoena from the DOJ requesting information
    related to certain passenger pricing practices and surcharges
    applicable to international passenger routes. We are cooperating
    fully. United is considered a source of information for the DOJ
    investigation, not a target.

Separately, United has received information requests regarding
    cargo pricing matters from the competition authorities in
    Australia, Brazil, Japan, Korea and Switzerland. On
    December 18, 2007, the Commission issued a Statement of
    Objections to 26 companies, including United. The Statement
    of Objections presented evidence related to the utilization of
    fuel and security surcharges and the exchange of pricing
    information that the Commission views as supporting the
    conclusion that an illegal price-fixing cartel had been in
    operation in the air cargo transportation industry. United has
    provided written and oral responses vigorously disputing the
    Commission’s allegations against the Company. On
    July 31, 2008, state prosecutors in Sao Paulo, Brazil,
    commenced criminal proceedings against eight individuals,
    including United’s cargo manager, for allegedly
    participating in cartel activity. The Company is actively
    participating in the defense of those allegations. On
    December 15, 2008, the New Zealand Commerce Commission
    issued Notices of Proceeding and Statements of Claim to 13
    airlines, including United. The Company is currently preparing
    its response to these proceedings.

In addition to the government investigations, United and other
    air cargo carriers were named as defendants in over ninety class
    action lawsuits alleging civil damages as a result of the
    purported air cargo pricing conspiracy. Those lawsuits were
    consolidated for pretrial activities in the United States
    Federal Court for the Eastern District of New York on
    June 20, 2006. United entered into an agreement with the
    majority of the private plaintiffs to dismiss United from the
    class action lawsuits in return for an agreement to cooperate
    with the plaintiffs’ factual investigation and United is no
    longer named as a defendant in the consolidated civil lawsuit.
    The Company is reviewing whether its receipt of a Statement of
    Objections from the Commission will impact the civil litigation.



Multiple putative class actions were also filed alleging
    violations of the antitrust laws with respect to the passenger
    pricing practices which were the subject of the DOJ subpoena.
    Those lawsuits were consolidated for pretrial activities in the
    United States Federal Court for the Northern District of
    California (“Federal Court”). United was dismissed
    from the case on October 3, 2008.

The Company is currently cooperating with all ongoing
    investigations and analyzing whether any potential liability may
    result from any of the investigating bodies. Based on its
    evaluation of all information currently available, the Company
    has determined that no reserve for potential liability is
    required and will continue to defend itself against all
    allegations that it was aware of or participated in cartel
    activities. However, penalties for violation of competition laws
    can be substantial and an ultimate finding that the Company
    engaged in improper activity could have a material adverse
    impact on our consolidated financial position and results of
    operations.

United
    Injunction Against ALPA and Four Individual Defendants for
    Unlawful Slowdown Activity under the Railway Labor
    Act

On July 30, 2008, United filed a lawsuit in federal court
    for the Northern District of Illinois (the “Court”)
    seeking a preliminary injunction against ALPA and four
    individual pilot employees also named as defendants for unlawful
    concerted activity which was disrupting the Company’s
    operations. The suit focused on ALPA’s nearly two-year
    campaign to exert unlawful pressure on the Company through work
    to rule initiatives, junior/senior manning refusals, sick leave
    usage, pilot driven flight delays, fuel adds and similar
    measures. The Company alleged all of this activity was a
    violation of the Railway Labor Act and should immediately be
    enjoined by the Court. The Court granted a preliminary
    injunction to United in November 2008. However, the Company
    intends to seek a permanent injunction to conclude the process.
    In addition, ALPA appealed the Court’s decision and
    arguments concerning the appeal were heard on February 24,
    2009.

Litigation
    Associated with September 11 Terrorism

Families of 94 victims of the September 11 terrorist attacks
    filed lawsuits asserting a variety of claims against the airline
    industry. United and American Airlines (the “aviation
    defendants”), as the two carriers whose flights were
    hijacked, are the central focus of the litigation, but a variety
    of additional parties have been sued on a number of legal
    theories ranging from collective responsibility for airport
    screening and security systems that allegedly failed to prevent
    the attacks to faulty design and construction of the World Trade
    Center towers. In excess of 97% of the families of the deceased
    victims received awards from the September 11th Victims
    Compensation Fund of 2001, which was established by the federal
    government, and consequently are now barred from making further
    claims against the aviation defendants. World Trade Center
    Properties, Inc., as lessee, has filed claims against the
    aviation defendants and The Port Authority of New York and New
    Jersey, the owner of the World Trade Center. The Port Authority
    has also filed cross-claims against the aviation defendants in
    both the wrongful death litigation and for property damage
    sustained in the attacks. The insurers of various tenants at the
    World Trade Center have filed subrogation claims for damages as
    well. In the aggregate, September 11th claims are estimated to
    be well in excess of $10 billion. By statute, these matters
    were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the
    Southern District of New York and the aviation defendants’
    exposure was capped at the limit of the liability coverage
    maintained by each carrier at the time of the attacks. In the
    personal injury and wrongful death matters, settlement
    discussions continue and the parties have reached settlement
    agreements for the majority of the remaining claims. The Company
    anticipates that any liability it may face arising from the
    events of September 11, 2001 could be significant, but by
    statute will be limited to the amount of its insurance coverage.

Other
    Legal Proceedings

UAL and United are involved in various other claims and legal
    actions involving passengers, customers, suppliers, employees
    and government agencies arising in the ordinary course of
    business. Additionally, from time to time, the Company becomes
    aware of potential non-compliance with



applicable environmental regulations, which have either been
    identified by the Company (through internal compliance programs
    such as its environmental compliance audits) or through notice
    from a governmental entity. In some instances, these matters
    could potentially become the subject of an administrative or
    judicial proceeding and could potentially involve monetary
    sanctions. After considering a number of factors, including (but
    not limited to) the views of legal counsel, the nature of
    contingencies to which the Company is subject and prior
    experience, management believes that the ultimate disposition of
    these contingencies will not materially affect its consolidated
    financial position or results of operations.

There is no trading market for the common stock of United. UAL
    and United did not pay any dividends in either 2008 or 2007. In
    December 2007, UAL’s Board of Directors approved a special
    distribution of $2.15 per common share, or approximately
    $257 million, which was paid on January 23, 2008 to
    holders of record of UAL common stock as of January 9, 2008
    and is characterized as a return of capital for tax purposes.
    Under the provisions of the Amended Credit Facility the
    Company’s ability to pay distributions on or repurchase UAL
    common stock is restricted. However, the Company may undertake
    an additional $243 million in shareholder initiatives
    without any additional prepayment of the Amended Credit
    Facility, provided that all covenants within the Amended Credit
    Facility are met. In addition, the agreement provides that the
    Company can carry out further shareholder initiatives in an
    amount equal to future term loan prepayments, provided the
    facility covenants are met. See Note 12, “Debt
    Obligations and Card Processing Agreements,” in

Combined
    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

for more
    information related to dividend restrictions under the Amended
    Credit Facility. Any future determination regarding dividend or
    distribution payments will be at the discretion of the Board of
    Directors, subject to applicable limitations under Delaware law.

Based on reports by the Company’s transfer agent for the
    UAL common stock, there were approximately 1,774 record holders
    of its UAL common stock as of February 20, 2009.

The following graph shows the cumulative total shareholder
    return for the UAL common stock during the period from
    February 2, 2006 to December 31, 2008. Five year
    historical data is not presented as a result of the significant
    period UAL was in bankruptcy and since the financial results of
    the Successor UAL are not comparable with the results of the
    Predecessor UAL, as discussed in Item 6,

Selected
    Financial Data

. The graph also shows the cumulative returns
    of the S&P 500 Index and the AMEX Airline Index
    (“AAI”) of 13 investor-owned airlines. The comparison
    assumes $100 was invested on February 2, 2006 (the date
    UAUA began trading on NASDAQ) in UAL Common Stock and in each of
    the indices shown and assumes that all dividends paid, including
    UAL’s January 2008 $2.15 per share distribution, were
    reinvested.

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
    OPERATIONS.

Overview

As discussed above under Item 1,

Business

, the
    Company derives virtually all of its revenues from airline
    related activities. The most significant source of airline
    revenues is passenger revenues; however, Mileage Plus, United
    Cargo and United Services are also major sources of operating
    revenues. The airline industry is highly competitive and is
    characterized by intense price competition. Fare discounting by
    United’s competitors has historically had a negative effect
    on the Company’s financial results because United has
    generally been required to match competitors’ fares to
    maintain passenger traffic. Future competitive fare adjustments
    may negatively impact the Company’s future financial
    results. The Company’s most significant operating expense
    is jet fuel. Jet fuel prices are extremely volatile and are
    largely uncontrollable by the Company. The Company’s
    historical and future earnings have been and will continue to be
    significantly impacted by jet fuel prices.

This Annual Report on

Form 10-K

is a combined report of UAL and United. As UAL consolidates
    United for financial statement purposes, disclosures that relate
    to activities of United also apply to UAL, unless otherwise
    noted. United’s operating revenues and operating expenses
    comprise nearly 100% of UAL’s revenues and operating
    expenses. In addition, United comprises approximately the entire
    balance of UAL’s assets, liabilities and operating cash
    flows. Therefore, the following qualitative discussion is
    applicable to both UAL and United, unless otherwise noted. Any
    significant differences between UAL and United results are
    separately disclosed and explained. United meets the conditions
    set forth in General Instruction I(1)(a) and (b) of

Form 10-K

and is therefore filing this

Form 10-K

with the reduced disclosure format allowed under that general
    instruction.

Bankruptcy Matters.

On December 9,
    2002, UAL, United and 26 direct and indirect wholly-owned
    subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions to reorganize its
    business under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. The
    Company emerged from bankruptcy on February 1, 2006, under
    a Plan of Reorganization that was approved by the Bankruptcy
    Court. In connection with its emergence from Chapter 11
    bankruptcy protection, the Company adopted fresh-start
    reporting, which resulted in significant changes in
    post-emergence financial statements, as compared to the
    Company’s historical financial statements. See the
    “Financial Results” section below for further
    discussion. See Note 4, “Voluntary Reorganization
    Under Chapter 11,” in

Combined Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements

for further information
    regarding bankruptcy matters.

Recent Developments.

The unprecedented
    increase in fuel prices and a worsening global recession have
    created an extremely challenging environment for the airline
    industry. While the Company significantly improved its financial
    performance in 2006 and 2007, the Company was not able to
    financially compensate for the substantial increase in fuel
    prices during 2008. The Company’s average consolidated fuel
    price per gallon, including net hedge losses that are classified
    in fuel expense, increased 59% from 2007 to 2008. The increased
    cost of fuel purchases and hedging losses drove the
    $3.1 billion increase in the Company’s consolidated
    fuel costs. The Company’s fuel hedge losses that are
    classified in nonoperating expense also had a significant
    negative impact on its 2008 liquidity and results of operations.

Although the Company was adversely impacted by fuel costs and
    special items in this recessionary environment, the
    Company’s commitment to cost reduction was a contributory
    factor to the

year-over-year

reduction in other areas of operating expenses as presented in
    the table below. The



following table presents the unit cost of various components of
    total operating expenses and

In 2008, the Company focused on mitigating a portion of the
    negative impact of higher fuel costs and the weakening economy
    through cost reductions, fleet optimization, generation of
    higher revenues, executing on initiatives to enhance liquidity
    and other strategies as discussed below. Overall, the Company
    has characterized its business approach as “Focus on
    Five,” which refers to a comprehensive set of priorities
    that focus on the fundamentals of running a good airline: one
    that runs on time, with clean planes and courteous employees,
    that delivers industry-leading revenues and competitive costs,
    and does so safely. Building on this foundation, United aims to
    regain its industry-leading position in key metrics reported by
    the DOT as well as industry-leading revenue driven by products,
    services, schedules and routes that are valued by the
    Company’s customers. The goal of this approach is intended
    to enable United to achieve

best-in-class

safety performance, exceptional customer satisfaction and
    experience and industry-leading margin and cash flow. Although
    results of operations in 2008 were disappointing and economic
    conditions continue to present a challenge for the Company, we
    believe we are taking the necessary steps to position the
    Company for improved financial and operational performance in
    2009.

Some of these actions include the following:

•

The Company significantly reduced its mainline domestic and
    international capacity in response to high fuel costs and the
    weakening global economy. Mainline domestic and international
    capacity decreased 14% and 8%, respectively, during the fourth
    quarter of 2008 as compared to the year-ago period. Mainline
    domestic capacity decreased 8% while international capacity
    increased 1% for the full year of 2008, as compared to 2007.
    Consolidated capacity was approximately 11% and 4% lower in the
    fourth quarter and the full year of 2008, respectively, as
    compared to the year-ago periods. The Company will implement
    additional capacity reductions in 2009 as it completes the
    removal of 100 aircraft, as discussed below, of which 51
    aircraft had been removed from service as of December 31,
    2008.

•

The Company is permanently removing 100 aircraft from its fleet,
    including its entire fleet of 94 B737 aircraft and six B747
    aircraft. These aircraft are some of the oldest and least fuel
    efficient in the Company’s fleet. This reduction reflects
    the Company’s efforts to eliminate unprofitable capacity
    and divest the Company of assets that currently do not provide
    an acceptable return, particularly in the current economic
    environment with volatile fuel prices and a global economy in
    recession. The Company continues to review the deployment of all
    of its aircraft in various markets and the overall composition
    of its fleet to ensure that we are using our assets
    appropriately to provide the best available return.



•

The Company continues to refit its wide body international
    aircraft with new first and business class premium seats,
    entertainment systems and other product enhancements. As of
    December 31, 2008, the Company has completed upgrades on 25
    international aircraft with new premium travel equipment
    featuring , among other improvements,

180-degree,

lie-flat beds in business class. The Company expects its
    remaining 66 wide body international aircraft to be upgraded by
    2011. The upgrade of this equipment is expected to allow the
    Company to generate revenue premiums from its first and business
    class international cabins. This new product will reduce premium
    seat counts by more than 20%.

•

In 2008, the Company ceased operations to Ft. Lauderdale and
    West Palm Beach, Florida, two markets served by Ted, which uses
    an all-economy seating configuration to serve primarily leisure
    markets. In addition, during 2008, as part of its operational
    plans the Company ceased operations in certain non-Ted markets
    and also reduced frequencies in several Ted and non-Ted markets.
    In light of these planned capacity reductions and other factors,
    the Company also determined that it would eliminate its entire
    B737 fleet by the end of 2009. With the reduced need for Ted
    aircraft in leisure markets and an increased need for narrow
    body aircraft in non-Ted markets due to the elimination of the
    B737 fleet, the Company decided to reconfigure the entire Ted
    fleet of

all-economy

Airbus aircraft to include first class, as well as Economy Plus
    and economy seats. The reconfigured Airbus aircraft will provide
    United a consistent product offering for our customers and
    employees, and increases our fleet flexibility to redeploy
    aircraft onto former Ted and other narrow body routes as market
    conditions change. The reconfiguration of the Ted aircraft will
    occur in stages with expected completion by the end of 2009.

•

The Company was able to pass some of the higher fuel costs in
    2008 to customers through passenger and cargo fuel surcharges,
    among other means. The Company created new revenue streams
    through unbundling products, offering new a la carte services
    and expanding choices for customers. The Company’s existing
    Travel Options, such as Economy Plus and Premium Cabin upsell
    have been extremely successful and the Company continues to
    implement new revenue initiatives such as a $15 fee for the
    first checked bag, as well as a $25 fee to check a second bag on
    domestic flights. Additional new Travel Options offered by
    United include Mileage Plus Award Accelerator, which allows
    customers to multiply their earned miles for each trip by
    purchasing accelerator miles upon ticket purchase, and

Door-to-Door

Baggage, which allows customers to avoid the hassle of taking
    their luggage to the airport by arranging for the luggage to be
    picked up from their home and shipped to their final
    destination. In addition, various ticket change fees have
    increased, including Mileage Plus close-in fees.

•

The Company reduced its capital expenditures in 2008 as compared
    to 2007 by more than $200 million as discussed in

Liquidity,

below. In addition, the Company further plans
    to limit capital spending to $450 million during 2009.

•

The Company is streamlining its operations and corporate
    functions in order to match the size of its workforce to the
    size of its reduced capacity. The Company expects a total
    workforce reduction of approximately 9,000 positions by the end
    of 2009, of which approximately 6,000 positions were eliminated
    as of December 31, 2008. The total expected reduction will
    consist of approximately 2,500 salaried and management positions
    and approximately 6,500 represented positions. The Company has
    offered furlough-mitigation programs such as voluntary early-out
    options, primarily to certain union groups, to reduce the
    required involuntary furloughs. Of the total expected
    represented workforce reduction, approximately 40% have been
    through voluntary furloughs through January 2009.

•

A transatlantic aviation agreement to replace the existing
    bilateral arrangements between the U.S. government and the
    27 European Union (“EU”) member states became
    effective in 2008. The future effects of this agreement on our
    financial position and results of operations cannot be predicted
    with certainty due to the diverse nature of its potential
    impacts, including increased competition at London’s
    Heathrow Airport as well as throughout the EU member states.



However, we have already taken actions to capitalize on
    opportunities under the new agreement. Upon the effective date
    of the transatlantic aviation agreement, the DOT’s approval
    of United’s application for antitrust immunity with bmi
    also became effective, allowing the two airlines to deepen their
    commercial relationship and adding bmi to the multilateral group
    of Star Alliance carriers that had already been granted
    antitrust immunity by the DOT.

•

United and Continental Airlines announced their plan to form a
    new partnership that will link the airlines’ networks and
    services worldwide to the benefit of customers, employees and
    shareholders, creating new revenue opportunities, cost savings
    and other efficiencies.

The Company also took certain actions to maintain adequate
    liquidity and minimize its financing costs during this
    challenging economic environment. During 2008, the Company
    generated unrestricted cash of approximately $1.9 billion
    through new financing agreements, amendments to our Mileage Plus
    co-branded credit card agreement and our largest credit card
    processing agreement and other means. Some of these agreements
    are summarized below. See

Liquidity and Capital
    Resources—Financing Activities

, below, for additional
    information related to these agreements.

•

During the fourth quarter of 2008, UAL began a public offering
    of up to $200 million of UAL common stock, generating gross
    proceeds of $172 million in 2008 and January 2009. UAL may
    issue additional shares during 2009 until it reaches
    $200 million in proceeds.

•

United completed a $241 million credit agreement secured by
    26 of the Company’s currently owned and mortgaged A319 and
    A320 aircraft. Borrowings under the agreement were at a variable
    interest rate based on LIBOR plus a margin. The credit agreement
    requires periodic principal and interest payments through its
    final maturity in June 2019. The Company may not prepay the loan
    prior to July 2012. This agreement did not change the number of
    the Company’s unencumbered aircraft as the Company used
    available equity in these previously owned and mortgaged
    aircraft as collateral for this financing.

•

United entered into an $84 million loan agreement secured
    by three aircraft, including two Airbus A320 and one Boeing B777
    aircraft. Borrowings under the agreement were at a variable
    interest rate based on LIBOR plus a margin. The loan requires
    principal and interest payments every three months and has a
    final maturity in June 2015.

•

During 2008 and January 2009, United also entered into three
    aircraft sale-leaseback agreements. The Company sold these
    aircraft for approximately $370 million and has leased them
    back.

•

The Company completed an amendment of its marketing services
    agreement with its Mileage Plus co-branded bankcard partner and
    its largest credit card processor to amend the terms of their
    existing agreements to, among other things, extend the terms of
    the agreements. These amendments resulted in an immediate
    increase in the Company’s cash position by approximately
    $1.0 billion, which included a total of $600 million
    for the advanced purchase of miles and the licensing extension
    payment, as well as the release of approximately
    $357 million in previously restricted cash for reserves
    required under the credit card processing agreement.
    Approximately $100 million of additional cash receipts are
    expected over the next two years based on the amended terms of
    the co-brand agreement as compared to cash that would have been
    generated under the terms of the previous co-brand agreement.
    This amount is less than the Company’s initial estimate
    primarily due to the severe weakening of the global economy. As
    part of the transaction, United granted a first lien of
    specified intangible Mileage Plus assets and a second lien on
    certain other assets. The term of the amended co-branded
    agreement is through December 31, 2017. See the discussion
    below in

Liquidity

for additional terms of this agreement.

The Company also made the following significant changes to its
    international route network:

•

United commenced daily, non-stop service between Washington
    Dulles and Dubai in October 2008.



•

The Company announced new daily service from Washington Dulles
    to Moscow and Geneva, commencing in March and April 2009,
    respectively.

•

The Company will reinstate daily seasonal service from Denver to
    London Heathrow effective March 2009.

Financial Results.

UAL and United
    adopted fresh-start reporting in accordance with

SOP 90-7

upon emerging from bankruptcy. Thus, the consolidated financial
    statements before February 1, 2006 reflect results based
    upon the historical cost basis of the Company while the
    post-emergence consolidated financial statements reflect the new
    basis of accounting, which incorporates fair value and other
    adjustments recorded from the application of

SOP 90-7.

Therefore, financial statements for the post-emergence periods
    are not comparable to the pre-emergence period financial
    statements. References to “Successor Company” refer to
    UAL

and/or

United on or after February 1, 2006, after giving effect to
    the adoption of fresh-start reporting. References to
    “Predecessor Company” refer to UAL

and/or

United before their exit from bankruptcy on February 1,
    2006.

For purposes of the discussion of financial results, management
    utilizes the combined results of the Successor Company and
    Predecessor Company for the twelve months ended
    December 31, 2006. The combined results for the twelve
    months ended December 31, 2006 are non-GAAP measures;
    however, management believes that the combined results provide a
    more meaningful comparison to the years ended December 31,
    2008 and 2007.

The air travel business is subject to seasonal fluctuations and
    historically, the Company’s results of operations are
    better in the second and third quarters as compared to the first
    and fourth quarters of each year, since our first and fourth
    quarter results normally reflect weaker travel demand. The
    Company’s results of operations can be impacted by adverse
    weather, air traffic control delays, fuel price volatility and
    other factors in any period.



The table below presents certain financial statement items to
    provide an overview of the Company’s financial performance
    for the three years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006.
    The most significant contributors to the Company’s net loss
    in 2008 were increased fuel prices and asset impairments. The
    table below also highlights that the Company, through its past
    and on-going cost reduction initiatives, was able to effectively
    manage costs in non-fuel and other areas, although the benefits
    of these cost savings initiatives and higher revenues were not
    sufficient to offset the dramatic increase in fuel cost.

The relatively small income tax benefit in 2008 is related to
    the impairment and sale of certain indefinite-lived intangible
    assets, partially offset by the impact of an increase in state
    tax rates. In 2007, UAL recognized income tax expense of
    $297 million.

The decrease in the Company’s cash, restricted cash and
    short-term investments balances was primarily due to a
    $3.4 billion unfavorable reduction in cash flows from
    operations in 2008 as compared to 2007. The operating cash
    decrease was primarily due to increased cash expenses, mainly
    fuel and fuel hedge cash settlements, as discussed below under

Results of Operations

. Fuel hedge collateral requirements
    also used operating cash of approximately $965 million in
    the year ended December 31, 2008. This unfavorable variance
    was partly offset by approximately $600 million of proceeds
    received from the amendment of the co-brand credit card
    agreement, as discussed above. Restricted cash



decreased in 2008 primarily due to an amendment to our largest
    credit card processing agreement and posting of letters of
    credit, as further discussed below.

The increase in net cash used by investing activities was
    primarily due to a reallocation of excess cash from short-term
    investments to cash and cash equivalents. Investing cash flows
    benefited from a reduction in restricted cash of
    $484 million. This benefit was primarily due to the
    amendment of the credit card processing agreement in association
    with the co-branded amendment described above, which decreased
    restricted cash by $357 million, and the substitution of
    letters of credit for cash deposits related to workers’
    compensation obligations. In addition, UAL financing outflows
    included approximately $253 million to pay a $2.15 per
    common share special distribution in January 2008.

The Company expects its cash flows from operations and its
    available capital to be sufficient to meet its future operating
    expenses, lease obligations and debt service requirements in the
    next twelve months; however, the Company’s future liquidity
    could be impacted by increases or decreases in fuel prices, fuel
    hedge collateral requirements, inability to adequately increase
    revenues to offset high fuel prices, softening revenues
    resulting from reduced demand, failure to meet future debt
    covenants and other factors. See the

Liquidity and Capital
    Resources

and Item 7A,

Quantitative and Qualitative
    Disclosures about Market Risk

, below, for a discussion of
    these factors and the Company’s significant operating,
    investing and financing cash flows.

Capital Commitments.

At
    December 31, 2008, the Company’s future commitments
    for the purchase of property and equipment include approximately
    $2.4 billion of nonbinding aircraft commitments and
    $0.6 billion of binding commitments. The nonbinding
    commitments of $2.4 billion are related to 42 A319 and A320
    aircraft. These orders may be cancelled which would result in
    the forfeiture of $91 million of advance payments provided
    to the manufacturer. United believes it is highly unlikely that
    it will take delivery of the remaining aircraft in the future
    and therefore believes it will be required to forfeit its
    $91 million of advance delivery deposits. Based on this
    determination, the Company recorded an impairment charge in 2008
    to decrease the value of the deposits and related capitalized
    interest of $14 million to zero in the Company’s

Statements of Consolidated Financial Position

. In
    addition, the Company’s capital commitments include
    commitments related to its international premium cabin
    enhancement program. During 2008, the Company reduced the scope
    of this project by six aircraft, from the originally disclosed
    number of 97 aircraft. As of December 31, 2008, the Company
    had completed upgrades on 25 aircraft and had remaining capital
    commitments to complete enhancements on an additional 66
    aircraft. For further details, see Note 14,
    “Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and
    Uncertainties,” in

Combined Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

Contingencies.

During the course of its
    Chapter 11 proceedings, the Company successfully reached
    settlements with most of its creditors and resolved most pending
    claims against the Debtors. We are a party to numerous long-term
    agreements to lease certain airport and maintenance facilities
    that are financed through tax-exempt municipal bonds issued by
    various local municipalities to build or improve airport and
    maintenance facilities. United was advised during its
    restructuring that these municipal bonds may have been unsecured
    (or in certain instances, partially secured) pre-petition debt.
    In 2006, certain of United’s LAX municipal bond obligations
    were conclusively adjudicated through the Bankruptcy Court as
    financings and not true leases; however, there remains pending
    litigation to determine the value of the security interests, if
    any, that the bondholders have in our underlying leaseholds. See
    Note 4, “Voluntary Reorganization Under
    Chapter 11,” in

Combined Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements

for further information on this matter
    and the resolution of the separate SFO municipal bond matter in
    2008.

United has guaranteed $270 million of the City and County
    of Denver, Colorado Special Facilities Airport Revenue Bonds
    (United Air Lines Project) Series 2007A (the “Denver
    Bonds”). This guarantee replaces our prior guarantee of
    $261 million of bonds issued by the City and County of
    Denver, Colorado in 1992. These bonds are callable by United.
    The outstanding bonds and related guarantee are not recorded in
    the Company’s

Statements of Consolidated Financial
    Position

. However, the related lease



agreement is accounted for on a straight-line basis resulting in
    a ratable accrual of the final $270 million payment over
    the lease term.

Legal and Environmental.

The Company has
    certain contingencies resulting from litigation and claims
    incident to the ordinary course of business. Management
    believes, after considering a number of factors, including (but
    not limited to) the information currently available, the views
    of legal counsel, the nature of contingencies to which the
    Company is subject and prior experience, that the ultimate
    disposition of the litigation and claims will not materially
    affect the Company’s consolidated financial position or
    results of operations. When appropriate, the Company accrues for
    these matters based on its assessments of the likely outcomes of
    their eventual disposition. The amounts of these liabilities
    could increase or decrease in the near term, based on revisions
    to estimates relating to the various claims.

The Company anticipates that if ultimately found liable, its
    damages from claims arising from the events of
    September 11, 2001, could be significant; however, the
    Company believes that, under the Air Transportation Safety and
    System Stabilization Act of 2001, its liability will be limited
    to its insurance coverage.

The Company continues to analyze whether any potential liability
    may result from air cargo/passenger surcharge cartel
    investigations following the receipt of a Statement of
    Objections that the European Commission (the
    “Commission”) issued to 26 companies on
    December 18, 2007. The Statement of Objections sets out
    evidence related to the utilization of fuel and security
    surcharges and exchange of pricing information that the
    Commission views as supporting the conclusion that an illegal
    price-fixing cartel had been in operation in the air cargo
    transportation industry. United received a copy of the Statement
    of Objections and has provided written and oral responses
    vigorously disputing the Commission’s allegations against
    the Company. Nevertheless, United will continue to cooperate
    with the Commission’s ongoing investigation. Based on its
    evaluation of all information currently available, the Company
    has determined that no reserve for potential liability is
    required and will continue to defend itself against all
    allegations that it was aware of or participated in cartel
    activities. However, penalties for violation of European
    competition laws can be substantial and a finding that the
    Company engaged in improper activity could have a material
    adverse impact on our consolidated financial position and
    results of operations.

Many aspects of United’s operations are subject to
    increasingly stringent federal, state and local laws protecting
    the environment. Future environmental regulatory developments,
    such as in regard to climate change, in the U.S. and abroad
    could adversely affect operations and increase operating costs
    in the airline industry. There are a few climate change laws and
    regulations that have gone into effect that apply to United,
    including environmental taxes for certain international flights,
    some limited greenhouse gas reporting requirements and some
    land-based planning laws which could apply to airports and
    ultimately impact airlines depending upon the circumstances. In
    addition, the EU has adopted legislation to include aviation
    within the EU’s existing greenhouse gas emission trading
    scheme effective in 2012. There are significant questions that
    remain as to the legality of applying the scheme to non-EU
    airlines and the U.S. and other governments are considering
    filing a legal challenge to the EU’s unilateral inclusion
    of non-EU carriers. While such a measure could significantly
    increase the costs of carriers operating in the EU, the precise
    cost to United is difficult to calculate with certainty due to a
    number of variables, and it is not clear whether the scheme will
    withstand legal challenge. There may be future regulatory
    actions taken by the U.S. government, state governments
    within the U.S., foreign governments, the International Civil
    Aviation Organization, or through a new climate change treaty to
    regulate the emission of greenhouse gases by the aviation
    industry. Such future regulatory actions are uncertain at this
    time (in terms of either the regulatory requirements or their
    applicability to United), but the impact to the Company and its
    industry would likely be adverse and could be significant,
    including the potential for increased fuel costs, carbon taxes
    or fees, or a requirement to purchase carbon credits.

Yield is a measure of average price
    paid per passenger mile, which is calculated by dividing
    passenger revenues by RPMs. Yields for geographic regions
    exclude charter revenue and RPMs.

In 2008, revenues for both mainline and United Express benefited
    from yield increases of 6.9% and 5.0%, respectively, as compared
    to 2007. The yield increases are due to industry capacity
    reductions and fare increases, including fuel surcharges plus
    incremental revenues derived from merchandising and fees.
    However, the benefit of higher yields was partially offset by
    6.3% and 3.9% decreases in traffic for the mainline and United
    Express segments, respectively. Consolidated passenger revenues
    in 2008 included an unfavorable variance compared to 2007 that
    was partly due to the change in the Mileage Plus expiration
    policy for inactive accounts from 36 months to
    18 months that provided a consolidated estimated annual
    benefit of $246 million in 2007. In addition, the weak
    economic environment negatively impacted demand and passenger
    revenues, particularly in the fourth quarter of 2008.

International PRASM was up 2.4%

year-over-year

with a related capacity increase of 0.9%. While Latin American
    PRASM growth was strong at 9.0%

year-over-year,

it is not a significant part of United’s international
    network. Atlantic performance was driven by lower than average
    revenue growth in our London and Germany markets, largely due to
    industry capacity growth of approximately 13% in the
    U.S. to London Heathrow route and United’s 15% growth
    in Germany. These markets account for approximately 75% of our
    Atlantic capacity. The Pacific region was impacted by 7%
    industry capacity growth between the U.S. and
    China / Hong Kong, which account for approximately 45%
    of United’s Pacific capacity.



Cargo revenues increased by $84 million, or 11%, in 2008 as
    compared to 2007, primarily due to higher fuel surcharges and
    improved fleet utilization. In addition, revenues were higher
    due to increased volume associated with the U.S. domestic
    mail contract, which commenced in late April 2007, as well as
    filling new capacity in international markets. A weaker dollar
    also benefited cargo revenues in 2008 as a significant portion
    of cargo services are contracted in foreign currencies. However,
    the Company experienced a significant decline in cargo revenues
    in the fourth quarter of 2008 due to rationalization of
    international capacity, falling demand for domestic and
    international air cargo as the global economy softened, and
    lower fuel costs driving lower fuel surcharges in late 2008.
    Decreased cargo revenues resulting from lower demand have a
    disproportionate impact on our operating results because cargo
    revenues typically generate higher margins as compared to
    passenger revenues.

The full-year 2008 trends in passenger and cargo revenues are
    not indicative of the Company’s most recent fourth quarter
    revenue results. In the fourth quarter of 2008, mainline
    passenger revenues decreased approximately 10% due to lower
    traffic as a result of the Company’s 12% capacity reduction
    and lower demand due to the weak global economy. The 2008
    capacity reductions, planned 2009 capacity reductions and weak
    U.S. and global economies are expected to negatively impact
    revenues in 2009. In late 2008 and early 2009, the Company has
    experienced decreased travel bookings and lower credit card
    sales activity which have resulted from the weak global economy
    and have negatively affected revenues and are expected to
    continue to negatively impact revenues in 2009. The Company
    cannot predict the longevity or severity of the current weak
    global economy and, therefore, cannot accurately estimate the
    negative impact it will have on future revenues.

Other revenues decreased approximately 11% in 2008 as compared
    to 2007. This decrease was primarily due to lower jet fuel sales
    to third parties. The decrease in third party fuel sales had a
    negligible impact on our operating margin because the associated
    cost of sales decreased by a similar amount in 2008 as compared
    to 2007.

    compared to 2006

The table below illustrates the

year-over-year

percentage changes in UAL and United operating revenues. The
    primary difference between UAL and United revenues is due to
    other revenues at UAL, which are generated from minor direct
    subsidiaries of UAL.

Variances are from the combined
    2006 period that includes the results for the one month period
    ended January 31, 2006 (Predecessor) and the eleven month
    period ended December 31, 2006 (Successor).

Including the special revenue items, mainline and United Express
    passenger revenues increased by $924 million and
    $170 million, respectively, in 2007 as compared to 2006. In
    2007, mainline revenues benefited from a 0.6 point increase in
    load factor and a 7% increase in yield as compared to 2006. In
    the same periods, United Express load factor was relatively flat
    while yield and traffic both increased 3% resulting in the 6%
    increase in revenue. Overall, passenger revenues increased due
    to a better revenue environment for the industry which was
    partly due to industry-wide capacity constraint. The
    Company’s shift of some capacity and traffic from domestic
    to higher yielding international flights also benefited revenues
    in 2007. In addition, the change in the Mileage Plus expiration
    period policy also contributed to the increase in revenues in
    2007. Mileage Plus revenue, included in passenger revenues, was
    approximately $169 million higher in 2007. This impact was
    largely due to a change in the Mileage Plus expiration period
    policy from 36 months to 18 months, as discussed in

Critical Accounting Policies

, below. Mileage Plus
    customer accounts are deactivated after 18 months of
    inactivity, effective December 31, 2007. Severe winter
    storms in December 2007 had the estimated impact of reducing
    revenue by $25 million. Similarly winter storms in December
    2006 had an estimated impact of reducing revenue by
    $40 million.

Cargo revenues increased by $20 million, or 3%, in the year
    ended December 31, 2007 as compared to the same period in
    2006. Freight revenue increased due to both higher yields and
    higher volume. This increase was partially offset by a reduction
    in mail revenue due to lower 2007 volume as a result of the
    termination of the U.S. Postal Service (“USPS”)
    contract on June 30, 2006. United signed a new USPS
    contract effective April, 2007.

UAL other operating revenues decreased by $311 million, or
    24%, in the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to the
    same period in 2006. Lower jet fuel sales to third parties by
    our subsidiary UAFC accounted for $307 million of the other
    revenue decrease. This decrease in jet fuel sales was due to
    several factors, including decreased UAFC sales to our regional
    affiliates, our decision not to renew various low margin supply
    agreements to other carriers and decreased sales of excess
    inventory. This decrease had no material impact on the
    Company’s operating margin, because UAFC cost of sales
    decreased by $306 million in the year ended
    December 31, 2007 as compared to the prior year.

Regional affiliate fuel costs are
    classified as part of Regional affiliate expense.

Salaries and related costs increased $50 million in 2008.
    The Company’s costs in 2008 include the negative impact of
    average wage increases and higher benefits expense, as well as
    severance expense of $106 million due to the implementation
    of the Company’s operating plans, as more fully explained
    in Note 2, “Company Operational Plans,” in

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

In
    addition, the Company recorded $87 million of expense in
    2008 from certain benefit obligation



adjustments, which were primarily due to discount rate changes.
    These negative impacts were partially offset by lower combined
    profit and success sharing expense in the 2008 period as
    compared to the

year-ago

period due to the unfavorable financial results in 2008 as
    compared to 2007. In addition, 2008 salaries and related costs
    benefited from the workforce reductions completed during the
    year as discussed in

Overview

above.

Regional affiliate expense increased $307 million, or 10%,
    in 2008 as compared to the same period last year. Regional
    affiliate expense increased primarily due to a
    $342 million, or 37%, increase in Regional Affiliate fuel
    that was driven by an increase in market price for fuel as
    highlighted in the fuel table above. The regional affiliate
    operating loss was $150 million in 2008 period, as compared
    to income of $122 million in 2007, due to the
    aforementioned fuel impacts, which could not be fully offset by
    higher ticket prices, as Regional Affiliate revenues were only
    1% higher in 2008.

The Company’s purchased services increased
    $29 million, or 2%, in 2008 as compared to 2007. In 2008,
    purchased services included a charge of $26 million related
    to certain projects and transactions being terminated or
    indefinitely postponed. In 2008, other areas of purchased
    services did not change significantly as compared to 2007.

Aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs decreased 6%
    in 2008 as compared to 2007, primarily due to a decrease in
    engine and airframe maintenance associated with the retirement
    of the Company’s B737 fleet and more favorable engine
    maintenance contract rates.

Depreciation expense in 2008 was adversely impacted by
    $34 million of accelerated depreciation primarily related
    to the retirement of certain B737 and B747 aircraft and related
    parts and a $20 million charge to increase the inventory
    obsolescence reserve. This adverse impact was partially offset
    by reduced amortization expense in 2008 related to certain of
    the Company’s intangible assets that were fully amortized
    in 2007.

UAL landing fees and other rent decreased 2% in 2008 due to a
    reduction in the amount of facilities rented based upon our
    ongoing efforts to optimize our rented facilities consistent
    with our operational needs.

Distribution expenses decreased 9% in 2008 as compared to 2007
    largely due to the Company’s reduction of some of its
    travel agency commission programs in 2008, resulting in an
    average commission rate reduction. In addition, the
    Company’s lower passenger revenues due to its capacity
    reductions in 2008 also contributed to the decrease in related
    distribution expenses.

Cost of third party sales decreased 14%

year-over-year

primarily due to a reduction in UAFC expenses. This decrease is
    consistent with the reduction in UAFC revenues.

The Company’s other operating expenses decreased 5% in 2008
    compared to the year-ago period. This decrease was partly due to
    a $29 million litigation-settlement gain, which was
    recorded in other operating expenses, and decreases in several
    other expense categories which resulted from the Company’s
    cost reduction program.

Asset
    Impairments and Special Items.

As described in

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements

, in accordance with SFAS 142 and
    SFAS 144, as of May 31, 2008 the Company performed an
    interim impairment test of its goodwill, all intangible assets
    and certain of its long-lived assets (principally aircraft
    pre-delivery deposits, aircraft and related spare engines and
    spare parts) due to events and changes in circumstances during
    the first five months of 2008 that indicated an impairment might
    have occurred. In addition, the Company also performed an
    impairment test of certain aircraft fleet types as of
    December 31, 2008, because unfavorable market conditions
    for aircraft indicated potential impairment of value. The
    Company also performed annual indefinite-lived intangible asset
    impairment testing at October 1, 2008. As a result of all
    of its impairment testing, the Company recorded asset impairment
    charges of $2.6 billion as summarized in the table below.
    All of these impairment charges are within the mainline segment.
    All of



the impairments other than the goodwill impairment, which is
    separately identified, are classified as “Other impairments
    and special items” in the Company’s

Statements of
    Consolidated Operations.

    Policies

for additional information, including factors
    considered by management in concluding that a triggering event
    under SFS 142 and SFAS 144 had occurred and additional
    details of assets impaired.

The lease termination and other charges of $25 million
    primarily relate to the accrual of future rents for the B737
    leased aircraft that have been removed from service and charges
    associated with the return of certain of these aircraft to their
    lessors.

The combined period includes the
    results for one month ended January 31, 2006 (Predecessor
    Company) and eleven months ended December 31, 2006
    (Successor Company).



Mainline aircraft fuel increased $179 million, or 4%, in
    the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to 2006. This
    net fuel variance was due to a 4% increase in the average price
    per gallon of jet fuel from $2.11 in 2006 to $2.18 in 2007,
    resulting from unfavorable market conditions. Included in the
    2007 average price per gallon was an $83 million net hedge
    gain; a net fuel hedge loss of $26 million is included in
    the 2006 average price per gallon.

UAL salaries and related costs remained relatively flat in 2007
    as compared to 2006. The Company recognized $49 million of
    share-based compensation expense in 2007 as compared to
    $159 million in 2006. There were no significant grants in
    2007 as compared to 2006, which included a large number of
    grants associated with the Company’s emergence from
    bankruptcy. Additionally, immediate recognition of 100% of the
    cost of awards granted to retirement-eligible employees on the
    grant date, together with accelerated vesting of grants within
    the first twelve months after the grant date, accounted for most
    of the decrease in share-based compensation expense. Also
    benefiting the 2007 period was the absence of the
    $22 million severance charge incurred in 2006. Offsetting
    the decreased share-based compensation and severance expense was
    a slight increase in salaries and related costs as a result of
    certain wage increases as well as a $110 million increase
    in profit sharing, including related employee taxes, which is
    based on annual pre-tax earnings. As noted above, this increase
    is due to increased pre-tax earnings and an increase in the
    payout percentage from 7.5% in 2006 to 15% in 2007.

Regional affiliate expense, which includes aircraft fuel,
    increased $117 million, or 4%, during 2007 as compared to
    2006. Regional affiliate capacity increased 4% in 2007, which
    was a major contributor to the increase in expense. Including
    the special revenue item of $8 million, our regional
    affiliate operating income was $53 million higher in the
    2007 period as compared to the 2006 period. The margin
    improvement was due to improved revenue performance, which was
    due to increased yield and traffic, and cost control. Factors
    impacting regional affiliate margin include the restructuring of
    regional carrier capacity agreements, the replacement of some
    50-seat regional jets with 70-seat regional jets and regional
    carrier network optimization. All of these improvements were put
    in place throughout 2006; therefore, we realized some

year-over-year

benefits in 2007. Regional affiliate fuel expense increased
    $81 million, or 10%, from $834 million in 2006 to
    $915 million in 2007 due to a 9% increase in the average
    price of fuel and a 1% increase in consumption.

Purchased services increased 8% in 2007 as compared to 2006,
    primarily due to increased information technology and other
    costs incurred in support of the Company’s customer and
    employee initiatives. Information technology expenses increased
    due to an increase in non-capitalizable information technology
    related expenditures, generally occurring during the planning
    and scoping phases, for new applications in 2007. In addition,
    airport operations handling and security costs increased due to
    the new USPS contract and new international routes, among other
    factors.

Aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs expense
    increased $157 million, or 16%,

year-over-year

primarily due to inflationary increases related to our V2500
    engine maintenance contract and the cost of component parts, as
    well as the impact of increases in airframe and engine repair
    volumes.

A charge of $18 million in 2007 for surplus and obsolete
    aircraft parts inventory accounted for approximately half of the
    4% increase in depreciation and amortization.

Ongoing efforts to efficiently utilize our rented facilities
    have offset contractual rent increases, keeping 2007 rent
    expense in line with 2006 rent expense.

In 2007, United’s mainline revenues increased by 6%. During
    the same period of time, distribution expenses, which include
    commissions, GDS fees and credit card fees decreased 2% from
    $798 million in 2006 to $779 million in 2007. This
    decrease was due to cost savings realized as the Company
    continues to drive reductions across the full spectrum of costs
    of sale. Impact areas included renegotiation of contracts with
    various channel providers, rationalization of commission plans
    and programs, and continued emphasis on movement of customer
    purchases toward lower cost channels including online channels.
    Such efforts resulted in a 9%

year-over-year

reduction in GDS fees and commissions.



The decrease in cost of sales in 2007 as compared to 2006 was
    primarily due to lower UAFC third party fuel sales of
    $307 million as described in the discussion of revenue
    variances above.

Special items of $44 million in the year ended
    December 31, 2007 include a $30 million benefit due to
    the reduction in recorded accruals for pending bankruptcy
    litigation related to our SFO and LAX municipal bond obligations
    and a $14 million benefit due to the Company’s ongoing
    efforts to resolve certain other bankruptcy pre-confirmation
    contingencies. In the eleven months ended December 31,
    2006, special items of $36 million included a
    $12 million benefit to adjust the Company’s recorded
    obligation for the SFO and LAX municipal bonds and a
    $24 million benefit related to pre-confirmation pension
    matters. The 2007 and 2006 special items resulted from revised
    estimates of the probable amount to be allowed by the Bankruptcy
    Court and were recorded in accordance with AICPA Practice
    Bulletin 11,

Accounting for Preconfirmation
    Contingencies in Fresh-Start Reporting

. See Note 4,
    “Voluntary Reorganization Under Chapter 11” and

UAL interest expense decreased $138 million, or 21%, in
    2008 as compared to 2007. The 2008 period was favorably impacted
    by $1.5 billion of total credit facility prepayments and
    the February 2007 credit facility amendment, which lowered
    United’s interest rate on these obligations. Scheduled debt
    obligation repayments throughout 2008 and 2007 also reduced
    interest expense in 2008 as compared to 2007. The Company has a
    significant amount of variable-rate debt. Lower benchmark
    interest rates on these variable-rate borrowings also reduced
    the Company’s interest expense in 2008 as compared to 2007.
    Interest expense in 2007 included the write-off of
    $17 million of previously capitalized debt issuance costs
    associated with the February 2007 Amended Credit Facility
    partial prepayment, $6 million of financing costs
    associated with the February 2007 amendment and a gain of
    $22 million from a debt extinguishment. The benefit of
    lower interest expense in 2008 was offset by a $145 million
    decrease in interest income due to lower average cash and
    short-term investment balances and lower investment yields. See

Liquidity and Capital Resources

below, for further
    details related to financing activities.

Nonoperating fuel hedge gains (losses) relate to hedging
    instruments that are not classified as economic hedges. These
    net hedge gains (losses) are presented separately in the table
    above for purposes of additional analysis. These hedging gains
    (losses) are due to favorable (unfavorable) movements in crude
    oil prices relative to the fuel hedge instrument terms. See
    Item 7A,

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about
    Market Risk

and Note 13, “Fair Value Measurements
    and Derivative Instruments,” in

for further discussion of
    these hedges.



There were no significant investment gains or losses in 2008 as
    compared to 2007 during which the Company recorded a
    $41 million gain on sale of investment, as discussed below
    under

2007 compared to 2006.

The $24 million variance in Miscellaneous, net is primarily
    due to unfavorable foreign exchange rate fluctuations in 2008.

(a)

The combined period includes the
    results for one month ended January 31, 2006 (Predecessor
    Company) and eleven months ended December 31, 2006
    (Successor Company).

UAL interest expense decreased $109 million, or 14%, in
    2007 as compared to 2006. The decrease was due to the February
    and December 2007 amendments and prepayments of the Amended
    Credit Facility, which lowered United’s interest rate on
    these obligations and reduced the total obligations outstanding
    by approximately $1.5 billion. Repayments of scheduled
    maturities of debt obligations and other debt refinancings,
    which are discussed in “Liquidity and Capital
    Resources,” below, also reduced interest expense. The 2007
    period also included a $22 million reduction in interest
    expense due to the recognition of a gain on debt extinguishment.
    These benefits were offset by interest expense of
    $17 million for expensing previously capitalized debt
    issuance costs that were associated with the February 2007
    prepayment of the Amended Credit Facility and $6 million
    for financing costs incurred in connection with the February
    amendment of the Amended Credit Facility. The $500 million
    Amended Credit Facility prepayment in December 2007 increased
    interest expense by a net of $4 million from expensing
    $6 million of previously capitalized credit facility costs
    and recording a gain of $2 million to recognize previously
    deferred interest rate swap gains.

UAL interest income increased $8 million, or 3%,

year-over-year.

Interest income increased due to the classification of
    $6 million of interest income as reorganization items in
    the January 2006 predecessor period in accordance with

SOP 90-7.

The $41 million gain on sale of investment resulted from
    the Company’s sale of its 21.1% interest in Aeronautical
    Radio, Inc. (“ARINC”).

The unfavorable variances in miscellaneous income (expense) are
    primarily due to foreign currency transaction gains of
    $9 million in 2006 as compared to foreign currency
    transaction losses of $4 million in 2007.

Income
    Taxes.

The relatively small tax benefit recorded in 2008 is related to
    the impairment and sale of certain indefinite-lived intangible
    assets, partially offset by the impact of an increase in state
    tax rates. UAL



recorded income tax expense of $297 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2007 based an estimated effective tax
    rate of 43%. See Note 8, “Income Taxes,” in

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

for
    additional information.

Liquidity
    and Capital Resources

As of the date of this

Form 10-K,

the Company believes it has sufficient liquidity to fund its
    operations for the next twelve months, including funding for
    scheduled repayments of debt and capital lease obligations,
    capital expenditures, cash deposits required under fuel hedge
    contracts and other contractual obligations. We expect to meet
    our liquidity needs in 2009 from cash flows from operations,
    cash and cash equivalents on hand, proceeds from new financing
    arrangements using unencumbered assets and proceeds from
    aircraft sales and sales of other assets, among other sources.
    While the Company expects to meet its future cash requirements
    in 2009, our ability to do so could be impacted by many factors
    including, but not limited to, the following:

•

Volatile fuel prices and the cost and effectiveness of hedging
    fuel prices, as described above in the

Overview

and

Results of Operations

sections, may require the use of
    significant liquidity in future periods. Crude oil prices have
    been extremely volatile and unpredictable in recent years and
    may become more volatile in future periods due to the current
    severe dislocations in world financial markets.

•

In late 2008, the price of crude oil dramatically fell from its
    record high in July 2008. Earlier in 2008, the Company entered
    into derivative contracts (including collar strategies) to hedge
    the risk of future price increases. As fuel prices have fallen
    below the floor of the collars, the Company has had, and could
    continue to have, significant future payment obligations at the
    settlement dates of these contracts. In addition, the Company
    has been and may in the future be further required to provide
    counterparties with additional cash collateral prior to such
    settlement dates. While the Company’s results of operations
    should benefit significantly from lower fuel prices on its
    unhedged fuel consumption, in the near term lower fuel prices
    could also significantly and negatively impact liquidity based
    on the amount of cash settlements and collateral that may be
    required. However, at December 31, 2008 the Company
    partially mitigated its exposure to further price declines by
    purchasing put options to effectively cover approximately 55% of
    its short put positions. In addition, over the longer term,
    lower crude oil prices will further benefit the Company as the
    unfavorable hedge contracts terminate and the Company realizes
    the benefit of lower jet fuel costs on a larger percentage of
    its fuel consumption. See Note 13, “Fair Value
    Measurements and Derivative Instruments” in

Combined
    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

, as well as Item
    7A,

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures Above Market
    Risk,

for further information regarding the Company’s
    fuel derivative instruments.

•

The Company’s current operational plans to address the
    severe condition of the global economy may not be successful in
    improving its results of operations and liquidity:

•

The Company may not achieve expected increases in unit revenue
    from the capacity reductions announced by the Company and
    certain of its competitors. Further, certain of the
    Company’s competitors may not reduce capacity or may
    increase capacity; thereby diminishing our expected benefit from
    capacity reductions. The Company may also not achieve expected
    revenue improvements from merchandising and fee enhancement
    initiatives.

•

Poor general economic conditions have had, and may in the future
    continue to have, a significant adverse impact on travel demand,
    which may result in a negative impact to revenues.

•

The Company is using cash to implement its operational plans for
    such items as severance payments, lease termination payments,
    conversion of Ted aircraft and facility closure costs, among
    others. These cash requirements will reduce the Company’s
    cash available for its ongoing operations and commitments.



•

While fuel prices decreased significantly from their record high
    prices, fuel prices remain volatile and could increase
    significantly.

•

Our level of indebtedness, our non-investment grade credit
    rating, and general credit market conditions may make it
    difficult, or impossible, for us to raise capital to meet
    liquidity needs

and/or

may
    increase our cost of borrowing.

•

Due to the factors above, and other factors, we may be unable to
    comply with our Amended Credit Facility covenant that currently
    requires the Company to maintain an unrestricted cash balance of
    $1.0 billion and will also require the Company, beginning
    in the second quarter of 2009, to maintain a minimum ratio of
    EBITDAR to fixed charges. If the Company does not comply with
    these covenants, the lenders may accelerate repayment of these
    debt obligations, which would have a material adverse impact on
    the Company’s financial position and liquidity.

•

If a default occurs under our Amended Credit Facility or other
    debt obligations, the cost to cure any such default may
    materially and adversely impact our financial position and
    liquidity, and no assurance can be provided that such a default
    will be mitigated or cured.

Although the factors described above may adversely impact the
    Company’s liquidity, the Company believes it has an
    adequate available cash position to fund current operations.
    UAL’s unrestricted and restricted cash balances were
    $2.0 billion and $0.3 billion, respectively, at
    December 31, 2008. In addition, the Company has recently
    taken actions to improve its liquidity and believes it may
    access additional capital or improve its liquidity further, as
    described below.

•

During 2008, the Company completed several initiatives that
    generated unrestricted cash of more than $1.9 billion.
    These initiatives are described below.

•

The Company has significant additional unencumbered aircraft and
    other assets that may be used as collateral to obtain additional
    financing, as discussed below. At December 31, 2008, the
    Company had 62 unencumbered aircraft. As discussed in Note 23,
    “Subsequent Events,” in

Combined Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements

, in January 2009, the
    Company completed several financing-related transactions which
    generated approximately $315 million of proceeds.

•

The Company is taking aggressive actions to right-size its
    business including significant capacity reductions, disposition
    of underperforming assets and a workforce reduction, among
    others.

Cash Position and Liquidity.

As of
    December 31, 2008, approximately 50% of the Company’s
    cash and cash equivalents consisted of money market funds
    directly or indirectly invested in U.S. treasury securities
    with the remainder largely in money market funds that are
    covered by the new government money market funds guarantee
    program. There are no withdrawal restrictions at the present
    time on any of the money market funds in which the Company has
    invested. In addition, the Company has no auction rate
    securities as of December 31, 2008. Therefore, we believe
    our credit risk is limited with respect to our cash balances.
    The following table provides a summary of UAL’s net cash
    provided (used)



by operating, financing, investing and reorganization activities
    for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 and
    total cash position as of December 31, 2008 and 2007.

The Company’s cash and short-term investment position
    represents an important source of liquidity. The change in cash
    from 2006 to 2008 is explained below. Restricted cash primarily
    represents cash collateral to secure workers’ compensation
    obligations, security deposits for airport leases and reserves
    with institutions that process our credit card ticket sales. We
    may be required to post significant additional cash collateral
    to meet such obligations in the future. The Company has a
    $255 million revolving commitment under its Amended Credit
    Facility, of which $254 million and $102 million had
    been used for letters of credit as of December 31, 2008 and
    2007, respectively. In addition, under a separate agreement, the
    Company had $27 million of letters of credit issued as of
    December 31, 2008. The increase of letters of credit issued
    in 2008 was primarily due to the providing of alternative
    collateral in place of restricted cash deposits, thereby
    providing the Company with additional unrestricted cash.

Cash
    Flows from Operating Activities.

    compared to 2007

UAL’s cash from operations decreased by approximately
    $3.4 billion in 2008 as compared to 2007. This decrease was
    primarily due to the increased cash required for fuel purchases
    and operating and nonoperating cash fuel hedge losses. Mainline
    and regional affiliate fuel costs increased $3.1 billion in
    2008 over 2007 and nonoperating expenses also increased over the
    same period largely due to cash and non-cash fuel hedge losses.
    In addition, certain counterparties to our fuel hedge
    instruments required the Company to provide cash collateral
    deposits of approximately $965 million in 2008, which
    negatively impacted our cash flows during this period as
    compared to 2007 when no similar deposits were required. A
    decrease in advance ticket sales also negatively impacted
    operating cash flow in 2008. Partially offsetting the negative
    impacts were $500 million of proceeds from the advanced
    purchase of miles by our co-branded credit card partner as part
    of the amendment of our marketing agreement and
    $100 million of proceeds from the extension of the license
    previously granted to our co-branded credit card partner to be
    the exclusive issuer of Mileage Plus Visa cards through 2017. In
    2008, the Company contributed approximately $240 million
    and $22 million to its defined contribution plans and

non-U.S. pension

plans, respectively, as compared to contributions of
    $236 million and $14 million, respectively, in 2007
    for these plans.

    compared to 2006

The Company’s cash from operations improved by more than
    $500 million

year-over-year.

The Company’s improvement in net income excluding primarily
    non-cash reorganization items, was a significant factor
    contributing to the increase in operating cash flows. Operating
    cash flows for 2007 also include the favorable impact of an
    increase in non-cash income tax expense of nearly
    $300 million as compared to 2006. In addition, cash from
    operations improved due to a reduction of $124 million in
    cash interest payments in 2007 as compared to 2006 as a result
    of the financing activities completed in



2007 to reduce debt and interest rates. The improvement in cash
    generated from operations that was due to better operating
    performance was further enhanced by a decrease in operating cash
    used for working capital. In 2007, the Company contributed
    approximately $236 million and $14 million to its
    defined contribution plans and

non-U.S. pension

plans, respectively, as compared to contributions of
    $270 million in 2006 for these plans.

Cash
    Flows from Investing Activities.

    compared to 2007

Net sales of short-term investments provided cash of
    $2.3 billion for UAL in 2008 as compared to cash used for
    net purchases of short-term investments of $2.0 billion in
    2007. In 2008, the Company invested most of its excess cash in
    money market funds, whereas in 2007, excess cash was largely
    invested in short-term investments such as commercial paper.
    During 2008, the Company also received $357 million of cash
    that was previously restricted cash held by the Company’s
    largest credit card processor. The release of cash was part of
    an amendment to the Company’s co-branded credit card
    agreement and largest credit card processor agreement. See

Credit Card Processing Agreements

, below, for further
    discussion of the amended agreement and future cash reserve
    requirements.

In 2008, cash expenditures for property, equipment and software
    totaled approximately $455 million. Additions to property
    in 2008 also included $20 million of capitalized interest.
    In 2007, cash expenditures for property and equipment, software
    and capitalized interest were $639 million,
    $65 million and $19 million, respectively. This

year-over-year

decrease is primarily due to the Company’s efforts to
    optimize its available cash and a reduction in cash used to
    acquire aircraft as the 2007 capital expenditures included cash
    used to acquire six aircraft that were previously financed as
    operating leases, as discussed in

2007 compared to 2006

,
    below.

During 2008, the Company generated $94 million from various
    asset sales including the sale of five B737 aircraft, spare
    parts, engines and slots. Certain previously existing agreements
    in principle to sell additional aircraft in 2008 have been
    terminated.

Investing cash of $274 million was generated from aircraft
    sold under sale-leaseback financing agreements. In 2008, United
    entered into a $125 million sale-leaseback involving nine
    previously unencumbered aircraft and a $149 million
    sale-leaseback involving 15 aircraft. See Note 15,
    “Lease Obligations,” and Note 16, “Statement
    of Consolidated Cash Flows—Supplemental Disclosures,”
    in

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

for additional information related to these transactions. In
    addition, the Company’s investing cash flows benefited from
    $41 million of cash proceeds from a litigation settlement
    resulting in the recognition of a $29 million gain during
    2008. The litigation settlement related to pre-delivery advance
    aircraft deposits.

    compared to 2006

UAL’s cash released from restricted funds was
    $91 million in 2007 as compared to $357 million that
    was provided by a decrease in the segregated and restricted
    funds for UAL in 2006. The significant cash generated from
    restricted accounts in 2006 was due to our improved financial
    position upon our emergence from bankruptcy. Net purchases of
    short-term investments used cash of $2.0 billion for UAL in
    2007 as compared to cash used for net purchases of short-term
    investments of $0.2 billion in 2006. This change was due to
    investing additional excess cash in longer-term commercial paper
    in 2007 to increase investment yields. Investing activities in
    2007 also included the Company’s use of $96 million of
    cash to acquire certain of the Company’s previously issued
    and outstanding debt instruments. The debt instruments
    repurchased by the Company remain outstanding. See Note 12,
    “Debt Obligations and Card Processing Agreements,” in

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

for
    further information related to the $96 million of purchased
    debt securities.

The Company’s capital expenditures were $658 million
    and $362 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively, including
    the purchase of six aircraft during 2007. In the third quarter
    of 2007, the



Company purchased three

747-400

aircraft that had previously been financed by United through
    operating leases which were terminated at closing. The total
    purchase price for these aircraft was largely financed with
    certain proceeds from the secured EETC financing described
    below. These transactions did not result in any change in the
    Company’s fleet count of 460 mainline aircraft, or in the
    amount of aircraft encumbered by debt or lease agreements.

During the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company used existing
    cash to acquire three aircraft that were previously financed
    under operating lease agreements. The total purchase price of
    these three aircraft and the three aircraft acquired in the
    third quarter of 2007 was approximately $200 million. This
    purchase did not result in any change in the Company’s
    fleet count of 460 mainline aircraft, but did unencumber three
    aircraft.

In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company utilized
    existing aircraft deposits pursuant to the terms of the original
    capital lease to make the final lease payments on three
    aircraft, resulting in the reclassification of the aircraft from
    capital leased assets to owned assets. However, the purchase of
    these three aircraft did not result in a net change in cash
    because the Company had previously provided cash deposits equal
    to the purchase price of the aircraft to third party financial
    institutions for the benefit of the lessor. These transactions
    resulted in three additional aircraft becoming unencumbered for
    a total increase of six unencumbered aircraft during the year.

During 2007, the Company sold its interest in ARINC, generating
    proceeds of $128 million. In 2006, UAL received
    $43 million more in cash proceeds from investing activities
    as compared to United primarily due to $56 million of
    proceeds from the sale of MyPoints, a former direct subsidiary
    of UAL.

Cash
    Flows from Financing Activities.

    Activity

UAL used $253 million for its special distribution to
    common stockholders (United issued a $257 million dividend
    to UAL for this distribution) and $919 million for
    scheduled long-term debt and capital lease payments. United used
    cash of $109 million in connection with an amendment to its
    Amended Credit Facility, as further discussed below. In 2008,
    the Company acquired ten aircraft that were being operated under
    existing leases. These aircraft were acquired pursuant to
    existing lease terms. Aircraft lease deposits of
    $155 million provided financing cash that was primarily
    utilized by the Company to make the final payments due under
    these lease obligations. Nine of these aircraft were previously
    recorded as capital leased assets and are now owned assets.

United completed a $241 million credit agreement secured by
    26 of the Company’s currently owned and mortgaged A319 and
    A320 aircraft. Borrowings under the agreement were at a variable
    interest rate based on LIBOR plus a margin. The agreement
    requires periodic principal and interest payments through its
    final maturity in June 2019. The Company may not prepay the loan
    prior to July 2012. This agreement did not change the number of
    the Company’s unencumbered aircraft as the Company used
    available equity in these previously owned and mortgaged
    aircraft as collateral for this financing.

United also entered into an $84 million loan agreement
    secured by three aircraft, including two Airbus A320 and one
    Boeing B777. Borrowings under the agreement were at a variable
    interest rate based on LIBOR plus a margin. The loan requires
    principal and interest payments every three months and has a
    final maturity in June 2015.

The Company issued 11.2 million shares of UAL common stock
    as part of a $200 million equity offering during 2008. As
    of December 31, 2008, the Company had generated net
    proceeds of $107 million.

As of December 31, 2008, 62 aircraft with a net book value
    of approximately $570 million were unencumbered. The
    unencumbered aircraft at December 31, 2008 exclude nine
    aircraft which became encumbered with the December 2008 signing
    of a binding sale-leaseback agreement that closed in January
    2009. As of December 31, 2007, the Company had 113
    unencumbered aircraft with a net book



value of $2.0 billion. See Note 12, “Debt
    Obligations and Card Processing Agreements,” in

Combined
    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

for additional
    information on assets provided as collateral by the Company.

See the

Cash Flows from Investing Activities

section

,

above, for a discussion of the Company’s 2008
    sale-leaseback transactions.

    Activity

In 2007, the Company made a $1.0 billion prepayment on its
    Amended Credit Facility and made $1.1 billion of additional
    debt payments, which included $590 million related to the
    early retirement of debt. The Company prepaid an additional
    $500 million of the Amended Credit Facility in December
    2007. In addition, the Company completed a $694 million
    debt issuance, which effectively refinanced the aforementioned
    early debt retirement and refinanced three aircraft that had
    been previously financed through operating lease agreements.

In 2007, the Company completed financing transactions totaling
    approximately $964 million which included the
    $694 million EETC secured financing and the
    $270 million Denver Airport financing. A portion of the
    proceeds of the $694 million EETC transaction was used to
    repay $590 million of debt obligations that were secured by
    ten previously mortgaged, owned aircraft and to finance three
    previously unencumbered owned aircraft. The proceeds of the
    Denver Airport bonds were used to refinance the former
    $261 million of Denver Series 1992A bonds.

In 2007, cash from aircraft lease deposits increased
    $80 million primarily due to the use of the deposits to
    purchase the three previously leased assets described above in

Cash Flows from Investing Activities

. This was reported
    as a financing cash inflow as the prepayment of the initial
    deposits were recorded as a financing cash outflow.

    Activity

During 2006, we generated proceeds of $3.0 billion from
    United’s new credit facility, but used approximately
    $2.1 billion of these proceeds to repay the
    $1.2 billion DIP Financing and make other scheduled and
    revolving payments under long-term debt and capital lease
    agreements.

Other
    2008 and 2009 Financing Matters

In January 2009, the Company entered into a sale-leaseback
    agreement of nine aircraft for approximately $95 million.
    In addition, in January 2009, the Company generated net proceeds
    of $62 million from the issuance of 4.0 million shares
    and settlement of unsettled trades at December 31, 2008
    under its $200 million common stock distribution agreement.
    After issuance of these shares, the Company had issued shares
    for gross proceeds of $172 million of the $200 million
    available under this stock offering, leaving $28 million
    available for future issuance under this program.

In January 2009, the Company entered into an amendment to its
    O’Hare cargo building site lease with the City of Chicago.
    The Company agreed to vacate its current cargo facility at
    O’Hare to allow the land to be used for the development of
    a future runway. In January 2009, the Company received
    $160 million from O’Hare in accordance with the lease
    amendment. In addition, the lease amendment requires that the
    City of Chicago provide the Company with another site at
    O’Hare upon which a replacement cargo facility could be
    constructed.

Future Financing.

Subject to the restrictions
    of its Amended Credit Facility, the Company could raise
    additional capital by issuing unsecured debt, equity or
    equity-like securities, monetizing or borrowing against certain
    assets or refinancing existing obligations to generate net cash
    proceeds. However, the availability and capacity of these
    funding sources cannot be assured or predicted. General economic
    conditions, poor credit market conditions and any adverse
    changes in the Company’s credit ratings could adversely
    impact the Company’s ability to raise capital, if needed,
    and could increase the Company’s cost of capital.



Credit Ratings.

In 2008, both
    Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s Investors
    Services lowered the Company’s credit ratings.
    Standard & Poor’s lowered its ratings from a
    corporate credit rating of B (outlook stable) to B- (outlook
    negative) reflecting expected losses and reduced operating cash
    flow due to volatile fuel prices. Meanwhile, Moody’s
    Investor Services lowered UAL’s corporate family from
    “B2” to “Caa1” with a negative outlook and
    its secured bank rating from “B1” to “B3,”
    citing record-high fuel prices and the weak U.S. economy.
    These credit ratings are below investment grade levels.
    Downgrades from these rating levels, among other things, could
    restrict the availability

and/or

increase the cost of future financing for the Company.

Amended Credit Facility Covenants.

The
    Company’s Amended Credit Facility requires compliance with
    certain covenants. The Company was in compliance with all of its
    Amended Credit Facility covenants as of December 31, 2008
    and 2007. In May 2008, the Company amended the terms of certain
    financial covenants of the Amended Credit Facility. A summary of
    financial covenants, after the May amendment, is included below.

Beginning with the second quarter of 2009, the Company must
    maintain a specified minimum ratio of EBITDAR to the sum of the
    following fixed charges for all applicable periods:
    (a) cash interest expense and (b) cash aircraft
    operating rental expense. EBITDAR represents earnings before
    interest expense net of interest income, income taxes,
    depreciation, amortization, aircraft rent and certain other cash
    and non-cash credits and charges as further defined by the
    Amended Credit Facility. The other adjustments to EBITDAR
    include items such as foreign currency transaction gains or
    losses, increases or decreases in our deferred revenue
    obligation, share-based compensation expense, non-recurring or
    unusual losses, any non-cash non-recurring charge or non-cash
    restructuring charge, a limited amount of cash restructuring
    charges, certain cash transaction costs incurred with financing
    activities and the cumulative effect of a change in accounting
    principle.

The Amended Credit Facility also requires compliance with the
    following financial covenants: (i) a minimum unrestricted
    cash balance of $1.0 billion, and (ii) a minimum ratio
    of market value of collateral to the sum of (a) the
    aggregate outstanding amount of the loans plus (b) the
    undrawn amount of outstanding letters of credit, plus
    (c) the unreimbursed amount of drawings under such letters
    of credit and (d) the termination value of certain interest
    rate protection and hedging agreements with the Amended Credit
    Facility lenders and their affiliates, of 150% at any time, or
    200% at any time following the release of Primary Routes having
    an appraised value in excess of $1 billion (unless the
    Primary Routes are the only collateral then pledged).

The requirement to meet a fixed charge coverage ratio was
    suspended for the four quarters beginning with the second
    quarter of 2008 and ending with the first quarter of 2009 and
    thereafter is determined as set forth below:

The Amended Credit Facility contains a cross default provision
    with respect to other credit arrangements that exceed
    $50 million. Although the Company was in compliance with
    all required financial covenants as of December 31, 2008,
    and the Company is not required to comply with a fixed charge
    coverage ratio until the three month period ending June 30,
    2009, continued compliance depends on many factors, some of
    which are beyond the Company’s control, including the
    overall industry revenue environment and the level of fuel
    costs. There are no assurances that the Company will continue to
    comply with its debt covenants. Failure to comply with
    applicable covenants in any reporting period would result in a
    default under the Amended Credit Facility, which could have a
    material adverse impact



on the Company depending on the Company’s ability to obtain
    a waiver of, or otherwise mitigate, the impact of the default.

Credit Card Processing Agreements.

The
    Company has agreements with financial institutions that process
    customer credit card transactions for the sale of air travel and
    other services. Under certain of the Company’s card
    processing agreements, the financial institutions either
    require, or have the right to require, that United maintain a
    reserve equal to a portion of advance ticket sales that have
    been processed by that financial institution, but for which the
    Company has not yet provided the air transportation (referred to
    as “relevant advance ticket sales”). As of
    December 31, 2008, the Company had advance ticket sales of
    approximately $1.5 billion of which approximately
    $1.3 billion relates to credit card sales.

In November 2008, United entered into an amendment for its card
    processing agreement with Paymentech and JPMorgan Chase Bank
    (the “Amendment”) that suspends until January 20,
    2010 the requirement for United to maintain additional cash
    reserves with this processor of bank cards (above the current
    cash reserve of $25 million at December 31,
    2008) if United’s month-end balance of unrestricted
    cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments falls below
    $2.5 billion. In exchange for this benefit, United has
    granted the processor a security interest in certain of
    United’s owned aircraft with a current appraised value of
    at least $800 million. United also has agreed that such
    security interest collateralizes not only United’s
    obligations under the processing agreement, but also
    United’s obligations under United’s Amended and
    Restated Co-Branded Card Marketing Services Agreement. United
    has an option to terminate the Amendment prior to
    January 20, 2010, in which event the parties’ prior
    credit card processing reserve arrangements under the processing
    agreement will go back into effect.

After January 20, 2010, or in the event United terminates
    the Amendment, and in addition to certain other risk protections
    provided to the processor, the amount of any such reserve will
    be determined based on the amount of unrestricted cash held by
    the Company as defined under the Amended Credit Facility. If the
    Company’s unrestricted cash balance is more than
    $2.5 billion as of any calendar month-end measurement date,
    its required reserve will remain at $25 million. However,
    if the Company’s unrestricted cash is less than
    $2.5 billion, its required reserve will increase to a
    percentage of relevant advance ticket sales as summarized in the
    following table:

Required % of

Total Unrestricted Cash Balance(a)

Relevant Advance Ticket Sales

Less than $2.5 billion


%

Less than $2.0 billion


%

Less than $1.0 billion


%

(a)

Includes unrestricted cash, cash
    equivalents and short-term investments at month-end, including
    certain cash amounts already held in reserve, as defined by the
    agreement.

If the November 2008 Amendment had not been in effect as of
    December 31, 2008, the Company would have been required to
    post an additional $132 million of reserves based on an
    actual unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term
    investments balance of between $2.0 billion and
    $2.5 billion at December 31, 2008.

United’s card processing agreement with American Express
    expired on February 28, 2009 and was replaced by a new
    agreement on March 1, 2009 which has an initial five year
    term. As of December 31, 2008, there were no required
    reserves under this card agreement, and no reserves were
    required up through the date of expiration.

Under the new agreement, in addition to certain other risk
    protections provided to American Express, the Company will be
    required to provide reserves based primarily on its unrestricted
    cash



balance and net current exposure as of any calendar month-end
    measurement date, as summarized in the following table:

Required % of

Total Unrestricted Cash Balance(a)

Net Current Exposure(b)

Less than $2.4 billion


%

Less than $2.0 billion


%

Less than $1.35 billion


%

Less than $1.2 billion


%

(a)

Includes unrestricted cash, cash
    equivalents and short-term investments at month-end, including
    certain cash amounts already held in reserve, as defined by the
    agreement.

(b)

Net current exposure equals
    relevant advance ticket sales less certain exclusions, and as
    adjusted for specified amounts payable between United and the
    processor, as further defined by the agreement.

The new agreement permits the Company to provide certain
    replacement collateral in lieu of cash collateral, as long as
    the Company’s unrestricted cash is above
    $1.35 billion. Such replacement collateral may be pledged
    for any amount of the required reserve up to the full amount
    thereof, with the stated value of such collateral determined
    according to the agreement. Replacement collateral may be
    comprised of aircraft, slots and routes, real estate or other
    collateral as agreed between the parties.

In the near term, the Company will not be required to post
    reserves under the new American Express agreement as long as
    unrestricted cash as measured at each month-end, and as defined
    in the agreement, is equal to or above $2.0 billion.

If the terms of the new agreement had been in place at
    December 31, 2008, and ignoring the near term protection in
    the preceding sentence, the Company would have been required to
    provide collateral of approximately $40 million.

An increase in the future reserve requirements as provided by
    the terms of either or both the Company’s material card
    processing agreements could materially reduce the Company’s
    liquidity.

Capital Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet
    Arrangements.

The Company’s business is
    very capital intensive, requiring significant amounts of capital
    to fund the acquisition of assets, particularly aircraft. In the
    past, the Company has funded the acquisition of aircraft through
    outright purchase, by issuing debt, by entering into capital or
    operating leases, or through vendor financings. The Company also
    often enters into long-term lease commitments with airports to
    ensure access to terminal, cargo, maintenance and other required
    facilities.

    discussion of these items.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements.

An off-balance
    sheet arrangement is any transaction, agreement or other
    contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under
    which a company has (1) made guarantees, (2) a
    retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets,
    (3) an obligation under derivative instruments classified
    as equity or (4) any obligation arising out of a material
    variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides
    financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the
    company, or that engages in leasing, hedging or research and
    development arrangements with the company. The Company’s
    off-balance sheet arrangements include operating leases, which
    are summarized in the contractual obligations table, above, and
    certain municipal bond obligations, as discussed below, and
    letters of credit, of which $281 million were outstanding
    at December 31, 2008.

Certain municipalities have issued municipal bonds on behalf of
    United to finance the construction of improvements at
    airport-related facilities. The Company also leases facilities
    at airports where municipal bonds funded at least some of the
    construction of airport-related projects. At December 31,
    2008, the Company guaranteed interest and principal payments on
    $270 million in principal of such bonds that were
    originally issued in 1992, subsequently refinanced in 2007, and
    are due in 2032 unless



the Company elects not to extend its lease in which case the
    bonds are due in 2023. The outstanding bonds and related
    guarantee are not recorded in the Company’s

Statements
    of Consolidated Financial Position

in accordance with GAAP.
    The related lease agreement is accounted for as an operating
    lease with the associated rent expense recorded on a
    straight-line basis. The annual lease payments through 2023 and
    the final payment for the principal amount of the bonds are
    included in the operating lease payments in the contractual
    obligations table above. For further details, see Note 14,
    “Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and
    Uncertainties—Guarantees and Off-Balance Sheet
    Financing,” in

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements

.

Fuel Consortia.

The Company participates in
    numerous fuel consortia with other carriers at major airports to
    reduce the costs of fuel distribution and storage. Interline
    agreements govern the rights and responsibilities of the
    consortia members and provide for the allocation of the overall
    costs to operate the consortia based on usage. The consortia
    (and in limited cases, the participating carriers) have entered
    into long-term agreements to lease certain airport fuel storage
    and distribution facilities that are typically financed through
    tax-exempt bonds (either special facilities lease revenue bonds
    or general airport revenue bonds), issued by various local
    municipalities. In general, each consortium lease agreement
    requires the consortium to make lease payments in amounts
    sufficient to pay the maturing principal and interest payments
    on the bonds. As of December 31, 2008, approximately
    $1.2 billion principal amount of such bonds were secured by
    significant fuel facility leases in which United participates,
    as to which United and each of the signatory airlines have
    provided indirect guarantees of the debt. United’s exposure
    is approximately $226 million principal amount of such
    bonds based on its recent consortia participation. The
    Company’s exposure could increase if the participation of
    other carriers decreases. The guarantees will expire when the
    tax-exempt bonds are paid in full, which ranges from 2010 to
    2028. The Company did not record a liability at the time these
    indirect guarantees were made.

Other
    Information

Foreign Operations.

The Company’s

Statements of Consolidated Financial Position

reflect
    material amounts of intangible assets related to the
    Company’s Pacific and Latin American route authorities and
    its operations at London’s Heathrow Airport. Because
    operating authorities in international markets are governed by
    bilateral aviation agreements between the U.S. and foreign
    countries, changes in U.S. or foreign government aviation
    policies can lead to the alteration or termination of existing
    air service agreements that could adversely impact, and
    significantly impair, the value of our international route
    authorities and other assets. Significant changes in such
    policies could also have a material impact on the Company’s
    operating revenues and expenses and results of operations. For

Critical
    Accounting Policies

Critical accounting policies are defined as those that are
    affected by significant judgments and uncertainties which
    potentially could result in materially different accounting
    under different assumptions and conditions. The Company has
    prepared the accompanying financial statements in conformity
    with GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and
    assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial
    statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ
    from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
    The Company has identified the following critical accounting
    policies that impact the preparation of these financial
    statements.

Passenger Revenue Recognition.

The
    value of unused passenger tickets and miscellaneous charge
    orders (“MCOs”) is included in current liabilities as
    advance ticket sales. United records passenger ticket sales and
    tickets sold by other airlines for use on United as operating
    revenues when the transportation is provided or when the ticket
    expires. Tickets sold by other airlines are recorded at the
    estimated values



to be billed to the other airlines. Non-refundable tickets
    generally expire on the date of the intended flight, unless the
    date is extended by notification from the customer on or before
    the intended flight date. Fees charged in association with
    changes or extensions to non-refundable tickets are recorded as
    passenger revenue at the time the fee is collected. Change fees
    related to non-refundable tickets are considered a separate
    transaction from the air transportation because they represent a
    charge for the Company’s additional service to modify a
    previous reservation. Therefore, the pricing of the change fee
    and the initial customer reservation are separately determined
    and represent distinct earnings processes. Refundable tickets
    expire after one year. MCOs can be either exchanged for a
    passenger ticket or refunded after issuance. United records an
    estimate of tickets that have been used, but not recorded as
    revenue due to system processing errors, as revenue in the month
    of sale based on historical results. United also records an
    estimate of MCOs that will not be exchanged or refunded as
    revenue ratably over the redemption period based on historical
    results. Due to complex industry pricing structures, refund and
    exchange policies and interline agreements with other airlines,
    certain amounts are recognized as revenue using estimates both
    as to the timing of recognition and the amount of revenue to be
    recognized. These estimates are based on the evaluation of
    actual historical results.

Accounting for Frequent Flyer Program Miles Sold to Third
    Parties and the Advanced Purchase of
    Miles.

The Company has an agreement with its
    co-branded credit card partner that requires our partner to
    purchase miles in advance of when miles are awarded to the
    co-branded partner’s cardholders (referred to as
    “pre-purchased miles”). The pre-purchased miles are
    deferred when received by United in our

Statements of
    Consolidated Financial Position

as “Advanced purchase
    of miles.” The Company amended its agreement with its
    co-branded credit card partner in 2008. See Note 17,
    “Advanced Purchase of Miles,” in

Combined Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements

for a description of this
    agreement and its 2008 amendment. Subsequently, when our credit
    card partner awards pre-purchased miles to its cardholders, we
    transfer the related air transportation element for the awarded
    miles from “Advanced purchase of miles” to
    “Mileage Plus deferred revenue” at estimated fair
    value and record the residual marketing element as “Other
    operating revenue”. The deferred revenue portion is then
    subsequently recognized as passenger revenue when transportation
    is provided in exchange for the miles awarded. Accounting for
    the Company’s air transportation element and marketing
    elements are described below:

Other
    Frequent Flyer Accounting Policies.

Air Transportation Element.

The Company defers
    the portion of the sales proceeds that represents estimated fair
    value of the air transportation and recognizes that amount as
    revenue when transportation is provided. The fair value of the
    air transportation component is determined based upon the
    equivalent ticket value of similar fares on United and amounts
    paid to other airlines for miles. The initial revenue deferral
    is presented as “Mileage Plus deferred revenue” on our

Statements of Consolidated Financial Position.

When
    recognized, the revenue related to the air transportation
    component is classified as “passenger revenues” in our

Statements of Consolidated Operations

.

Marketing-related element.

The amount of
    revenue from the marketing-related element is determined by
    subtracting the fair value of the air transportation from the
    total sales proceeds. The residual portion of the sales proceeds
    related to marketing activities is recognized when miles are
    awarded. This portion is recognized as “Other operating
    revenues” in our

Statements of Consolidated
    Operations.

The Company’s frequent flyer obligation was recorded at
    fair value at February 1, 2006, the effective date of the
    Company’s emergence from bankruptcy. The deferred revenue
    measurement method used to record fair value of the frequent
    flyer obligation on and after the Effective Date is to allocate
    an equivalent weighted-average ticket value to each outstanding
    mile, based upon projected redemption patterns for available
    award choices when such miles are consumed. Such value is
    estimated assuming redemptions on both United and other
    participating carriers in the Mileage Plus program and by
    estimating the relative proportions of awards to be redeemed by
    class of service within broad geographic regions of the
    Company’s operations, including North America, Atlantic,
    Pacific and Latin America.



The estimation of the fair value of each award mile requires the
    use of several significant assumptions, for which significant
    management judgment is required. For example, management must
    estimate how many miles are projected to be redeemed on United,
    versus on other airline partners. Since the equivalent ticket
    value of miles redeemed on United and on other carriers can vary
    greatly, this assumption can materially affect the calculation
    of the weighted-average ticket value from period to period.

Management must also estimate the expected redemption patterns
    of Mileage Plus customers, who have a number of different award
    choices when redeeming their miles, each of which can have
    materially different estimated fair values. Such choices include
    different classes of service (first, business and several coach
    award levels), as well as different flight itineraries, such as
    domestic and international routings and different itineraries
    within domestic and international regions of United’s and
    other participating carriers’ route networks. Customer
    redemption patterns may also be influenced by program changes,
    which occur from time to time and introduce new award choices,
    or make material changes to the terms of existing award choices.
    Management must often estimate the probable impact of such
    program changes on future customer behavior, which requires the
    use of significant judgment. Management uses historical customer
    redemption patterns as the best single indicator of future
    redemption behavior in making its estimates, but changes in
    customer mileage redemption behavior to patterns which are not
    consistent with historical behavior can result in material
    changes to deferred revenue balances, and to recognized revenue.

The Company measures its deferred revenue obligation using all
    awarded and outstanding miles, regardless of whether or not the
    customer has accumulated enough miles to redeem an award.
    Eventually these customers will accumulate enough miles to
    redeem awards, or their accounts will deactivate after a period
    of inactivity, in which case the Company will recognize the
    related revenue through its revenue recognition policy for
    expired miles.

The Company recognizes revenue related to expected expired miles
    over the estimated redemption period. The Company’s
    estimate of the expected expiration of miles requires
    significant management judgment. In early 2007, the Company
    announced that it was reducing the expiration period for
    inactive accounts from 36 months to 18 months
    effective December 31, 2007. The change in the expiration
    period increased revenues by $246 million in 2007. Current
    and future changes to expiration assumptions or to the
    expiration policy, or to program rules and program redemption
    opportunities, may result in material changes to the deferred
    revenue balance, as well as recognized revenues from the
    program. In 2008, the Company updated certain of its assumptions
    related to the recognition of revenue for expiration of miles.
    Based on additional analysis of mileage redemption and
    expiration patterns, the Company revised the estimated number of
    miles that are expected to expire from 15% to 24% of earned
    miles, including miles that will expire or go unredeemed for
    reasons other than account deactivation. In 2008, the Company
    also extended the total time period over which revenue from its
    expiration of miles is recognized based upon the estimated
    period of miles redemption. This change did not materially
    impact the Company’s Mileage Plus revenue recognition in
    2008.

As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company’s
    outstanding number of miles was approximately 478.2 billion
    and 488.4 billion, respectively. The Company estimates that
    approximately 362.0 billion of the outstanding miles at
    December 31, 2008 will ultimately be redeemed based on
    assumptions as of December 31, 2008. At December 31,
    2008, a hypothetical 1% change in the Company’s outstanding
    number of miles or the weighted-average ticket value has
    approximately a $50 million effect on the liability.

Impairment Testing.

In accordance with
    SFAS 142 and SFAS 144 as of May 31, 2008, the
    Company performed an interim impairment test of its goodwill,
    all intangible assets and certain of its long-lived assets
    (principally aircraft and related spare engines and spare parts)
    due to events and changes in circumstances that indicated an
    impairment might have occurred. The Company also performed
    annual impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangible assets
    as of October 1, 2008 and further tested the potential
    impairment of certain tangible assets as of December 31,
    2008.



Factors deemed by management to have collectively constituted a
    potential impairment triggering event as of May 31, 2008
    included record high fuel prices, significant losses in the
    first and second quarters of 2008, a softening
    U.S. economy, analyst downgrade of UAUA common stock,
    rating agency changes in outlook for the Company’s debt
    instruments from stable to negative, the announcement of the
    planned removal from UAL’s fleet of 100 aircraft in 2008
    and 2009 and a significant decrease in the fair value of the
    Company’s outstanding equity and debt securities during the
    first five months of 2008, including a decline in UAL’s
    market capitalization to significantly below book value. The
    Company’s consolidated fuel expense increased by more than
    50% during this period.

As a result of the interim impairment testing performed as of
    May 31, 2008 and December 31, 2008, the Company
    recorded impairment charges during the year as presented in the
    table below. All of these impairment charges are within the
    mainline segment. All of the impairments other than the goodwill
    impairment, which is separately identified, are classified as
    “Other impairments and special items” in the
    Company’s

Statements of Consolidated Operations.

Discussed below is the methodology used for each type of asset

Accounting for Long-Lived Assets.

The
    net book value of operating property and equipment for UAL was
    $10.3 billion and $11.4 billion at December 31,
    2008 and 2007, respectively. In addition to the original cost of
    these assets, as adjusted by fresh-start reporting as of
    February 1, 2006, their recorded value is impacted by a
    number of accounting policy elections, including the estimation
    of useful lives and residual values and, when necessary, the
    recognition of asset impairment charges.

For purposes of testing impairment of long-lived assets at
    May 31, 2008, the Company determined whether the carrying
    amount of its long-lived assets was recoverable by comparing the
    carrying amount to the sum of the undiscounted cash flows
    expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the
    assets. If the carrying value of the assets exceeded the
    expected cash flows, the Company estimated the fair value of
    these assets to determine whether an impairment existed. The
    Company grouped its aircraft by fleet type to perform this
    evaluation and used data and assumptions through May 31,
    2008. The estimated undiscounted cash flows were dependent on a
    number of critical management assumptions including estimates of
    future capacity, passenger yield, traffic, operating costs
    (including fuel prices) and other relevant assumptions. If
    estimates of fair value were required, fair value was estimated
    using the market approach. Asset appraisals, published aircraft
    pricing guides and recent transactions for similar aircraft were
    considered by the Company in its market value determination. As
    of May 31, 2008, based on the results of these tests, the
    Company determined that an impairment of $36 million
    existed which was attributable to the Company’s fleet of
    owned B737 aircraft and related spare parts. As described in

Overview

above, the Company is retiring its entire B737
    fleet earlier than originally planned. The Company recorded an
    additional $2 million of impairment for other assets in the
    second quarter of 2008. Subsequently in the fourth quarter of
    2008, the Company determined it was necessary to perform an
    impairment test of certain of its operating fleet due to changes
    in market conditions for aircraft which



indicated a potential impairment of value. This impairment
    analysis resulted in an additional fourth quarter impairment
    charge of $107 million related to the Company’s B737
    fleet. This additional impairment charge was due to changes in
    market conditions and other conditions, including but not
    limited to the cancellation of multiple letters of intent that
    the Company had to sell B737 aircraft, that occurred since the
    impairment testing performed in the second quarter of 2008.

Due to the unfavorable economic and industry factors described
    above, the Company also determined in the second quarter of 2008
    that it was required to test its $91 million of
    pre-delivery aircraft deposits for impairment. The Company
    determined that these aircraft deposits were completely impaired
    and recorded an impairment charge to write-off their full
    carrying value and $14 million of related capitalized
    interest. The Company believes that it is highly unlikely that
    it will take these future aircraft deliveries and will therefore
    be required to forfeit the $91 million of deposits, which
    are not transferable.

As a result of the impairment testing described above, the
    Company’s goodwill and certain of its indefinite-lived
    intangible assets and tangible assets were recorded at fair
    value. In accordance with FASB Staff Position

No. 157-2

,
    Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157

, the Company
    has not applied Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

(“SFAS 157”) to the determination of the fair
    value of these assets. However, the provisions of SFAS 157
    were applied to the determination of the fair value of financial
    assets and financial liabilities that were part of the
    SFAS 142 Step Two goodwill fair value determination.

Due to extreme fuel price volatility, tight credit markets,
    uncertain economic environment, as well as other factors and
    uncertainties, the Company can provide no assurance that a
    material impairment charge of aircraft or indefinite-lived
    intangible assets will not occur in a future period. The value
    of our aircraft could be impacted in future periods by changes
    in the market for these aircraft. Such changes could result in a
    greater supply and lower demand for certain aircraft types as
    other carriers announce plans to retire similar aircraft. The
    Company will continue to monitor circumstances and events in
    future periods to determine whether additional interim asset
    impairment testing is warranted.

Except for the adoption of fresh-start reporting at
    February 1, 2006, whereby the Company remeasured long-lived
    assets at fair value, it is the Company’s policy to record
    assets acquired, including aircraft, at acquisition cost.
    Depreciable life is determined through economic analysis, such
    as reviewing existing fleet plans, obtaining appraisals and
    comparing estimated lives to other airlines that operate similar
    fleets. Older generation aircraft are assigned lives that are
    generally consistent with the experience of United and the
    practice of other airlines. As aircraft technology has improved,
    useful life has increased and the Company has generally
    estimated the lives of those aircraft to be 30 years.
    Residual values are estimated based on historical experience
    with regard to the sale of both aircraft and spare parts and are
    established in conjunction with the estimated useful lives of
    the related fleets. Residual values are based on current dollars
    when the aircraft are acquired and typically reflect asset
    values that have not reached the end of their physical life.
    Both depreciable lives and residual values are revised
    periodically to recognize changes in the Company’s fleet
    plan and other relevant information. A one year increase in the
    average depreciable life of our flight equipment would reduce
    annual depreciation expense on flight equipment by approximately
    $18 million.

Accounting for Goodwill and Intangible
    Assets.

Upon the implementation of
    fresh-start reporting (see Note 4, “Voluntary
    Reorganization Under Chapter 11—Fresh-Start
    Reporting,” in

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements

) the Company’s assets, liabilities and
    equity were generally valued at their respective fair values.
    The excess of reorganization value over the fair value of net
    tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities was
    recorded as goodwill in the accompanying

Statements of
    Consolidated Financial Position

on the Effective Date. The
    entire goodwill amount of $2.3 billion at December 31,
    2007 was allocated to the mainline reporting segment. In
    addition, the adoption of

fresh-start

reporting resulted in the recognition of $2.2 billion of
    indefinite-lived intangible assets.

In accordance with SFAS 142, the Company applies a fair
    value-based impairment test to the book value of goodwill and
    indefinite-lived intangible assets on an annual basis and, if
    certain events or



circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been
    incurred, on an interim basis. An impairment charge could have a
    material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position
    and results of operations in the period of recognition. The
    Company tested its goodwill and other indefinite-lived
    intangible assets for impairment during its annual impairment
    test as of October 1, 2007 and as part of its interim test
    as of May 31, 2008. The interim testing resulted in the
    total impairment of the Company’s goodwill and partial
    impairment of other indefinite-lived intangible assets. The
    Company also performed its annual interim test of
    indefinite-lived intangible assets as of October 1, 2008.

Goodwill—2008
    Interim Impairment Test

For purposes of testing goodwill, the Company performed Step One
    of the SFAS 142 test by estimating the fair value of the
    mainline reporting unit (to which all goodwill is allocated)
    utilizing several fair value measurement techniques, including
    two market estimates and one income estimate, and using relevant
    data available through and as of May 31, 2008. The market
    approach is a valuation technique in which fair value is
    estimated based on observed prices in actual transactions and on
    asking prices for similar assets. The valuation process is
    essentially that of comparison and correlation between the
    subject asset and other similar assets. The income approach is a
    technique in which fair value is estimated based on the cash
    flows that an asset could be expected to generate over its
    useful life, including residual value cash flows. These cash
    flows are discounted to their present value equivalents using a
    rate of return that accounts for the relative risk of not
    realizing the estimated annual cash flows and for the time value
    of money. Certain variations of the income approach were used to
    determine certain of the intangible asset fair values.

Under the market approaches, the fair value of the mainline
    reporting unit was estimated based upon the fair value of
    invested capital for UAL, as well as a separate comparison to
    revenue and EBITDAR multiples for similar publicly traded
    companies in the airline industry. The fair value estimates
    using both market approaches included a control premium similar
    to those observed for historical airline and transportation
    company market transactions.

Under the income approach, the fair value of the mainline
    reporting unit was estimated based upon the present value of
    estimated future cash flows for UAL. The income approach is
    dependent on a number of critical management assumptions
    including estimates of future capacity, passenger yield,
    traffic, operating costs (including fuel prices), appropriate
    discount rates and other relevant assumptions. The Company
    estimated its future fuel-related cash flows for the income
    approach based on the

five-year

forward curve for crude oil as of May 31, 2008. The impacts
    of the Company’s aircraft and other tangible and intangible
    asset impairments, discussed below, were considered in the fair
    value estimation of the mainline reporting unit.

Taking into consideration an equal weighting of the two market
    estimates and the income estimate, which has been the
    Company’s practice when performing annual goodwill
    impairment tests, the indicated fair value of the mainline
    reporting unit was less than its carrying value, and therefore,
    the Company was required to perform Step Two of the
    SFAS 142 goodwill impairment test.

In Step Two of the impairment test, the Company determined the
    implied fair value of goodwill of the mainline reporting unit by
    allocating the fair value of the reporting unit determined in
    Step One to all the assets and liabilities of the mainline
    reporting unit, including any recognized and unrecognized
    intangible assets, as if the mainline reporting unit had been
    acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the
    mainline reporting unit was the acquisition price. As a result
    of the Step Two testing, the Company determined that goodwill
    was completely impaired and therefore recorded an impairment
    charge to write-off the full value of goodwill.

Indefinite-lived
    Intangible Assets

The Company utilized appropriate valuation techniques to
    separately estimate the fair values of all of its
    indefinite-lived intangible assets as of May 31, 2008 and
    compared those estimates to related carrying values. Tested
    assets included tradenames, international route authorities,
    London Heathrow



slots and codesharing agreements. The Company used a market or
    income valuation approach, as described above, to estimate fair
    values. Based on the preliminary results of this testing, the
    Company recorded $80 million of impairment charges during
    the second quarter of 2008 and in the third quarter of 2008
    reduced the impairment charge by $16 million as a result of
    the finalization of the impairment testing. No impairments of
    indefinite-lived intangible assets resulted from the
    Company’s annual impairment test performed as of
    October 1, 2008.

Other Postretirement Benefit
    Accounting.

The Company accounts for other
    postretirement benefits using Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards No. 106,

Employers’ Accounting for
    Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions

(“SFAS 106”) and Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 158,

Employers’ Accounting
    for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
    Plans—an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106
    and 132(R)

(“SFAS 158”). For the year ended
    December 31, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS 158, which
    requires the Company to recognize the difference between plan
    assets and obligations, or the plan’s funded status, in its

Statements of Consolidated Financial Position

. Under
    these accounting standards, other postretirement benefit expense
    is recognized on an accrual basis over employees’
    approximate service periods and is generally calculated
    independently of funding decisions or requirements. The Company
    has not been required to pre-fund its current and future plan
    obligations, which has resulted in a significant net obligation,
    as discussed below.

The fair value of plan assets at December 31, 2008 and 2007
    was $57 million and $56 million, respectively, for the
    other postretirement benefit plans. The benefit obligation was
    $2.0 billion for the other postretirement benefit plans at
    both December 31, 2008 and 2007. The difference between the
    plan assets and obligations has been recorded in the

Statements of Consolidated Financial Position

. Detailed
    information regarding the Company’s other postretirement
    plans, including key assumptions, is included in Note 9,
    “Retirement and Postretirement Plans,” in

Combined
    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

.

The following provides a summary of the methodology used to
    determine the assumptions disclosed in Note 9,
    “Retirement and Postretirement Plans,” in

Combined
    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

. The calculation
    of other postretirement benefit expense and obligations requires
    the use of a number of assumptions, including the assumed
    discount rate for measuring future payment obligations and the
    expected return on plan assets. The discount rates were based on
    the construction of theoretical corporate bond portfolios,
    adjusted according to the timing of expected cash flows for the
    payment of the Company’s future postretirement obligations.
    A yield curve was developed based on a subset of these bonds
    (those with yields between the 10th and
    90th percentiles). The projected cash flows were matched to
    this yield curve and a present value developed, which was then
    calibrated to develop a single equivalent risk-adjusted discount
    rate.

Actuarial gains or losses are triggered by changes in
    assumptions or experience that differ from the original
    assumptions. Under the applicable accounting standards, those
    gains and losses are not required to be recognized currently as
    other postretirement expense, but instead may be deferred as
    part of accumulated other comprehensive income and amortized
    into expense over the average remaining service life of the
    covered active employees. The Company’s accounting policy
    is to not apply the corridor approach available under
    SFAS 106 with respect to amortization of amounts included
    in accumulated other comprehensive income. Under the corridor
    approach, amortization of any gain or loss in accumulated other
    comprehensive income is only required if, at the beginning of
    the year, the accumulated gain or loss exceeds 10% of the
    greater of the benefit obligation or the fair value of assets.
    If amortization is required, the minimum amount outside the
    corridor divided by the average remaining service period of
    active employees is recognized as expense. The corridor approach
    is intended to reduce volatility of amounts recorded in pension
    expense each year. Since the Company has elected not to apply
    the corridor approach, all gains and losses in accumulated other
    comprehensive income are amortized and included in pension
    expense each year. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the
    Company had unrecognized actuarial gains of $286 million
    and $254 million, respectively, recorded in accumulated
    other comprehensive income for its other postretirement benefit
    plans.



Valuation Allowance for Deferred Tax
    Assets.

At December 31, 2008, the
    Company had valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets
    of approximately $2.9 billion. In accordance with Statement
    of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109,

Accounting
    for Income Taxes

, a valuation allowance is required to be
    recorded when it is more likely than not that deferred tax
    assets will not be realized. Future realization depends on the
    existence of sufficient taxable income within the carry forward
    period available under the tax law. Sources of future taxable
    income include future reversals of taxable temporary
    differences, future taxable income exclusive of reversing
    taxable differences, taxable income in carry back years and tax
    planning strategies. These sources of positive evidence of
    realizability must be weighed against negative evidence, such as
    cumulative losses in recent years. A recent history of losses
    would make difficult a determination that a valuation allowance
    is not needed.

In forming a judgment about the future realization of our
    deferred tax assets, management considered both the positive and
    negative evidence of realizability and gave significant weight
    to the negative evidence from our cumulative losses for recent
    years. Management will continue to assess this situation and
    make appropriate adjustments to the valuation allowance based on
    its evaluation of the positive and negative evidence existing at
    that time. We are currently unable to forecast when there will
    be sufficient positive evidence for us to reverse the remainder
    of the valuation allowances that we have recorded. Through
    December 31, 2008, any reversals of valuation allowance
    would have reduced goodwill, if any, then intangible assets. See
    Note 1(p), “Summary of Significant Accounting
    Policies—New Accounting Pronouncements,” for
    information regarding the effect of changes to this method of
    accounting for valuation allowance reversals, if any, on the
    Company’s results of operations and financial condition

    No. 141 (revised 2007),

Forward-Looking
    Information

Certain statements throughout Item 7,

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

and elsewhere in this report are forward-looking
    and thus reflect the Company’s current expectations and
    beliefs with respect to certain current and future events and
    financial performance. Such forward-looking statements are and
    will be subject to many risks and uncertainties relating to
    United’s operations and business environment that may cause
    actual results to differ materially from any future results
    expressed or implied in such forward-looking statements. Words
    such as “expects,” “will,”
    “plans,” “anticipates,”
    “indicates,” “believes,”
    “forecast,” “guidance,” “outlook”
    and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking
    statements.

Additionally, forward-looking statements include statements
    which do not relate solely to historical facts, such as
    statements which identify uncertainties or trends, discuss the
    possible future effects of current known trends or
    uncertainties, or which indicate that the future effects of
    known trends or uncertainties cannot be predicted, guaranteed or
    assured. All forward-looking statements in this report are based
    upon information available to the Company on the date of this
    report. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update
    or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of
    new information, future events, changed circumstances or
    otherwise.

The Company’s actual results could differ materially from
    these forward-looking statements due to numerous factors
    including, without limitation, the following: its ability to
    comply with the terms of financing arrangements; the costs and
    availability of financing; its ability to execute its business
    plan; its ability to realize benefits from its resource
    optimization efforts and cost reduction initiatives; its ability
    to utilize its net operating losses; its ability to attract,
    motivate

and/or

retain key employees; its ability to attract and retain
    customers; demand for transportation in the markets in which it
    operates; general economic conditions (including interest rates,
    foreign currency exchange rates, crude oil prices, costs of



aviation fuel and energy refining capacity in relevant markets);
    its ability to cost-effectively hedge against increases in the
    price of aviation fuel, including its ability to meet the
    liquidity requirements of cash deposits which may be required
    from time to time under hedge agreements; the effects of any
    hostilities, act of war or terrorist attack; the ability of
    other air carriers with whom the Company has alliances or
    partnerships to provide the services contemplated by the
    respective arrangements with such carriers; the costs and
    availability of aircraft insurance; the costs associated with
    security measures and practices; labor costs; industry
    consolidation; competitive pressures on pricing and on demand;
    capacity decisions of United

and/or

its
    competitors; U.S. or foreign governmental legislation,
    regulation and other actions, including open skies agreements;
    its ability to maintain satisfactory labor relations; any
    disruptions to operations due to any potential actions by its
    labor groups; weather conditions; and other risks and
    uncertainties set forth under Item 1A,

Risk Factors

of this

Form 10-K,

as well as other risks and uncertainties set forth from time to
    time in the reports the Company files with the SEC.
    Consequently, forward-looking statements should not be regarded
    as representations or warranties by the Company that such
    matters will be realized.



ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE
    AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Interest Rate and Foreign Currency Exchange Rate
    Risks.

United’s exposure to market risk
    associated with changes in interest rates relates primarily to
    its debt obligations and short-term investments. The Company
    does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment
    portfolio. United’s policy is to manage interest rate risk
    through a combination of fixed and variable rate debt and by
    entering into swap agreements, depending upon market conditions.
    A portion of United’s aircraft lease obligations and
    related accrued interest ($306 million in equivalent
    U.S. dollars at December 31, 2008) is denominated
    in foreign currencies that expose the Company to risks
    associated with changes in foreign exchange rates. To hedge
    against this risk, United has placed foreign currency deposits
    ($306 million in equivalent U.S. dollars at
    December 31, 2008), primarily for euros, to meet foreign
    currency lease obligations denominated in that respective
    currency. Since unrealized

mark-to-market

gains or losses on the foreign currency deposits are offset by
    the losses or gains on the foreign currency obligations, United
    has hedged its overall exposure to foreign currency exchange
    rate volatility with respect to its foreign lease deposits and
    obligations. The fair value of these deposits is determined
    based on the present value of future cash flows using an
    appropriate swap rate. The fair value of long-term debt is
    predominantly based on the present value of future cash flows
    using a U.S. Treasury rate that matches the remaining life
    of the instrument, adjusted by a credit spread and, to a lesser
    extent, on the quoted market prices for the same or similar
    instruments. The table below presents information as of
    December 31, 2008 about certain of the Company’s
    financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest
    and exchange rates. Amounts shown below are the same for both
    UAL and United, except as noted.

Amounts also represent United
    except that in 2008, United’s carrying value and fair value
    of its cash equivalents and debt obligations are approximately
    $6 million and $2 million, respectively, lower than
    the reported UAL amounts. The reported 2007 cash equivalents
    balance includes cash of $1.3 billion with a weighted
    average rate of 5.12% and short-term investments of
    $2.3 billion with a weighted average rate of 5.04%.
    United’s 2007 cash equivalents and debt obligations were
    approximately $56 million and $3 million,
    respectively, lower than the amounts reported for UAL.

In addition to the cash equivalents included in the table above,
    UAL and United have $54 million and $50 million of
    short-term restricted cash, respectively, and $218 million
    and $217 million, respectively, of long-term restricted
    cash. As discussed in Note 1(d), “Summary of
    Significant Accounting Policies—Cash and Cash Equivalents,
    Short-Term Investments and Restricted Cash” in

Combined
    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

, this cash is
    being held in restricted accounts primarily for workers’
    compensation obligations, security deposits for airport leases
    and reserves with institutions that process United’s credit
    card ticket sales. Due to the short term nature of these cash
    balances, their carrying values approximate their fair values.
    The Company’s interest income is exposed to changes in
    interest rates on these cash balances. During 2007, the Company
    also repurchased certain of its own debt instruments, which
    remain outstanding and have a fair value and carrying value of
    $46 million at



December 31, 2008. The Company recognizes changes in fair
    value of these securities through other comprehensive income;
    however, on a net basis, the Company is not exposed to market
    risk due to the existence of offsetting changes in the fair
    value of the Company’s related debt obligations.

The material changes in the amounts reported in the table above
    for 2008 as compared to 2007 include the following:
    (1) cash and short-term investments decreased by
    approximately $1.5 billion primarily due to cash used for
    operating activities as discussed in

Liquidity

above;
    (2) lease deposits decreased by $190 million due to
    scheduled payments and aircraft acquisitions under lease
    agreement terms; and (3) debt obligations decreased by
    $316 million primarily due to scheduled debt repayments in
    2008, which were partially offset by new debt issuances in 2008.
    The interest rate on the Company’s cash and variable rate
    debt decreased in 2008, as compared to 2007, primarily due to a
    decrease in market interest rates.

Commodity Price Risk (Jet Fuel).

Our
    results of operations and liquidity have been, and may continue
    to be, materially impacted by changes in the price of aircraft
    fuel and other oil-related commodities and related derivative
    instruments. When market conditions indicate risk reduction is
    achievable, United may use commodity option contracts or other
    derivative instruments to reduce its price risk exposure to jet
    fuel. The Company’s derivative positions are typically
    comprised of crude oil, heating oil and jet fuel derivatives.
    The derivative instruments are designed to provide protection
    against increases in the price of aircraft fuel. Some derivative
    instruments may result in hedging losses if the underlying
    commodity prices drop below specified floors; however, the
    negative impact of these losses may be offset by the benefit of
    lower jet fuel acquisition cost since the Company typically does
    not hedge all of its fuel consumption. United may adjust its
    hedging program based on changes in market conditions. At
    December 31, 2008, the fair value of United’s
    fuel-related derivatives was a payable of $867 million, as
    compared to a receivable of $20 million at
    December 31, 2007. The primary reason for this change was
    due to the dramatic spike in fuel prices through July 2008 and
    the subsequent fuel price decreases in the latter part of 2008.
    At December 31, 2008, the fuel derivative payables includes
    $140 million related to pending settlements for purchased
    options and expired contracts.

As of December 31, 2008, the Company had hedged its
    forecasted consolidated fuel consumption as shown in the table
    below.

As presented in the table above, in 2008 the Company began
    modifying its fuel hedge portfolio by purchasing put options
    contracts to effectively cap losses on its short put option
    positions from further oil price decreases. The Company may take
    additional actions to reduce potential losses and collateral
    requirements that could arise from its short put option
    positions. Certain 3-way collars and collars included in the
    table above have sold puts with twice the notional amount of the
    purchased calls. The Company’s exposure to losses, should
    the positions settle below the put exercise price, exceeds its
    potential benefit from price increases above the purchased call
    exercise price. The Company classifies gains (losses) resulting
    from these collar structures as nonoperating income (expense).
    As of December 31, 2008, the Company had hedged less than
    1% of its 2010 forecasted fuel consumption.

The above derivative positions are subject to potential
    counterparty cash collateral requirements in some circumstances.
    The Company provided counterparties with cash collateral of
    $965 million as of December 31, 2008. This collateral
    decreased to $780 million as of January 19, 2009
    primarily due to the settlement of the December 2008 contracts.
    Our counterparties may require greater amounts of collateral
    when the price of the underlying commodity decreases and lesser
    amounts when the price of the underlying commodity increases.
    However, the Company has mitigated some of its exposure to
    larger collateral requirements by purchasing puts to cover its
    short put positions as presented in the table above. The
    following table presents the Company’s actual collateral
    position as of January 19, 2009 and estimated fuel
    collateral position at the end of each quarter in 2009 based on
    the Company’s January 16, 2009 hedge positions and
    closing forward curve fuel prices:

Because United had already posted significant amounts of
    collateral during 2008, the 2009 net cash impacts of the
    hedge settlements are not expected to be material based on
    January 16, 2009 forward curve prices and the
    Company’s January 16, 2009 hedge position. As hedges
    settle, this collateral will be returned to cover cash settled
    losses. The following table presents information regarding
    estimated fuel purchase cost and estimated cash requirements to
    meet fuel hedge losses based on the Company’s actual
    collateral position as of January 19, 2009 using closing
    forward fuel prices as of January 16, 2009 and other
    factors.

Actual collateral requirements, fuel purchase costs and cash
    requirements for hedge losses will vary depending on changes in
    forward fuel prices, modifications to the Company’s fuel
    hedge portfolio and other factors. The table below outlines the
    Company’s estimated collateral provisions at various crude
    oil prices, based on the hedge portfolio as of January 16,
    2009.

For example, using the table above, at an illustrative $35 per
    barrel at January 16, 2009, the Company’s required
    collateral provision to its derivative counterparties would be
    approximately $780 million.

Foreign Currency.

United generates
    revenues and incurs expenses in numerous foreign currencies.
    Such expenses include fuel, aircraft leases, commissions,
    catering, personnel expense, advertising and distribution costs,
    customer service expenses and aircraft maintenance. Changes in
    foreign currency exchange rates impact the Company’s
    results of operations through changes in the dollar value of
    foreign currency-denominated operating revenues and expenses.

Despite the adverse effects a strengthening foreign currency may
    have on demand for

U.S.-originating

traffic, a strengthening of foreign currencies tends to increase
    reported revenue and operating income because the Company’s
    foreign currency-denominated operating revenue generally exceeds
    its foreign currency-denominated operating expense for each
    currency. Likewise, despite the favorable effects a weakening
    foreign currency may have on demand for

U.S.-originating

traffic, a weakening of foreign currencies tends to decrease
    reported revenue and operating income.

The Company’s most significant net foreign currency
    exposures in 2008, based on exchange rates in effect at
    December 31, 2008, are presented in the table below:

The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge a
    portion of its exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange
    rates. As of December 31, 2008, the Company hedged a
    portion of its expected foreign currency cash flows in the
    Australian dollar, Canadian dollar and European Euro. As of
    December 31, 2008, the notional amount of these foreign
    currencies hedged with the forward contracts in
    U.S. dollars was approximately $62 million, based on
    contractual forward rates. These contracts had a fair value of
    $10 million at December 31, 2008 and expire at various
    dates through March 2009. As of December 31, 2007, the
    notional amount of these foreign currencies hedged with the
    forward contracts in U.S. dollars terms was approximately
    $346 million, with a fair value of $1 million.



ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

UAL Corporation

Chicago, Illinois

We have audited the accompanying statements of consolidated
    financial position of UAL Corporation and subsidiaries (the
    “Company”) as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and
    the related statements of consolidated operations, consolidated
    stockholders’ equity (deficit), and consolidated cash flows
    for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 and eleven
    months ended December 31, 2006 (Successor Company
    operations) and for the one month ended January 31, 2006
    (Predecessor Company operations). Our audits also included the
    financial statement schedule of the Successor Company for the
    years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 and eleven months
    ended December 31, 2006 and the Predecessor Company for the
    one month ended January 31, 2006 as listed in the Index at
    Item 15. These consolidated financial statements and
    financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the
    Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on these financial statements and financial statement
    schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial
    statements, on January 20, 2006, the Bankruptcy Court
    entered an order confirming the plan of reorganization which
    became effective after the close of business on February 1,
    2006. Accordingly, the accompanying consolidated financial
    statements have been prepared in conformity with AICPA Statement
    of Position

90-7,

“Financial Reporting by Entities in Reorganization Under
    the Bankruptcy Code,” for the Successor Company as a new
    entity with assets, liabilities and a capital structure having
    carrying values not comparable with prior periods as described
    in Note 1.

In our opinion, the Successor Company consolidated financial
    statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
    financial position of UAL Corporation and subsidiaries as of
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the results of their
    operations and their cash flows for the years ended
    December 31, 2008 and 2007 and the eleven month period
    ended December 31, 2006 in conformity with accounting
    principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
    Further, in our opinion, the Predecessor Company consolidated
    financial statements present fairly, in all material respects,
    the results of operations and cash flows of the Predecessor
    Company for the one month ended January 31, 2006, in
    conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such Successor
    Company financial statement schedule and Predecessor Company
    financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the
    basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole,
    present fairly in all material respects the information set
    forth therein.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial
    statements on January 1, 2006, the Company adopted
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123
    (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment” which changed
    the method of accounting for share based payments.



We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on the
    criteria established in “Internal Control—Integrated
    Framework” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated
    March 2, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion on the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to
    have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal
    control over financial reporting. Our audits included
    consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a
    basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the
    circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
    on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An
    audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
    supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
    statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
    significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
    the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
    our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial
    statements, on January 20, 2006, the Bankruptcy Court
    entered an order confirming the plan of reorganization which
    became effective after the close of business on February 1,
    2006. Accordingly, the accompanying consolidated financial
    statements have been prepared in conformity with AICPA Statement
    of Position

90-7,

“Financial Reporting by Entities in Reorganization Under
    the Bankruptcy Code,” for the Successor Company as a new
    entity with assets, liabilities and a capital structure having
    carrying values not comparable with prior periods as described
    in Note 1.

In our opinion, the Successor Company consolidated financial
    statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
    financial position of United Air Lines, Inc. and subsidiaries as
    of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the results of their
    operations and their cash flows for the years ended
    December 31, 2008 and 2007 and the eleven month period
    ended December 31, 2006 in conformity with accounting
    principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
    Further, in our opinion, the Predecessor Company consolidated
    financial statements present fairly, in all material respects,
    the results of operations and cash flows of the Predecessor
    Company for the one month ended January 31, 2006, in
    conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such Successor
    Company financial statement schedule and Predecessor Company
    financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the
    basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole,
    present fairly in all material respects the information set
    forth therein.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial
    statements on January 1, 2006, the Company adopted
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123
    (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment” which changed
    the method of accounting for share based payments.

UAL
    Corporation and Subsidiary Companies

Combined
    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

The
    Company

UAL Corporation (together with its consolidated subsidiaries,
    “UAL”) is a holding company whose principal,
    wholly-owned subsidiary is United Air Lines, Inc. (together with
    its consolidated subsidiaries, “United”). We sometimes
    use the words “we,” “our,” “us”
    and the “Company” in this Annual Report on

Form 10-K

for disclosures that relate to both UAL and United.

This Annual Report on

Form 10-K

is a combined report of UAL and United. Therefore, these

Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

apply
    to both UAL and United, unless otherwise noted. As UAL
    consolidates United for financial statement purposes,
    disclosures that relate to activities of United also apply to
    UAL.

(1)

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

(a)

Basis of Presentation

—UAL is a holding
    company whose principal subsidiary is United. The Company’s
    consolidated financial statements include the accounts of its
    majority-owned affiliates. All significant intercompany
    transactions are eliminated. Certain prior year amounts have
    been reclassified to conform to the current year’s
    presentation. Reclassifications in the

Statements of
    Consolidated Cash Flows

include reclassifications of
    “Other impairments and special items” and
    “Additions to deferred software costs” which are
    currently classified as a separate line items and were
    historically classified within “Other operating
    activities” and “Other investing activities,”
    respectively.

Upon emergence from its Chapter 11 proceedings, the Company
    adopted fresh-start reporting in accordance with American
    Institute of Certified Public Accountants’ Statement of
    Position

90-7,

Financial Reporting by Entities in Reorganization under the
    Bankruptcy Code

(“SOP 90-7”)

as of February 1, 2006. The Company’s emergence from
    reorganization resulted in a new reporting entity with no
    retained earnings or accumulated deficit as of February 1,
    2006 (the “Effective Date”). Accordingly, the
    Company’s consolidated financial statements for periods
    before February 1, 2006 are not comparable to consolidated
    financial statements presented on or after February 1,
    2006. References to “Successor Company” refer to UAL
    and United on or after February 1, 2006, after giving
    effect to the adoption of fresh-start reporting. References to
    “Predecessor Company” refer to UAL and United before
    February 1, 2006. See Note 4, “Voluntary
    Reorganization Under Chapter 11—Fresh-Start
    Reporting,” for further details.

(b)

Use of Estimates

—The preparation of financial
    statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”)
    requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
    affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
    accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those
    estimates.

The Company estimates fair value of its financial instruments
    and its reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets
    for testing impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets,
    including goodwill. These estimates and assumptions are
    inherently subject to significant uncertainties and
    contingencies beyond the control of the Company. Accordingly,
    the Company cannot provide assurance that the estimates,
    assumptions and values reflected in the valuations will be
    realized, and actual results could vary materially.

(c)

Airline Revenues

—The value of unused
    passenger tickets and miscellaneous charge orders
    (“MCOs”) are included in current liabilities as
    advance ticket sales. United records passenger ticket sales and
    tickets sold by other airlines for use on United as operating
    revenues when the transportation is provided or when the ticket
    expires. Tickets sold by other airlines are recorded at the
    estimated values to be billed to the other airlines.
    Non-refundable tickets generally expire on the date of the
    intended flight, unless the date is extended by notification
    from the customer



on or before the intended flight date. Fees charged in
    association with changes or extensions to non-refundable tickets
    are recorded as passenger revenue at the time the fee is
    incurred. Change fees related to non-refundable tickets are
    considered a separate transaction from the air transportation
    because they represent a charge for the Company’s
    additional service to modify a previous order. Therefore, the
    pricing of the change fee and the initial customer order are
    separately determined and represent distinct earnings processes.
    Refundable tickets expire after one year.

MCOs can be exchanged for a passenger ticket or refunded after
    issuance. United estimates the amount of MCOs that will not be
    exchanged or refunded and recognizes revenue for these MCOs
    ratably over the redemption period, based on historical
    experience.

United records an estimate of tickets that have been used, but
    not recorded as revenue due to system processing errors, as
    revenue in the month of sale based on historical results. Due to
    complex industry pricing structures, refund and exchange
    policies and interline agreements with other airlines, certain
    amounts are recognized as revenue using estimates both as to the
    timing of recognition and the amount of revenue to be
    recognized. These estimates are based on the evaluation of
    actual historical results. United recognizes cargo and mail
    revenue as service is provided.

(d)

Cash and Cash Equivalents, Short-Term Investments,
    Restricted Cash

—Cash in excess of operating
    requirements is invested in short-term, highly liquid
    investments. Investments with a maturity of three months or less
    on their acquisition date are classified as cash and cash
    equivalents. Other investments are classified as short-term
    investments. Investments classified as

held-to-maturity

are stated at amortized cost, which approximates market due to
    their short-term maturities. Investments in debt securities
    classified as

available-for-sale

are stated at fair value. The gains or losses from sales of

available-for-sale

securities are included in other comprehensive income.

As of December 31, 2008, approximately 50% of the
    Company’s cash and cash equivalents consisted of money
    market funds directly or indirectly invested in
    U.S. treasury securities with the remainder largely in
    money market funds that are covered by the new government money
    market funds guarantee program. There are no withdrawal
    restrictions at the present time on any of the money market
    funds in which the Company has invested. In addition, the
    Company has no auction rate securities as of December 31,
    2008. At December 31, 2007, UAL’s and United’s
    investments in debt securities classified as

held-to-maturity

included $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively,
    recorded in cash and cash equivalents and $2.3 billion
    recorded in short-term investments for both UAL and United.

In 2008 and 2007, restricted cash includes cash collateral to
    secure workers’ compensation obligations and reserves for
    institutions that process credit card ticket sales. The Company
    classifies changes in restricted cash balances as an investing
    activity in its statement of consolidated cash flows, because we
    consider restricted cash similar to an investment. Certain other
    companies within our industry also classify certain of their
    restricted cash transactions as investing activities in their
    statement of cash flows, while others classify certain of their
    restricted cash transactions as operating activities in their
    statement of cash flows. The pro-forma impact of UAL classifying
    all changes in its restricted cash balances as operating
    activities in the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    the eleven month period from February 1, 2006 to



December 31, 2006 and the one month period ended
    January 31, 2006 is shown in the table below:

(e)

Aircraft Fuel, Spare Parts and Supplies

—The
    Company records fuel, maintenance, operating supplies and
    aircraft spare parts at cost when acquired and provides an
    obsolescence allowance for aircraft spare parts.

(f)

Operating Property and Equipment

—The Company
    records additions to owned operating property and equipment at
    cost when acquired. Property under capital leases and the
    related obligation for future lease payments are recorded at an
    amount equal to the initial present value of those lease
    payments. Owned operating property and equipment, and equipment
    under capital leases, were stated at fair value as of
    February 1, 2006 upon the adoption of fresh-start reporting.

Depreciation and amortization of owned depreciable assets is
    based on the straight-line method over the assets’
    estimated service lives. Leasehold improvements are amortized
    over the remaining term of the lease, including estimated
    facility renewal options when renewal is reasonably assured at
    key airports, or the estimated service life of the related
    asset, whichever is less. Properties under capital leases are
    amortized on the straight-line method over the life of the lease
    or, in the case of certain aircraft, over their estimated
    service lives. Amortization of capital leases is included in
    depreciation and amortization expense. The estimated useful
    lives of our property and equipment are as follows:

Estimated Useful Life (in years)

Aircraft

27 to 30

Buildings

25 to 45

Other property and equipment

4 to 15

Software (a)


Aircraft lease terms

3 to 17

Building lease terms


(a)

The carrying amount of computer
    software, which is classified as noncurrent other assets in our

Statements of Consolidated Financial Position,

was
    $182 million and $157 million at December 31,
    2008 and 2007, respectively.

Maintenance and repairs, including the cost of minor
    replacements, are charged to maintenance expense as incurred,
    except for costs incurred under our

power-by-the-hour

engine maintenance agreements, which are expensed based upon the
    number of hours flown. Costs of additions to and renewals of
    units of property are capitalized as property and equipment
    additions.



(g)

Mileage Plus Awards

—The Company has an
    agreement with its co-branded credit card partner that requires
    our partner to purchase miles in advance of when miles are
    awarded to the

co-branded

partner’s cardholders (referred to as “pre-purchased
    miles”). These sales are deferred when received by United
    in our

Statements of Consolidated Financial Position

as
    “Advanced purchase of miles.” Subsequently, when our
    credit card partner awards

pre-purchased

miles to its cardholders, we transfer the related air
    transportation element for the awarded miles from “Advanced
    purchase of miles” to “Mileage Plus deferred
    revenue” at estimated fair value and record the residual
    marketing element as “Other operating revenue.” The
    deferred revenue portion is then subsequently recognized as
    passenger revenue when transportation is provided in exchange
    for the miles awarded. Additional information on accounting for
    each of these elements is as follows:

Air Transportation Element.

The Company defers
    the portion of the sales proceeds that represents estimated fair
    value of the air transportation and recognizes that amount as
    revenue when transportation is provided. The fair value of the
    air transportation component is determined based upon the
    equivalent ticket value of similar fares on United and amounts
    paid to other airlines for miles. The initial revenue deferral
    is presented as “Mileage Plus deferred revenue” on our

Statements of Consolidated Financial Position

. When
    recognized, the revenue related to the air transportation
    component is classified as “passenger revenues” in our

Statements of Consolidated Operations

.

Marketing-related element.

The amount of
    revenue from the marketing-related element is determined by
    subtracting the fair value of the air transportation from the
    total sales proceeds. The residual portion of the sales proceeds
    related to marketing activities is recognized when miles are
    awarded. This portion is recognized as “Other operating
    revenues” in our

Statements of Consolidated
    Operations

.

The Company’s frequent flyer obligation was recorded at
    fair value at February 1, 2006, the effective date of the
    Company’s emergence from bankruptcy. The deferred revenue
    measurement method used to record fair value of the frequent
    flyer obligation on and after the Effective Date is to allocate
    an equivalent weighted-average ticket value to each outstanding
    mile, based upon projected redemption patterns for available
    award choices when such miles are consumed. Such value is
    estimated assuming redemptions on both United and other
    participating carriers in the Mileage Plus program and by
    estimating the relative proportions of awards to be redeemed by
    class of service within broad geographic regions of the
    Company’s operations, including North America, Atlantic,
    Pacific and Latin America.

The estimation of the fair value of each award mile requires the
    use of several significant assumptions, for which significant
    management judgment is required. For example, management must
    estimate how many miles are projected to be redeemed on United,
    versus on other airline partners. Since the equivalent ticket
    value of miles redeemed on United and on other carriers can vary
    greatly, this assumption can materially affect the calculation
    of the weighted-average ticket value from period to period.

Management must also estimate the expected redemption patterns
    of Mileage Plus customers, who have a number of different award
    choices when redeeming their miles, each of which can have
    materially different estimated fair values. Such choices include
    different classes of service (first, business and several coach
    award levels), as well as different flight itineraries, such as
    domestic and international routings and different itineraries
    within domestic and international regions of United’s and
    other participating carriers’ route networks. Customer
    redemption patterns may also be influenced by program changes,
    which occur from time to time and introduce new award choices,
    or make material changes to the terms of existing award choices.
    Management must often estimate the probable impact of such
    program changes on future customer behavior, which requires the
    use of significant judgment. Management uses historical customer
    redemption patterns as the best single indicator of future
    redemption behavior in



making its estimates, but changes in customer mileage redemption
    behavior to patterns which are not consistent with historical
    behavior can result in material changes to deferred revenue
    balances, and to recognized revenue.

The Company measures its deferred revenue obligation using all
    awarded and outstanding miles, regardless of whether or not the
    customer has accumulated enough miles to redeem an award.
    Eventually these customers will accumulate enough miles to
    redeem awards, or their accounts will deactivate after a period
    of inactivity, in which case the Company will recognize the
    related revenue through its revenue recognition policy for
    expired miles.

The Company recognizes revenue related to expected expired miles
    over the estimated redemption period. Management’s estimate
    of the expected expiration of miles requires significant
    management judgment. In early 2007, the Company announced that
    it was reducing the expiration period for inactive accounts from
    36 months to 18 months effective December 31,
    2007. The change in the expiration period increased revenues by
    $246 million in 2007. Current and future changes to
    expiration assumptions or to the expiration policy, or to
    program rules and program redemption opportunities, may result
    in material changes to the deferred revenue balance, as well as
    recognized revenues from the program. In 2008, the Company
    updated certain of its assumptions related to the recognition of
    revenue for expiration of miles. Based on additional analysis of
    mileage redemption and expiration patterns, the Company revised
    the estimated number of miles that are expected to expire from
    15% to 24% of earned miles, including miles that will expire or
    go unredeemed for reasons other than account deactivation. In
    2008, the Company also extended the total time period over which
    revenue from the expiration of miles is recognized based upon
    the estimated period of miles redemption. This change did not
    materially impact the Company’s Mileage Plus revenue
    recognition in 2008.

See Note 17, “Advanced Purchase of Miles,” for
    additional information related to the Mileage Plus program.

(h)

Deferred Gains (Losses)

—Gains and losses on
    aircraft sale and leaseback transactions are deferred and
    amortized over the terms of the related leases as an adjustment
    to aircraft rent expense.

(i)

United Express

—United has agreements under
    which independent regional carriers, flying under the United
    Express name, connect passengers to other United Express

and/or

United flights (the latter of which we also refer to as
    “mainline” operations, to distinguish them from United
    Express regional operations). The vast majority of United
    Express flights are operated under capacity agreements, while a
    relatively smaller number are operated under prorate agreements.

United Express operating revenues and expenses are classified as
    “Passenger—Regional affiliates” and
    “Regional affiliates,” respectively, in the

Statements of Consolidated Operations

. Regional affiliate
    expense includes both allocated and direct costs. Direct costs
    represent expenses that are specifically and exclusively related
    to United Express flying activities, such as capacity agreement
    payments, commissions, booking fees, fuel expenses and dedicated
    staffing. The capacity agreement payments are based on specific
    rates for various operating expenses of the United Express
    carriers, such as crew expenses, maintenance and aircraft
    ownership, some of which are multiplied by specific operating
    statistics (e.g., block hours, departures) while others are
    fixed per month. Allocated costs represent United Express’s
    portion of shared expenses and include charges for items such as
    airport operating costs, reservation-related costs, credit card
    discount fees and facility rents. For each of these expense
    categories, the Company estimates United Express’s portion
    of total expense and allocates the applicable portion of expense
    to the United Express carrier.

United has the right to exclusively operate and direct the
    operations of these aircraft and accordingly the minimum future
    lease payments for these aircraft are included in the
    Company’s



lease obligations. See Note 10, “Segment
    Information” and Note 15, “Lease
    Obligations,” for additional information related to United
    Express.

The Company recognizes revenue as flown on a net basis for
    flights on United Express covered by prorate agreements.

As of December 31, 2008, United has call options on 159
    regional jet aircraft currently being operated by certain United
    Express carriers. At December 31, 2008, none of the call
    options were exercisable because none of the required conditions
    to make an option exercisable by the Company were met.

(j)

Advertising

—Advertising costs, which are
    included in other operating expenses, are expensed as incurred.

(k)

Intangibles

—Goodwill was determined to be
    completely impaired in 2008. Goodwill represented the excess of
    the reorganization value of the Successor Company over the fair
    value of net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets
    and liabilities resulting from the application of

SOP 90-7.

Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are
    reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or
    circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. The
    Mileage Plus customer database is amortized on an accelerated
    basis utilizing cash flows correlating to the expected attrition
    rate of the Mileage Plus database. The other customer
    relationships, which are included in “Contracts,” are
    amortized in a manner consistent with the timing and amount of
    revenues that the Company expects to generate from these
    customer relationships. All other definite-lived intangible
    assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated
    lives of the related assets.

In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

(“SFAS 142”), the Company applies a fair
    value-based impairment test to the net book value of goodwill
    and indefinite-lived intangible assets on an annual basis as of
    October 1, or on an interim basis whenever a triggering
    event occurs. SFAS 142 requires that a two-step impairment
    test be performed on goodwill. In the first step, the Company
    compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying
    value. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the
    carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit, goodwill
    is not impaired and the Company is not required to perform
    further testing. If the carrying value of the net assets of a
    reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit,
    then the Company must perform the second step to determine the
    implied fair value of the goodwill and compare it to the
    carrying value of the goodwill. If the carrying value of
    goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then the Company must
    record an impairment charge equal to such difference.

See Note 3, “Asset Impairments and Intangible
    Assets,” for additional information related to intangibles,
    including impairments recognized in 2008.

(l)

Measurement of Impairments

—In accordance with
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
    Assets

(“SFAS 144”) and SFAS 142, the
    Company evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets and
    intangible assets subject to amortization whenever events or
    changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist.
    An impairment charge is recognized when the asset’s
    carrying value exceeds its net undiscounted future cash flows
    and its fair market value. The amount of the charge is the
    difference between the asset’s carrying value and fair
    market value. See Note 3, “Asset Impairments and
    Intangible Assets,” for information related to asset
    impairments recognized in 2008.

(m)

Share-Based Compensation

—Stock-based
    compensation is accounted for in accordance with Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004),

Share-Based Payment

(“SFAS 123R”)
    effective January 1, 2006. SFAS 123R requires
    companies to measure the cost of employee services received in
    exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the
    grant-date fair value of the award. The resulting cost is
    recognized over the period during which



an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the
    award, usually the vesting period. See Note 7,
    “Share-Based Compensation Plans,” for additional
    information.

(n)

Ticket Taxes

—Certain governmental taxes are
    imposed on United’s ticket sales through a fee included in
    ticket prices. United collects these fees and remits them to the
    appropriate government agency. These fees are recorded on a net
    basis (excluded from operating revenues).

(o)

Early Retirement of Leased Aircraft

—The
    Company accrues for the present value of future minimum lease
    payments, net of estimated sublease rentals (if any) in the
    period aircraft are removed from service. When reasonably
    estimable and probable, the Company estimates maintenance lease
    return condition obligations for items such as minimum aircraft
    and engine conditions specified in leases and accrues these
    amounts as contingent rent ratably over the lease term while the
    aircraft are operating, and any remaining unrecognized estimated
    obligations are accrued in the period an aircraft is removed
    from service. In addition, the Company accrues for an early
    termination lease penalty in the period that the Company
    executes an early return agreement with a lessor.

(p)

New Accounting Pronouncements

—In May 2008,
    the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (“FSP”)
    No. APB

14-1,

Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be
    Settled in Cash upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash
    Settlement)

(“APB

14-1”).

APB

14-1

requires the issuer of certain convertible debt instruments that
    may be settled in cash (or other assets) on conversion to
    separately account for the liability (debt) and equity
    (conversion option) components of the instrument in a manner
    that reflects the issuer’s non-convertible debt borrowing
    rate. APB

14-1,

which
    is applied retrospectively, is effective for the Company
    beginning January 1, 2009. The Company estimates that the
    fair value of the equity component of its two convertible debt
    instruments that may be cash settled was approximately
    $250 million at the time of issuance of these instruments.
    This discount will be applied retrospectively to the
    Company’s financial statements from the date of adoption of
    fresh-start reporting and amortized over the expected five-year
    life of the notes resulting in increased interest expense in
    historical and future periods.

In June 2008, the Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”)
    of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
    issued EITF Issue

07-5,

Determining Whether an Instrument (or Embedded Feature) is
    Indexed to an Entity’s Own Stock

,

(“EITF 07-5”)

which is effective for the Company beginning January 1,
    2009.

EITF 07-5

provides additional guidance as to the phrase “indexed to
    an entity’s own stock” for purposes of determining
    whether certain instruments or embedded features qualify for a
    scope exception in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
    Hedging Activities

(“SFAS 133”). The Company
    is still evaluating the impact, if any, that the adoption of

EITF 07-5

will have on its results of operations and financial position
    based on its current financial instruments. The impact, if any,
    would be recorded as a cumulative adjustment to beginning
    retained earnings.

In June 2008, the FASB issued FSP

No. EITF 03-6-1,

Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based
    Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities

(“EITF 03-6-1”).

EITF 03-6-1

addresses whether instruments granted in share-based payment
    transactions are participating securities prior to vesting and,
    therefore, need to be included in the earnings allocation under
    the two-class method of calculating earnings per share.

EITF 03-6-1,

which will be applied retrospectively to the date of fresh-start
    reporting, is effective for the Company beginning
    January 1, 2009. The Company expects that the retrospective
    application of

EITF 03-6-1

will result in increases in the basic shares outstanding used to
    compute basic earnings per share of approximately
    1.4 million, 2.0 million and 2.7 million shares
    for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 and eleven
    month period ended December 31, 2006, respectively. The
    Company does not expect that

EITF 03-6-1

will change its previously reported diluted earnings per share.

In March 2008, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards No. 161,

Disclosures about Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities—an amendment of FASB
    Statement No. 133

(“SFAS 161”). This
    Statement changes the disclosure requirements for



derivative instruments and hedging activities. Entities are
    required to provide enhanced disclosures about (a) how and
    why an entity uses derivative instruments, (b) how
    derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted
    for under SFAS 133 and its related interpretations and
    (c) how derivative instruments and related hedged items
    affect an entity’s financial position, financial
    performance and cash flows. SFAS 161 is effective for the
    Company for periods beginning January 1, 2009. The Company
    will incorporate the additional disclosures required under
    SFAS 161 into its future consolidated financial statements.

In February 2008, the FASB issued FSP

No. 157-2

,
    Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157

(“FSP 157-2”).

This FSP delayed the effective date of Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

(“SFAS 157”) for all nonfinancial assets and
    nonfinancial liabilities, except those that are recognized or
    disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a
    recurring basis, until periods beginning January 1, 2009.
    The Company is currently evaluating the impact of SFAS 157
    on the reporting and disclosure of its nonfinancial assets and
    nonfinancial liabilities.

In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 141 (revised 2007),

Business
    Combinations

(“SFAS 141R”). This statement
    replaces Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 141,

Business Combinations

(“SFAS 141”). SFAS 141R retains the
    fundamental requirements in Statement No. 141 that the
    acquisition method of accounting be used for all business
    combinations and for an acquirer to be identified for each
    business combination. In addition, SFAS 141R provides new
    guidance intended to improve reporting by creating greater
    consistency in the accounting and financial reporting of
    business combinations, resulting in more complete, comparable
    and relevant information for users of financial statements.
    SFAS 141R is effective for the Company for any business
    combinations with an acquisition date on or after
    January 1, 2009. In accordance with the provisions of
    SFAS 141R that amended Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards No. 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes

(“SFAS 109”), beginning January 1, 2009,
    the Company will be required to recognize any changes in the
    valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, which was
    established as part of fresh-start reporting, to be recognized
    as an adjustment to income tax expense. This reflects a change
    from current practice which requires changes in the valuation
    allowance to first reduce goodwill to zero and then to reduce
    intangible assets to zero.

In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests
    in Consolidated Financial Statements—an amendment of ARB
    No. 51

(“SFAS 160”). This statement
    amends Accounting Research Bulletin 51,

Consolidated
    Financial Statements

, to establish accounting and reporting
    standards for the noncontrolling interest (also known as
    minority interest) in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation
    of a subsidiary. SFAS 160 is effective for the Company for
    periods beginning January 1, 2009. The Company does not
    expect the adoption of SFAS 160 to have a significant
    impact on its consolidated financial statements.

(q)

Income Tax Contingencies

—The Company has
    recorded reserves for income taxes and associated interest that
    may become payable in future years. Certain of these reserves
    are for uncertain income tax positions which are accounted for
    in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes

(“FIN 48”), effective January 1, 2007.
    Although management believes that its positions taken on income
    tax matters are reasonable, the Company nevertheless has
    established tax and interest reserves in recognition that
    various taxing authorities may challenge certain of the
    positions taken by the Company, potentially resulting in
    additional liabilities for taxes and interest. The
    Company’s tax contingency reserves are reviewed
    periodically and are adjusted as events occur that affect its
    estimates, such as the availability of new information, the
    lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations, the conclusion of
    tax audits, the measurement of additional estimated liability,
    the identification of new tax contingencies, the release of
    administrative tax guidance affecting its estimates of tax
    liabilities,



or the rendering of relevant court decisions. See Note 8,
    “Income Taxes,” for further information related to
    uncertain income tax positions and the adoption of FIN 48.

Company
    Operational Plans

The volatility of and increases in crude oil prices, a weakening
    economic environment and a highly competitive industry with
    excess capacity have created an extremely challenging
    environment for the Company. The Company’s cash flows and
    results of operations have been adversely impacted by these
    factors as indicated by its net loss of $5.3 billion during
    the year ended December 31, 2008. The Company’s
    results in 2008 include asset impairment charges of
    approximately $2.6 billion that resulted primarily from
    unfavorable market and economic conditions as discussed in
    Note 3, “Asset Impairments and Intangible
    Assets.” These factors have had a significant negative
    impact on the Company’s liquidity as unrestricted cash and
    short-term investments decreased by $1.5 billion in 2008 to
    $2.0 billion at December 31, 2008. In addition, the
    Company may not be able to improve its liquidity position with
    cash from operations in 2009 because of lower demand for air
    travel during 2009 and a weak global economy. The Company is
    implementing certain operational plans to address its increased
    operating costs and its liquidity needs in 2009. In addition,
    the Company continues to evaluate the most cost-effective
    alternatives to raise additional capital, including asset sales
    and financings. Highlights of the Company’s operational
    plans and financings include the following:

•

The Company is significantly reducing mainline domestic and
    consolidated capacity. Fourth quarter 2008 mainline domestic and
    consolidated capacity were down approximately 14% and 11%

year-over-year,

respectively. The Company is planning to further decrease
    mainline domestic and consolidated capacity in 2009.

•

The capacity reductions are being made through reductions in
    frequencies of routes and the elimination of unprofitable
    routes. These actions have resulted in the closure of a small
    number of airport operations where United cannot operate
    profitably in the current economic environment. Additional
    airport operations may be closed in future periods.

•

The Company has announced plans to permanently remove 100
    aircraft from its mainline fleet, including its entire B737
    fleet and six B747 aircraft, by the end of 2009. The B737
    aircraft being retired are some of the oldest and least fuel
    efficient in the Company’s fleet. This planned reduction
    reflects the Company’s efforts to eliminate unprofitable
    capacity and divest the Company of assets that currently do not
    provide an acceptable return.

•

United is eliminating its Ted product for leisure markets and
    will reconfigure that fleet’s 56 A320s to include United
    First seating. The reconfiguration of the Ted aircraft will
    occur in stages, with expected completion by year-end 2009. We
    will continue to review the deployment of all of our aircraft in
    various markets and the overall composition of our fleet to
    ensure that we are using our assets appropriately to provide the
    best available return.

•

In connection with the capacity reductions, the Company is
    further streamlining its operations and corporate functions in
    order to reduce the size of its workforce to match the size of
    its operations.

•

The Company also recently entered into an alliance partnership
    with Continental Airlines that is expected to create revenue
    enhancements, costs savings and operational efficiencies.

•

The Company is managing its liquidity by investing only in those
    projects that are considered high-value, such as the
    international premium product. The Company has $0.2 billion
    of binding commitments for the purchase of property in 2009 and
    $0.8 billion of long-term debt obligations in 2009.

•

As of December 31, 2008, the Company has 62 unencumbered
    aircraft and other assets that may be used as collateral to
    obtain additional financing. The Company could also sell certain
    of these assets to generate liquidity.



•

As discussed in Note 23, “Subsequent Events,” in
    January 2009, the Company completed several financing-related
    transactions which generated approximately $315 million of
    proceeds.

The following is a discussion of expenses associated with
    implementing the Company’s plans. In addition, see
    Note 3, “Asset Impairments and Intangible
    Assets,” for a discussion of the impairment charges
    recorded during the year ended December 31, 2008.

Severance.

During 2008, the Company
    reduced its workforce in operations and corporate functions
    through attrition and both voluntary and involuntary furloughs.
    The Company is streamlining its workforce to match the reduced
    capacity of its operations. The Company reduced its workforce in
    2008 and plans to further reduce its workforce in 2009.
    Workforce reductions include salaried and management positions
    and certain of the Company’s unionized workforce. The
    Company’s standard severance policies provide the affected
    employees with salary continuation as well as certain insurance
    benefits for a specified period of time. The Company recognizes
    its severance obligations in accordance with Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards No. 112 (As Amended),

Employers’ Accounting for Postemployment
    Benefits—an amendment of FASB Statements No. 5 and
    43,

except for voluntary programs which are accounted for
    under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 88,

Employers’ Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments
    of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination
    Benefits

.

The following is a reconciliation of the Company’s
    severance accrual activity:

In addition to involuntary furloughs, the Company is currently
    offering furlough-mitigation programs, such as voluntary
    early-out options, primarily to certain union groups.
    Termination benefits expected to be paid under such voluntary
    programs are not recognized until the employees accept the
    termination benefit offer. Therefore, as the Company continues
    to implement its reductions in force during 2009, additional
    severance costs may be incurred. Severance expense is classified
    within salaries and related costs in the Company’s

Statements of Consolidated Operations.

Severance charges
    are expected to be primarily within the mainline segment where
    the fleet reductions will occur.

Nonoperating at December 31, 2008 (a) (e)

—


(a)

At December 31, 2007, the
    Company had 113 unencumbered aircraft. In 2007, United leased
    one operating aircraft from UAL and therefore had one less owned
    B737 aircraft and one more leased aircraft as compared to
    UAL’s fleet. This particular aircraft became nonoperational
    in 2008; therefore, United has one less nonoperating owned B737
    aircraft and one more leased aircraft as compared to UAL’s
    fleet at December 31, 2008.



During 2008, the Company expensed $24 million related to
    the retirement of leased aircraft, of which $16 million remained
    accrued and unpaid at December 31, 2008. These amounts
    consist of the present value of future lease payments for
    aircraft that have been removed from service in advance of their
    lease termination dates as of December 31, 2008, estimated
    payments for lease return maintenance conditions related to B737
    aircraft and the write-off of fresh-start lease fair value
    adjustments. Periodic lease payments will be made over the lease
    terms of these aircraft unless early return agreements are
    reached with the lessors; and, lease return maintenance
    condition payments, if any, will be made upon return of the
    aircraft to the lessors. The total expected payments for leased
    aircraft that were grounded at December 31, 2008 and that
    are expected to be grounded in 2009 are $132 million,
    payable through 2013. These estimated payments are future lease
    payments and estimated lease maintenance return condition
    payments. Actual lease payments may be less if the Company is
    able to negotiate early termination of any of its leases.

Other costs.

As the Company continues
    to implement the operational plans discussed above, it may incur
    additional costs related to its conversion of the Company’s
    fleet of Ted aircraft, costs to exit additional facilities such
    as airports no longer served, lease termination costs,
    additional severance costs and asset impairment charges, among
    others. Such future costs and charges may be material.

Asset
    Impairments and Intangible Assets

Asset
    Impairments

In accordance with SFAS 142 and SFAS 144, as of
    May 31, 2008 the Company performed an interim impairment
    test of its goodwill, all intangible assets and certain of its
    long-lived assets (principally aircraft and related spare
    engines and spare parts) due to events and changes in
    circumstances that indicated an impairment might have occurred.
    In addition, the Company also performed an interim impairment
    test on certain of its aircraft fleet types as of
    December 31, 2008 due to management’s determination
    that unfavorable market conditions indicated potential
    impairment of value. Factors deemed by management to have
    collectively constituted an impairment triggering event included
    record high fuel prices, significant losses in the first and
    second quarters of 2008, a softening U.S. economy, analyst
    downgrade of UAL common stock, rating agency changes in outlook
    for the Company’s debt instruments from stable to negative,
    the announcement of the planned removal from UAL’s fleet of
    100 aircraft in 2008 and 2009 and a significant decrease in the
    fair value of UAL’s outstanding equity and debt securities
    during the first five months of 2008, including a decline in
    UAL’s market capitalization to significantly below book
    value. The Company’s consolidated fuel expense increased by
    more than 50% during this period.

As a result of this impairment testing, for which certain
    estimates made in the second quarter of 2008 were adjusted to
    final values in the third quarter of 2008, the Company recorded
    impairment charges during the year ended December 31, 2008,
    as presented in the table below. All of these impairment charges
    are within the mainline segment. All of the impairments other
    than the goodwill impairment, which is separately identified,
    are classified within “Other impairments and special
    items” in the Company’s

Statements of Consolidated
    Operations.

Goodwill

For purposes of testing goodwill, the Company performed Step One
    of the SFAS 142 test by estimating the fair value of the
    mainline reporting unit (to which all goodwill is allocated)
    utilizing several fair value measurement techniques, including
    two market estimates and one income estimate and using relevant
    data available through and as of May 31, 2008. The market
    approach is a valuation technique in which fair value is
    estimated based on observed prices in actual transactions and on
    asking prices for similar assets. The valuation process is
    essentially that of comparison and correlation between the
    subject asset and other similar assets. The income approach is a
    technique in which fair value is estimated based on the cash
    flows that an asset could be expected to generate over its
    useful life, including residual value cash flows. These cash
    flows are discounted to their present value equivalents using a
    rate of return that accounts for the relative risk of not
    realizing the estimated annual cash flows and for the time value
    of money. Variations of the income approach were used to
    determine certain of the intangible asset fair values.

Under the market approaches, the fair value of the mainline
    reporting unit was estimated based upon the fair value of
    invested capital for UAL, as well as a separate comparison to
    revenue and EBITDAR multiples for similar publicly traded
    companies in the airline industry. The fair value estimates
    using both market approaches included a control premium similar
    to those observed for historical airline and transportation
    company market transactions.

Under the income approach, the fair value of the mainline
    reporting unit was estimated based upon the present value of
    estimated future cash flows for UAL. The income approach is
    dependent on a number of critical management assumptions
    including estimates of future capacity, passenger yield,
    traffic, operating costs (including fuel prices), appropriate
    discount rates and other relevant assumptions. The Company
    estimated its future fuel-related cash flows for the income
    approach based on the

five-year

forward curve for crude oil as of May 31, 2008. The impacts
    of the Company’s aircraft and other tangible and intangible
    asset impairments were considered in the fair value estimation
    of the mainline reporting unit.

Taking into consideration an equal weighting of the two market
    estimates and the income estimate, which has been the
    Company’s practice when performing annual goodwill
    impairment tests, the indicated fair value of the mainline
    reporting unit was less than its carrying value, and therefore,
    the Company was required to perform Step Two of the
    SFAS 142 goodwill impairment test.



In Step Two of the impairment test, the Company determined the
    implied fair value of goodwill of the mainline reporting unit by
    allocating the fair value of the reporting unit determined in
    Step One to all the assets and liabilities of the mainline
    reporting unit, including any recognized and unrecognized
    intangible assets, as if the mainline reporting unit had been
    acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the
    mainline reporting unit was the acquisition price. As a result
    of the Step Two testing, the Company determined that goodwill
    was completely impaired and therefore recorded an impairment
    charge during the second quarter of 2008 to write-off the full
    value of goodwill.

Indefinite-lived
    intangible assets

    Interim Impairment Test

The Company utilized appropriate valuation techniques to
    separately estimate the fair values of all of its
    indefinite-lived intangible assets as of May 31, 2008 and
    compared those estimates to related carrying values. Tested
    assets included tradenames, international route authorities,
    London Heathrow slots and codesharing agreements. The Company
    used a market or income valuation approach, as described above,
    to estimate fair values. Based on the results of this testing,
    the Company recorded a $64 million impairment charge to
    indefinite-lived intangible assets for the year ended
    December 31, 2008.

Annual
    Impairment Tests

United performed annual impairment reviews of its
    indefinite-lived intangible assets as of October 1, 2008
    and 2007 and of its goodwill as of October 1, 2007 and
    determined that no impairment was indicated.

Long-lived
    assets

For purposes of testing impairment of long-lived assets at
    May 31, 2008, the Company determined whether the carrying
    amount of its long-lived assets was recoverable by comparing the
    carrying amount to the sum of the undiscounted cash flows
    expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the
    assets. If the carrying value of the assets exceeded the
    expected cash flows, the Company estimated the fair value of
    these assets to determine whether an impairment existed. The
    Company grouped its aircraft by fleet type to perform this
    evaluation and used data and assumptions through May 31,
    2008. The estimated undiscounted cash flows were dependent on a
    number of critical management assumptions including estimates of
    future capacity, passenger yield, traffic, operating costs
    (including fuel prices) and other relevant assumptions. If
    estimates of fair value were required, fair value was estimated
    using the market approach. Asset appraisals, published aircraft
    pricing guides and recent transactions for similar aircraft were
    considered by the Company in its market value determination.
    Based on the results of these tests, the Company determined that
    an impairment of $38 million existed which was attributable
    to the Company’s fleet of owned B737 aircraft and related
    spare parts. In addition, as of December 31, 2008, the
    Company performed an impairment test of its B737 aircraft. Based
    on this analysis, the Company recorded an additional charge of
    $107 million to reduce the carrying value of the B737
    aircraft. As described in Note 2, “Company Operational
    Plans,” the Company is retiring its entire B737 fleet
    earlier than originally planned.

Due to the unfavorable economic and industry factors described
    above, the Company also determined in the second quarter of 2008
    that it was required to perform an impairment test of its
    $105 million of pre-delivery aircraft deposits and related
    capitalized interest. The Company determined that these aircraft
    deposits were completely impaired and wrote off their full
    carrying value. The Company believes that it is highly unlikely
    that it will take these future aircraft deliveries and,
    therefore, the Company will be required to forfeit the deposits,
    which are also not transferable.

As a result of the impairment testing described above, the
    Company’s goodwill and certain of its indefinite-lived
    intangible assets and tangible assets were recorded at fair
    value. In accordance with

FSP 157-2

,

the Company has not applied SFAS 157 to the
    determination of the fair value of these assets.



However, the provisions of SFAS 157 were applied to the
    determination of the fair value of financial assets and
    financial liabilities that were part of the SFAS 142 Step
    Two goodwill fair value determination.

The carrying value of the Company’s intangible assets or
    tangible long-lived assets as of December 31, 2008 may
    decrease in future periods as a result of factors such as
    decreased demand for aircraft, decreases in revenues, fuel price
    volatility and adverse economic conditions, among others.

During 2008, the Company wrote off its entire goodwill balance
    as discussed above. The Company initially recorded goodwill of
    $2,756 million upon its exit from bankruptcy. Unamortized
    intangible assets, other than goodwill, decreased by
    $82 million during 2008 as a result of a $64 million
    impairment of codeshare agreements and the Company’s
    tradenames and an $18 million decrease in airport slots and
    gates related to the sale of assets. During the year ended
    December 31, 2007, goodwill decreased by $423 million
    due to a $414 million reduction of the valuation allowance
    for the deferred tax assets established at fresh-start,
    $6 million due to the adoption of FIN 48 and
    $3 million due to a change in estimate of tax accruals
    existing at the Effective Date.

Total amortization expense recognized was $92 million and
    $155 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and
    2007, $169 million for the eleven month period ended
    December 31, 2006 and $1 million for the one month
    period ended January 31, 2006. The Company expects to
    record amortization expense of $69 million,
    $63 million, $58 million, $55 million and
    $52 million for 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013,
    respectively.

Voluntary
    Reorganization Under Chapter 11

Bankruptcy Considerations.

The
    following discussion provides general background information
    regarding the Company’s Chapter 11 cases and is not
    intended to be an exhaustive summary.

On December 9, 2002 (the “Petition Date”), UAL,
    United and 26 direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries
    (collectively, the “Debtors”) filed voluntary
    petitions to reorganize their businesses under



Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the
    United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of
    Illinois, Eastern Division (the “Bankruptcy Court”).
    On January 20, 2006, the Bankruptcy Court confirmed the
    Debtors’ Second Amended Joint Plan of Reorganization
    Pursuant to Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code
    (the “Plan of Reorganization”). The Plan of
    Reorganization became effective and the Debtors emerged from
    bankruptcy protection on February 1, 2006 (the
    “Effective Date”). Pursuant to the Plan of
    Reorganization, UAL issued new debt and equity securities to
    certain of its creditors. On the Effective Date, the Company
    implemented fresh-start reporting.

Significant Bankruptcy Matters Resolved in
    2008.

During 2008, the San Francisco
    International Airport (“SFO”) municipal bond secured
    interest matter was resolved. HSBC Bank Inc. (“HSBC”),
    as trustee for the 1997 municipal bonds related to SFO, had
    filed a complaint against United asserting a security interest
    in United’s leasehold for portions of its maintenance base
    at SFO. HSBC alleged that it was entitled to be paid the value
    of that security interest, which HSBC had once claimed was as
    much as $257 million. HSBC and United went to trial in
    April 2006 and the Bankruptcy Court rejected as a matter of law
    HSBC’s $257 million claim. HSBC subsequently alleged
    that it was entitled to $154 million, or at a minimum,
    approximately $93 million. The parties tried the case and
    filed post-trial briefs which were heard by the Bankruptcy
    Court. In October 2006, the Bankruptcy Court issued its written
    opinion holding that the value of the security interest is
    approximately $27 million. United has accrued this amount
    as its estimated obligation at December 31, 2008. During
    2008, HSBC withdrew its appeal to the Seventh Circuit Court of
    Appeals of the District Court’s affirmance of the October
    2006 Bankruptcy Court ruling. The matter is now final and United
    expects to pay the amount due to HSBC in 2009.

Significant Matters Remaining to be Resolved in
    Chapter 11 Cases.

There is pending
    litigation before the Bankruptcy Court regarding the extent to
    which the Los Angeles International Airport (“LAX”)
    municipal bond debt is entitled to secured status under
    Section 506(a) of the Bankruptcy Code. At December 31,
    2006, United had accrued $60 million for this matter. Trial
    on this matter occurred during April 2007 and the two parties
    filed post-trial briefs in the second quarter of 2007. In August
    2007, the Bankruptcy Court issued its written opinion holding
    that the value of the security interest is approximately
    $33 million, which United had accrued at December 31,
    2007 and 2008. The District Court affirmed the Bankruptcy
    Court’s rulings and the trustee for the bondholders has
    appealed the matter to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals,
    which is pending. See

Claims Resolution Process

, below,
    for details of special items recognized in the

Statements of
    Consolidated Operati

ons for the SFO and LAX matters.

Claims Resolution Process.

As permitted
    under the bankruptcy process, the Debtors’ creditors filed
    proofs of claim with the Bankruptcy Court. Through the claims
    resolution process, the Company identified many claims which
    were disallowed by the Bankruptcy Court for a number of reasons,
    such as claims that were duplicative, amended or superseded by
    later filed claims, were without merit, or were otherwise
    overstated. Throughout the Chapter 11 proceedings, the
    Company resolved many claims through settlement or objections
    ordered by the Bankruptcy Court. The Company will continue to
    settle claims and file additional objections with the Bankruptcy
    Court.

With respect to unsecured claims, once a claim is deemed to be
    valid, either through the Bankruptcy Court process or through
    other means, the claimant is entitled to a distribution of
    common stock in UAL. Pursuant to the terms of the Plan of
    Reorganization, 115 million shares of common stock in UAL
    have been authorized to be issued to satisfy valid unsecured
    claims. The Bankruptcy Court confirmed the Plan of
    Reorganization and established January 20, 2006 as the
    record date for purposes of establishing the persons that are
    claimholders of record to receive distributions. Approximately
    113 million common shares have been issued and distributed to
    holders of valid unsecured claims between February 2, 2006,
    the first distribution date established in the Plan of
    Reorganization, and December 31, 2008. As of
    December 31, 2008, approximately 46,000 valid unsecured
    claims aggregating to approximately $29.3 billion in claim
    value had received those common shares to satisfy those claims.
    There are 2.0 million remaining shares of UAL common stock
    held in reserve to satisfy all of the remaining disputed and
    undisputed unsecured claim values, once the remaining claim
    disputes are



resolved. The final distributions of shares will not occur until
    2009 or later, pending resolution of bankruptcy matters.

The Company’s current estimate of the probable range of
    unsecured claims to be allowed by the Bankruptcy Court is
    between $29.3 billion and $29.6 billion. Differences
    between claim amounts filed and the Company’s estimates
    continue to be investigated and will be resolved in connection
    with the claims resolution process. However, there will be no
    further financial impact to the Company associated with the
    settlement of such unsecured claims, as the holders of all
    allowed unsecured claims will receive under the Plan of
    Reorganization no more than their pro rata share of the
    distribution of the 115 million shares of common stock of
    UAL, together with the previously-agreed issuance of certain
    securities.

With respect to valid administrative and priority claims,
    pursuant to the terms of the Plan of Reorganization these claims
    have been or will be satisfied with cash. Many asserted
    administrative and priority claims still remain unpaid and the
    Company will continue to settle claims and file objections with
    the Bankruptcy Court to eliminate or reduce such claims. In
    addition, certain disputes, the most significant of which is
    discussed in “

Significant Matters Remaining to be
    Resolved in Chapter 11 Cases,

” above, still remain
    with respect to the valuation of certain claims. The Company
    accrued an obligation for claims it believed were reasonably
    estimable and probable at the Effective Date. However, the
    claims resolution process is uncertain and adjustments to claims
    estimates could result in material adjustments to the Successor
    Company’s financial statements in future periods as a
    result of court rulings, the receipt of new or revised
    information or the finalization of these matters. In accordance
    with AICPA Practice Bulletin 11,

Accounting for
    Preconfirmation Contingencies in Fresh-Start Reporting,

(“Practice Bulletin 11”), the Company has
    recorded the impact of revisions to these estimates in current
    results of operations.

The table below includes activity related to the administrative
    and priority claims and other bankruptcy-related claim reserves
    including reserves related to legal, professional and tax
    matters, among others, for the Successor Company for the years
    ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 and the eleven months
    ended December 31, 2006, respectively. These reserves are
    primarily classified in other current liabilities in the

Statements of Consolidated Financial Position

. Certain of
    the accrual adjustments identified below are a direct result of
    the Company’s ongoing efforts to resolve certain bankruptcy

pre-confirmation

contingencies and do not relate directly to the Company’s
    ongoing performance; therefore, the Company considers these
    adjustments to be special.

At December 31, 2008, 2.0 million of the initial
    115 million shares authorized remain to be distributed to
    employees and holders of previously allowed claims and disputed
    claims that are pending final resolution. All treasury shares
    were acquired either for tax withholding obligations related to
    UAL’s share-based compensation plan or as consideration
    under an employment agreement. See Note 7,
    “Share-Based Compensation Plans” for additional
    information related to the remaining grants available to be
    awarded under the UAL’s share-based compensation plans and
    outstanding option awards, neither of which are included in
    outstanding shares above.

UAL is authorized to issue 250 million shares of preferred
    stock (without par value). UAL was also authorized to issue two
    shares of junior preferred stock (par value $0.01 per share)
    which were issued in 2006 and remained outstanding at
    December 31, 2008.

UAL issued 5 million shares of 2% convertible preferred
    stock to the PBGC on the Effective Date. The shares were issued
    at a liquidation value of $100 per share, convertible at any
    time following the second anniversary of the issuance date into
    common stock of UAL at an initial conversion price of $46.86 per
    common share; with dividends payable in kind semi-annually (in
    the form of increases to the liquidation value of the issued and
    outstanding shares). The preferred stock ranked pari passu with
    all current and future UAL or United preferred stock and was
    redeemable at any time at the then-current liquidation value
    (plus accrued and unpaid dividends) at the option of the issuer.
    At December 31, 2007, 5 million shares of UAL 2%
    convertible preferred stock were outstanding with an aggregate
    liquidation value of $519 million, which included
    $19 million of accrued and paid in kind dividends. The
    preferred stock had been pushed down to United and was reflected
    on United’s books as part of fresh-start reporting. At
    December 31, 2007, the carrying value of the 2% convertible
    preferred stock was $371 million, which included the
    $19 million of accrued and paid in kind dividends.

As reflected in the table above, 11.1 million shares of UAL
    common stock were issued upon preferred stockholders’
    elections to exercise their conversion option of all
    5 million shares of 2% mandatorily convertible preferred
    stock during 2008. As a result of these conversions, there are
    currently no outstanding shares of 2% convertible preferred
    stock and this class of stock was retired in October 2008. The
    Company increased additional paid in capital by
    $374 million and decreased the mandatorily convertible
    preferred stock by the same amount to record the impact of these
    conversions.

In addition, as indicated in the table above, during 2008 the
    Company issued 11.2 million shares of common stock as part
    of a $200 million equity offering generating net proceeds
    of $122 million, of which $107 million was received in
    2008 and $15 million was received in January 2009 upon
    settlement of shares sold during the last three days of 2008. In
    January 2009, an additional 4.0 million shares were issued
    generating net proceeds of $47 million. After the January
    2009 issuances, the Company had issued shares for gross proceeds
    of $172 million leaving $28 million of remaining
    capacity available to issue additional shares in 2009.

UAL
    Per Share Amounts

In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 128,

Earnings per Share

, basic per share amounts
    were computed by dividing earnings (loss) available to common
    stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of UAL
    common stock outstanding. Approximately 2.0 million,
    2.8 million and 6.7 million UAL shares remaining to be
    issued to unsecured creditors and employees under the Plan of
    Reorganization are included in outstanding basic shares for
    2008, 2007 and the eleven month period ended December 31,
    2006, respectively, as the necessary conditions for issuance
    have been satisfied. UAL’s $546 million of
    6% senior notes are callable at any time at 100% of par
    value, and can be redeemed with either cash or UAL common stock
    at UAL’s option. These notes are not included in the
    diluted earnings per share calculation, as it is UAL’s
    intent to redeem these notes with cash. In January 2009, the
    Company issued additional common shares as discussed in
    Note 5, “Common Stockholders’ Equity and
    Preferred Securities,” above. The table below represents
    the reconciliation of the basic earnings (loss) per share to
    diluted earnings (loss) per share.

Share-Based
    Compensation Plans

Compensation expense associated with the UAL share-based
    compensation plans has been pushed down to United.

Predecessor Company

—As of January 31,
    2006, a total of nine million stock options were outstanding.
    Under the Company’s Plan of Reorganization, these stock
    options were canceled on the Effective Date. No material
    share-based compensation expense was incurred as a result of
    these outstanding options for the month of January 2006.

The unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested awards at
    December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $18 million and
    $41 million, respectively, which is expected to be
    recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.6 and
    2.2 years, respectively. During the second quarter of 2006,
    the Company revised its initial estimated award forfeiture rate
    of 7.5% to 15% based upon actual attrition. As a result, the

share-based

compensation expense was reduced by approximately
    $7 million for the eleven month period ended
    December 31, 2006.

2008 Incentive Compensation Plan.

In 2008,
    UAL’s Board of Directors and stockholders approved the UAL
    Corporation 2008 Incentive Compensation Plan (the “2008
    Plan”). The 2008 Plan is an incentive compensation plan
    that allows the Company to use different forms of compensation
    awards to attract, retain and reward eligible participants. This
    approval by stockholders also allows for the issuance of up to
    8,000,000 additional shares pursuant to awards granted under the
    2008 Plan. The 2008 Plan replaced the UAL Corporation 2006
    Management Equity Incentive Plan, which was automatically
    terminated with respect to future grants and otherwise replaced
    and superseded by the 2008 Plan. Any awards granted under the
    MEIP remain in effect pursuant to their terms.

Any officer or employee of UAL or its affiliates is eligible to
    participate in the 2008 Plan. The 2008 Plan allows for the grant
    of options intended to qualify as incentive stock options
    (“ISOs”) under Section 422 of the Code,
    non-qualified stock options (“NSOs”), stock
    appreciation rights (“SARs”), restricted share awards,
    restricted stock units (“RSUs”), performance
    compensation awards, performance units, cash incentive awards
    and other equity-based and equity-related awards. Any shares of
    our common stock issued under the 2008 Plan will consist, in
    whole or in part, of authorized and unissued shares or of
    treasury shares.

The 2008 Plan provides that, unless otherwise provided in an
    award agreement, in the event of a change of control of the
    Company (as defined in the 2008 Plan):

•

any options and SARs outstanding as of the date the change of
    control is determined to have occurred become fully exercisable
    and vested, as of immediately prior to the change of control.

•

all performance units, cash incentive awards and other awards
    designated as performance compensation awards will be paid out
    at the “target” performance level on a prorated basis
    based on the number of days elapsed from the beginning of the
    performance period up to and including the change of control.

•

all other outstanding awards are automatically deemed
    exercisable or vested and all restrictions and forfeiture
    provisions related thereto lapse as of immediately prior to such
    change of control.

The fair value of options was determined at the grant date using
    a Black Scholes option pricing model, which requires the Company
    to make several assumptions. The risk-free interest rate is
    based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect for the
    expected term of the option at the time of grant. The dividend
    yield on UAL’s common stock was assumed to be zero since
    UAL did not have any plans to pay dividends at the time of the
    option grants.

The volatility assumptions were based upon historical
    volatilities of comparable airlines whose shares are traded
    using daily stock price returns equivalent to the contractual
    term of the option. In addition, implied volatility data for
    both UAL and comparable airlines, using current exchange-traded
    options, was utilized. Since the new UAL common stock only began
    trading in February 2006, the historical volatility data for UAL
    was not considered adequate to determine expected volatility.

The expected life of the options was determined based upon a
    simplified assumption that the option will be exercised evenly
    from vesting to expiration under the transitional guidance of
    Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, Topic 14,

Share-Based Payments

. Under the MEIP and the 2008 Plan,
    the stock options typically vest over a four year period. Under
    the MEIP, awards to employees that are retirement eligible
    either at the grant date or within the vesting period are
    considered vested at the respective retirement eligibility date.

Under SFAS 123R, the fair value of the Restricted Stock
    awards was primarily based upon the share price on the date of
    grant. Restricted stock vesting under the 2008 Plan and the MEIP
    is similar to the stock option vesting described above.
    Approximately 1.2 million of the 1.4 million
    non-vested restricted stock awards at December 31, 2008 are
    expected to vest.

Income
    Taxes

In 2008, substantially all of the tax benefit of the
    Company’s net loss was offset by a valuation allowance. In
    2008, UAL and United recorded tax benefits of $25 million
    and $22 million, respectively, primarily due to the
    impairment and sale of select indefinite-lived intangibles and
    the impact of an increase in state tax rates. This tax benefit
    is small relative to the Company’s losses; consequently,
    the Company’s effective tax rate is insignificant, when
    compared to the 35% U.S. federal statutory rate. In 2007,
    the Company’s regular taxable income was completely
    absorbed by utilization of its net operating loss
    (“NOL”) carry forward; however, the Company did incur
    an alternative minimum tax (“AMT”) liability of
    $6 million.

The federal and state NOL carry forwards relate to prior
    years’ NOLs, which may be used to reduce tax liabilities in
    future years. This tax benefit is mostly attributable to federal
    pre-tax NOL carry forwards of $7.0 billion. If not
    utilized, the federal tax benefits of $1.0 billion expire
    in 2022, $0.4 billion expire in 2023, $0.5 billion
    expire in 2024, $0.4 billion expire in 2025,
    $20 million expire in 2026 and $0.1 billion in 2028.
    In addition, the state tax benefit of $170 million, if not
    utilized, expires over a five to twenty year period.

At this time, the Company does not believe that the limitations
    imposed by the Internal Revenue Code on the usage of the NOL
    carry forward and other tax attributes following an ownership
    change will have an effect on the Company. Therefore, the
    Company does not believe its exit from bankruptcy has had any
    material impact on the utilization of its remaining NOL carry
    forward and other tax attributes.

The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent
    upon the generation of future taxable income (including the
    reversals of deferred tax liabilities) during the periods in
    which those temporary differences will become deductible. The
    Company’s management assesses the realizability of its
    deferred tax assets, and records a valuation allowance for the
    deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a
    portion, or all of the deferred tax assets, will not be
    realized. As a result, the Company has a valuation allowance
    against its deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2008 and
    2007, to reflect management’s assessment regarding the
    realizability of those assets. The Company expects to continue
    to maintain a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets until
    there is sufficient positive evidence of future realization. The
    current valuation allowance of $2,941 million and
    $2,866 million for UAL and United, respectively, if
    reversed in future years will be allocated to reduce income tax
    expense as discussed in Note 1(p), “Summary of
    Significant Accounting Policies—New Accounting
    Pronouncements.” The current valuation allowance reflects a
    change from December 31, 2007 of $1,126 million and
    $1,109 million for UAL and United, respectively.

In addition to the deferred tax assets listed above, the Company
    has an $809 million unrecorded tax benefit at
    December 31, 2008 attributable to the difference between
    the amount of the financial statement expense and the allowable
    tax deduction for UAL common stock issued to certain unsecured
    creditors and employees pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization.
    The Company is accounting for this unrecorded tax benefit by
    analogy to SFAS 123R which requires recognition of the tax
    benefit to be deferred until it is realized as a reduction of
    taxes payable. If not utilized, the unrecognized tax benefits of
    $161 million will expire in 2025, $489 million in 2026
    and $159 million over a period from 2027 through 2050.

Effective January 1, 2007, we adopted the provisions of
    FIN 48. Our adoption of FIN 48 resulted in a
    $24 million increase in the liability for unrecognized tax
    benefits which was accounted for as a $6 million decrease
    in goodwill, a $2 million increase in additional capital
    invested and a $32 million increase to deferred tax assets.

Our liability for uncertain tax positions was $20 million
    and $35 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively. Included in the ending balance are unrecognized
    tax benefits of $15 million that would affect our effective
    tax rate if recognized. During 2008, uncertain tax positions
    that were



effectively settled amounted to $5 million. Excluding these
    items and amounts related to tax positions for which the
    ultimate deductibility is highly certain, there were no other
    significant changes in the components of the liability in the
    twelve months ending December 31, 2008. Any change in the
    amount of unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve
    months is not expected to significantly impact the
    Company’s results of operations or financial position.

Included in the balance at December 31, 2008, is
    $4 million of tax positions for which the ultimate
    deductibility is highly certain but for which there is
    uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility. Because of
    the impact of deferred tax accounting, other than interest and
    penalties, the disallowance of the shorter deductibility period
    would not affect the effective tax rate but would cause a
    reduction to the net operating losses available for utilization.

The Company records penalties and interest relating to uncertain
    tax positions in the other operating expense and interest
    expense line items, respectively, within our

Statements of
    Consolidated Operations.

There are no significant accrued
    interest or penalties or interest or penalty expense recorded in
    the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

The following is a reconciliation of the beginning and ending
    amount of unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax
    positions:

Our income tax returns for tax years after 2003 remain subject
    to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and state taxing
    jurisdictions.

United and its domestic consolidated subsidiaries, file a
    consolidated federal income tax return with UAL. Under an
    intercompany tax allocation policy, United and its subsidiaries
    compute, record and pay UAL for their own tax liability as if
    they were separate companies filing separate returns. In
    determining their own tax liabilities, United and each of its
    subsidiaries take into account all tax credits or benefits
    generated and utilized as separate companies and they are
    compensated for the aforementioned tax benefits only if they
    would be able to use those benefits on a separate company basis.

Retirement
    and Postretirement Plans

The Company maintains various retirement plans, both defined
    benefit and defined contribution, which cover substantially all
    employees. As discussed below, most of the Company’s
    defined benefit plans were terminated and replaced with defined
    contribution plans as part of the bankruptcy reorganization. The
    Company also provides certain health care benefits, primarily in
    the U.S., to retirees and eligible dependents, as well as
    certain life insurance benefits to certain retirees reflected as
    “Other Benefits” in the tables below. The Company has
    reserved the right, subject to collective bargaining agreements,
    to modify or terminate the health care and life insurance
    benefits for both current and future retirees.

The following table sets forth the reconciliation of the
    beginning and ending balances of the benefit obligation and plan
    assets, the funded status and the amounts recognized in the

The estimated amounts that will be amortized from accumulated

    2009 for actuarial gains are $1 million for pension plans
    and $20 million for other postretirement plans. At exit the
    Company elected not to apply the corridor approach for
    amortization of unrecognized amounts included in accumulated
    other comprehensive income. This policy



may result in more volatility in the amortization of these
    unrecognized amounts into net periodic pension cost.

The Company believes that the long-term asset allocations on
    average will approximate the targeted allocations and regularly
    reviews the actual asset allocations to periodically rebalance
    the investments to the targeted allocations when appropriate.
    The target asset allocations are established with the objective
    of achieving the plans’ expected return on assets without
    undue investment risk.

Expected 2009 contributions are $10 million for the pension
    plans and $158 million for the other postretirement benefit
    plans. The following benefit payments are expected to be made in
    future years for the Company’s retirement plans:

Years 2014—2018






Defined
    Contribution Plans

In place of the domestic defined benefit pension plans that were
    terminated during bankruptcy, the Company enhanced its
    contributions to the defined contribution plans for most
    employee groups. Depending upon the employee group,
    contributions consist of matching contributions

and/or

non-elective

employer contributions. The Company’s contribution
    percentages vary from 1 to 16% of eligible earnings depending on
    the terms of each plan.

Effective March 1, 2006, an International Association of
    Machinists (“IAM”) replacement plan was implemented.
    The IAM replacement plan is a multi-employer plan whereby the
    assets contributed by the Company (based on hours worked) may be
    used to provide benefits to employees of other participating
    companies, since assets contributed by all participating
    companies are not segregated or restricted to provide benefits
    specifically to employees of one participating company. In
    accordance with the applicable accounting for multi-employer
    plans, the Company would only recognize a withdrawal obligation
    if it becomes probable it would withdraw from the plan. The
    Predecessor Company recorded expense from defined contribution
    plans of $16 million for the month of January 2006. The
    Successor Company recognized $248 million,
    $232 million and $206 million of expense for the years
    ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 and the eleven months
    ended December 31, 2006, respectively, for all of the
    Company’s defined contribution employee retirement plans,
    of which $34 million, $28 million and
    $21 million, respectively, related to the IAM
    multi-employer plan.

Segment
    Information

Segments.

The Company manages its
    business by two reporting segments: Mainline and United Express.
    The Company manages its business as an integrated network with
    assets deployed across various regions. See Note 1(i),
    “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies—United
    Express” for additional information related to United
    Express expenses.

The accounting policies for each of these reporting segments are
    the same as those described in Note 1, “Summary of
    Significant Accounting Policies,” except that segment
    financial information has been prepared using a management
    approach which is consistent with how the Company internally
    disperses financial information for the purpose of making
    internal operating decisions. The Company evaluates segment
    financial performance based on earnings before income taxes,
    special items, reorganization items and gain on sale of
    investments. As discussed in the notes to the tables below, the
    Company does not allocate corporate overhead to its United
    Express segment; although certain selling and operational costs
    are allocated to United Express.



The following table presents UAL segment information for the
    years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, the eleven month

Equity earnings are part of the

The Company does not allocate interest income or interest
    expense to the United Express segment in reports used to
    evaluate segment performance. Therefore, all amounts classified
    as interest income and interest expense in the

Statements of
    Consolidated Operations

relate to the mainline segment.

In accordance with SFAS 142, on the Effective Date the
    Company allocated goodwill upon adoption of fresh-start
    reporting in a manner similar to how the amount of goodwill
    recognized in a business combination is determined. This
    required the determination of the fair value of each reporting
    unit to calculate an estimated purchase price for such reporting
    unit. This purchase price was then allocated to the individual
    assets and liabilities assumed to be related to that reporting
    unit. Any excess purchase price is the amount of goodwill
    assigned to that reporting unit. To the extent that individual
    assets and liabilities could be assigned directly to specific
    reporting units, those assets and liabilities were so assigned.
    As a result of this process, all of the Company’s goodwill
    has been allocated to the mainline segment. See Note 3,
    “Asset Impairments and Intangible Assets,” for further
    information related to goodwill.



At December 31, 2008 and 2007, UAL’s and United’s

The Company attributes revenue among the geographic areas based
    upon the origin and destination of each flight segment.
    United’s operations involve an insignificant level of
    dedicated revenue-producing assets in geographic regions as the
    overwhelming majority of the Company’s revenue producing
    assets (primarily U.S. registered aircraft) generally can
    be deployed in any of its geographic regions, as any given
    aircraft may be used in multiple geographic regions on any given

    During the initial adoption of SFAS 158, the Company
    recorded deferred taxes on the portion of other comprehensive
    income associated with the Medicare Part D subsidiary. In
    2007, the Company recomputed deferred taxes on the



portion of the initial other comprehensive balance at the

    current debt obligation as of December 31, 2008, and
    $3 million which was classified as long-term debt
    obligation as of December 31, 2007.

The Company has a $255 million revolving loan commitment
    available under Tranche A of its credit facility. As of
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company used
    $254 million and $102 million, respectively, of the
    Tranche A commitment capacity for letters of credit. In
    addition, under a separate agreement, the Company had
    $27 million of letters of credit issued as of
    December 31, 2008.

At December 31, 2008, UAL’s contractual principal
    payments under then-outstanding long-term debt agreements in
    each of the next five calendar years are as follows:
    2009—$782 million; 2010—$952 million;
    2011—$869 million; 2012—$414 million;
    2013—$268 million and
    thereafter—$3,743 million.

As of December 31, 2008, assets with a net carrying value
    of $7.9 billion, principally aircraft, route authorities
    and Mileage Plus intangible assets were pledged under various
    loan and other agreements.

Aircraft-related
    Transactions

In June 2008, United entered into an $84 million credit
    agreement secured by three aircraft, including two Airbus A320s
    and one Boeing B777. Borrowings under the agreement are at a
    variable interest rate based on LIBOR plus a margin. The loan
    has a final maturity in June 2015.

In July 2008, United completed a $241 million credit
    agreement secured by 26 of the Company’s owned A319 and
    A320 aircraft. Borrowings under the agreement were at a variable
    interest rate based on LIBOR plus a margin. Periodic principal
    and interest payments are required until the final maturity in
    June 2019. The Company may not prepay the loan prior to July
    2012. This agreement did not change



the number of the Company’s unencumbered aircraft as the
    Company used available equity in these previously mortgaged
    aircraft as collateral for this financing.

EETC Pass Through Certificates,

Series 2007-1.

On
    June 26, 2007, United and Wilmington Trust Company, as
    subordination agent and pass through trustee under three pass
    through trusts newly formed by United (the “Trustee”)
    entered into a note purchase agreement, dated as of
    June 26, 2007 (the “Note Purchase Agreement”).
    The Note Purchase Agreement provides for the issuance by United
    of equipment notes (the “Equipment Notes”) in the
    aggregate principal amount of approximately $694 million to
    finance 13 aircraft owned by United. Ten of these owned aircraft
    had been financed by pre-existing aircraft mortgages which
    United repaid in full (approximately $590 million principal
    amount) with most of the proceeds of the Equipment Notes. The
    mortgages related to these ten aircraft had been adjusted to
    fair market value at the adoption of fresh-start reporting on
    February 1, 2006. The extinguishment of the aircraft
    mortgages resulted in the recognition of a $22 million gain
    for the unamortized premium, which was accounted for as a
    reduction in interest expense in the second quarter of 2007. The
    remaining three owned aircraft were unencumbered prior to the
    closing of the Enhanced Equipment Trust Certificates
    (“EETC”) transaction.

The payment obligations of United under the Equipment Notes are
    fully and unconditionally guaranteed by UAL. The Class B
    and Class C certificates are subject to transfer
    restrictions. They may be sold only to qualified institutional
    buyers, as defined by Rule 144A under the Securities Act of
    1933, as amended, for so long as they are outstanding. Pursuant
    to the Note Purchase Agreement, the Trustee for each pass
    through trust agreed to purchase Equipment Notes issued under a
    Trust Indenture and Mortgage (each, an
    “Indenture” and, collectively, the
    “Indentures”) with respect to each aircraft financing
    entered into by United and Wilmington Trust Company, as
    Mortgagee.

Each Indenture contemplated the issuance of Equipment Notes in
    three series: Series A, bearing interest at the rate of
    6.636% per annum, Series B, bearing interest at the rate of
    7.336% per annum, and Series C, bearing interest at the
    rate of six-month LIBOR plus 2.25% per annum, in the aggregate
    principal amount of approximately $694 million divided
    between the three series as follows: $485 million in the
    case of Series A Equipment Notes, $107 million in the
    case of Series B Equipment Notes and $102 million in
    the case of Series C Equipment Notes. The Equipment Notes
    were purchased by the Trustee for each pass through trust using
    the proceeds from the sale of Pass Through Certificates,

Series 2007-1A,

Pass Through Certificates,

Series 2007-1B

and Pass Through Certificates,

Series 2007-1C

(collectively, the “Certificates”).

Interest on the Equipment Notes is payable semiannually on each
    January 2 and July 2, beginning on January 2, 2008.
    Principal payments are scheduled on January 2 and July 2 in
    scheduled years, beginning on January 2, 2008. The final
    payments will be due on July 2, 2022, in the case of the
    Series A Equipment Notes, July 2, 2019, in the case of
    the Series B Equipment Notes and July 2, 2014, in the
    case of the Series C Equipment Notes. Maturity of the
    Equipment Notes may be accelerated upon the occurrence of
    certain events of default, including failure by United to make
    payments under the applicable Indenture when due or to comply
    with certain covenants, as well as certain bankruptcy events
    involving United. The Equipment Notes issued with respect to
    each of the 13 aircraft are secured by a lien on each such
    aircraft and are cross-collateralized by the rest of the 13
    aircraft financed pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement.

Distributions on the Certificates are subject to certain
    subordination provisions whereby Morgan Stanley Senior Funding,
    Inc. provided a liquidity facility for each of the Class A
    and Class B certificates. The liquidity facilities are
    expected to provide an amount sufficient to pay up to three
    semiannual interest payments on the certificates of the related
    pass through trust. The Class C certificates do not have
    the benefit of a liquidity facility.

The Company evaluated whether the trusts formed for the above
    EETC financing are variable interest entities (“VIEs”)
    required to be consolidated by the Company under FASB
    Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003),

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities

,
    (“FIN 46R”). Additionally, the Company considered
    the guidance in FASB Staff Position

FIN 46R-6,

Determining the Variability to



Be Considered in Applying FASB interpretation
    No. 46(R)

. Based on this evaluation the Company
    determined that the trusts are VIEs and are not excluded from
    the scope of FIN 46R. The Company evaluated whether there
    is an implicit or explicit arrangement that absorbs variability
    from the trusts. Based on the Company’s analysis as
    described below, the Company determined that it does not absorb
    variability of the trusts and that it does not have a variable
    interest in the trusts.

The Company evaluated the design of the trusts, including
    (1) the nature of the risk in the trusts and (2) the
    purpose for which the trusts were created and the variability
    that the trusts are designed to create and pass along to their
    variable interest holders. The primary risk of the trusts is
    credit risk (i.e. the risk that United, the issuer of the
    equipment notes, may be unable to make its principal and
    interest payments). The purpose of the trusts is to enhance the
    credit worthiness of United’s debt obligation through
    certain bankruptcy protection provisions, a liquidity facility
    and improved

loan-to-value

ratios for more senior debt classes. These credit enhancements
    lower United’s total borrowing cost. The other purpose of
    the trust is to receive principal and interest payments on the
    equipment notes purchased by the trusts from United and remit
    these proceeds to the trusts’ certificate holders.

United did not invest in or obtain a financial interest in the
    trusts. Rather United has an obligation to make its interest and
    principal payments on its equipment notes held by the trusts. By
    design, United was not intended to have any voting or non-voting
    equity interest in the trusts or to absorb variability from the
    trusts. Based on this analysis, the Company determined that it
    is not required to consolidate the trusts under FIN 46R.

EETC Repurchases.

In addition, the Company
    purchased certain of its previously issued and outstanding EETC
    securities in open market transactions during 2007. The Company
    purchased EETC securities, including accrued interest, for
    $96 million and adjusted these securities to a fair value
    of $91 million at December 31, 2007. At
    December 31, 2008, the fair value of these securities was
    $46 million. These EETC securities were issued by
    third-party pass-through trusts that are not consolidated by the
    Company. The pass-through trusts’ only investments are
    equipment notes issued by United. The acquisition of the EETC
    securities does not legally extinguish the corresponding
    equipment notes; therefore, the certificates are classified as a
    non-current investment.

See Note 14, “Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and
    Uncertainties” for a discussion of the Company’s
    municipal bond guarantees.

Other
    Debt

Push Down of UAL Securities.

The following
    instruments issued by UAL have been pushed down to United and
    are reflected as debt of United as part of fresh-start reporting.

4.5% convertible notes.

These notes are
    unsecured, mature on June 30, 2021 and do not require any
    payment of principal before maturity. Interest is payable
    semi-annually, in arrears. These notes may be converted into
    common stock of UAL. The conversion price, which was initially
    $34.84, is subject to adjustment for certain dilutive items and
    events. Effective January 10, 2008, the conversion price
    was changed to $32.64 due to UAL’s January 23, 2008
    special distribution to holders of UAL common stock. The notes
    are junior, in right of payment upon liquidation, to the
    Company’s obligations under the 5% senior convertible
    notes and 6% senior notes discussed below. The notes are
    callable in cash

and/or

UAL
    common stock beginning in 2011, except that UAL may elect to pay
    in common stock only if the common stock has traded at not less
    than 125% of the conversion price for the 60 consecutive trading
    days immediately before the redemption date. In addition, on
    each of June 30, 2011 and June 30, 2016, holders have
    the option to require UAL to repurchase its notes, which UAL may
    elect to do through the payment of cash or UAL common stock, or
    a combination of both. These notes are guaranteed by United.

5% senior convertible notes.

The notes
    are unsecured, have a term of 15 years from the date of
    issuance and do not require any payment of principal before
    maturity. Interest is payable semi-annually, in arrears. These
    5% senior convertible notes may be converted, at the
    holder’s option, into UAL



common stock at any time at an initial conversion price of
    $46.86. Effective January 10, 2008, the conversion price
    was adjusted to $43.90 due to the UAL special distribution to
    holders of UAL common stock on January 23, 2008. This
    conversion price is subject to adjustment for certain dilutive
    items and events. These notes are callable, at UAL’s
    option, in cash or UAL common stock, under certain conditions,
    beginning five years after the issuance date. In the case of any
    such redemption, the Company may only redeem these notes with
    shares of common stock if UAL common stock has traded at no less
    than 125% of the conversion price for the 60 consecutive trading
    days prior to the redemption date. The holders have the option
    to require UAL to repurchase their notes on the 5th and 10th
    anniversary of the date of issuance, which UAL may elect to do
    through the payment of cash, common stock or a combination of
    both.

6% senior notes.

These notes are
    unsecured, mature 25 years from the issuance date and do
    not require any payment of principal before maturity. Interest
    is payable semi-annually, in arrears. Interest may be paid with
    cash, in kind notes or UAL common stock through 2011 and
    thereafter in cash. These notes are callable at any time at 100%
    of par value and can be redeemed with either cash or UAL common
    stock at UAL’s option. Upon a change in control or other
    event as defined in the agreement, UAL has an obligation to
    redeem the notes. In the case of such mandatory redemption, UAL
    may elect to redeem the notes in cash, in shares of UAL common
    stock or a combination thereof. The Company paid interest
    in-kind of approximately $31 million and $15 million
    on the 6% senior notes during the years ended
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

Contingent Senior Unsecured Notes.

In addition
    to the debt issued as noted above, UAL is obligated to issue to
    the PBGC 8% senior unsecured notes with an aggregate
    $500 million principal amount in up to eight equal tranches
    of $62.5 million (with no more than two tranches issued on
    a single date) upon the occurrence of certain financial
    triggering events. Any required tranche will be issued no later
    than 45 days following the end of any fiscal year in which
    there is an issuance-triggering event

,

starting
    with the fiscal year ending December 31, 2009 through
    fiscal year ending December 31, 2017. An issuance trigger
    event occurs when, among other things, the Company’s
    EBITDAR exceeds $3.5 billion over the prior twelve months
    ending June 30 or December 31 of any applicable fiscal year,
    beginning with the fiscal year ending December 31, 2009.
    However, if the issuance of a tranche would cause a default
    under any other securities then existing, UAL may satisfy its
    obligations with respect to such tranche by issuing UAL common
    stock having a market value equal to $62.5 million. Each
    issued tranche will mature 15 years from its respective
    issuance date, with interest payable in cash in semi-annual
    installments, and will be callable at any time at 100% of par
    value, plus accrued and unpaid interest.

Amended
    Credit Facility

In February 2007, the Company prepaid $972 million of its
    then outstanding credit facility debt and entered into an
    Amended and Restated Revolving Credit, Term Loan and Guaranty
    Agreement dated as of February 2, 2007 with JPMorgan Chase
    Bank, N.A, Citicorp USA, Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities Inc.,
    Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. and Credit Suisse Securities
    (USA) LLC (the “Amended Credit Facility”) that, among
    other things, reduced the size of the facility from
    $3.0 billion to $2.055 billion, reduced the applicable
    interest rates and provided for a more limited collateral
    package and a relaxation of certain restrictive covenants. There
    were no prepayment penalties associated with this debt
    retirement. In addition, United also incurred financing costs of
    $10 million of which $6 million was expensed and
    $4 million was capitalized. The financing costs associated
    with the credit facility amendment and prepayment, which were
    expensed, are classified within interest expense. The Company
    expensed approximately $17 million of deferred financing
    costs which are related to the portion of the credit facility
    prepaid in February 2007 and included in other assets on the
    December 31, 2006

Statements of Consolidated Financial
    Position.

The Amended Credit Facility provided for a total commitment of
    up to $2.055 billion, comprised of two separate tranches:
    (i) a Tranche A consisting of $255 million
    revolving commitment available for Tranche A loans and
    standby letters of credit and (ii) a Tranche B
    consisting of a term loan commitment



of $1.8 billion available at the time of closing. The
    Tranche A loans mature on February 1, 2012 and the
    Tranche B loans mature on February 1, 2014.

Borrowings under the Amended Credit Facility bear interest at a
    floating rate, which, at the Company’s option, can be
    either a base rate or a LIBOR rate, plus an applicable margin of
    1.0% in the case of base rate loans and 2.0% in the case of
    LIBOR loans. The Tranche B term loan requires regularly
    scheduled semi-annual payments of principal equal to
    $9 million. Interest is payable at least every three
    months. The Company may prepay some or all of the Tranche B
    loans from time to time, at a price equal to 100% of the
    principal amount prepaid plus accrued and unpaid interest, if
    any, to the date of prepayment, but without penalty or premium.

In December 2007 the Company prepaid an additional
    $500 million of the term loan under the Amended Credit
    Facility. In connection with this prepayment, the Company
    expensed an additional $6 million of previously capitalized
    debt issuance costs. The Company also recognized a
    $2 million credit to interest expense to recognize
    previously deferred interest rate swap gains. The December 2007
    amendment enabled the Company to undertake certain shareholder
    initiatives. UAL’s Board of Directors approved a special
    distribution of $2.15 per share to holders of UAL common stock,
    or approximately $257 million, which was paid on
    January 23, 2008. The Company can undertake approximately
    $243 million in additional shareholder initiatives without
    any additional prepayment of the Amended Credit Facility. The
    amendment also provides that the Company can carry out further
    shareholder initiatives in an amount equal to future term loan
    prepayments.

Amended Credit Facility
    Collateral.

United’s obligations under the
    Amended Credit Facility are unconditionally guaranteed by UAL
    Corporation and certain of its direct and indirect domestic
    subsidiaries, other than certain immaterial subsidiaries (the
    “Guarantors”). On February 2, 2007, the closing
    date of the Amended Credit Facility, the obligations were
    secured by a security interest in the following tangible and
    intangible assets of United and the Guarantors: (i) the
    Pacific (Narita, China and Hong Kong) and Atlantic (Heathrow)
    routes (the “Primary Routes”) that United had as of
    February 2, 2007, (ii) primary foreign slots, primary
    domestic slots, certain gate interests in domestic airport
    terminals and certain supporting route facilities,
    (iii) certain spare engines, (iv) certain quick engine
    change kits, (v) certain owned real property and related
    fixtures, and (vi) certain flight simulators (the
    “Collateral”). After the closing date, and subject to
    certain conditions, United and the Guarantor were able to grant
    a security interest in the following assets, in substitution for
    certain Collateral (which may be released from the lien in
    support of the Amended Credit Facility upon the satisfaction of
    certain conditions): (a) certain aircraft, (b) certain
    spare parts, (c) certain ground handling equipment and
    (d) accounts receivable. In addition, United had the right
    to remove collateral pledged to the Amended Credit Facility as
    long as the minimum collateral ratio described below is achieved.

In March 2008, in accordance with the terms of its the Amended
    Credit Facility, United provided notice to the lenders of its
    intent to remove certain assets from the collateral securing its
    outstanding loans. The release of such collateral was effective
    as of April 16, 2008. The release of collateral, which was
    valued at approximately $650 million, was facilitated, in
    part, by the reduction in outstanding loans under the Amended
    Credit Facility following United’s $500 million
    prepayment in December 2007. United’s assets released from
    the Amended Credit Facility collateral included all domestic
    slots, spare engines, flight simulators, owned real property and
    related fixtures previously securing the Amended Credit
    Facility. Following such release of collateral, the Amended
    Credit Facility is secured by certain of United’s
    international route authorities, international slots, related
    gate interests and associated rights.

Amended Credit Facility Covenants.

The Amended
    Credit Facility contains covenants that in certain circumstances
    may limit the ability of United and the Guarantors to, among
    other things, incur or guarantee additional indebtedness, create
    liens, pay dividends on or repurchase stock, make certain types
    of investments, enter into transactions with affiliates, sell
    assets or merge with other companies, modify corporate documents
    or change lines of business. The Company was in compliance with
    all of its Amended Credit Facility covenants as of
    December 31, 2008 and 2007. In May 2008, the Company
    amended the terms of certain financial covenants of the Amended
    Credit Facility. The Company paid



$109 million to amend the credit facility. These costs are
    being deferred and amortized over the remaining life of the
    agreement. The following is a summary of the financial covenants
    after the May amendment.

Beginning with the second quarter of 2009, the Company must
    maintain a specified minimum ratio of EBITDAR to the sum of the
    following fixed charges for all applicable periods:
    (a) cash interest expense and (b) cash aircraft
    operating rental expense. EBITDAR represents earnings before
    interest expense net of interest income, income taxes,
    depreciation, amortization, aircraft rent and certain other cash
    and non-cash credits and charges as further defined by the
    Amended Credit Facility. The other adjustments to EBITDAR
    include items such as foreign currency transaction gains or
    losses, increases or decreases in our deferred revenue
    obligation, share-based compensation expense, non-recurring or
    unusual losses, any non-cash non-recurring charge or non-cash
    restructuring charge, a limited amount of cash restructuring
    charges, certain cash transaction costs incurred with financing
    activities and the cumulative effect of a change in accounting
    principle.

The Amended Credit Facility also requires compliance with the
    following financial covenants: (i) a minimum unrestricted
    cash balance of $1.0 billion and (ii) a minimum ratio
    of market value of collateral to the sum of (a) the
    aggregate outstanding amount of the loans plus (b) the
    undrawn amount of outstanding letters of credit plus
    (c) the unreimbursed amount of drawings under such letters
    of credit plus (d) the termination value of certain
    interest rate protection and hedging agreements with the Amended
    Credit Facility lenders and their affiliates, of 150% at any
    time, or 200% at any time following the release of Primary
    Routes having an appraised value in excess of $1 billion
    (unless the Primary Routes are the only collateral then pledged).

The requirement to meet a fixed charge coverage ratio was
    suspended for the four quarters beginning with the second
    quarter of 2008 and ending with the first quarter of 2009 and
    thereafter is determined as set forth below:

Failure to comply with any applicable covenants in effect for
    any reporting period could result in a default under the Amended
    Credit Facility unless the Company obtains a waiver of, or
    otherwise mitigates or cures, any such default. A default could
    result in a termination of the Amended Credit Facility and a
    requirement to accelerate repayment of all outstanding facility
    borrowings. Additionally, the Amended Credit Facility contains a
    cross default provision with respect to other credit
    arrangements that exceed $50 million. Although the Company
    was in compliance with all required financial covenants as of
    December 31, 2008 and the Company is not required to comply
    with a fixed charge coverage ratio until the three month period
    ending June 30, 2009, continued compliance depends on many
    factors, some of which are beyond the Company’s control,
    including the overall industry revenue environment and the level
    of fuel costs.

Credit
    Card Processing Agreement Covenants

The Company has agreements with financial institutions that
    process customer credit card transactions for the sale of air
    travel and other services. Under certain of the Company’s
    card processing agreements, the financial institutions either
    require, or have the right to require, that United maintain a
    reserve equal to a portion of advance ticket sales that have
    been processed by that financial institution, but for which the
    Company has not yet provided the air transportation (referred to
    as “relevant advance



ticket sales”). As of December 31, 2008, the Company
    had advance ticket sales of approximately $1.5 billion of
    which approximately $1.3 billion relates to credit card
    sales.

In November 2008, United entered into an amendment for its card
    processing agreement with Paymentech and JPMorgan Chase Bank
    (the “Amendment”) that suspends until January 20,
    2010 the requirement for United to maintain additional cash
    reserves with this processor of bank cards (above the current
    cash reserve of $25 million at December 31,
    2008) if United’s month-end balance of unrestricted
    cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments falls below
    $2.5 billion. In exchange for this benefit, United has
    granted the processor a security interest in certain of
    United’s owned aircraft with a current appraised value of
    at least $800 million. United also has agreed that such
    security interest collateralizes not only United’s
    obligations under the processing agreement, but also
    United’s obligations under United’s Amended and
    Restated Co-Branded Card Marketing Services Agreement. United
    has an option to terminate the Amendment prior to
    January 20, 2010, in which event the parties’ prior
    credit card processing reserve arrangements under the processing
    agreement will go back into effect.

After January 20, 2010, or in the event United terminates
    the Amendment, and in addition to certain other risk protections
    provided to the processor, the amount of any such reserve will
    be determined based on the amount of unrestricted cash held by
    the Company as defined under the Amended Credit Facility. If the
    Company’s unrestricted cash balance is more than
    $2.5 billion as of any calendar month-end measurement date,
    its required reserve will remain at $25 million. However,
    if the Company’s unrestricted cash is less than
    $2.5 billion, its required reserve will increase to a
    percentage of relevant advance ticket sales as summarized in the
    following table:

Required % of

Total Unrestricted Cash Balance(a)

Relevant Advance Ticket Sales

Less than $2.5 billion


%

Less than $2.0 billion


%

Less than $1.0 billion


%

(a)

Includes unrestricted cash, cash
    equivalents and short-term investments at month-end, including
    certain cash amounts already held in reserve, as defined by the
    agreement.

If the November 2008 Amendment had not been in effect as of
    December 31, 2008, the Company would have been required to
    post an additional $132 million of reserves based on an
    actual unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term
    investments balance of between $2.0 billion and
    $2.5 billion at December 31, 2008.

United’s card processing agreement with American Express
    expired on February 28, 2009 and was replaced by a new
    agreement on March 1, 2009 which has an initial five year
    term. As of December 31, 2008, there were no required
    reserves under this card agreement, and no reserves were
    required up through the date of expiration.

Under the new agreement, in addition to certain other risk
    protections provided to American Express, the Company will be
    required to provide reserves based primarily on its unrestricted
    cash balance and net current exposure as of any calendar
    month-end measurement date, as summarized in the following table:

Required % of

Total Unrestricted Cash Balance(a)

Net Current Exposure(b)

Less than $2.4 billion


%

Less than $2.0 billion


%

Less than $1.35 billion


%

Less than $1.2 billion


%

(a)

Includes unrestricted cash, cash
    equivalents and short-term investments at month-end, including
    certain cash amounts already held in reserve, as defined by the
    agreement.



(b)

Net current exposure equals
    relevant advance ticket sales less certain exclusions, and as
    adjusted for specified amounts payable between United and the
    processor, as further defined by the agreement.

The new agreement permits the Company to provide certain
    replacement collateral in lieu of cash collateral, as long as
    the Company’s unrestricted cash is above
    $1.35 billion. Such replacement collateral may be pledged
    for any amount of the required reserve up to the full amount
    thereof, with the stated value of such collateral determined
    according to the agreement. Replacement collateral may be
    comprised of aircraft, slots and routes, real estate or other
    collateral as agreed between the parties.

In the near term, the Company will not be required to post
    reserves under the new American Express agreement as long as
    unrestricted cash as measured at each month-end, and as defined
    in the agreement, is equal to or above $2.0 billion.

If the terms of the new agreement had been in place at
    December 31, 2008, and ignoring the near term protection in
    the preceding sentence, the Company would have been required to
    provide collateral of approximately $40 million.

An increase in the future reserve requirements as provided by
    the terms of either or both the Company’s material card
    processing agreements could materially reduce the Company’s
    liquidity.

Fair
    Value Measurements and Derivative Instruments

Instruments designated as cash flow hedges are accounted for
    under SFAS 133, as long as the hedge is highly effective
    and the underlying transaction is probable. If both factors are
    present, the effective portion of the changes in fair value of
    these contracts is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive
    income (loss) until earnings are affected by the cash flows
    being hedged. To the extent that the designated cash flow hedges
    are ineffective, gain or loss is recognized currently in
    earnings. The Company offsets the fair value of derivative
    instruments executed with the same counterparty when netting
    agreements exist.

Instruments classified as economic hedges do not qualify for
    hedge accounting under SFAS 133. Under this classification
    all changes in the fair value of these contracts are recorded
    currently in income, with the offset to either current assets or
    liabilities each reporting period. Economic fuel hedge gains and
    losses are classified as part of aircraft fuel expense and fuel
    hedge gains and losses from instruments that are not deemed
    economic hedges are classified as part of nonoperating income.
    Foreign currency hedge gains and losses are classified as part
    of nonoperating income.

Aircraft
    Fuel Hedges.

The Company has a risk management strategy to hedge a portion of
    its price risk related to projected jet fuel requirements. As
    presented in the table below, the Company utilizes various types
    of hedging instruments including purchased calls, collars, 3-way
    collars and 4-way collars. A collar involves the purchase of

    with identical expiration dates. Derivative gains (losses) from

Foreign
    Currency Derivatives.

The Company hedges a portion of its remaining foreign currency
    risk exposure using foreign currency forward contracts. As of
    December 31, 2008, the Company hedged a portion of its
    expected foreign currency cash flows in the Australian dollar,
    Canadian dollar, British pound, European Euro and Japanese yen.
    As of December 31, 2008, the notional amount of these
    foreign currencies hedged with the forward contracts in
    U.S. dollars terms was approximately $62 million.
    These contracts expire at various dates through December 2009.
    For the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, there were
    no material gains or losses from these derivative positions.

Fair Value Information.

Effective
    January 1, 2008, the Company adopted SFAS 157.
    SFAS 157 establishes a fair value hierarchy that
    prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy
    gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active
    markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1
    measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs
    (Level 3 measurement). This



hierarchy requires entities to maximize the use of observable
    inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The three
    levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:

Level 1

Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible
    at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or
    liabilities.

Level 2

Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1,
    such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in
    active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets
    and liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs
    that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market
    data.

Level 3

Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market
    activity and that are significant to the fair value of the
    assets or liabilities.

The table below presents disclosures about the fair value of
    financial assets and financial liabilities recognized in the

The Company considered counterparty credit risk in determining
    the fair value of the financial instruments shown in the table
    above. Credit risk did not have a significant impact on the fair
    values of fuel derivatives because the Company was required to
    post $965 million of cash collateral with certain of its
    fuel derivative counterparties at December 31, 2008. The
    current portion of the collateral, $953 million, is
    classified as “Fuel hedge collateral deposits” and the
    noncurrent portion is classified as “Other assets” in
    the accompanying

Statements of Consolidated Financial
    Position.

The Company routinely reviews the credit risk
    associated with its counterparties and believes its collateral
    is fully recoverable from its counterparties as of
    December 31, 2008. Based on the fair value of the
    Company’s



fuel derivative instruments, our counterparties may require the
    Company to post additional amounts of collateral when the price
    of the underlying commodity decreases and lesser amounts when
    the price of the underlying commodity increases.

Derivative instruments and investments presented in the table
    above have the same fair value as their carrying value. The
    table below presents the carrying values and estimated fair
    values of the Company’s financial instruments not presented

Fair value of the above financial instruments was determined as
    follows:

Description

Fair Value Methodology

Cash and Cash Equivalents,

Short-term

Investments and Restricted Cash

The carrying amounts approximate fair value because of the

short-term

maturity of these investments.

Enhanced Equipment Trust Certificates
    (“EETCs”)

The EETCs are not actively traded on an exchange. Fair value is
    based on the trading prices of similar EETC instruments issued
    by other airlines. The Company uses internal models and
    observable and unobservable inputs to corroborate third party
    quotes. Because certain inputs are unobservable, the Company
    categorized the EETCs as Level 3.

Fuel Derivative Instruments

Derivative contracts are privately negotiated contracts and are
    not exchange traded. Fair value measurements are estimated with
    option pricing models that employ observable and unobservable
    inputs.

Foreign Currency Derivative Instruments

Fair value is determined with a formula utilizing observable
    inputs.

Preferred Stock and Long-Term Debt

The fair value is based on the quoted market prices for the same
    or similar issues, discounted cash flow models using appropriate
    market rates and the Black-Scholes model to value conversion
    rights in UAL’s convertible preferred stock and debt
    instruments. The Company’s credit risk was considered in
    estimating fair value.

Commitments,
    Contingent Liabilities and Uncertainties

General Guarantees and
    Indemnifications.

In the normal course of
    business, the Company enters into numerous real estate leasing
    and aircraft financing arrangements that have various guarantees
    included in the contracts. These guarantees are primarily in the
    form of indemnities. In both leasing and financing transactions,
    the Company typically indemnifies the lessors and any
    tax/financing parties, against tort liabilities that arise out
    of the use, occupancy, operation or maintenance of the leased
    premises or financed aircraft. Currently, the Company believes
    that any future payments required under these guarantees or
    indemnities would be immaterial, as most tort liabilities and
    related indemnities are covered by insurance (subject to
    deductibles). Additionally, certain leased premises such as
    fueling stations or storage facilities include indemnities of
    such parties for any environmental liability that may arise out
    of or relate to the use of the leased premises.



Legal and Environmental
    Contingencies.

The Company has certain
    contingencies resulting from litigation and claims (including
    environmental issues) incident to the ordinary course of
    business. Management believes, after considering a number of
    factors, including (but not limited to) the information
    currently available, the views of legal counsel, the nature of
    contingencies to which the Company is subject and prior
    experience, that the ultimate disposition of these contingencies
    will not materially affect the Company’s consolidated
    financial position or results of operations.

The Company records liabilities for legal and environmental
    claims when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. These
    amounts are recorded based on the Company’s assessments of
    the likelihood of their eventual disposition. The amounts of
    these liabilities could increase or decrease in the near term,
    based on revisions to estimates relating to the various claims.

The Company anticipates that if ultimately found liable, its
    damages from claims arising from the events of
    September 11, 2001 could be significant; however, the
    Company believes that, under the Air Transportation Safety and
    System Stabilization Act of 2001, its liability will be limited
    to its insurance coverage.

The Company continues to analyze whether any potential liability
    may result from air cargo/passenger surcharge cartel
    investigations following the receipt of a Statement of
    Objections that the European Commission (the
    “Commission”) issued to 26 companies on
    December 18, 2007. The Statement of Objections sets out
    evidence related to the utilization of fuel and security
    surcharges and exchange of pricing information that the
    Commission views as supporting the conclusion that an illegal
    price-fixing cartel had been in operation in the air cargo
    transportation industry. United received a copy of the Statement
    of Objections and has provided written and oral responses
    vigorously disputing the Commission’s allegations against
    the Company. Nevertheless, United will continue to cooperate
    with the Commission’s ongoing investigation. Based on its
    evaluation of all information currently available, the Company
    has determined that no reserve for potential liability is
    required and will continue to defend itself against all
    allegations that it was aware of or participated in cartel
    activities. However, penalties for violation of European
    competition laws can be substantial and a finding that the
    Company engaged in improper activity could have a material
    adverse impact on our consolidated financial position and
    results of operations.

Contingent Senior Unsecured Notes.

UAL
    is obligated to issue up to $500 million of 8% senior
    unsecured notes to the PBGC in up to eight equal tranches of
    $62.5 million upon the occurrence of certain financial
    triggering events. Beginning with fiscal year ending
    December 31, 2009 and through fiscal year ending
    December 31, 2017, a triggering event may occur when, among
    other things, the Company’s EBITDAR exceeds
    $3.5 billion over a prior twelve month period. In certain
    circumstances, UAL common stock may be issued in lieu of
    issuance of the notes. See Note 12, “Debt Obligations
    and Card Processing Agreements,” for further information.

Commitments.

At December 31, 2008,
    future commitments for the purchase of property and equipment,
    principally aircraft, include approximately $0.6 billion of
    binding commitments and $2.4 billion of nonbinding
    commitments. The nonbinding commitments of $2.4 billion are
    related to 42 A319 and A320 aircraft. These orders may be
    cancelled which would result in the forfeiture of
    $91 million of advance payments provided to the
    manufacturer. The Company also reached an agreement with the
    engine manufacturer eliminating all provisions pertaining to
    firm commitments and support for future Airbus aircraft. While
    this permits future negotiations on engine pricing with any
    engine manufacturer, restructured aircraft manufacturer
    commitments have assumed that aircraft will be delivered with
    installed engines at list price. As discussed in Note 3,
    “Asset Impairments and Intangible Assets,” in 2008 the
    Company determined these aircraft deposits were completely
    impaired and

wrote-off

their entire carrying value because it is highly unlikely that
    the Company will take these aircraft deliveries, which will
    require forfeiture of these deposits. The Company’s current
    commitments would require the payment of an estimated
    $0.2 billion in 2009, $0.7 billion for the combined
    years of 2010 and 2011, $1.4 billion for the combined years
    of 2012 and 2013 and $0.7 billion thereafter.



Guarantees
    and Off-Balance Sheet Financing.

Fuel Consortia.

The Company participates in
    numerous fuel consortia with other carriers at major airports to
    reduce the costs of fuel distribution and storage. Interline
    agreements govern the rights and responsibilities of the
    consortia members and provide for the allocation of the overall
    costs to operate the consortia based on usage. The consortium
    (and in limited cases, the participating carriers) have entered
    into long-term agreements to lease certain airport fuel storage
    and distribution facilities that are typically financed through
    tax-exempt bonds (either special facilities lease revenue bonds
    or general airport revenue bonds), issued by various local
    municipalities. In general, each consortium lease agreement
    requires the consortium to make lease payments in amounts
    sufficient to pay the maturing principal and interest payments
    on the bonds. As of December 31, 2008, approximately
    $1.2 billion principal amount of such bonds were secured by
    significant fuel facility leases in which United participates,
    as to which United and each of the signatory airlines has
    provided indirect guarantees of the debt. As of
    December 31, 2008, United’s contingent exposure was
    approximately $226 million principal amount of such bonds
    based on its recent consortia participation. The Company’s
    contingent exposure could increase if the participation of other
    carriers decreases. The guarantees will expire when the
    tax-exempt bonds are paid in full, which ranges from 2010 to
    2028. The Company did not record a liability at the time these
    indirect guarantees were made.

Municipal Bond Guarantees.

The Company has
    guaranteed interest and principal payments on $270 million
    of the Denver International Airport bonds, which were originally
    issued in 1992, but were subsequently redeemed and reissued in
    2007 and are due in 2032 unless the Company elects not to extend
    its lease in which case the bonds are due in 2023. The bonds
    were issued in two tranches — approximately
    $170 million aggregate principal amount of 5.25% discount
    bonds and $100 million aggregate principal amount of 5.75%
    premium bonds. The outstanding bonds and related guarantee are
    not recorded in the Company’s

Statements of Consolidated
    Financial Position

at December 31, 2008 or 2007. The
    related lease agreement is recorded on a straight-line basis
    resulting in ratable accrual of the final $270 million
    lease obligation over the lease term. See Note 12,
    “Debt Obligations and Card Processing Agreements,” for
    additional information.

There remains an issue as to whether the LAX bondholders have a
    secured interest in certain of the Company’s leasehold
    improvements. The Company has accrued an amount which it
    estimates is probable to be approved by the Bankruptcy Court for
    this matter. See Note 4, “Voluntary Reorganization
    Under Chapter 11 — Significant Matters Remaining
    to be Resolved in Chapter 11 Cases,” for a discussion
    of ongoing litigation with respect to certain of this obligation.

Collective
    Bargaining Agreements.

Approximately 83% of United’s employees are represented by
    various U.S. labor organizations. During 2005, United
    reached new agreements with its labor unions for new collective
    bargaining agreements which became effective in January 2005.
    These agreements are not amendable until January 2010. The
    Company expects to begin negotiations in 2009.

(15)

Lease
    Obligations

The Company leases aircraft, airport passenger terminal space,
    aircraft hangars and related maintenance facilities, cargo
    terminals, other airport facilities, other commercial real
    estate, office and computer equipment and vehicles.

In connection with fresh-start reporting requirements, aircraft
    operating leases were adjusted to fair value and a net deferred
    asset of $263 million was recorded in the

Statement of
    Consolidated Financial Position

on the Effective Date,
    representing the net present value of the differences between
    stated lease rates in agreed term sheets and the fair market
    lease rates for similar aircraft. As of December 31, 2008,
    the balance of the net deferred asset was $153 million.
    These deferred amounts are amortized on a straight-line basis as
    an adjustment to aircraft rent expense over the individual
    applicable remaining lease terms, generally from one to
    16 years.



At December 31, 2008, the Company’s leased aircraft,
    scheduled future minimum lease payments under capital leases
    (substantially all of which are for aircraft) and operating
    leases having initial or remaining noncancelable lease terms of
    more than one year were as follows:

    presented above also include future payments for 12 additional
    nonoperating aircraft as of December 31, 2008.

(b)

Aircraft capital lease obligations
    are for 58 mainline and 11 United Express aircraft. Includes
    non-aircraft capital lease payments aggregating $19 million
    in years 2009 through 2013 and United Express capital lease
    obligations of $6 million in 2009 and $5 million in
    each of the years 2010 through 2013.

A portion of United’s aircraft lease obligations and
    related accrued interest ($306 million in equivalent
    U.S. dollars at December 31, 2008) is denominated
    in foreign currencies that expose the Company to risks
    associated with changes in foreign exchange rates. To hedge
    against this risk, United has placed foreign currency deposits
    ($306 million in equivalent U.S. dollars at
    December 31, 2008), primarily for euros, to meet foreign
    currency lease obligations denominated in that respective
    currency. Since unrealized

mark-to-market

gains or losses on the foreign currency deposits are offset by
    the losses or gains on the foreign currency obligations, United
    has hedged its overall exposure to foreign currency exchange
    rate volatility with respect to its foreign lease deposits and
    obligations. In addition, the Company has $20 million of
    U.S. dollar denominated deposits to meet U.S. dollar
    denominated lease obligations. These deposits will be used to
    repay an equivalent amount of recorded capital lease obligations
    and are classified as aircraft lease deposits in the

Statements of Consolidated Financial Position

.

Aircraft operating leases have initial terms of five to
    26 years, with expiration dates ranging from 2009 through
    2024. The Company has facility operating leases that extend to
    2032. Under the terms of most leases, the Company has the right
    to purchase the aircraft at the end of the lease term, in some
    cases at fair market value and in others, at fair market value
    or a percentage of cost. See Note 1(i), “Summary of
    Significant Accounting Policies—United Express,” for
    additional information related to United Express contracts and
    Note 2, “Company Operational Plans,” for
    information related to accrued rent related to the
    Company’s fleet reductions.

Certain of the Company’s aircraft lease transactions
    contain provisions such as put options giving the lessor the
    right to require us to purchase the aircraft at lease
    termination for a certain amount resulting in residual value
    guarantees. Leases containing this or similar provisions are
    recorded as capital



leases on the balance sheet and, accordingly, all residual value
    guarantee amounts contained in the Company’s aircraft
    leases are fully reflected as capital lease obligations in the

Statements of Consolidated Financial Position

.

The Company has various operating leases for 119 aircraft in
    which the lessors are trusts established specifically to
    purchase, finance and lease aircraft to United. These leasing
    entities related to 108 of these aircraft meet the criteria for
    VIEs; however, the Company does not hold a significant variable
    interest in and is not considered the primary beneficiary of the
    leasing entities since the lease terms are consistent with
    market terms at the inception of the lease and do not include a
    residual value guarantee, fixed-price purchase option or similar
    feature that obligates us to absorb decreases in value, or
    entitles the Company to participate in increases in the value of
    the financed aircraft. In addition, of the Company’s total
    aircraft operating leases only 11 of these aircraft leases have
    leasing entities that meet the criteria for VIEs and allow the
    Company to purchase the aircraft at other than fair market
    value. These leases have fixed price purchase options specified
    in the lease agreements which at the inception of the lease
    approximated the aircraft’s expected fair market value at
    the option date.

In October 2008, United entered into a $125 million
    sale-leaseback involving nine previously unencumbered aircraft.
    This financing agreement terminates in 2010; however, United has
    the option to extend the financing agreement for one year
    provided it meets the minimum loan to asset value requirement.
    Interest payments are based on LIBOR plus a margin. The lease is
    considered a capital lease resulting in non-cash increases to
    capital lease assets and capital lease obligations.

In December 2008, United entered into a $149 million
    sale-leaseback involving 15 previously unencumbered aircraft.
    The final maturities of the leases under this agreement vary and
    have an average term of seven years. Two of the leased aircraft
    are being accounted for as operating leases, with the remaining
    13 accounted for as capital leases.

Amounts charged to rent expense, net of minor amounts of
    sublease rentals, were $926 million and $928 million
    and $934 million and $936 million for UAL and United,
    respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2008 and
    2007, respectively; $833 million and $834 million for
    UAL and United, respectively, for the eleven months ended
    December 31, 2006; $76 million for both UAL and United
    for the month ended January 31, 2006. Included in Regional
    affiliates expense in the

were operating rents for United Express aircraft
    of $413 million, $425 million and $403 million

    Purchase of Miles

In September 2008, the Company amended certain terms of its
    agreement with its co-branded credit card partner (the
    “Amendment”). In connection with the Amendment, the
    Company sold an additional $500 million of pre-purchased
    miles to its co-branded credit card partner and extended the
    term of the agreement to December 31, 2017. Prior to the
    Amendment, our Advanced purchase of miles obligation to our
    co-branded credit card partner was approximately
    $600 million, which represented pre-purchased miles
    purchased by our co-branded credit card partner. As a result of
    the additional $500 million purchase of miles, our
    co-branded credit card partner has a remaining pre-purchase
    miles balance of approximately $1.1 billion as of
    December 31, 2008. As part of the Amendment, our co-branded
    credit card partner cannot use the pre-purchased miles for
    issuance to its cardholders prior to 2011; accordingly, the
    $1.1 billion of deferred revenue at December 31, 2008
    for the pre-purchased miles is classified as “Advanced
    purchase of miles” in the non-current liabilities section
    of the Company’s

Statements of Consolidated Financial
    Position

. The Amendment specifies the maximum amount of the
    pre-purchased miles that our co-branded credit card partner can
    award to its cardholders each year from 2011 to 2017.

Prior to the Amendment, the pre-purchased miles were reflected
    as a current liability because the miles pre-purchased by our
    co-branded credit card partner were generally awarded to
    cardholders within one year of purchase. As of December 31,
    2007, the total Advanced purchase of miles was $694 million.

United has the right, but is not required, to repurchase the
    pre-purchased miles from its co-branded credit card partner
    during the term of the agreement. The Amendment contains
    termination penalties that may require United to make certain
    payments and repurchase outstanding pre-purchased miles in cases
    such as the Company’s insolvency, bankruptcy false
    representations or other material breaches.



The Amendment requires that our co-branded credit card partner
    make annual guaranteed payments to United between 2008 and 2017.
    Between 2008 and 2012, our co-branded credit card partner’s
    annual guaranteed payment is satisfied through the purchase of a
    specified minimum amount of miles. Afterwards, our co-branded
    credit card partner’s annual guaranteed payment is
    satisfied through awarding pre-purchased miles, purchasing miles
    and through other contractual payments. Between 2008 and 2012,
    our co-branded credit card partner is allowed to carry forward
    those miles purchased subject to the annual guarantee that have
    not been awarded to its cardholders. Any miles carried forward
    subject to this provision will result in a net increase to our
    “Advance purchase of miles” obligation in our

Statements of Consolidated Financial Position.

In connection with the Amendment, the Company received a payment
    of $100 million in exchange for the extension of the
    license previously granted to its co-branded credit card partner
    to be the exclusive issuer of Mileage Plus Visa cards through
    2017. This amount is reflected as Mileage Plus deferred revenue
    in our

Statements of Consolidated Financial Position

and
    is being recognized as revenue over the period the fees are
    earned.

As part of the Amendment, the Company granted its co-branded
    credit card partner a first lien in specified Mileage Plus
    assets and a second lien on those assets that are provided as
    collateral under our credit facility. See Note 12,
    “Debt Obligations and Card Processing Agreements,” for
    additional information regarding these assets. The Amendment may
    be terminated by either party upon the occurrence of certain
    events as defined, including but not limited to a change in law
    that has a material adverse impact, insolvency of one of the
    parties, or failure of the parties to perform their obligations.
    The security interest is released if the Company repurchases the
    full balance of the pre-purchased miles or the Company achieves
    a certain fixed charge coverage ratio.

In November 2008, the Company further amended its largest credit
    card processing agreement to allow for the temporary
    substitution of aircraft collateral in lieu of cash collateral.
    United also agreed that such security interest collateralizes
    not only United’s obligations under this processing
    agreement, but also United’s obligations under
    United’s Amended and Restated Co-Branded Card Marketing
    Services Agreement. See Note 12, “Debt Obligations and
    Card Processing Agreements,”—Credit Card Processing
    Agreement Covenants,” for further discussion of the
    substitution agreement.

Related
    Party Transactions

In 2008, United contributed cash of $257 million to UAL for
    use in UAL’s payment of its January 2008 special
    distribution to its common shareholders. In addition, UAL made
    capital contributions of $173 million to United during 2008
    consisting of the following:

•

In December 2008, UAL contributed 100% of the capital stock
    United BizJet Holdings, Inc. (“Bizjet”) to United,
    which had a book value of $10 million. In accordance with
    SFAS 141, United’s results of operations reflect the
    results of operations of Bizjet as though the contribution from
    UAL occurred on January 1, 2006, the earliest period
    presented. Subsequently, United and Bizjet entered into a merger
    agreement under which Bizjet was merged with and into United,
    with United being the surviving company. This merger was
    effective December 31, 2008. The only impact that this
    contribution will have on United’s previously reported
    results of operations in 2008 is an increase to income of
    $29 million in the three and six month periods ended
    June 30, 2008 and the nine month period ended
    September 30, 2008.

•

In addition, UAL contributed cash of $163 million to
    United. This contribution included $107 million of proceeds
    that UAL generated from the issuance and sale of UAL common
    stock.

At December 31, 2006, United, through one of its
    wholly-owned subsidiaries, Mileage Plus, Inc. (“MPI”),
    had a $200 million note receivable from UAL. During 2007,
    UAL, United and MPI executed a note payment agreement to pay and
    thereby cancel this note payable (plus accrued interest). This
    transaction had no effect in the UAL consolidated financial
    statements and was treated as a forgiveness



of debt in United’s financial statements, resulting in a
    decrease in paid in capital equal to the total decrease in notes
    and interest receivable.

Special
    Items


See Note 3, “Asset Impairments and Intangible
    Assets,” for a discussion of the asset impairments and
    other special charges recorded in 2008.


SFO Municipal Bonds Security Interest.

In the
    first quarter of 2007, the Company recorded a $3 million
    benefit to operating income as a special item to reduce the
    Company’s recorded obligation for the SFO municipal bonds
    to the amount considered probable of being allowed by the
    Bankruptcy Court.

LAX Municipal Bonds Security Interest.

In the
    first and third quarters of 2007, the Company recorded special
    items of $19 million and $8 million, respectively, as
    favorable adjustments to operating income to adjust the
    Company’s recorded obligation for the LAX municipal bonds
    to the amount considered probable of being allowed by the
    Bankruptcy Court. See Note 4, “Voluntary
    Reorganization Under Chapter 11—Significant Matters
    Remaining to be Resolved in Chapter 11 Cases” for
    further information related to the SFO and LAX litigation.

Change in Estimate.

In the third quarter of
    2007, the Company recorded a change in estimate of
    $59 million for certain liabilities relating to bankruptcy
    administrative claims. This adjustment resulted directly from
    the progression of the Company’s ongoing efforts to resolve
    certain bankruptcy

pre-confirmation

contingencies. Therefore, the Company recorded a special
    operating revenue credit of $45 million and a special
    operating expense credit of $14 million for these changes
    in estimate.


SFO Municipal Bonds Security Interest.

In
    October 2006, the Bankruptcy Court issued an order declaring
    that the owners of certain municipal bonds, issued before the
    Petition Date to finance construction of certain leasehold
    improvements at SFO, should be allowed a secured claim of
    approximately $27 million, based upon the court-determined
    fair value of the Company’s underlying leasehold. After the
    denial of post-trial motions, both parties have appealed to the
    District Court. In accordance with

SOP 90-7,

as of the Effective Date, the Company recorded $60 million
    as its best estimate of the probable security interest to be
    awarded in this unresolved litigation. In the third quarter of
    2006 the Company recorded a special item of $30 million
    benefit to operating income, to reduce the Company’s
    recorded obligation for the SFO municipal bonds to the amount
    the Company estimated liability at that time.

ALPA Non-Qualified Pension Plan.

In the fourth
    quarter of 2006, the Company recorded a special item of
    $24 million as a benefit to operating income to reduce the
    Company’s recorded obligation for this matter. This
    adjustment was based on the receipt of a favorable court ruling
    in ongoing litigation and the Company’s determination that
    it was probable the Company would not be required to satisfy
    this obligation.

LAX Municipal Bonds Security Interest.

In the
    fourth quarter of 2006, based on litigation developments, the
    Company recorded a special item of $18 million as a charge
    to operating income to adjust the Company’s recorded
    obligation for the LAX municipal bonds to the amount the Company
    estimated was probable to be allowed by the Bankruptcy Court.

(20)

Investments

In the fourth quarter of 2007, United, along with certain other
    major air carriers, sold its interests in Aeronautical Radio,
    Inc. (“ARINC”) to Radio Acquisition Corp., an
    affiliate of The Carlyle Group.



ARINC is a provider of transportation communications and systems
    engineering. The transaction generated proceeds of
    $128 million and resulted in a pre-tax gain of
    $41 million.

Investments at December 31, 2008 and 2007 include
    $46 million and $91 million of the Company’s
    previously issued EETC debt securities that the Company
    repurchased in 2007. These securities remain outstanding and are
    classified as

available-for-sale.

An unrealized loss of $37 million and $5 million to
    record these securities at fair value has been recognized in
    other comprehensive income during 2008 and 2007, respectively.
    See Note 12, “Debt Obligations and Card Processing
    Agreements,” for additional information.

Distribution
    Payable

In December 2007, the UAL Corporation Board of Directors
    approved a special distribution of $2.15 per share to holders of
    UAL common stock. The distribution, of approximately
    $257 million, was paid on January 23, 2008 to the
    holders of record of UAL common stock on January 9, 2008.
    The distribution, which is characterized as a return of capital
    for income tax purposes, was accrued at December 31, 2007
    in UAL’s

Statements of Consolidated Financial
    Position.

In January 2008, United’s Board of Directors approved a
    dividend of up to $260 million to UAL to fund the
    January 23, 2008 special distribution to UAL common
    stockholders. As such, United did not accrue the distribution at
    December 31, 2007 in its

    Financial Position

UAL’s quarterly financial data is subject to seasonal
    fluctuations and historically, its results in the second and
    third quarters are better as compared to the first and fourth
    quarters of each year since the latter quarters normally reflect
    weaker demand. UAL’s quarterly results were impacted by the
    following significant items:


•

The second quarter was negatively impacted by impairment charges
    of $2.5 billion related to the Company’s interim
    impairment testing of its intangible assets. In addition, the
    Company incurred $110 million of severance and employee
    benefit charges, as well as $26 million of purchased
    services charges. Offsetting these impacts was a
    $29 million gain from a litigation-related settlement gain.

•

The third quarter included reversals of $16 million of
    intangible asset impairments recorded during the second quarter.
    The Company also recorded an additional $6 million of
    severance



charges, as well as $8 million of losses on the sale of
    assets and $7 million of lease termination and other
    charges.

•

During the fourth quarter, the Company recorded
    $107 million of impairment charges, $18 million of
    severance, $53 million of employee benefit charges,
    $34 million of accelerated depreciation related to aircraft
    groundings and $18 million of lease termination and other
    special charges. In addition, an $11 million net gain on
    asset sales partially offset these unfavorable expenses.


•

The first and third quarters include $22 million and
    $8 million, respectively, of favorable adjustments to
    operating income for the SFO and LAX municipal bonds.

•

The third quarter was impacted by a special operating revenue
    credit of $45 million and a special operating expense
    credit of $14 million for changes in estimates for certain
    liabilities relating to bankruptcy administrative claims.

•

The fourth quarter includes a gain of $41 million from the
    sale of ARINC.

•

The Company’s change in the expiration period for unused
    frequent flyer miles increased revenues by approximately
    $28 million, $47 million, $50 million and
    $121 million in each quarter of 2007, respectively.

See Note 4, “Voluntary Reorganization Under
    Chapter 11” and Note 19, “Special
    Items,” for further discussion of these items.

(23)

Subsequent
    Events

    Financing Initiatives

In January 2009, the Company completed a $95 million
    sale-leaseback agreement for nine aircraft. The Company expects
    this transaction to be treated as a capital lease.

In January 2009, the Company generated net proceeds of
    $62 million from the issuance of 4.0 million shares
    and settlement of unsettled trades at December 31, 2008
    under its $200 million common stock distribution agreement.
    After issuance of these shares, the Company had issued shares
    for gross proceeds of $172 million of the $200 million
    available under this stock offering, leaving $28 million
    available for future issuance under this program, as further
    discussed in Note 5, “Common Stockholders’ Equity
    and Preferred Securities.”

In January 2009, the Company entered into an amendment to its
    Chicago O’Hare International Airport cargo building site
    lease with the City of Chicago. The Company agreed to vacate its
    current cargo facility at O’Hare to allow the land to be
    used for the development of a future runway. In January 2009,
    the Company received approximately $160 million from
    O’Hare in accordance with the lease amendment. In addition,
    the lease amendment requires that the City of Chicago provide
    the Company with another site at O’Hare upon which a
    replacement cargo facility could be constructed.

United’s card processing agreement with American Express
    expired on February 28, 2009 and was replaced by a new
    agreement on March 1, 2009 as discussed in Note 12,
    “Debt Obligations and Card Processing Agreements.”



ITEM 9.

CHANGES
    IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND

None.

ITEM 9A.

CONTROLS
    AND PROCEDURES.

UAL and United each maintain controls and procedures that are
    designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in
    the reports filed or submitted by UAL and United to the
    Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) is
    recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time
    periods specified by the SEC’s rules and forms, and is
    accumulated and communicated to management including the Chief
    Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer as appropriate to
    allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The
    management of UAL and United, including the Chief Executive
    Officer and Chief Financial Officer, performed an evaluation to
    conclude with reasonable assurance that UAL’s and
    United’s disclosure controls and procedures were designed
    and operating effectively to report the information each company
    is required to disclose in the reports they file with the SEC on
    a timely basis. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive
    Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of UAL and United have
    concluded that as of December 31, 2008, disclosure controls
    and procedures were effective.

Changes
    in Internal Control over Financial Reporting during the Quarter
    Ended December 31, 2008

There were no changes in UAL’s or United’s internal
    control over financial reporting during their most recent fiscal
    quarter that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
    materially affect, their internal control over financial
    reporting.



UAL
    Corporation Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial
    Reporting

March 2, 2009

To the Stockholders of UAL Corporation

Chicago, Illinois

The management of UAL Corporation and subsidiaries
    (“UAL”) is responsible for establishing and
    maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting,
    as such term is defined in Exchange Act

Rules 13a-15(f).

Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to
    provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
    financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
    for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations,
    internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
    detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
    effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
    controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
    or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures
    may deteriorate.

Under the supervision and with the participation of management,
    including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the design and operating
    effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
    as of December 31, 2008. In making this assessment,
    management used the framework set forth in

Internal
    Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of
    the Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based
    on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer concluded that our internal controls over
    financial reporting were effective as of December 31, 2008.

Our independent registered public accounting firm,
    Deloitte & Touche LLP, who audited UAL’s
    consolidated financial statements included in this

Form 10-K,

has issued a report on UAL’s internal control over
    financial reporting, which is included herein.



United
    Air Lines, Inc. Management Report on Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting

March 2, 2009

To the Stockholder of United Air Lines, Inc.

Chicago, Illinois

The management of United Air Lines, Inc. (“United”) is
    responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
    control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in
    Exchange Act

Rules 13a-15(f).

Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to
    provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
    financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
    for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations,
    internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or

    effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
    controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
    or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures
    may deteriorate.

Under the supervision and with the participation of management,
    including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
    Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the design and operating
    effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
    as of December 31, 2008. In making this assessment,
    management used the framework set forth in

issued by the Committee of
    the Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based
    on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer concluded that our internal controls over
    financial reporting were effective as of December 31, 2008.

This annual report does not include an attestation report of
    United’s registered public accounting firm regarding
    internal control over financial reporting. Management’s
    report was not subject to attestation by United’s
    registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of
    the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit United to
    provide only management’s report in this annual report.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

UAL Corporation

Chicago, Illinois

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of
    UAL Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of
    December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for
    maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
    and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
    over financial reporting, included in the accompanying
    Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
    in Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
    the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
    based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
    company’s principal executive and principal financial
    officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected
    by the company’s board of directors, management, and other
    personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over
    financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
    improper management override of controls, material misstatements
    due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a
    timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
    effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting
    to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may
    become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
    degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
    deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2008, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.



We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated financial statements and financial statement
    schedule as of and for the year ended December 31, 2008 of
    the Company and our report dated March 2, 2009 expressed an
    unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial
    statement schedule.

    ACCOUNTANT FEES AND SERVICES.

The Audit Committee of the UAL Board of Directors adopted a
    policy on pre-approval of services of independent accountants in
    October 2002. The policy provides that the Audit Committee shall

pre-approve

all audit and non-audit services to be provided to the Company
    and its subsidiaries and affiliates by its auditors. The process
    by which this is carried out is as follows:

For recurring services, the Audit Committee reviews and
    pre-approves Deloitte & Touche LLP’s annual audit
    services and employee benefit plan audits in conjunction with
    the Committee’s annual appointment of the outside auditors.
    The materials include a description of the services along with
    related fees. The Committee also reviews and pre-approves other
    classes of recurring services along with fee thresholds for
    pre-approved services. In the event that the pre-approval fee
    thresholds are met and additional services are required prior to
    the next scheduled Committee meeting, pre-approvals of
    additional services follow the process described below.

Any requests for audit, audit-related, tax and other services
    not contemplated with the recurring services approval described
    above must be submitted to the Audit Committee for specific
    pre-approval and cannot commence until such approval has been
    granted. Normally, pre-approval is provided at regularly
    scheduled meetings. However, the authority to grant specific
    pre-approval between meetings, as necessary, has been delegated
    to the Chairman of the Audit Committee. The Chairman must update
    the



Committee at the next regularly scheduled meeting of any
    services that were granted specific

pre-approval.

On a periodic basis, the Audit Committee reviews the status of
    services and fees incurred

year-to-date

and a list of newly pre-approved services since its last
    regularly scheduled meeting. Our Audit Committee has considered
    whether the 2008 non-audit services provided by
    Deloitte & Touche LLP are compatible with maintaining
    auditor independence.

The aggregate fees billed for professional services rendered by
    Deloitte & Touche LLP in 2008 and 2007 are as follows:

    Passenger Facility Charges and statutory audits of certain
    subsidiaries’ financial statements. The 2008 and 2007 audit
    fees also include the impact of the attestation work performed
    by Deloitte & Touche related to Sarbanes-Oxley.

    consisted of audits of the maintenance operation center,

    the Audit Committee pursuant to paragraph (c)(7)(i)(c) of
