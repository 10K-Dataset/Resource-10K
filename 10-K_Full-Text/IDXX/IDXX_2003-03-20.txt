PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

We operate in two primary business areas: products and services for the veterinary market, which we refer to as
our Companion Animal Group (“CAG”) segment, and products and services for food and environmental markets, which we refer
to as our Food and Environmental Group (“FEG”) segment. See Note 10 to the financial statements for financial information
about our business segments, including geographic information.

COMPANION ANIMAL GROUP

Immunoassays

We provide a broad range of single-use, hand-held test kits that allow quick (in most cases, less than ten minutes),
accurate and convenient testing for a variety of companion animal diseases and health conditions. These products enable
veterinarians to provide improved service to animal owners by delivering test results in the clinic, allowing the veterinarian to
initiate therapy or prevention during the office visit, if required.

Our principal single-use tests are sold under the SNAP name, and include a feline combination test, the SNAP
Combo FIV antibody/FeLV antigen test, which enables veterinarians to test simultaneously for feline leukemia virus (“FeLV”) and feline
immunodeficiency virus (“FIV”) (similar to the human AIDS virus); a canine combination test, the SNAP 3Dx, which tests
simultaneously for Lyme disease,

Ehrlichia canis

and heartworm; and a canine heartworm only test. Sales of heartworm
tests are significantly greater in the first half of our fiscal year due to seasonality of the disease.

In addition to our single-use tests, we sell a line of microwell-based test kits, under the PetChek name, which are
used by larger clinics and independent laboratories to test multiple samples. PetChek tests offer accuracy, ease of use
and cost advantages to high-volume customers. We currently sell PetChek tests for FeLV, FIV and canine heartworm disease.

Instruments

We currently market several instrument systems, as well as associated consumable products, for use in
veterinary clinics. These instruments include the following:

Blood Chemistry

. Our VetTest blood chemistry analyzer is used to measure levels of certain enzymes and other
substances in blood in order to assist the veterinarian in diagnosing physiologic conditions. Twenty-one separate blood
chemistry tests can be performed on the VetTest analyzer. Commonly run tests include glucose, alkaline phosphatase, ALT
(alanine aminotransferase), creatinine, BUN (blood urea nitrogen) and total protein.

Hematology

.  In October 2002 we introduced the LaserCyte system, a new hematology system that uses laser flow
cytometry technology to analyze components of blood, including red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. We believe
that the LaserCyte system is the only in-clinic hematology system that provides veterinarians with a five-part white blood cell
differential and an absolute reticulocyte count, which provides enhanced diagnostic capabilities to veterinarians. We also sell
the QBC® VetAutoread™ hematology analyzer, which is based on the Becton Dickinson QBC® Autoread™ hematology
system that is sold to physicians for human applications.

Electrolytes

.Our VetLyte system measures three electrolytes — sodium, potassium and chloride — to aid in
evaluating acid-base and electrolyte balances and assessing plasma hydration. Test results are available in less than one
minute after sample introduction and are either displayed on the VetLyte analyzer or downloaded to the VetTest analyzer.

Quantitative Hormone Testing

. The VetTest SNAP Reader allows the veterinarian to obtain quantitative
measurement of hormones including thyroxine (T4) and cortisol. These measurements assist in diagnosing and monitoring
the treatment of certain endocrine diseases, such as hyper- and hypo-thyroidism, Cushing’s syndrome and Addison’s disease.
The VetTest SNAP Reader is a module that can be integrated with the VetTest chemistry analyzer. Samples and reagents are
introduced to the analyzer using our SNAP device.

Veterinary Laboratory and Consulting Services

We offer commercial veterinary laboratory and consulting services in the U.S. through facilities located in Arizona,
California, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Oregon and Texas. Through subsidiaries located in the


United Kingdom, Japan and Australia, we offer commercial veterinary laboratory services to veterinary clinics located in
those countries. Veterinarians use our services by submitting samples by courier or overnight delivery to one of our
facilities. Our laboratories offer a large selection of tests and diagnostic panels to detect a number of disease states and other
conditions in production and companion animals.

Additionally, we provide specialized veterinary consultation, telemedicine and advisory services, including
cardiology, radiology, internal medicine, dermatology and ultrasound consulting. These services permit veterinarians to
obtain readings and interpretations of test results transmitted by telephone and over the Internet from the veterinarians’
offices.

Approximately 73%, 74% and 75% of the Company’s revenues were derived from sales of veterinary diagnostic
products and services within the CAG segment in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Information Products and Services

We develop, market and sell practice information management software systems that run key functions of veterinary
clinics, including scheduling, billing and patient records management. Our systems also provide veterinarians with the
ability to electronically download laboratory results from our veterinary reference laboratories directly into the patient’s
medical records. We believe we are the leading provider of veterinary practice information management software systems
in the U.S. with an installed based of more than 8,000 of the approximately 25,000 veterinary hospitals in North America. We
also provide software and hardware support and derive a significant portion of our revenues for this product line from
ongoing service contracts.

Veterinary Pharmaceuticals

We develop, market and sell novel therapeutics for the veterinary market. In December 2000, we introduced
ACAREXX (.01% Ivermectin) otic suspension for the treatment of ear mites in cats, our first drug approved by the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration (“FDA”). In 2002 we commenced active marketing of PZI VET®, an insulin product for the
treatment of diabetic cats, under the FDA’s regulatory discretion guidelines. We currently have a number of other products
under development, including a nitazoxanide-based product for treatment of equine protozoal myeloencephalitis, a
neurological disease that is believed to affect approximately 200,000 horses in the U.S.; diclofenac, a topical non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory for equine use; and tilmicosin, a long-acting, injectable antibiotic for cats. We have completed the
manufacturing, safety and efficacy components of our New Animal Drug Application (“NADA”) for nitazoxanide, and we
have submitted revised labeling and Freedom of Information Act summary information as requested by the FDA. We have
completed the safety and efficacy components of our NADA for diclofenac, and have submitted information relating to
manufacturing in response to questions from the FDA. We anticipate submitting information in support of a NADA for tilmicosin to the
FDA in 2003.

FOOD AND ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP

We sell products that detect microbial contaminants in water and antibiotic residues in milk, and a broad range of
diagnostic and health monitoring products for production animals (primarily poultry, livestock and swine).

Approximately 21%, 20% and 20% of the Company’s revenues were derived from sales of food and environmental
products and services in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Through a series of transactions completed late in 1999 and
early 2000, we disposed of our food microbiology testing products and services business. Revenues from this disposed
product line were approximately $0.8 million in 2000.

Water and Dairy Testing Products

Our Colilert, Colilert-18 and Colisure tests, based on patented Defined Substrate Technology (“DST”),
simultaneously detect total coliforms and

E. coli

in water. These organisms are broadly used as indicators of microbial
contamination in water. Our DST products utilize indicator-nutrients that produce a change in color or fluorescence when
metabolized by target microbes in the sample. Our water tests are used by government laboratories, water utilities and
private certified laboratories to test drinking water in compliance with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”)
standards. The tests also are used in evaluating water used in production processes (for example, in beverage and
pharmaceutical applications) and in evaluating bottled water, recreational water, waste water and water from private wells.


Our Enterolert product is also based on DST and detects enterococci in drinking and recreational waters, with results
available in 24 hours. Our Quanti-Tray products, when used in conjunction with our Colilert, Colilert-18, Colisure or
Enterolert products, provide users quantitative measurements of microbial contamination, rather then a presence/absence
indication. The Colilert, Colilert-18, Colisure and Quanti-Tray products have been approved by the EPA and by regulatory
agencies in certain other countries.

In August 2000, we acquired Genera Technologies Limited, a U.K.-based company that develops and sells products
for detection of cryptosporidia in water. Cryptosporidia are parasites that can cause potentially fatal gastrointestinal illness if
ingested. Testing of water supplies for cryptosporidia is mandated by regulation in the United Kingdom but is not regulated
in other countries at this time.

We offer two principal products for use in testing for antibiotic residue in milk, the SNAP Beta-lactam test and the
Parallux system, an instrument-based testing system. Dairy producers and processors use our tests for quality assurance of
raw milk, and government and food quality managers use them for ongoing surveillance.

We have entered into an agreement with the FDA under which we have agreed, among other things, to perform
specified lot release and stability testing of our SNAP Beta-lactam products and to provide related data to the FDA. If the
FDA were to determine that one or more lots of product failed to meet applicable criteria for product performance or stability,
the FDA could take various actions, including requiring us to recall products or restricting our ability to sell these products.
Sales of dairy antibiotic residue testing products were $16.3 million in 2002.

Production Animal Services

We sell diagnostic tests and related instrumentation and software that are used to detect a wide range of diseases and
monitor health status in production animals. Our production animal products are purchased primarily by government
laboratories and poultry and swine producers. Significant products include diagnostic tests for porcine reproductive and
respiratory syndrome (“PRRS”) and pseudorabies virus in pigs; Newcastle disease in poultry; and Johne’s disease and
brucellosis in cattle.

MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION

We market, sell and service our products in more than 50 countries through our marketing, sales and technical
service groups as well as through independent distributors and other resellers. We maintain sales offices outside the U.S. in
Australia, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Mexico, The Netherlands, Spain, Taiwan and the United Kingdom.

Generally, we will select the appropriate distribution channel for our products based on the type of product,
technical service requirements, number and concentration of customers, regulatory requirements and other factors. We
market our veterinary diagnostic products to veterinarians both directly and through independent veterinary distributors in the
U.S., with most instruments sold directly by IDEXX sales personnel, and test kits and instrument consumables supplied both
via the distribution channel and directly. Outside the U.S., we sell our veterinary diagnostic products through independent
distributors and other resellers and, in certain countries, through our direct sales force. We market our software products and
veterinary laboratory services through our direct sales force. We market our water, dairy, livestock and poultry products
primarily through our direct sales force in the U.S. and Canada. Outside the U.S. and Canada, we market these products
through selected independent distributors and, in certain countries, through our direct sales force.

In 2002, 2001 and 2000, 29%, 28% and 27%, respectively, of our revenue was attributable to sales of products and
services to customers outside the U.S. Risks associated with foreign operations include the need for additional regulatory
approvals, possible disruptions in transportation of our products, the differing product needs of foreign customers, difficulties
in building and managing foreign operations, fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies, import/export duties and quotas,
and unexpected regulatory, economic or political changes in foreign markets. We engage in hedging activities to reduce the
effect of foreign currency fluctuations on our earnings. See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for information by geographic
region; Note 1(j) to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our hedging activities; and "Quantitative and Qualitative Discosure About Market Risk" for a description of foreign currency exchange risk.

In 2002, 2001 and 2000, no customer accounted for 10% or more of our sales.


RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

Our business includes the development and introduction of new products and may involve entry into new business
areas. Our research and development activity is focused primarily on development of new animal drugs, new diagnostic
instrument platforms, new immunoassay devices, new diagnostic tests and improvements to our diagnostic and testing
products. Our research and development expenses were approximately $29.3 million, $28.4 million and $28.3 million in
2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

PATENTS AND LICENSES

We actively seek to obtain patent protection in the U.S. and other countries for inventions covering our products
and technologies. We also license patents and technologies from third parties. These licenses include an exclusive royalty-
bearing license of certain patents relating to diagnostic products for FIV, which expire in 2009, from The Regents of the
University of California; an exclusive royalty-bearing license of certain patents relating to DST utilized in the Colilert,
Colilert-18, Colisure and Enterolert water testing products, which expire in 2007; exclusive licenses to certain patents and
patent applications relating to detection of Lyme disease, which expire beginning in 2019, from Tulane University and the
University of Texas; and a non-exclusive royalty-bearing license from Barnes-Jewish Hospital to certain patents relating to
canine heartworm tests, which expire in 2006. In addition, we hold a U.S. patent, which expires in 2014, covering certain
methods and kits for simultaneously detecting antigens and antibodies, which covers our SNAP Combo FeLV/FIV and
Canine SNAP 3Dx combination tests.

To the extent some of our products may now, or in the future, embody technologies protected by patents, copyrights
or trade secrets of others, we may be required to obtain licenses to such technologies in order to continue to sell our products.
These licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms. Our failure to obtain any such licenses may delay or
prevent the sale of certain new or existing products. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations — Future Operating Results.”

PRODUCTION AND SUPPLY

VetTest analyzers are manufactured for us by Tokyo Parts Industrial Company Ltd. under an agreement that renews
annually unless either party notifies the other of its decision not to renew. The dry chemistry slides used in the VetTest
analyzer (“VetTest Slides”) are supplied exclusively by Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, Inc. (formerly known as Johnson and
Johnson Clinical Diagnostics, Inc.) (“Ortho”) under supply agreements with Ortho (the “Ortho Agreements”). We are
required to purchase all of our requirements for VetTest Slides from Ortho to the extent Ortho is able to supply those
requirements. In addition, we have committed to minimum annual purchase volumes of certain VetTest Slides during the
term of the Ortho Agreements. The Ortho Agreements do not prohibit Ortho from selling dry chemistry slides for use in
veterinary applications, and Ortho currently sells dry chemistry slides for use in its own analyzer, which is primarily designed
for human applications but is also used in the veterinary market. However, Ortho may not sell slides that are bar-coded for
use in the VetTest analyzer to any party other than IDEXX. The Ortho Agreements expire on December 31, 2010, although our purchase obligation
may be extended at our option through December 31, 2011.

The QBC®VetAutoread™ system is manufactured for us by Becton Dickinson under a development and distribution
agreement that requires Becton Dickinson to supply analyzers to us through 2008 and reagents through 2010. Becton
Dickinson is the sole source of these analyzers and reagents.

Certain other components of our products, including the lasers used in our LaserCyte system, also are available from
only one source. While we do not anticipate difficulties in obtaining any of the components used in our products, the loss of
any of these sources of supply would have a material adverse effect on the Company.

We do not generally maintain significant backlog and believe that our backlog at any particular date historically has
not been indicative of future sales. However, backlog at December 31, 2002 was larger than in prior periods due to our
introduction of the LaserCyte system in the fourth quarter of 2002. As of December 31, 2002, our backlog of LaserCyte
orders was approximately $3.3 million.


COMPETITION

We face intense competition within the markets in which we sell our products and services. We expect that future
competition will become even more intense, and that we will have to compete with changing technologies, which could affect
the marketability of our products and services. Our competitive position also will depend on our ability to develop
proprietary products, attract and retain qualified scientific and other personnel, develop and implement production and
marketing plans, obtain patent protection and obtain adequate capital resources.

We compete with many companies ranging from small businesses focused on animal health to large pharmaceutical
companies. Our competitors vary in our different markets. Academic institutions, governmental agencies and other public
and private research organizations also conduct research activities and may commercialize products, which could compete
with our products, on their own or through joint ventures. Some of our competitors have substantially greater capital,
manufacturing, marketing and research and development resources than us.

Competitive factors in our different business areas are detailed below:

•

Veterinary diagnostic products and food and environmental test products

. We compete primarily on the basis of the
ease of use, speed, accuracy and other performance characteristics of our products and services, the breadth of our product
line and services, the effectiveness of our sales and distribution channels, the quality of our technical and customer service
and pricing.

•

Veterinary laboratory services

. In this market, we compete primarily on the basis of quality, service and technolohgy. We
compete in certain geographic locations with Antech Diagnostics, a unit of VCA Antech, Inc.

•

Veterinary pharmaceuticals

. We compete primarily on the basis of the performance characteristics of our products.

•

Veterinary practice information management software systems

. We compete primarily on the basis of ease of use,
performance characteristics, effectiveness of our customer service, information handling capabilities, and advances in
technologies.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION

Many of our products are subject to regulation by U.S. and foreign regulatory agencies. The following is a
description of the principal regulations affecting our businesses.

Veterinary diagnostic products

. Most diagnostic tests for animal health applications are veterinary biological
products that are regulated in the U.S. by the Center for Veterinary Biologics within the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s
(“USDA”) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (“APHIS”). The APHIS regulatory approval process involves the
submission of product performance data and manufacturing documentation. Following regulatory approval to market a
product, APHIS requires that each lot of product be submitted for review before release to customers. In addition, APHIS
requires special approval to market products where test results are used in part for government-mandated disease
management programs. A number of foreign governments accept APHIS approval as part of their separate regulatory
approvals. However, compliance with an extensive regulatory process is required in connection with marketing diagnostic
products in Japan, Germany, The Netherlands and many other countries. We also are required to have a facility license from
APHIS to manufacture USDA-licensed products. We have obtained such a license for our manufacturing facility in
Westbrook, Maine.

Our instrument systems are medical devices regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) under the
Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act (the “FDC Act”). While the sale of these products does not require premarket approval by
FDA and does not subject us to the FDA’s Good Manufacturing Practices regulations (“GMPs”), these products must not be
adulterated or misbranded under the FDC Act.

Veterinary pharmaceuticals

. The manufacture and sale of veterinary pharmaceuticals are regulated by the Center for
Veterinary Medicine (“CVM”) of the FDA. A new animal drug may not be commercially marketed in the U.S. unless it has
been approved as safe and effective by CVM. Approval may be requested by filing a New Animal Drug Application
(“NADA”) with CVM containing substantial evidence as to the safety and effectiveness of the drug. Data regarding
manufacturing methods and controls are also required to be submitted with the NADA. Manufacturers of animal drugs must


also comply with GMPs and Good Laboratory Practices (“GLPs”). Sales of animal drugs in countries outside the U.S.
require compliance with the laws of those countries, which may be extensive.

Water testing products

. Our water tests are not subject to formal premarket regulatory approval. However, before a
test may be used as part of a water quality monitoring program required by the EPA, the test must first be approved by the
EPA. The EPA approval process involves submission of extensive product performance data in accordance with an EPA
approved protocol, evaluation of the data by the EPA and publication for public comment of any proposed approval in the
Federal Register before final approval. Our Colilert, Colilert-18, Colisure, Quanti-Tray, Filta-Max and SimPlate for HPC
products have been approved by the EPA. The sale of water testing products also is subject to extensive and lengthy
regulatory processes in many other countries around the world.

Dairy testing products

. The sale of dairy testing products in the U.S. is regulated by the FDA in conjunction with
the Association of Official Analytical Chemists — Research Institute (“AOAC-RI”). Before a product may be sold, extensive
product performance data must be submitted in accordance with a protocol that is approved by the FDA and the AOAC-RI.
Following approval of a product by FDA, the product must also be approved by the National Conference on Interstate Milk
Shipments (“NCIMS”), an oversight body that includes state, federal and industry representatives. Our SNAP Beta-lactam
and Parallux dairy antibiotic residue testing products have been approved by the FDA and NCIMS. While some foreign
countries accept AOAC-RI approval as part of their regulatory approval process, many countries have separate regulatory
processes.

Any acquisitions of new products and technologies may subject us to additional areas of government regulation.
These may involve food, drug and water quality regulations of the FDA, the EPA and the USDA, as well as state, local and
foreign governments. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —
Future Operating Results.”

EMPLOYEES

As of December 31, 2002, IDEXX had approximately 2,181 full-time and part-time employees. We are not a party
to any collective bargaining agreement and we believe that relations with our employees are good.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

We lease approximately 290,000 square feet of office and manufacturing space in Westbrook, Maine under a lease
expiring in 2008, approximately 75,000 square feet of industrial space in Memphis, Tennessee for use as a distribution
facility, under a lease expiring in 2007, approximately 40,000 square feet of office and manufacturing space in Eau Claire,
Wisconsin for our veterinary practice information management software business, under a lease expiring 2009, and
approximately 40,000 square feet of warehouse and office space in The Netherlands for use as our headquarters for Europea
 operations, under a lease expiring 2008.

We also lease a total of approximately 100,000 square feet of smaller office, manufacturing and warehouse space in
the U.S. and elsewhere in the world. In addition, we own or lease approximately 112,000 square feet of space in the U.S.,
Australia and the United Kingdom for use as veterinary reference laboratories and office space for our veterinary consulting
services. Of this space, 46,000 square feet is owned by us and the remaining amount is leased, under leases having expiration
dates up to the year 2012.

We consider that the properties are generally in good condition, are well maintained, and are generally suitable and
adequate to carry on our business.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

We are not a party to any material legal proceedings.

ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

No matters were submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year covered by this

ITEM 7.
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

We operate primarily through two business segments: the Companion Animal Group (“CAG”) and the Food and
Environmental Group (“FEG”). CAG comprises our veterinary diagnostic products and services, veterinary pharmaceutical
products, and veterinary information products and services. FEG comprises our water testing products,
dairy testing products and our production animal testing products. Additionally, Other is primarily comprised of corporate research and development, CEO succession charge and interest income.

BUSINESS OVERVIEW

The following is a discussion of the strategic and operating factors that we believe have the most significant effect
on the performance of our business.

Companion Animal Group

Our CAG segment accounted for approximately 79% of our sales in 2002 and is therefore our most significant
business. The largest product lines within our CAG segment are instruments and instrument consumables, laboratory
services, and rapid assays, which accounted for 43%, 24% and 22% of CAG revenues, respectively, in 2002. To date,
revenues from sales of pharmaceutical products have not been substantial. However, we are investing significantly in a


pipeline of companion animal pharmaceutical products. If we are successful in developing, obtaining FDA approval for, and
marketing these products, we believe that sales of pharmaceutical products will become a more material component of CAG
sales in the future.

By offering to companion animal veterinarians a broad range and an integrated set of proprietary diagnostic products
and services, therapeutics and practice management computer systems, we believe we have developed a strong customer
franchise, providing us a strategic advantage over companies with more narrow product or service offerings. Our
complementary products and services give us scale in sales and distribution in this market, and permit us to offer programs
such as “Practice Developer”, a customer reward that encourages purchases across multiple categories and builds customer
loyalty. By offering both point-of-care diagnostics for use in the clinic and outside laboratory services, we are able to
develop integrated disease management solutions that leverage the advantages of both point-of-care and laboratory testing. In
addition, by integrating our practice management software systems with our instruments and with our reference laboratories,
we enhance the veterinary practices of our customers by facilitating the flow of medical information in the clinic.

In the U.S., we sell instrument consumables, rapid assays and pharmaceuticals through distributors, and therefore
our reported sales of these products are sales made to distributors, rather than sales to veterinarians, the end users. Because
distributor inventory levels and purchasing patterns may fluctuate, sales of a particular product line in a particular period may
not always be representative of the underlying customer demand for the product. Therefore, we closely track sales of these
products by our distributors to the clinics (“clinic-level sales”), which we think provides a more accurate picture of the real
growth rate for these products. In the discussion of results below, we note certain instances where we believe reported sales
have been influenced, positively or negatively, by changes in distributor inventories.

Instruments and Instrument Consumables

. Our instrument strategy is to provide veterinarians within integrated set
of instruments (called IDEXX VetLab) that, individually and together, provide superior diagnostic information in the clinic,
enabling veterinarians to practice better medicine and build more profitable practices. We derive substantial revenues from
the sale of consumables that are used in these instruments. During the early stage of an instrument life cycle, we derive
relatively greater revenues from instrument placements, while consumable sales become relatively more significant in later
stages as the installed base of instruments increases and instrument placements begin to decline. Our long-term success in
this area of our business is dependent on our ability both to develop and sell new instruments with enhanced diagnostic
capabilities and to maximize customer utilization of those instruments, which creates more consumables sales.

We have a large installed base of VetTest chemistry analyzers, and substantially all of our revenues from that
product line are now derived from consumables sales, although we continue to place instruments through an active rental
program in the U.S. and through sales in Europe and Asia Pacific. As a result, the success of this product line is dependent on
increased customer utilization of those instruments. Toward that end, we seek to educate veterinarians about best medical
practices that emphasize the importance of blood chemistry testing for a variety of diagnostic purposes.

In the fourth quarter of 2002, we introduced our new hematology analyzer, the LaserCyte system, which provides
more extensive hematological diagnostic information than our original platform, the QBC® VetAutoread™ system. Our
success in growing hematology revenues over the next several years will depend upon our ability to sell LaserCyte
instruments, although we intend to continue to sell the QBC® VetAutoread® system. We do not intend to rent LaserCyte
instruments. At earlier stages in the life cycle of this product, a substantial portion of LaserCyte placements will be made at
veterinary clinics that already own our QBC® VetAutoread™ instruments. As a result, net consumables sales are not likely
to grow significantly in the near future, as we expect the increase in LaserCyte consumable sales to be largely offset by
declines in sales of QBC® VetAutoread™ consumables. However, we believe that the enhanced diagnostic capabilities of the
LaserCyte system will lead veterinarians to perform more in-clinic hematology testing, which will increase consumables
sales as our installed base of LaserCyte systems increases. In addition, since we produce the LaserCyte consumables, the
profitability of these consumables is greater than the profitability of the QBC® VetAutoread™ consumables, which we
purchase as finished products.

With all of our instrument lines, we seek to differentiate our products based on superior system capability, quality of
diagnostic information, reliability and customer service. Our equipment and consumables typically are sold at a premium
price to competitive offerings. Our success depends on our ability to maintain a premium price strategy. In addition, our in-clinic instrumentation competes with outside laboratory services for similar diagnostic information, and such services are
typically offered at a lower cost. Therefore, our success also depends on our ability to market the relative attractiveness of in-clinic diagnostic testing, versus less convenient and timely, but lower priced, laboratory testing.


Laboratory Services

. We believe that more than half of all diagnostic testing by U.S. veterinarians is done at outside
reference laboratories such as our IDEXX Laboratory Services laboratories. We attempt to differentiate our laboratory
testing services from those of our competitors primarily on the basis of quality, customer service and technology. Revenue
growth in this business is achieved both through increased sales at existing laboratories and through the acquisition of new
customers. Profitability of this business is largely the result of our ability to achieve efficiencies from both volume and
operational improvements.

Rapid Assays

. Our rapid assay business comprises single-use kits for in-clinic testing and microwell-based kits for
large clinic and laboratory testing for canine and feline diseases and conditions. Our two principal product lines are canine
heartworm products (which include the SNAP 3Dx heartworm antigen,

Ehrlichia canis

and Lyme antibody combination test)
and the SNAP FIV antibody/FeLV antigen combination test. Our rapid assay strategy is to develop, manufacture, market and sell
proprietary tests with superior performance that address important medical needs. As in our other lines of business, we
also seek to differentiate our products through superior customer support. These products carry price premiums over
competitive products that do not offer equivalent performance and diagnostic capabilities, and which do not include a similar level of support. We augment
our product development and customer service efforts with marketing programs that enhance medical awareness and
understanding regarding our target diseases and the importance of diagnostic testing.

Food and Environmental Group

Water and Dairy Testing

. Our strategy in the water testing business is to develop, manufacture, market and sell
proprietary products with superior performance, supported by exceptional customer service. Our customers are primarily
water utilities to whom strong relationships and customer support are very important. Over the past several years the rate of
growth of this product line has slowed from over 20% to approximately 10% in 2002. The decline in growth rate is the result
of increased competition and market penetration. International sales of water testing products represent 36% of total water
product sales and we expect that future growth in this business will be significantly dependent on our ability to increase
international sales. Growth also will be dependent on our ability to enhance and broaden our product line. Most water
microbiological testing is driven by regulation, and in many countries a test may not be used for regulatory testing unless it
has been approved by the applicable regulatory body. As a result, we maintain an active regulatory program under which we
are seeking regulatory approvals in a number of countries, primarily in Europe. We follow a similar strategy in marketing and
selling our dairy testing products.

Production Animal Services

. We develop, manufacture, market and sell a broad range of tests for various poultry,
cattle and swine diseases and conditions, and have an active research and development and in-licensing program in this area.
Our strategy is to offer proprietary tests with superior performance characteristics. Disease outbreaks are episodic and
unpredictable and certain diseases that are prevalent at one time may be substantially contained or eradicated. In response to
outbreaks, testing initiatives may lead to exceptional demand for certain products in certain periods. Conversely, successful
eradication programs may result in significantly decreased demand for certain products. The performance of this business,
therefore, can be subject to fluctuation. In 2002, approximately 64% of our sales in this business were international. Because
of the significant dependence of this business on international sales, the performance of the business is particularly subject to
the various risks described below that are associated with doing business internationally.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated
financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The
preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of
assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis,
we evaluate our estimates, including those related to customer programs and incentives, product returns, bad debts, inventories,
investments, intangible assets, income taxes, warranty obligations, restructuring and contingencies and litigation. We base
our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities
that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions
or conditions.

We believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments and estimates used in
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.


Inventory

Our inventories include material, labor and overhead, and are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market.
We write down inventory for estimated obsolescence when warranted by our estimates of future demand and market
conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those estimated by management, additional inventory write-
downs may be required, which would have a negative effect on our results of operations. Certain major components of our
inventory are discussed in more detail below.

Nitazoxanide

.Our nitazoxanide product for the treatment of equine protozoal myeloencephalitis  (“EPM”) is in
registration with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). We have completed the manufacturing, efficacy and
safety  components of our submission, and in February 2003 we submitted revised labeling and Freedom of Information Act
summary information as requested by the FDA. Our inventories as of December 31, 2002 included $8.4 million of inventory
associated with the nitazoxanide product, consisting of $8.3 million of active  ingredient and $0.1 million of other raw
materials. The $8.3 million of active ingredient included in inventory at December 31, 2002 will expire in 2005. In 2002 the
manufacturer of the active ingredient submitted additional stability data to the FDA, which supported extending the shelf life
of the active  ingredient from 48 to 60 months from the date of manufacture. Upon use of unexpired active ingredient in the
manufacture of finished goods, the active ingredient shelf life is no longer relevant. The shelf life of the finished goods is
measured from the date of manufacture, regardless of the age of the active ingredient used to manufacture the finished goods.
Based on stability data that we have submitted to the FDA, we believe that the shelf life of the finished goods will be at least
36 months if and when the product is approved by
the FDA.

We evaluate our nitazoxanide inventory on a quarterly basis for realizability. During the year ended December 31,
2002, we incurred no further write-downs for this inventory due to expected product expiration. Our quarterly evaluation is
based upon the expiration dates described, assumptions regarding the timing of FDA approval and our launch of the product
and assumptions regarding sales volumes that we expect to achieve following approval and launch of the product. We believe
that the product will be approved in late 2003 and launched shortly thereafter, that the worldwide market for EPM treatments
is approximately $50 million annually, and that our nitazoxanide product will capture approximately 25-40% of that market
over four years following launch. Should FDA approval be delayed beyond 2003 or should sales volumes be lower than those
assumed, additional active ingredient would expire and would need to be written off. For example, if FDA approval was
obtained in late 2003, but sales volumes over the next four years were fifty percent lower than anticipated, and assuming a
shelf life of 36 months for finished goods inventory, approximately $0.5 million of additional inventory would expire and
require a charge to operations.

If we do not receive FDA approval of the nitazoxanide product, and if we then elect to terminate our license to use
the active ingredient, we have the right to require our supplier to repurchase the active ingredient at a price equal to our cost.
We have no assurances that our supplier has the financial ability to repurchase all of this inventory. To the extent we were
unable to sell the active ingredient to our supplier, we would incur a loss in the amount of any unrecovered costs of the active
ingredient. This could result in a loss of up to the full value of our net inventory, or $8.4 million as of December 31, 2002.

VetTest® Slides

. Our inventories as of December 31, 2002 included $30.2 million of slides used in our VetTest
chemistry instruments, which represents approximately 1.3 turns based on recent historical usage. Most of the slides have a
shelf life of 24 months at the date of manufacture. The average remaining shelf life at December 31, 2002 was 16.9 months.
In addition, we are required to purchase a minimum of $232.4 million of slides over the remaining life of our contract with
Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, Inc. (“Ortho”), which expires on December 31, 2010, although our purchase obligation may be
extended at our option through December 31, 2011.

We evaluate potential losses over the life of the Ortho contract on a quarterly basis. Our quarterly evaluation is
based on an estimate of the value of slides that we are required to purchase under the contract but that will expire before sale.
The estimated loss is calculated based on the expiration dating described, and an evaluation of our minimum contractual
purchase obligations relative to assumptions regarding (i) the per-customer growth in demand for slides over the life of the
contract, and (ii) changes over the life of the contract in the size of our installed base of VetTest customers resulting from (a)
new VetTest instrument placements by us and (b) loss of customers who switch to other chemistry analyzers supplied by
IDEXX or its competitors. We have assumed that the rate of growth of end customer unit sales of VetTest slides, which grew
approximately 7% in 2002, will decline over the life of the Ortho contract due to the impact of the factors described
in the preceding sentence.


During the quarter ended September 30, 2002, we amended the contract with OCD to reduce our minimum purchase
commitment for both 2002 and the life of the contract by 30 million slides (or approximately $17.7 million) in consideration
for our agreement to forego approximately $2.0 million of certain volume rebates on slides purchased in 2002. As a result of
this amendment, we do not believe we will incur a loss on the contract and we have reversed the previously established
contract loss reserve of $0.7 million, of which $0.4 million was provided in 2002. However, if our assumptions regarding the
per-customer demand for slides or the changes in the installed base of VetTest instruments are incorrect, we could incur loss
on this contract. For example, if we experienced no per-customer growth in demand for slides
through the contract term, we would incur a loss of approximately $0.1 million.

LaserCyte hematology instrument

. As of December 31, 2002, our inventories included $8.3 million of component
parts and finished goods associated with our LaserCyte hematology instrument, which we began shipping to customers in
November 2002. In addition, we have placed $0.9 million in deposits with vendors to secure additional critical components
and we have firm purchase commitments of an additional $2.1 million. We expect to fully realize our investment and
purchase commitments. However, if we alter the design of this product, we may be required to write off some or all of the
associated inventory.

The nitazoxanide, VetTest slides and LaserCyte products are included in our CAG segment.

Valuation of Long-lived and Intangible Assets and Goodwill

We assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles, long-lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors we consider important that could trigger an
impairment review include but are not limited to the following:

•

significant under-performance relative to historical or projected future operating results;

•

failure to obtain obtain regulatory approval of certain products;

•

significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business;

•

significant negative
industry or economic trends; and

•

significant advancements or changes in technology.

When we determine that the carrying value of intangibles, long-lived assets and goodwill may not be recoverable
based on a change in events and circumstances discussed above, we measure any impairment based on factors such as
projected cash flows. Net intangible assets and goodwill amounted to $56.2 million as of December 31, 2002, consisting of
$23.7 million related to veterinary laboratories (of which $23.4 million represents goodwill), $15.8 million related to water
test products (of which $13.5 million represents goodwill), $14.5 million related to veterinary pharmaceutical products (of
which $13.7 million represents goodwill) and $2.2 million of other (of which $1.7 million represents goodwill).

In 2002, we adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 142 and as a
result, we ceased to amortize goodwill, but continued to amortize all other intangibles. We had recorded approximately $5.0
million of goodwill amortization on these amounts during the year ended December 31, 2001 and would have recorded
approximately $4.5 million of goodwill amortization during the same period in 2002, if the existing standards had been
continued. In addition, we recorded $1.5 million of other intangible amortization during the year ended December 31, 2001
and $0.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2002. In lieu of goodwill amortization, we were required to perform an
initial impairment review of our goodwill in 2002 and are now required to perform annual impairment reviews. No
impairment was found as a result of either our initial impairment review or our 2002 year-end review.

Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenue in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 101, “Revenue Recognition in
Financial Statements” (“SAB No. 101”). SAB No. 101 requires that four criteria are met before revenue is recognized. These
include (i) persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, (ii) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, (iii) the
seller’s price is fixed and determinable, and (iv) collectibility is reasonably assured.

•

We recognize revenue at the time of shipment (including to distributors) for substantially all products,
as title and risk of loss pass to the customer on delivery to the common carrier.


•

We recognize revenue on sales to leasing companies after the instrument or practice
information management

system is installed and the customer has accepted the instrument or
system.

•

We recognize revenue on sales of certain instruments after the instrument is installed,
where installation is

considered essential to the usability of the instrument, and the customer has accepted the
instrument.

•

We recognize service revenue at the
time the service is performed.

•

We recognize revenue associated
with extended maintenance agreements ratably over the life of the contracts.

•

We recognize revenue from non-cancelable software licenses and hardware systems upon
installation of the

software (and completion of training if applicable) or hardware
because at this time collection is probable and we

have no significant further obligations.

•

We recognize revenue on certain instrument systems under rental programs over the life of the rental agreement.

When instruments are sold together with extended maintenance agreements, we allocate revenue to the extended
maintenance agreement (the undelivered element) based on amounts charged separately to similar customers and recognize
those revenues ratably over the period of the agreement. The residual value is recognized as instrument revenue when
appropriate under the policies described above. Shipping costs reimbursed by the customer are included in revenue and cost
of sales.

We record estimated reductions to revenue in connection with customer programs and incentive offerings, which
may give customers future rights such as free or discounted goods or services or trade-in rights. We estimate these
reductions based on our experience with similar customer programs in prior years. Our distributors do not have the right to
return products.

We recognize revenue only in those situations where collection from the customer is probable. We maintain
allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required
payments. We base our estimates on our historical collection and write-off experience, current trends, credit policy, detailed
analysis of specific client situations and percentage of our accounts receivable by aging category. If the financial condition of
our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payment, additional allowances would
be required.

Income Taxes

We account for income taxes under SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes”. This statement requires that
we recognize a current tax liability or asset for current taxes payable or refundable and a deferred tax liability or asset for the
estimated future tax effects of temporary differences and carryforwards to the extent they are realizable. We record a
valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We have
recorded a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets that relate to international net operating loss carryforwards.
While we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the
need for the valuation allowance, in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in
the future in excess of the net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period
such determination was made. Likewise, should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net
deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such
determination was made.

We do not provide for U.S. income taxes on earnings of our subsidiaries outside of the U.S. As of December 31,
2002, we had unremitted earnings in subsidiaries outside the U.S. of $44.8 million, on which no U.S. taxes have been
provided. Our intention is to reinvest these earnings permanently or to repatriate the earnings only when tax-effective to do
so. It is not practical to estimate the amount of additional taxes that might be payable upon repatriation of foreign earnings.

Warranty Reserves

We provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized. Our actual warranty
obligation is affected by product failure rates and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure. Should
actual product failure rates or service delivery costs differ from our estimates, which are based on historical data and
engineering estimates, where applicable, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required. As of December 31,


2002, we had accrued $343,000 for estimated warranty expense. Warranty expense was $0.3 million and $0.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2002, respectively.

We launched our LaserCyte system in October 2002, and expect sales will increase in 2003 and beyond. We expect
that sales of this system will cause warranty expense to increase significantly in 2003. We will charge warranty expense to
the cost of LaserCyte sales based upon our experience with instrument sales and engineering information about the system.
Should actual warranty expense exceed our estimates, our cost of sales of LaserCyte systems would increase.

Companion Animal Group.

Revenue for CAG increased $18.8 million, or 6%, to $326.9 million from $308.0
million in the same period of the prior year. An increase in sales of laboratory services (approximately $7.3 million, or 10%)
resulted primarily from higher volume worldwide and, to a lesser extent, price increases in the U. S. and the impact of
currency exchange rates on sales at our laboratories outside the U.S.

An increase in sales of instrument consumables (approximately $6.2 million, or 6%) resulted primarily from
increased unit sales of VetTest slides worldwide and, to a lesser extent, the impact of currency exchange rates on sales
outside of the U.S. The increase in revenues was positively impacted by depressed 2001 sales that resulted from a late 2000 marketing
program that pulled sales into 2000. Revenues were negatively impacted due to a decrease in distributor inventories of
instrument consumables in 2002. We believe, however, that reported growth in consumables sales approximates the
underlying growth rate after adjusting for these two factors. Sales of LaserCyte, a hematology instrument introduced in
October 2002, contributed $1.9 million to the revenue increase.

An increase in sales of rapid assay products (approximately $3.1 million, or 5%) resulted primarily from increased
clinic-level sales of canine heartworm and feline test kits, offset primarily by the negative impact of changes in distributor
inventory levels (which increased $1.5 million in 2001 and decreased $3.1 million in 2002), and increased accruals on sales
of canine heartworm test kits due to higher customer participation in a5volume rebate program. After adjusting for these
changes in distributor inventory levels, sales of rapid assay products would have increased approximately $7.8 million, or
12%.

An increase in sales of veterinary practice management software and services (approximately $1.4 million, or 7%),
resulted primarily from higher volume of complete system sales, and increased hardware upgrade sales.

Offsetting these increases were reduced sales of our QBC

®

VetAutoread™ hematology instrument (approximately
$1.2 million, or 16%), primarily due to a shift in marketing and customer focus to the LaserCyte system. Sales of
pharmaceutical products decreased slightly due to a decline in sales of the Company’s ACAREXX feline ear mite treatment,
offset partially by increased sales of PZI VET insulin, which was launched on a commercial basis in 2002.

Food and Environmental Group.

Revenue for FEG increased $7.7 million, or 10%, to $85.8 million from $78.0
million for the same period of the prior year. An increase in sales of poultry and livestock tests (approximately $4.9 million,
or 22%) resulted primarily from higher unit sales of livestock products and, to a lesser extent, price increases on livestock
products and the impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside of the U.S. Approximately half of the increased sales of
livestock products were the result of government sponsored testing initiatives in Germany, which may not continue through
2003.


An increase in sales of water testing products (approximately $3.7 million, or 10%) resulted primarily from
increased unit sales volume in Europe and the Americas and, to a lesser extent, price increases in the U.S. A decrease in sales
of dairy testing products (approximately $0.8 million or 5%) was primarily attributable to lower unit sales volume as a result
of increased competition.

Companion Animal Group.

Gross profit for CAG increased $4.9 million, or 4%, to $142.7 million from $137.8
million in the same period of the prior year, primarily due to increased sales volume across the CAG product lines, partially
offset by a reduction in the gross profit percentage. As a percentage of CAG revenue, gross profit declined from 45% for the
same period in the prior year to 44%. The decrease in gross profit percentage was attributable primarily to foreign exchange
hedge contract losses in the current period compared to gains in the prior period; increased amortization due to additional
placements of VetTest instruments in our rental and trade-up programs; and a net unfavorable change in manufacturing
variances. These factors were offset partially by productivity improvements across CAG product lines, partly due to
increased revenue spread against the fixed cost portion of our expense base; the positive impact of the strengthening of the
Euro and British Pound on sales denominated in those currencies; reversal of an accrual for potential loss on our VetTest
slide supply agreement with Ortho as a result of a reduction in our minimum purchase obligations under the agreement; and
higher prices, primarily on laboratory services and feline test kits.

Food and Environmental Group.

Gross profit for FEG increased $4.5 million, or 10%, to $50.0 million from
$45.5 million for the same period in the prior year, primarily due to increased sales volume across the FEG product lines. As
a percentage of FEG revenue, gross profit was unchanged at 58%. Gross profit percentage benefited from a favorable mix of
higher margin poultry and livestock products, higher prices for water testing and livestock products, and the positive impact
of the strengthening of the Euro and British Pound on revenue. These increases were offset by higher inventory writedowns
of certain dairy products and royalty accruals on certain livestock products.

Operating Expenses

Total Company.

Total company operating expenses increased $0.1 million to $126.9 from $126.8 million for the
same period of the prior year. As a percentage of revenues, operating expenses declined to 31% from 33%. The following

Companion Animal Group.

Operating expenses for CAG decreased $4.5 million, or 4%, to $96.7 million from
$101.2 million in the same period of the prior year. This decrease resulted primarily from the impact of adoption of SFAS
No. 142 (under which the Company ceased amortizing goodwill); a reduction in severance and related costs; a reduction in
marketing expense associated with feline diagnostic products (due to a direct to consumer marketing campaign in 2001); a
reduction in bad debt expense; and savings from the consolidation of our pharmaceuticals and companion animal diagnostics
sales forces. These decreases were offset partially by increased spending on sales and marketing (including the unfavorable
impact of foreign exchange) to support higher sales volumes; litigation spending, net of a settlement received, related to the
Company’s patent infringement lawsuit against Abaxis, Inc. and S.A. Scientific, Inc.; and increased research and
development expenses.

Food and Environmental Group.

Operating expenses for FEG increased $1.1 million, or 5%, to $24.0 million
from $22.9 million in the same period of the prior year. Increased expenses resulted primarily from the write-off of non-
performing intangible assets (primarily associated with the 2000 acquisition of Genera Technologies Limited); higher
litigation, infrastructure and other administrative expenses; the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange; and increased
research and development expenses. These increases were offset partially by the impact of adoption of SFAS No. 142 and a
reduction in bad debt expense.

Other.

Operating expenses for other, which consist of $2.9 million in corporate research and development and $3.4
million in charges related to our Chief Executive Officer succession, increased $3.6 million to $6.3 million from $2.7 million
in the same period of the prior year. The increase resulted primarily from severance and related benefits provided in
connection with the retirement of our Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer in January 2002. Under an
employment agreement, we are required to make certain payments to our former Chief Executive Officer and provide certain
benefits to him following his retirement and the succession to our new Chief Executive Officer. During 2002 we incurred
charges under this agreement of $3.4 million, of which $1.8 million was non-cash.

Interest Income, Net

Net interest income was $3.0 million for 2002 compared with $2.2 million during 2001. The increase was due to
higher invested cash balances and the receipt of $0.3 million in interest on a domestic tax refund. These increases were
partially offset by lower effective interest rates.

Provision For Income Taxes

Our effective tax rate was 34% for 2002 compared with 36% for 2001. The reduction in the effective tax rate was
primarily due to the elimination of non-deductible goodwill associated with the adoption of SFAS No. 142.

Companion Animal Group

. Revenue for CAG increased $12.3 million, or 4%, to $308.0 million from $295.7
million in 2000. An increase in sales of veterinary reference laboratory services (approximately $7.7 million, or 12%)
resulted primarily from incremental sales associated with our acquisition of Veterinary Pathology Services Pty. Ltd. (“VPS”)
in July 2000 and from higher volume at laboratories in existence during both reporting periods. A decrease in sales of
VetTest slides (approximately $4.0 million, or 4%) resulted primarily from the negative impact of changes in distributor
inventory levels and a late 2000 marketing program that pulled sales into 2000 from 2001, offset partially by growth in


clinic-level sales. An increase in sales of canine test kits (approximately $2.1 million, or 6%) resulted primarily from
increased sales of our Canine SNAP 3Dx combination test, which we introduced in March 2001. Sales of ACAREXX in
2001 (approximately $2.3 million) were largely incremental to 2000 because we launched this product in December 2000.
In aggregate, unfavorable exchange rates negatively impacted total CAG revenue by approximately $4.6 million, or 2%.

Food and Environmental Group.

Revenue for FEG increased $6.3 million, or 9%, to $78.0 million from $71.7
million in 2000. An increase in sales of water testing products (approximately $7.4 million, or 25%) resulted primarily from
incremental revenue associated with the acquisition of Genera Technologies Limited (“Genera”) in August 2000. A decrease
in sales of dairy testing products (approximately $1.4 million, or 8%) was primarily attributable to the elimination of our
LacTek product in the second quarter of 2001, increased competition, and lack of product availability due to manufacturing
issues. A decrease in sales of food testing products (approximately $0.8 million, or 99%) was primarily due to the divestiture
of the food microbiology testing business in the first quarter of 2000.

Gross Profit

Gross profit for the total company increased 6.1 million, or 4%, to $183.3 million from $177.2

million in the same period of the prior year. Gross profit as a percent of CAG revenue decreased to 45% from 46% in 2000.
Improved margins on veterinary reference laboratory services and the veterinary practice information management software
product line were offset by our inability to absorb fixed costs as a result of delays in the launch of our nitazoxanide new
animal drug and our LaserCyte hematology instrument and by unfavorable exchange rates. The increased margins from
veterinary reference laboratory services were attributable primarily to cost savings from process automation and reduced
courier costs. The increase in margin from the veterinary practice management software product line was attributable
primarily to infrastructure reductions in our veterinary Internet portal and customer service operations.

Food and Environmental Group.

Gross profit for FEG increased $4.6 million, or 11%, to $45.5 million from
$40.9 million in the same period of the prior year. Gross profit as a percent of FEG revenue increased to 58% from 57% in
2000. The increase in gross margin percentage was attributable primarily to increased sales of higher margin water testing
products, including those products from Genera, partially offset by decreased margins on dairy testing products due to our inability to absorb fixed costs as a result of lower manufacturing volumes.

Companion Animal Group.

Operating expenses relating to CAG increased $1.1 million, or 1% to $101.2 million
from $100.1 million in 2000. The increase was attributable primarily to an increase in veterinary diagnostic sales personnel
and related overhead, offset by a decrease in expenses relating to our veterinary practice information management software
product line.

Food and Environmental Group.

Operating expenses relating to FEG increased $1.1 million, or 5%, to $22.8
million from $21.7 million in 2000. The increase was attributable primarily to incremental operating expenses and
amortization associated with the acquisition of Genera and a $1.5 million one-time gain on the sale of the food product lines
that was recorded as a reduction of operating expenses in 2000, partially offset by the elimination of operating expenses
associated with the food product lines.

Other.

Operating expenses for other, which consists of corporate research and development, increased $0.6 million
to $2.7 million from $2.1 million in the same period of the prior year. The increase resulted primarily from incremental
resources and related overhead expenses and lower allocated costs to CAG and FEG in 2001 compared to 2000.

Interest Income, Net

Net interest income was $2.2 million for 2001 compared with $5.0 million during 2000. The decrease in interest
income was mainly due to lower invested cash balances as well as lower effective interest rates.

Provision For Income Taxes

Our effective tax rate was 36% for 2001 compared with 37% for 2000. The reduction in the effective tax rate was
the result of continued realization of tax benefits resulting from business operations in jurisdictions with lower effective
income tax rates.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In October 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 144, “Accounting
for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets” (“SFAS No. 144”). Adoption of SFAS No. 144 is required for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2001. The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 144, effective January 2002.
The adoption of SFAS No. 144 had no material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

In April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145, “Rescission of FASB Nos. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB
Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections” (“SFAS No. 145”). SFAS No. 145 rescinds FASB SFAS No. 4, “Reporting
Gains and Losses from Extinguishment of Debt,” and an amendment of SFAS No. 64, “Extinguishments of Debt Made to
Satisfy Sinking-Fund Requirements.” SFAS No. 145 also rescinds SFAS No. 44, “Accounting for Intangible Assets of Motor
Carriers.” SFAS No. 145 amends SFAS No. 13, “Accounting for Leases,” to eliminate an inconsistency between the required
accounting for sale-leaseback transactions and the required accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic
effects that are similar to sale-leaseback transactions. SFAS No. 145 also amends other existing authoritative
pronouncements to make various technical corrections, clarify meanings, or describe their applicability under changed
conditions. Adoption of certain provisions of SFAS No. 145 was required after May 15, 2002, while other provisions must be
adopted with financial statements issued after May 15, 2002 or the year beginning after May 15, 2002. The adoption of SFAS
No. 145 did not have a material impact on the operations of the Company.

In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, “Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities”
(“SFAS No. 146”). This Statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal
activities and nullifies Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue No. 94-3, “Liability Recognition for Certain Employee
Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring).” Adoption of


SFAS No. 146 is required for exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. The Company does not expect
adoption of SFAS No. 146 to have material impact on its operations.

In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” (“SFAS No.
148”). This Statement provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of
accounting for stock-based employee compensation. Additionally, SFAS No. 148 amends the disclosure requirements of
Statement 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of
accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. We have adopted
the additional disclosure provisions of this statement required for the year ended December 31, 2002 and will include the
prescribed additional disclosures in our future filings on Form 10-Q.

In November 2002, the FASB issued FIN No. 45, “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for
Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others, an interpretation of FASB Statements No. 5, 57 and 107
and rescission of FASB Interpretation No. 34” (“FIN No. 45”). FIN No. 45 requires that a guarantor recognize, at the
inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken by issuing the guarantee. FIN No. 45 also
requires additional disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligation
under certain guarantees it has issued. The accounting requirements for the initial recognition of guarantees are applicable on
a prospective basis for guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The disclosure requirements are effective for
all guarantees outstanding, regardless of when they were issued or modified, for financial statements for interim or annual
periods ending after December 15, 2002. We have adopted the additional disclosure provisions of this statement required for
the year ended December 31, 2002 and will adopt the accounting requirements effective January 1, 2003.

In November 2002, the FASB’s Emerging Issues Task Force reached consensus on EITF No. 00-21, “Accounting
for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables” (“EITF No. 00-21”). EITF No. 00-21 addresses the accounting
treatment for arrangements that provide for the delivery or performance of multiple products or services where the delivery
of a product, system or separation of the multiple deliverables that meet certain requirements into individual units of
accounting that are accounted for separately under the appropriate authoritative accounting literature. EIFT No. 00-21 is
applicable to revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2003. The Company does not
expect the provisions of EIFT No. 00-21 to have a material impact on its results of operations or financial position.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

We fund the capital needs of our business through cash generated from operations. At December 31, 2002 and 2001, we had
$147.2 million and $79.6 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, respectively, and working
capital of $213.4 million and $164.2 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, we also had long-term investments in debt securities of $15.6 million and $21.0 million, respectively.

In connection with the acquisition of Genera in August 2000, we issued $8.3 million in notes payable to a former
shareholder of Genera, of which $7.0 million was secured by cash in escrow, and the remaining $1.3 million was unsecured.
In April 2002, we repaid $7.5 million, of which $7.0 million was paid from the cash held in escrow. The remaining
unsecured portion of $1.0 million is noninterest bearing, has been discounted to yield 6% and is due in three annual
installments, beginning in August 2002. The noteholder elected to defer the August 2002 payment of $0.5 million, which
now bears interest at 3% and is due on demand.

In September 2001 we entered into a $20.0 million uncommitted line of credit with a large multi-national bank.
Under the terms of this agreement the bank retained the right to approve all borrowings and all borrowings were due on
demand. Any borrowings under this line would have borne interest at the bank’s prime rate. This agreement expired in
October 2002. There were no loans outstanding under this agreement at the time of expiration. In January 2003 we entered
into a $15.0 million uncommitted line of credit with another large multi-national bank. Under the terms of this agreement, the
bank will retain the right to approve all borrowings and all borrowings will be due on demand. Any borrowings under this
line will bear interest at the mutually agreed upon rate at the time of borrowing.

Effective January 1, 2003, the Company entered into a workers’ compensation insurance policy where the Company
retains the first $250,000 in claim liability per incident and up to $1.2 million in claim liability in the aggregate. The
insurance company administers and pays these claims and the Company reimburses the insurance company for the
Company’s portion of these claims. The Company also agreed to issue a $450,000 letter of credit to the insurance company


as security for these claims. Previously, the Company was fully insured for workers’ compensation liabilities. We do not
expect that this change in insurance coverage will have an unfavorable impact on our total workers’ compensation costs.

We purchased approximately $15.1 million in fixed assets and $2.4 million in other long term assets during the year
ended December 31, 2002, principally related to the CAG segment. Our total capital budget for 2003 is approximately $19.8
million. Research and development expense as a percentage of revenue for 2003 is expected to be consistent with 2002
levels. Under certain supply agreements with suppliers of veterinary instruments, slides for our VetTest instruments and
certain raw materials, at December 31, 2002 we had aggregate commitments to purchase approximately $72.4 million of
products in 2003.

Cash provided by operating activities was $103.3 million during 2002. Cash of $16.3 million was provided by an
increase in accrued expenses attributable primarily to increased liabilities for marketing programs, payroll, taxes, royalties,
and the CEO succession charge. Cash of $11.4 million was provided by use of inventory already in stock.

During 1999 and 2000, the Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to ten million shares of our Common
Stock in the open market or in negotiated transactions. During 2002, we repurchased 1,000,000 shares of our Common Stock
for $29.8 million. As of December 31, 2000, 2001 and 2002, approximately 7,024,000, 7,614,000 and 8,614,000 cumulative
shares, respectively, had been repurchased under this program. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements.

We believe that current cash, short-term investments, long-term investments, debt facilities and funds generated
from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations for the foreseeable future.

FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS

The future operating results of IDEXX involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual events or results may differ
materially from those discussed in this report. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not
limited to, the factors discussed below as well as those discussed elsewhere in this report.

IDEXX’s Future Growth Depends on Several Factors

Our ability to grow our business in the future depends upon our ability to successfully implement various strategies,
including:

•

developing, manufacturing and marketing new products with new features and capabilities,
including pharmaceutical products;

•

expanding our market by increasing use of our products by our customers;

•

strengthening our sales and marketing activities in geographies outside of the U.S.;

•

developing and implementing new technology development and licensing strategies; and

•

identifying and completing acquisitions that enhance our existing businesses or create new
business areas for us.

However, we may not be able to successfully implement some or all of these strategies and increase or sustain our rate of growth.


The Markets in Which IDEXX Competes are Competitive and Subject to Rapid and Substantial Technological
Change

We face intense competition within the markets in which we sell our products and services. We expect that future
competition will become even more intense, and that we will have to compete with changing and improving technologies.
Some of our competitors and potential competitors, including large pharmaceutical companies, have substantially greater
capital, manufacturing, marketing and research and development resources than we do.

IDEXX’s Products and Services Are Subject to Various Government Regulations

In the U.S., the manufacture and sale of our products are regulated by agencies such as the U.S. Department of
Agriculture (“USDA”), U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
(“EPA”). Most diagnostic tests for animal health applications, including our canine, feline and poultry and livestock tests,
must be approved by the USDA prior to sale. Our water testing products must be approved by the EPA before they may be
used by customers in the U.S. as a part of a water quality monitoring program required by the EPA. Our pharmaceutical and
dairy testing products require approval by the FDA. Any failure to comply with regulatory requirements relating to the
manufacture and sale of our products could result in fines and sanctions against us or removals of our products from the
market, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

We have entered into an agreement with the FDA under which we have agreed, among other things, to perform
specified lot release and stability testing of our SNAP Beta-lactam products and to provide related data to the FDA. If the
FDA were to determine that one or more lots of product failed to meet applicable criteria for product performance or stability,
the FDA could take various actions, including requiring us to recall products or restricting our ability to sell these products.
Sales of dairy antibiotic residue testing products were $16.3 million in 2002.

Commercialization of animal health pharmaceuticals in the U.S. requires prior approval by the FDA. To obtain such
approvals we are required to submit substantial clinical, manufacturing and other data to the FDA. Regulatory approval for
products submitted to the FDA may take several years and following approval, the FDA continues to regulate all aspects of
the manufacture, labeling, storage, record keeping and promotion of pharmaceutical products. We have several animal
pharmaceutical products in registration with the FDA, including a nitazoxanide product for treatment of equine protozoal
myeloencephalitis and a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory for the treatment of lameness in horses. Failure to obtain, or delays
in obtaining, FDA approval for these products would have a negative impact on our future growth.

IDEXX’s Future Operating Results May Be Negatively Impacted by Various Factors

Factors such as the introduction and market acceptance of new products and services, the mix of products and
services sold and the mix of domestic versus international revenue could negatively impact our future operating results.

We sell many of our products, including substantially all of the rapid assays and instrument consumables sold in
the U.S., through distributors. As a result, changes in the timing and size of distributor purchases can result in lower revenue
for us because our revenue for each quarter is usually generated from orders received during that quarter. Our financial
performance, therefore, is subject to an unexpected downturn in product demand and may be unpredictable.

While our pharmaceutical products are under development, we may carry related active ingredients, other raw
materials and finished goods as assets on our balance sheet when recovery of the asset value from future sales is deemed
probable. To the extent that these inventories become unusable due to unanticipated delays in obtaining FDA approval for
these products, or to our failure to obtain such approvals, we may be required to write down those inventories, which could
have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.”

We are actively developing new diagnostic platforms, including new instrument systems. In connection with these
programs, we are developing production machinery and equipment. As of December 31, 2002, we had $4.5 million of these
fixed assets on our balance sheet. Were we to discontinue any such programs, we would be required to write off the
associated production machinery and equipment. Such a write-off could have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations.


We believe that more than half of all veterinary diagnostic testing occurs in laboratories. Although we have a
significant laboratory business, our in-clinic testing business is more material to our results of operations. If testing by
companion animal veterinarians generally were to shift towards increased laboratory testing and away from in-clinic testing,
this shift could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

Our expense levels are based in part on expectations of future revenue levels. Therefore, a loss in expected revenue
could result in a disproportionate decrease in our net income.

IDEXX’s Success Is Heavily Dependent Upon Its Proprietary Technologies

We rely on a combination of patent, trade secret, trademark and copyright law to protect our proprietary rights. If we
do not have adequate protection of our proprietary rights, our business may be affected by competitors who develop
substantially equivalent technologies that compete with us.

We cannot assure that we will obtain issued patents, that any patents issued or licensed to us will remain valid, or
that any patents owned or licensed by us will provide protection against competitors with similar technologies. Even if our
patents cover products sold by our competitors, the time and expense of litigating to enforce our patent rights could be
substantial, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

In the past we have received notices claiming that our products infringe third-party patents and we may receive such
notices in the future. Patent litigation is complex and expensive and the outcome of patent litigation can be difficult to
predict. We cannot assure that we will win a patent litigation case or negotiate an acceptable resolution to such a case. If we
lose, we may be stopped from selling certain products and/or we may be required to pay damages and/or ongoing royalties as
a result of the lawsuit. Any such adverse result could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

IDEXX Purchases Materials for Its Products From a Limited Number of Sources

We currently purchase certain products and materials from single sources or a limited number of sources. Some of
the products that we purchase from these sources are proprietary, and therefore may not be available from other sources.
These products include our chemistry and hematology analyzers and related consumables, active ingredients for
pharmaceutical products and certain components of our SNAP devices and water testing products. If we are unable to obtain
adequate quantities of these products in the future, then we could face cost increases or reductions or delays in product
shipments, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

The slides sold for use in our VetTest instruments are purchased under an agreement with OCD at fixed prices. Under this agreement we are required to purchase a minimum of $232.4 million of slides over the remaining life of the contract. To the extent that slides
purchased under the contract exceed demand for the slides, we may incur losses in the future under this agreement. To the extent that we are unable to
maintain current pricing levels on sales of slides to our customers, our profits on slide sales would decline because we purchase slides at fixed prices. See
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.”

International Revenue Accounts for a Significant Portion of IDEXX’s Total Revenue

Various risks associated with foreign operations may impact our international sales. Possible risks include
fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies, disruptions in transportation of our products, the differing product and service
needs of foreign customers, difficulties in building and managing foreign operations, import/export duties and quotas, and
unexpected regulatory, economic or political changes in foreign markets. Prices that we charge to foreign customers may be
different than the prices we charge for the same products in the U.S. due to competitive, market or other factors. As a result,
the mix of domestic and international sales in a particular period could have a material impact on our results for that period.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK

Our financial market risk consists primarily of foreign currency exchange risk. We operate subsidiaries in 13
foreign countries and transact business in local currencies. We attempt to hedge our cash flow on intercompany sales to
minimize foreign currency exposure.


The primary purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to protect against the volatility associated with
foreign currency transactions. Corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity. We primarily utilize
forward exchange contracts and options with a duration of less than 12 months. Gains and losses related to qualifying hedges
of foreign currency from commitments or anticipated transactions are deferred in prepaid expenses or accrued liabilities and
are included in the basis of the underlying transaction. As of December 31, 2002, the Company had $2.6 million in unrealized losses on foreign exchange contracts designated as hedges.

Based on our overall currency rate exposure at December 31, 2002, including local currency revenues and expenses, the impact of hedge contracts and balances denominated in a currency
other than the Company’s or its subsidiaries’ functional currency, a 10% strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign
currencies will reduce operating income by approximately $5.3 million and a 10% weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to
foreign currencies will reduce operating income by approximately $0.4 million. A 10% strengthening
of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies, excluding the impact of hedge contracts currently in place,
would reduce operating income by approximately $7.4 million and the effects
of a 10% weakening of U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies, excluding the impact of hedge contracts currently in place,
would increase operating income by approximately $7.4 million.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.:

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) at December 31, 2002, and
the results of their operations and their cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the
accompanying index presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein as of and for the year ended December 31, 2002 when read in conjunction with
the related consolidated financial statements. These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the
responsibility of the Company’s management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
financial statement schedule based on our audit. We conducted our audit of these statements in accordance with auditing
standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining,
on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. The financial statements and financial statement
schedule of the Company as of December 31, 2001 and for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2001
were audited by other independent accountants who have ceased operations. Those independent accountants expressed an
unqualified opinion on those financial statements, prior to the revision discussed in Note 1(d), and financial statement
schedule in their report dated January 24, 2002.

As discussed in Note 1(d) to the consolidated financial statements, effective January 1, 2002, the Company changed
its method of accounting for goodwill upon adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(“SFAS”) No. 142, “

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.

”

As discussed above, the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of December 31, 2001 and for each of
the two years in the period ended December 31, 2001 were audited by other independent accountants who have ceased
operations. As described in Note 1(d), these consolidated financial statements have been revised to include the transitional
disclosures required by SFAS No. 142, “

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

,” which was adopted by the Company as of
January 1, 2002. We audited the transitional disclosures in Note 1(d). In our opinion, the transitional disclosures for 2001 and
2000 in Note 1(d) are appropriate. However, we were not engaged to audit, review or apply any procedures to the 2001 or
2000 consolidated financial statements of the Company other than with respect to such disclosures and, accordingly, we do
not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on the 2001 or 2000 consolidated financial statements taken as a
whole.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. (a Delaware
corporation) and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000 and 2001, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001. These consolidated
financial statements and the schedule referred to below are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in the United States. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000 and 2001, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001, in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.

Our audits were made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic consolidated financial statements taken as
a whole. The schedule listed in the index to consolidated financial statements is presented for purposes of complying with
the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and is not part of the basic consolidated financial statements. The schedule
has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audits of the basic consolidated financial statements and, in our
opinion, fairly states, in all material respects, the financial data required to be set forth therein in relation to the basic
consolidated financial statements taken as a whole.

This is a copy of the audit report previously issued by Arthur Andersen LLP in connection with IDEXX Laboratories,
Inc.‘s Annual Report on Form 10-K filing for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2001. The inclusion of this
previously issued Arthur Andersen LLP report is pursuant to the “Temporary Final Rule and Final Rule Requirements
for Arthur Andersen LLP Auditing Clients,” issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission in March 2002. Note
that the previously issued Arthur Andersen LLP report includes references to certain fiscal years that are not required
to be presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31,
2002. This audit report has not been reissued by Arthur Andersen LLP in connection with the filing of this Annual
Report on Form 10-K. As described in Note 1(d), the Company has presented the transitional disclosures for 2001 and 2000 required by SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangibe Assets". The Arthur Andersen LLP report does not extend to these changes to the 2001 and 2000 consolidated financial statements. The adjustments to the 2001 and 2000 consolidated financial statements referred to in Note 1(d) were reported on by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as stated in their report appearing herein.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 OPERATIONS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) develop, manufacture and distribute products
and provide services for the veterinary, food and environmental markets. In the veterinary market, the Company develops,
manufactures and distributes biology-based detection systems, develops and distributes veterinary pharmaceuticals and
chemistry-based detection systems, provides laboratory testing and specialized consulting services and develops and
distributes veterinary practice information management software systems and provides related services. In the food and
environmental market, the Company develops, manufactures and distributes biology-based detection systems. The
Company’s products and services are sold worldwide.

The preparation of these financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, the Company
evaluates its estimates, including those related to customer programs and incentives, product returns, bad debts, inventories,
investments, intangible assets, income taxes, warranty obligations, restructuring and contingencies. The Company accrues contingent liabilities
when it is probable that future expenditures will be made and such expenditures can reasonably be estimated. The
Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable
under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and
liabilities that are not readily apparent form other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different
assumptions or conditions.

(a) Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, all of
which are wholly-owned. All material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.

(b) Inventories

Inventories include material, labor and overhead, and are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market.
The Company writes down inventory for estimated obsolescence when warranted by estimates of future demand and market
conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those estimated by management, additional inventory write-
downs may be required, which would have a negative effect on results of operations. Certain major components of inventory
are discussed in more detail below.

Nitazoxanide

.The Company’s nitazoxanide product for the treatment of equine protozoal myeloencephalitis
(“EPM”) is in registration with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). The Company has completed the
manufacturing, efficacy and safety components of its submission, and in February 2003 the Company submitted revised
labeling and Freedom of Information Act summary information as requested by the FDA. The Company’s inventories as of
December 31, 2002 included $8.4 million of inventory associated with the nitazoxanide product, consisting of $8.3 million of
active ingredient and $0.1 million of other raw materials. The $8.3 million of active ingredient included in inventory at
December 31, 2002 will expire in 2005.

The Company evaluates its nitazoxanide inventory on a quarterly basis for realizability. During the year ended
December 31, 2002, the Company incurred no further write-downs for this inventory due to expected product expiration. The
Company’s quarterly evaluation is based upon the expiration dates described, assumptions regarding the timing of FDA
approval and launch of the product and assumptions regarding sales volumes that the Company expects to achieve following
approval and launch of the product.

VetTest Chemistry Slides

. The Company’s inventories as of December 31, 2002 included $30.2 million of
slides used in its VetTest chemistry instruments. Most of the slides have a shelf life of 24 months at the date of manufacture.
The average remaining shelf life at December 31, 2002 was 16.9 months. In addition, the Company is required to purchase a
minimum of $232.4 million of slides over the remaining life of its contract with Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, Inc. (“Ortho”),

F-8

which expires on December 31, 2010, although the Company’s purchase obligation may be extended at its option through
December 31, 2011.

The Company evaluates potential losses over the life of the Ortho contract on a quarterly basis. The Company’s quarterly evaluation is based on an estimate of the value of slides that it is required to purchase under the contract but that
will expire before sale. The estimated loss is calculated based on the expiration dating described, and an evaluation of its
minimum contractual purchase obligations relative to assumptions regarding (i) the per-customer growth in demand for slides
over the life of the contract, and (ii) changes over the life of the contract in the size of the Company’s installed base of
VetTest customers resulting from (a) new VetTest instrument placements by the Company and (b) loss of customers who
switch to other chemistry analyzers supplied by IDEXX or its competitors.

During the quarter ended September 30, 2002, the Company amended the contract with Ortho to reduce its minimum
purchase commitment for both 2002 and the life of the contract by 30 million slides (or approximately $17.7 million) in
consideration for the Company’s agreement to forego approximately $2.0 million of certain volume rebates on slides
purchased in 2002. As a result of this amendment, the Company reversed the previously established contract loss reserve of
$0.7 million, of which $0.4 million was provided in 2002.

LaserCyte Hematology Instrument

. As of December 31, 2002, the Company’s inventories included $8.3 million of
component parts and finished goods associated with its LaserCyte hematology instrument, which the Company began
shipping to customers in November 2002. In addition, the Company has placed $0.9 million in deposits with vendors to
secure additional critical components and has firm purchase commitments of an additional $2.1 million.

(c) Property and Equipment

The Company records property and equipment at cost net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. When an
item is sold or retired, the cost and related accumulated depreciation is relieved, and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is
recognized in the statement of operations. The Company provides for depreciation and amortization using the declining-
balance and straight-line methods by charges to operations in amounts that allocate the cost of property and equipment over
their estimated useful lives as follows:

Asset Classification

The Company recorded depreciation expense of $11.5 million, $12.7 million and $15.2 million for the years ended
December 31, 2000, 2001 and 2002, respectively.

The Company assesses the impairment of identifiable intangibles and long-lived assets whenever events or changes
in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors the Company considers important that
could trigger an impairment review include, but are not limited to, the following:

•

significant under-performance relative to historical or projected future operating results;

•

failures to obtain regulatory approval of certain products;

•

significant changes in the manner of the Company's use of the acquired assets or the strategy for its overall business;

•

significant negative industry or economic trends; and

•

significant advancements or changes in technology.

Amortization of intangible assets excluding goodwill was $3.3 million, $1.5 million and $0.6 million for the years
ended December 31, 2000, 2001 and 2002, respectively. The Company continually assesses the realizability of these assets
in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets” (“SFAS No. 144”). If an impairment review is triggered, the Company evaluates the
carrying value of long-lived assets by determining if impairment exists based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows
over the remaining useful life of the assets and comparing that value to the carrying value of the assets. If the carrying value
of the asset is greater than the estimated future cash flows, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value. In determining
expected future cash flows, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which cash flows are identifiable and independent of
cash flows from other asset groups. The cash flow estimates that are used contain management’s best estimates, using
appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time. During the quarter ended September 30, 2002, the
Company discontinued development of a product based on certain technology acquired as part of the Genera Technologies

F-10

Ltd. acquisition. As a result, the Company recorded a charge of $0.5 million in general and administrative expense within the
FEG segment to reflect the impairment of intangible assets.

The change in goodwill noted above is a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company did not
acquire any goodwill in 2002.

In 2002, SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” (“SFAS No. 142”), became effective and as a
result, the Company ceased to amortize approximately $50.7 million of goodwill beginning January 1, 2002. The Company
had recorded approximately $5.0 million of amortization on these amounts during 2001 and would have recorded
approximately $4.5 million of amortization during 2002 if the existing standards had been continued. Under SFAS No. 142,
amortization of goodwill is replaced with periodic tests for impairment. The Company was required to perform an initial
impairment review of its goodwill as of January 1, 2002, under the transitional provisions of SFAS No. 142. Thereafter, the
Company is required to perform annual tests of its goodwill for impairment or additional tests whenever events or
circumstances indicate an impairment may exist. For its transitional and annual impairment test the Company identified its
reporting units, allocated assets and liabilities (including goodwill) to the reporting units and compared the reporting units’
net book value to their estimated fair value. No impairment was identified as a result of either the transitional or year-end
annual review. The fair value of the reporting units was estimated using a discounted cash flow approach. The cash flow
estimates used contain management’s best estimates, using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the
time.

Net income and earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 2001, adjusted to exclude expense
from amortization of goodwill (net of taxes), and for the year ended December 31, 2002 are as follows:

(e) Stock-Based Compensation

The Company measures compensation related to employee stock-based compensation plans in accordance with
Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees” (“APB No. 25”), and
elects to disclose the pro forma impact of accounting for stock-based compensation plans under the provisions of SFAS No.
123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” (“SFAS No. 123”). Accordingly, no SFAS No. 123-based employee
compensation cost has been recognized for these plans. Had compensation cost for the Company’s stock-based compensation

F-11

and employee stock purchase plans been determined consistent with the provisions of SFAS No. 123, the Company’s net income and net
income per common and common equivalent share would have been reduced to the following pro forma amounts

See Note 9 for discussion of the Company’s stock-based compensation plans and assumptions used in determining

(f) Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes under SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes”. This statement
requires that the Company recognize a current tax liability or asset for current taxes payable or refundable and a deferred tax
liability or asset for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences and carryforwards to the extent they are
realizable. See Note 2.

(g) Revenue Recognition

The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 101, “Revenue
Recognition in Financial Statements” (“SAB No. 101”). SAB No. 101 requires that four criteria are met before revenue is
recognized. These include (i) persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, (ii) delivery has occurred or services have been
rendered, (iii) the seller’s price is fixed and determinable, and (iv) collectibility is reasonably assured.

•

The
Company recognizes revenue at the time of shipment (including to distributors) for substantially all products, as

title and risk of loss pass to the customer on delivery to the common carrier.

•

The
Company recognizes revenue on sales to leasing companies after the instrument or practice
information

management system is installed and the customer has accepted the instrument
or system.

•

The Company recognizes revenue on sales of certain instruments after the instrument is
installed, where installation

is considered essential to the usability of the instrument,
and the customer has accepted the instrument.

•

The
Company recognizes service revenue at the time the service is performed.

•

The
Company recognizes revenue associated with extended maintenance agreements over the life
of the contracts.

•

The
Company recognizes revenue from non-cancelable software licenses and hardware systems
upon installation of

the software (and completion of training if applicable) or hardware
because at this time collection is probable and

the Company has no significant further
obligations.

•

The
Company recognizes revenue on certain instrument systems under rental programs over the
life of the rental

agreement.

When instruments are sold together with extended maintenance agreements, the Company allocates revenue to the
extended maintenance agreement (the undelivered element) based on amounts charged separately to similar customers and
recognizes those revenues ratably over the agreement. The residual value is recognized as instrument revenue when

F-12

appropriate under the policies described above. Shipping costs reimbursed by the customer are included in revenue and cost
of sales.

The Company records estimated reductions to revenue in connection with customer programs and incentive
offerings, which may give customers future rights such as free or discounted goods or services or trade-in rights. The
Company estimates these reductions based on its experience with similar customer programs in prior years. The Company’s
distributors do not have the right to return products.

The Company recognizes revenue only in those situations where collection from the customer is probable. The
Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to
make required payments. The Company bases its estimates on its historical collection and write-off experience, current
trends, credit policy, detailed analysis of specific client situations and percentage of its accounts receivable by aging
category. If the financial condition of the Company’s customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability
to make payment, additional allowances may be required.

(h) Research and Development and Software Development Costs

Research and Development costs are expensed as incurred. In accordance with SFAS No. 86, “Accounting for the
Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed” (“SFAS No. 86”), the Company evaluates its
software research and development costs for capitalization after the technological feasibility of software and products
containing software has been established. No software development costs have been capitalized by the Company because
costs eligible for capitalization under SFAS No. 86 have been insignificant.

(i) Foreign Currency Translation

Assets and liabilities of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries are translated using the exchange rate in effect at the
balance sheet date. Revenue and expense accounts are translated using a weighted average of exchange rates in effect during
the period. Cumulative translation gains and losses are shown in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as a separate
component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Exchange gains and losses arising from transactions
denominated in foreign currencies other than a subsidiary’s functional currency are included in current operations. Included
in general and administrative expenses are foreign currency translation losses of $0.6 million for each of the years ended
December 31, 2000 and 2001, and a foreign currency translation gain of $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2002.

(j) Derivative Instruments and Hedging

Effective in the first quarter of 2001, the Company adopted SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities” (“SFAS No. 133”). SFAS No. 133, as amended, requires that all derivatives, including forward
currency exchange contracts, be recognized on the balance sheet at fair value. Derivatives that are not hedges must be
recorded at fair value through earnings. If a derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair
value of the derivative are either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged item through earnings or recognized in
other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The Company immediately records in earnings
the extent to which a hedge is not effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value.

The Company enters into foreign currency exchange contracts of its anticipated intercompany inventory purchases
for the next twelve months in order to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on these transactions. The
Company’s accounting policies for these contracts are based on the Company’s designation of such instruments as hedging
transactions. The Company also utilizes some natural hedges to mitigate its transaction and commitment exposures. The
contracts the Company enters into are firm foreign currency commitments, and therefore market gains and losses are deferred
until the contract matures, which is the period when the related obligation is settled. The Company enters into these
exchange contracts with large multinational financial institutions. The Company does not hold or engage in transactions
involving derivative instruments for purposes other than risk management. The Company hedges less than the full value of
forecasted intercompany sales and thus no significant ineffectiveness has resulted or been recorded through the statement of
operations. As of December 31, 2001, the Company recorded $0.4 million in unrealized losses through accumulated other
comprehensive loss from foreign exchange contracts with 2002 expiration dates. As of December 31, 2002, the Company
recorded $2.6 million in unrealized losses through accumulated other comprehensive loss from foreign exchange contracts
with 2003 expiration dates. The foreign currency contracts, which extend through December 31, 2002 and 2003, respectively,
consisted of the following

December 31, 2000 and 2001, respectively, and foreign exchange losses of $2.6 million for the year ended December 31,
2002.

(k)

Disclosure of Fair Value of Financial Instruments and Concentration of Risk

Financial instruments consist mainly of cash and cash equivalents, investments, accounts receivable, accounts
payable and notes payable. Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk are
principally cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and accounts receivable. The Company places its investments in
highly rated financial institutions. Concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is limited to certain
customers to whom the Company makes substantial sales. To reduce risk, the Company routinely assesses the financial
strength of its customers and, as a consequence, believes that its accounts receivable credit risk exposure is limited. The
Company maintains an allowance for potential credit losses but historically has not experienced any significant credit losses
related to an individual customer or groups of customers in any particular industry or geographic area. The carrying amounts
of the Company’s financial instruments approximate fair market value.

Certain parts and finished goods are available only from one source. While the Company does not anticipate
difficulties in obtaining any of the components used in its products, the loss of any of these sources of supply would have a
material adverse effect on the Company.

(l) Earnings per Share

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of Common
Stock outstanding during the year. The computation of diluted earnings per share is similar to the computation of basic
earnings per share, except that the denominator is increased for the assumed exercise of dilutive options and other potentially
dilutive securities using the treasury stock method unless the effect is antidilutive. The following is a reconciliation of shares
outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per share

excluded from the calculation of shares outstanding for diluted earnings per share because they were antidilutive. Warrants
to purchase 806,000, 806,000 and 787,000 shares for 2000, 2001 and 2002, respectively, have been excluded from the
calculation of shares outstanding for diluted earnings per share because they were antidilutive.

(m) Reclassifications

Reclassifications have been made in the consolidated financial statements to conform to the current year’s
presentation.

F-14

(n) Comprehensive Income

SFAS No. 130, “Reporting Comprehensive Income”, requires companies to report all changes in equity during a
period, resulting from net income and transactions or other events and circumstances from non-owner sources, in a financial
statement for the period in which they are recognized. The Company has chosen to disclose comprehensive income, which
encompasses net income, foreign currency translation adjustments and the difference between the cost and the fair market
value of investments in debt securities and foreign exchange contracts, in the Consolidated Statement of Stockholders’
Equity. The Company considers the foreign currency cumulative translation adjustment to be permanently invested and
therefore has not provided income taxes on those amounts.

(o) New Accounting Standards

In October 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144. Adoption of SFAS No. 144 is required for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2001. The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 144 effective January 2002. The adoption of
SFAS No. 144 had no material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

In April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145, “Rescission of FASB Nos. 4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB
Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections” (“SFAS No. 145”). SFAS No. 145 rescinds FASB SFAS No. 4, “Reporting
Gains and Losses from Extinguishment of Debt,” and an amendment of SFAS No. 64, “Extinguishments of Debt Made to
Satisfy Sinking-Fund Requirements.” SFAS No. 145 also rescinds SFAS No. 44, “Accounting for Intangible Assets of Motor
Carriers.” SFAS No. 145 amends SFAS No. 13, “Accounting for Leases,” to eliminate an inconsistency between the required
accounting for sale-leaseback transactions and the required accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic
effects that are similar to sale-leaseback transactions. SFAS No. 145 also amends other existing authoritative
pronouncements to make various technical corrections, clarify meanings, or describe their applicability under changed
conditions. Adoption of certain provisions of SFAS No. 145 was required after May 15, 2002, while other provisions must be
adopted with financial statements issued after May 15, 2002 or the year beginning after May 15, 2002. The Company does
not expect adoption of SFAS No. 145 to have a material impact on its operations.

In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, “Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities”
(“SFAS No. 146”). This Statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal
activities and nullifies Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue No. 94-3, “Liability Recognition for Certain Employee
Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring).” Adoption of
SFAS No. 146 is required for exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. The Company does not expect
adoption of SFAS No. 146 to have material impact on its operations.

In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” (“SFAS No.
148”). This Statement provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of
accounting for stock-based employee compensation. Additionally, SFAS No. 148 amends the disclosure requirements of
Statement 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of
accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. The Company
adopted the additional disclosure provisions of this statement required for the year ended December 31, 2002 and will include
the prescribed additional disclosures in the Company’s future filings on Form 10-Q.

In November 2002, the FASB’s Emerging Issues Task Force reached consensus on EITF No. 00-21, “Accounting
for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables” (“EITF No. 00-21”). EITF 00-21 addresses the accounting treatment
for arrangements that provide for the delivery or performance of multiple products or services where the delivery of a
product, system or performance of services may occur at different points in time or over different periods of time. EITF No.
00-21 requires the separation of the multiple deliverables that meet certain requirements into individual units of accounting
that are accounted for separately under the appropriate authoritative accounting literature. EITF No. 00-21 is applicable to
revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2003. The Company does not expect the
provisions of EITF No. 00-21 to have a material impact on its results of operations or financial position.

(p) Warranty Reserves

The Company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized. The
Company’s actual warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a

F-15

product failure. Should actual product failure rates or service delivery costs differ from management’s estimates, which are
based on historical data and engineering estimates where applicable, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be
required. Below is a summary of changes in accrued warranty expense for products sold to customers for the year ended
December 31, 2002

(q) Contingencies

The Company has certain contingent liabilities that arise in the ordinary course of business, including
with respect to actual and threatened litigation and other matters. The Company had accruals of $3.9 million at December 31, 2002 for these contingencies.
However, the Company's actual losses with respect to these contingencies could exceed the Company's accruals.

(r) Guarantees

In November 2002, the FASB issued FIN No. 45, “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for
Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others an interpretation of FASB Statements No. 5, 57 and 107
and rescission of FASB Interpretation No. 34” (“FIN No. 45”). FIN No. 45 requires that a guarantor recognize, at the
inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken by issuing the guarantee. FIN No. 45 also
requires additional disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations
under certain guarantees it has issued. The accounting requirements for the initial recognition of guarantees are applicable on
a prospective basis for guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The disclosure requirements are effective for
all guarantees outstanding, regardless of when they were issued or modified, for financial statements for interim or annual
periods ending after December 15, 2002. The recognition of the provisions of FIN No. 45 are not expected to have a material effect on the Company’s
consolidated financial statements. The following is a summary of the Company’s agreements and obligationsthat it has
determined to be within the scope of FIN No. 45.

The Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that the Company will indemnify its
officers and directors to the maximum extent permitted by Delaware law. The maximum payment that the Company may be
required to make under such provisions is theoretically unlimited and is impossible to determine. The Company maintains
directors’ and officers’ liability insurance, which may provide reimbursement to the Company for payments made to, or on
behalf of, officers and directors pursuant to the indemnification provisions. The Company’s indemnification obligations were
grandfathered under the provisions of FIN No. 45 as they were in effect prior to December 31, 2002. Accordingly, the
Company has recorded no liability for such obligations as of December 31, 2002.

The Company enters into agreements with third parties in the ordinary course of business under which the Company
is obligated to indemnify such third parties for and against various risks and losses. The precise terms of such indemnities
vary with the nature of the agreement. In many cases, the Company limits the maximum amount of its indemnification
obligations, but in some cases those obligations may be theoretically unlimited. The Company has not incurred material
expenses in discharging any of these indemnification obligations, and based on its analysis of the nature of the risks involved,
the Company believes that the fair value of these agreements is minimal. Accordingly, the Company has recorded no
liabilities for these obligations as of December 31, 2002.

When acquiring a business, the Company sometimes assumes liability for certain events or occurrences that took
place prior to the date of acquisition. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to
make for such obligations is undeterminable at this time. All of these obligations were grandfathered under the provisions of
FIN No. 45 as they were in effect prior to December 31, 2002. Accordingly, the Company has no liabilities recorded for these
liabilities as of December 31, 2002.

Effective January 1, 2003 the Company entered into a workers’ compensation insurance policy where the Company
retains the first $250,000 in claim liability per incident and up to $1.2 million in claim liability in the aggregate. The
insurance company administers and pays these claims and the Company reimburses the insurance company for the

F-16

Company’s portion of these claims. The Company also agreed to issue a $450,000 letter of credit to the insurance company
as security for these claims.

(s) Advertising and Promotion Costs

The Company expenses advertising costs to sales and marketing expense in the period they are incurred.

At December 31, 2002, the Company had domestic net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $0.5 million
available to offset future taxable income. Net operating loss carryforwards expire at various dates beginning in 2003 through
2014. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 contains provisions that limit annual availability of the net operating loss carryforwards
due to a more than 50% change in ownership that occurred upon the acquisition of certain companies.

At December 31, 2002, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards in foreign subsidiaries of approximately
$1.8 million available to offset future taxable income. These net operating loss carryforwards expire at various dates
beginning in 2003. The Company has recorded a valuation allowance for the assets because realizability is uncertain.

At December 31, 2002, unremitted earnings in subsidiaries outside the United States totaled $44.8 million, on which
no United States taxes have been provided. The Company’s intention is to reinvest these earnings permanently or to
repatriate the earnings only when tax effective to do so. It is not practical to estimate the amount of additional taxes that
might be payable upon repatriation of foreign earnings.

NOTE 3 CASH EQUIVALENTS, SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS

Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of less than three
months.

The Company accounts for investments under SFAS No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and
Equity Securities” as available-for-sale. Investments are recorded at amortized cost and adjusted to fair market value through
other comprehensive income. Gains on sales of investments were $0.8 million and $0.1 million for the years ended December
31, 2000 and 2001, respectively. Gains on sales of investments were not significant for the year ended December 31, 2002.
Short-term investments, which have a cost basis of $12.9 million and $32.3 million as of December 31, 2001 and 2002,
respectively, are investment securities with maturities of greater than three months but less than one year and consist of the

NOTE 4 NOTES PAYABLE

In September 2001, the Company entered into a $20.0 million uncommitted line of credit with a large multi-national
bank. Under the terms of the agreement, the bank retained the right to approve all borrowings and all borrowings were due
on demand. Borrowings would bear interest at the bank’s prime rate. The agreement expired in October 2002. There were
no amounts outstanding at time of expiration.

In January 2003 the Company entered into a $15.0 million uncommitted line of credit with another large multi-
national bank. Under the terms of this agreement, the bank will retain the right to approve all borrowings and all borrowings
will be due on demand. Any borrowings under this line will beat interest at the mutually agreed upon rate at the time of
borrowing.

In connection with the acquisition of the business of Genera Technologies Limited in August 2000, the Company
issued notes payable to the former principal shareholder of Genera for $8.3 million, of which $7.0 million was collateralized by
cash in escrow, and the remaining $1.3 million was unsecured. In April 2002, the Company repaid $7.5 million, of which
$7.0 million was paid from the restricted cash. The remaining unsecured portion of $1.0 million is non-interest bearing, is
discounted to yield 6% and is due in three annual installments beginning in August 2002. The note holder elected to defer
the August 2002 payment of $0.5 million, which now bears interest at 3%. This payment is now payable on demand.

NOTE 5 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

The Company leases its facilities under operating leases which expire through 2012. In addition, the Company is
responsible for the real estate taxes and operating expenses related to these facilities. The Company also has lease
commitments for automobiles and office equipment. Minimum annual rental payments under these agreements are as

Under the terms of certain supply agreements with suppliers of the Company’s veterinary instruments, slides for its
VetTest instruments, and certain raw materials, the Company has aggregate commitments to purchase approximately $258.6
million of products through 2010. In addition, the Company has various minimum royalty payments due through 2015 of
$2.4 million.

From time to time, the Company has received notices alleging that the Company’s products infringe third-party
proprietary rights, although the Company is not aware of any pending litigation with respect to such
claims. Patent litigation frequently is complex and expensive, and the outcome of patent litigation can be difficult to predict.
There can be no assurance that the Company will prevail in any infringement proceedings that may be commenced against
the Company. If the Company loses any such litigation, it may be stopped from selling certain products and/or it may be
required to pay damages as a result of the litigation.

NOTE 6 STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY

(a) Preferred Stock

The Board of Directors is authorized, subject to any limitations prescribed by law, without further stockholder
approval, to issue from time to time up to 500,000 shares of Preferred Stock, $1.00 par value per share (“Preferred Stock”), in
one or more series. Each such series of Preferred Stock shall have such number of shares, designations, preferences, voting
powers, qualifications and special or relative rights or privileges as shall be determined by the Board of Directors, which may
include, among others, dividend rights, voting rights, redemption and sinking fund provisions, liquidation preferences,
conversion rights and preemptive rights.

(b) Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock

On December 17, 1996, the Company designated 100,000 shares of Preferred Stock as Series A Junior Participating
Preferred Stock (“Series A Stock”) in connection with its Shareholder Rights Plan. See Note 7. In general, each share of
Series A Stock will: (i) be entitled to a minimum preferential quarterly dividend of $10 per share and to an aggregate
dividend of 1,000 times the dividend declared per share of Common Stock, (ii) in the event of liquidation, be entitled to a
minimum preferential liquidation payment of $1,000 per share (plus accrued and unpaid dividends) and to an aggregate
payment of 1,000 times the payment made per share of Common Stock, (iii) have 1,000 votes, voting together with the
Common Stock, (iv) in the event of any merger, consolidation or other transaction in which Common Stock is exchanged, be
entitled to receive 1,000 times the amount received per share of Common Stock and (v) not be redeemable. These rights are
protected by customary antidilution provisions. There are no shares of Series A Stock outstanding.

NOTE 7 PREFERRED STOCK PURCHASE RIGHTS

On December 17, 1996, the Company adopted a Shareholder Rights Plan and declared a dividend of one preferred
stock purchase right for each outstanding share of Common Stock to stockholders of record at the close of business on
December 30, 1996. Under certain conditions, each right may be exercised to purchase one one-thousandth of a share of
Series A Stock at a purchase price of $200.00. The rights will be exercisable only if a person or group has acquired
beneficial ownership of 20% or more of the Common Stock or commenced a tender or exchange offer that would result in
such a person or group owning 30% or more of the Common Stock. The Company generally will be entitled to redeem the
rights, in whole, but not in part, at a price of $.01 per right at any time until the tenth business day following a public
announcement that a 20% stock position has been acquired and in certain other circumstances.

If any person or group becomes a beneficial owner of 20% or more of the Common Stock (except pursuant to a
tender or exchange offer for all shares at a fair price as determined by the outside members of the Company’s Board of
Directors), each right not owned by a 20% stockholder will enable its holder to purchase such number of shares of Common
Stock as is equal to the exercise price of the right divided by one-half of the current market price of the Common Stock on
the date of the occurrence of the event. In addition, if the Company thereafter is acquired in a merger or other business
combination with another person or group in which it is not the surviving corporation or in connection with which its
Common Stock is changed or converted, or if the Company sells or transfers 50% or more of its assets or earning power to
another person, each right that has not previously been exercised will entitle its holder to purchase such number of shares of
common stock of such other person as is equal to the exercise price of the right divided by one-half of the current market
price of such common stock on the date of the occurrence of the event.

F-20

NOTE 8 IDEXX RETIREMENT AND INCENTIVE SAVINGS PLAN

The Company has established the IDEXX Retirement and Incentive Savings Plan (the “401(k) Plan”). Employees
eligible to participate in the 401(k) Plan may contribute specified percentages of their salaries, a portion of which will be
matched by the Company. The Company matched $1.5 million for the year 2000, $1.6 million for the year 2001, and $1.6
million for the year 2002. In addition, the Company may make contributions to the 401(k) Plan at the discretion of the Board
of Directors. There were no discretionary contributions in 2000, 2001 and 2002.

NOTE 9 STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS

As discussed in Note 1(e), the Company accounts for stock-based compensation to employees in accordance with
APB No. 25, and elects to disclose the pro forma impact of accounting for stock-based compensation plans under the
provisions of SFAS No. 123. Accordingly, no SFAS No. 123-based compensation cost has been recognized for these plans.

In order to determine the pro forma impact under SFAS No. 123, the fair value of each option grant is estimated on
the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions used for the
grants in 2000, 2001 and 2002, respectively; no dividend yield for all years; expected volatility of 65% for 2000, 48% for
2001 and 55% for 2002; risk-free interest rates of 4.9%, 4.4% and 3.3% for 2000, 2001 and 2002, respectively; and expected
lives of 4.6 years for 2000, 5.2 years for 2001, and 6.0 years for 2002. At December 31, 2002, the options outstanding had

The Company's stock-based compensation plans are described below. Each of these plans, and any amendments thereto
increasing the number of shares issuable thereunder, was approved by the Company's stockholders.

1991 Stock Option Plan

During 1991, the Board of Directors approved the 1991 Stock Option Plan which, as amended, provides for grants
up to 6,475,000 incentive and nonqualified stock options at the discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Board of
Directors. Incentive stock options are granted at the fair market value on the date of grant and expire ten years from the date
of grant. Incentive stock options for greater than 10% shareholders are granted at 110% of the fair market value and expire
five years from the date of grant. Nonqualified options may be granted at no less than 100% of the fair market value on the
date of grant. The vesting schedule of all options is determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors at
the time of grant.

1991 Director Option Plan

During 1991, the Board of Directors approved the 1991 Director Option Plan (as amended, the “1991 Director
Plan”) pursuant to which Directors who were not officers or employees of the Company were eligible to receive nonstatutory
options to purchase shares of the Company’s Common Stock. The time period for granting options under the 1991 Director
Plan expired in accordance with the terms of the plan in June 1996.

1997 Director Option Plan

During 1997, the Board of Directors approved the 1997 Director Option Plan (the “1997 Director Plan”) pursuant to
which Directors who were not officers or employees of the Company received nonstatutory options to purchase shares of the
Company’s Common Stock. On May 19, 1999, this plan was terminated and replaced with the 1999 Director Stock Plan.

F-21

1998 Stock Incentive Plan

During 1998, the Board of Directors approved the 1998 Stock Incentive Plan (the “1998 Stock Plan”), which provides
for grants of incentive and nonqualified stock options at the discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Board of
Directors. A total of 4,100,000 shares of Common Stock may be issued under the 1998 Stock Plan as amended. Options
granted under the 1998 Stock Plan may not be granted at an exercise price less than the fair market value of the Common
Stock on the date granted (or less than 110% of the fair market value in the case of incentive stock options granted to holders
of more than 10% of the Company’s Common Stock). Options may not be granted for a term of more than ten years. The
vesting schedule of all options granted under the 1998 Stock Plan is determined by the Compensation Committee of the
Board of Directors at the time of grant.

1999 Director Stock Plan

During 1999, the Board of Directors approved the 1999 Director Stock Plan pursuant to which Directors who were
not officers or employees of the Company received shares of the Company’s Common Stock. A total of 80,000 shares of
Common Stock were issuable under the 1999 Director Stock Plan. In May 2000, the 1999 Director Stock Plan was
terminated and replaced with the 2000 Director Option Plan. As of December 31, 2000, 13,364 shares had been issued under
the 1999 Director Stock Plan, and the fair value of these shares of $0.4 million was charged to expense in 1999 and 2000.

2000 Director Option Plan

During 2000, the Board of Directors approved the 2000 Director Option Plan (the “2000 Director Plan”) pursuant to
which Directors who are not officers or employees of the Company receive nonstatutory options to purchase shares of the
Company’s Common Stock. Under the 2000 Director Plan each non-employee Director is granted an option to purchase
6,500 shares of Common Stock at each annual meeting of the Company’s shareholders. Options granted under the 2000
Director Plan have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the Company’s Common Stock on the date of grant,
vest fully on the first anniversary of the date of grant and expire ten years from the date of grant. A total of 200,000 shares of
Common Stock may be issued under the plan.

Summary of Outstanding Options

A summary of the status of the Company’s stock option plans as of December 31, 2000, 2001 and 2002 and changes
during the years then ended is presented in the table below

(in thousands, except weighted average exercise price)

:

As of December 31, 2002 a total of 1,436,629 shares of Common Stock were available for future grants under the Company's stock option plans.

Employee Stock Purchase Plans

During 1994, the Board of Directors approved the 1994 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, under which the Company
had reserved up to an aggregate of 300,000 shares of Common Stock for issuance in semiannual offerings over a three-year
period. During 1997, the Board of Directors approved the 1997 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, under which the Company

F-22

has reserved and may issue up to an aggregate of 420,000 shares of Common Stock in semiannual offerings. Also during
1997, the Board of Directors approved the 1997 International Employee Stock Purchase Plan, under which the Company has
reserved and may issue up to an aggregate of 30,000 shares of Common Stock in semiannual offerings. Stock is sold under
each of these plans at 85% of fair market value, as defined in the plans. Shares subscribed to and issued under the plans were
68,900 in 2000, 54,550 in 2001 and 53,000 in 2002.

Under SFAS No. 123, pro forma compensation cost is recognized for the fair value of the employees’ purchase rights,
which was estimated using the Black-Scholes model with the following assumptions for 2000, 2001 and 2002, respectively:
no dividend yield for all years; an expected life of one year for all years; expected volatility of 65% for 2000, 48% for 2001
and 40% for 2002; and risk-free interest rates of 4.7%, 2.2% and 1.2% for 2000, 2001 and 2002, respectively. Expected volatility of purchase rights under employee stock purchase rights is based on an expected life of only one year because shares are automatically purchased by plan participants at the end of each semiannual offering. The weighted-
average fair value of those purchase rights granted in 2000, 2001 and 2002 was $6.27, $7.07 and $6.95 per share,
respectively.

NOTE 10 SEGMENT REPORTING

The Company discloses information regarding its segments in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 131,
“Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information” (“SFAS No. 131”). SFAS No. 131 requires
disclosures about operating segments in annual financial statements and requires selected information about operating
segments in interim financial statements. It also requires related disclosures about products and services and geographic
areas. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available
that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or decision making group, in deciding how to allocate
resources and in assessing performance. The Company’s chief operating decision maker is the chief executive officer.

The Company is organized into business units by market and customer group. The Company’s reportable operating segments

biology-based test kits for veterinarians and develops products for therapeutic applications in companion animals. FEG
develops, designs, manufactures and distributes products and performs services to detect disease and contaminants in food
animals, food and water. In 1999 and 2000, the Company disposed of products and services for food microbiology testing.
Both the CAG and FEG distribute products and services world-wide. Other is primarily comprised of corporate research
and development, CEO succession charge and interest income and includes cash, short-term investments, long-term investments,
deferred tax assets and other miscellaneous current and long-term assets.
