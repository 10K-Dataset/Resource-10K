DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS BY SEGMENT

Prior to January 1, 2013, we operated primarily through three business segments: diagnostic and information technology-based products and services for the veterinary market, which we continue to refer to as the Companion Animal Group (“CAG”); water quality products (“Water”); and diagnostic products for livestock and poultry health, which we referred to as Livestock and Poultry Diagnostics. We also operated two smaller operating segments that comprised products for milk quality and safety (“Dairy”) and products for the human point-of-care medical diagnostics market (“OPTI Medical”). Financial information about our Dairy and OPTI Medical operating segments was combined and presented with our remaining pharmaceutical product line and our out-licensing arrangements in an “Other” category because they did not meet the quantitative or qualitative thresholds for reportable segments.

In 2013, we combined the management of our Livestock and Poultry Diagnostics, and Dairy lines of business to more effectively realize the market synergies between the product lines and to achieve operational efficiencies. We refer to this segment as Livestock, Poultry and Dairy (“LPD”). Our OPTI Medical operating segment remains combined and presented with our remaining pharmaceutical product line and our out-licensing arrangements in an “Other” category because they do not meet the quantitative or qualitative thresholds for reportable segments. The segment income (loss) from operations discussed within this report for the year ended December 31, 2012 has been retrospectively revised to reflect this change in the composition of our reportable segments.

See Note 1


to

the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31,


included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for financial information about our segments, including our product and service categories

and our geographic areas

.

The performance of our business is particularly subject to various risks that are associated with doing business internationally. For the year ended December 31, 2014, sales of products and services to customers outside

the U.S. accounted for approximate

ly 43% of our o

verall revenue. These foreign sales accounted for approximately

36%, 52% and 90% of revenue in our CAG, Water and LPD segments, respectively. See “Part 1, Item 1A. Risk Factors.”

and Note 14

to

the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31,


included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K

for more information on revenue from customers outside of the U.S.

COMPANION ANIMAL GROUP

CAG provides

to veterinarians

diagnostic capabilities and information management solutions that enhance the health and well-being of pets

. The breadth and complementary nature of our products and services comprise a unique competitive

advantage that we refer to as the IDEXX Diagnostic Advantage, providing veterinarians with the tools and services to offer advanced veterinary medical care. The IDEXX Diagnostic Advantage improves staff efficiencies and also enables the veterinarian to communicate the value of this medical care to the pet owner, which ultimately leads to

growing practice revenues.

CAG Diagnostics

We provide diagnostic capabilities that meet veterinarians’ diverse needs through a variety of modalities, including in-clinic diagnostic solutions and outside reference laboratory services. Regardless of modality utilized, veterinarians are provided with clinically relevant data which is integrated within our information management technologies. The result is a comprehensive view of patient diagnostic information that is easily accessible by both the veterinarian and pet owner.


Integrated Diagnostic Information Management

VetConnect PLUS

is a cloud-based technology that enables veterinarians to access and analyze patients’ data from

all of

IDEXX’s diagnostic modalities. These integrated diagnostic results provide the veterinarian with a visualization of patient-specific testing results, allowing the veterinarian to easily see and trend diagnostic results, enabling greater medical insight

and enhanced decision making

. In addition, VetConnect PLUS provides instant mobile or

browser-based

access to results, which can be printed or emailed to pet owners

and

other veterinarians. In this way, VetConnect PLUS can aid veterinarian

s

and practice staff in engaging the pet owner in the patient’s care, which can support greater compliance

with medical

recommendations or preventive care protocols.

VetConnect PLUS is currently available in North America, Australia, New Zealand, Israel and i

n numerous countrie

s throughout Europe.

In-Clinic Diagnostic Solutions

Our in-clinic diagnostic solutions are comprised of our IDEXX VetLab suite of in-clinic chemistry, hematology, immunoassay, urinalysis and coagulation analyzers, associated proprietary consumable products that provide real-time reference lab quality diagnostic results and a broad range of single-use, handheld IDEXX SNAP

rapid assay test kits that provide quick, accurate and convenient point-of-care diagnostic test results for a variety of companion animal diseases and health conditions.

The IDEXX VetLab suite includes several instrument systems, as well as associated proprietary consumable products, all of which are described below.

Additionally, we offer extended maintenance agreements in connection with the sale of our instruments.

Blood and Urine Chemistry

.

We

sell three chemistry analyzers,

the Catalyst Dx

Chemistry Analyzer, the Catalyst One Chemistry Analyzer and the VetTest Chemistry Analyzer, that are used by veterinarians to measure levels of certain enzymes and other substances in blood or urine for monitoring health status and assisting in diagnosing physiologic conditions. These three instruments use consumables manufactured for IDEXX by Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, Inc. (“Ortho”) based on Ortho’s dry slide technology. In addition, the Catalyst Dx and the Catalyst One analyzers also use dry slide electrolyte consumables manufactured by OPTI Medical Systems, Inc. (“OPTI Medical Systems”), one of our wholly-

owned subsidiaries, and other slides also manufactured by IDEXX. Blood tests commonly run on these analyzers in

clude glucose, alkaline phosphatase, ALT (alanine aminotransferase), albumin, calcium, creatinine,

blood urea nitrogen,

total protein

and many others

. Tests are sold individually and in prepackaged panels. All three analyzers also run a urine test called urine protein:creatinine ratio, which assists in the early detection of renal disease.

The Catalyst Dx and Catalyst One analyzers provide significantly improved throughput, ease of use and test menu relative to the VetTest analyzer (our original chemistry analyzer), including the ability to run electrolytes, phenobarbital and fructosamine. Key ease-of-use features include the ability to run a whole blood sample using an on-board centrifuge, the ability to run pre-packaged, multi-slide clips in addition to single chemistry slides and an automated metering system. These analyzers also enable automated dilutions, which is an ease-of-use feature both for certain blood chemistries and the test for urine protein:creatinine ratio. The Catalyst Dx analyzer allows a veterinarian to run multiple patient samples simultaneously and both the Catalyst Dx and Catalyst One run different sample types including whole blood, plasma, serum a

nd urine. In addition, the Catalyst Dx and Catalyst One analyzers run a test to measure

phenobarbital levels in blood, allowing veterin

arians to adjust anticonvulsant medication more quickly and efficiently

. Our

fructosamine test helps veterinarians to manage canine and feline diabetes mellitus, helping to assess insulin treatments and adjust insulin dosages. We launched a total thyroxine (“T


”)

test for use with the Catalyst One analyzer in February 2015 an

d

will be

introducing a similar

test

for use with the Catalyst Dx during the first half of 2015.

T


testing is essential to assessing thyroid function and is an accepted standard for baseline testing for both sick pets and preventive care in senior pets.


The Catalyst One analyzer, launched in November 2014, is engineered to deliver the same laboratory-quality results and real-time work

flow as the Catalyst Dx analyzer, offering an attractive in-house chemistry option when a single sample drawer is sufficient for a clinic’s work-flow requirements. The Catalyst One analyzer currently offers an expanding menu of 30 tests, including tests for thyroid disease, kidney disease, diabetes and therapeutic drug monitoring. Additionally, the instrument is the industry’s first to combine chemistry, electrolytes and T


in a single blood sample run.

We also sell two other chemistry analyzers, the VetLyte Electrolyte Analyzer and the VetStat Electrolyte and Blood Gas Analyzer. The VetStat analyzer runs single-use disposable cassettes that are manufactured by OPTI Medical Systems.

Sales of consumables for use in our installed base of chemistry analyzers provide the majority of consumables volumes and recurring diagnostic revenues generated from our installed base of IDEXX VetLab equipment.

Hematology

. We sell four hematology analyzers that assess the cellular components of blood, including red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets (also called a complete blood count). These analyzers include the ProCyte Dx

Hematology Analyzer, the first and only in-house analyzer to combine laser-flow cytometry, optical fluorescence and laminar-flow impedance in its analysis; the original LaserCyte Hematology Analyzer and next generation LaserCyte Dx Hematology Analyzer, launched in 2013, which both use laser-flow cytometry technology in their analysis; and the IDEXX VetAutoread Hematology Analyzer, our original hematology analyzer. In addition, the ProCyte Dx

Hematology Analyzer, the LaserCyte Dx He

matology Analyzer and the LaserCyte Hematology Analyzer each have the ability to analyze the components of certain body fluids. We also sell the Coag Dx Analyzer, which permits the detection and diagnosis of blood clotting disorders

.

The ProCyte Dx

analyzer is our premier hematology analyzer, which we launched in 2010. The ProCyte Dx analyzer provides significantly improved throughput and accuracy and more complete medical information relative to the LaserCyte, LaserCyte Dx and VetAutoread hematology analyzers. The ProCyte Dx an

alyzer provides up to 26 different blood parameters, including the ability to detect band neutrophils and nucleated red blood cells, for a more complete picture of a patient’s health. The ProCyte Dx is validated for ten companion animal species (canine, feline, equine, bovine, ferret, rabbit, gerbil, pig, guinea pig and mini pig) with research and development efforts focused on validating results for additional species. In

2012, we began to place ProCyte Dx

analyzers containing a more advanced and research-focused user interface with customers in the bioresearch market.

Immunoassay Testing Instruments

.

During the first quarter of 2014, we launched the SNAP Pro

Mobile D

evice

, whic

h automatically activates a SNAP test, properly times the run and captures an image of the result. This device improves medical care by allowing veterinarians to share the test results on the SNAP Pro Mobile screen, or via VetConnect PLUS

. In

addition, the SNAP Pro Mobile D

evice improves staff efficiency and ensures that all

SNAP test runs are captured and

entered into the patient record for customer billing.

With multiple-patient testing functionality, the SNAPshot Dx Analyzer provides quantitative measurements of total T


, cortisol and bile acids to assist in the evaluation of thyroid, adrenal and liver function,

respectively. The SNAPshot Dx A

nalyzer also reads, interprets and records the results of many IDEXX rapid assay SNAP tests, including our canine SNAP

4Dx Plus test,

feline SNAP FIV/FeLV Combo test, canine

SNAP

cPL

test, feline

SNAP

fPL

test, SNAP Feline Triple test

,

canine

SNAP

Heartworm RT test and SNAP Feline proBNP test.

Urinalysis

. The I

DEXX VetLab UA Analyzer provides rapid,

automated capture of

semi-quantitative chemical urinalysis and is validated specifically for veterinary use.


IDEXX VetLab Station

. The IDEXX VetLab Station (“IVLS”) connects and integrates the diagnostic information from all the IDEXX VetLab analyzers and thus provides reference laboratory information management system capabili

ty.

IVLS securely connects to the I

nternet, and in this way enables IDEXX to perform, through

its

SmartService Solutions

wireless services

, remote

instrument service and software

updates to IVLS and certain connected instruments. IVLS also sends all results created on connected instruments instantly to VetConnect PLUS

. We sell IVLS as an integral component of the Catalyst Dx, Catalyst One, L

aserCyte Dx and

ProCyte Dx

analyzers

, SNAP Pro Mobile Device

and also as a standalone hardware platform. The IVLS includes a touch screen user interface to simplify laboratory work flow, connect with a practice management system and send information to run the individual analyzers. IVLS also generates one integrated patient report incorporating all of the lab work generated by the IDEXX VetLab suite, stores, retrieves and analyzes historical patient diagnostics data, including SNAP test results, and sends and receives information from practice management systems, including the IDEXX Cornerstone system, as well as a wide variety of third-party systems.

The SNAP

rapid a

ssays

are single-use, handheld test kits that can work without the use of instru

mentation, although many kits may also be read and recorded au

tomatically by the SNAPshot Dx A

nalyzer or activated and captured automa

tically by the SNAP Pro Mobile D

evice as discu

ssed above. The principal SNAP rapid a

ssay tests are as follows:

Single-Use Canine Tests

:

·

S

NAP 4Dx Plus, launched during the second quarter of 2012, which

tests for the six vector

-borne diseases

;

Lyme disease,

Ehrlichia canis, Ehrlichia ewingii, Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Anaplasma platys,

and

canine heartworm;

·

SNAP 3Dx, which tests for Lyme disease,

Ehrlichia canis

and canine heartworm;

·

SNAP Heartworm RT, which tests for canine hear

tworm;

·

SNAP Parvo, which tests for parvovirus, a virus causing life-threatening damage to the immune system and intestinal tract;

·

SNAP cPL, which tests for canine pancreatitis; and

·

SNAP

Giardia

, which is a fecal test for soluble

Giardia

antigens, a common cause of waterborne infection.

Single-Use Feline Tests

:

·

SNAP Feline Triple, which tests for feline immunodeficiency virus (“FIV”) (which is similar to the human AIDS virus), feline leukemia virus (“FeLV”) and feline heartworm;

·

SNAP FIV/FeLV Combo Test, which tests for FIV and FeLV;

·

SNAP fPL, which tests for feline pancreatitis;

·

SNAP

Giardia

, which is a fecal test for soluble

Giardia

antigens; and

·

SNAP Feline proBNP, which uses a cardiac biomarker (NT proBNP) to test for stretch and stress on the heart.

Sales of canine vector-borne disease tests, including SNAP 4Dx Plus, SNAP 3Dx and SNAP Heartworm RT, are greater in the first half of our fiscal year due to seasonality of disease testing in the veterinary practice.


Outside

Reference Laboratory Diagnostic and Consulting Services

We offer commercial reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services to veterinarians worldwide, including customers in the U.S., Europe, Canada, Australia, Japan, South Africa and South Korea. We have large reference laboratories in Memphis, Tennessee and Leipzig, Germany that are strategically located near large courier hubs. Customers use our services by submitting samples by courier or overnight delivery to one of our facilities. Most test results have same-day or next-day turnaround times. Our reference laboratories offer a large selection of tests and diagnostic panels to detect a number of disease states and other conditions in animals, including all tests that can be run in-clinic at the veterinary practice with our instruments or rapid assays.

This menu of tests also includes a number of specialized and proprietary tests that we have developed that allow practitioners to diagnose increasingly relevant

diseases and

conditions in dogs and cats, including

parasites,

heart disease, allergies, pancreatitis, diabetes and infectious diseases.

Canine vector-borne disease testing volumes are greater in the first half of our fiscal year due to seasonality of disease testing in the veterinary practice.

In January 2015, we announced an upcoming kidney test SDMA, which utilizes a

new renal biomarker to detect the onset of canine and feline kidney disease

months or years earlier

than traditional methods. We anticipate offering SDMA as part of a standard chemistry panel in North America during the summer of 2015.

In the spring of 2015, we plan to

introduce

Hookworm and Roundworm antigen tests

to all fecal panels that

already

include the Whipworm antigen test. These new inte

stinal parasite panels detect

the p

resence of intestinal worms left undiagnosed by current methods,

find

ing

them

earlier in the infection cycle and therefore

enabling earlier disease diagnosis and treatment intervention.

Additionally, we provide specialized veterinary consultation, telemedicine and advisory services, including radiology, cardiology, internal medicine and ultrasound consulting. These services enable veterinarians to obtain readings and interpretations of test results transmitted by telephone and over the Internet.

In 2012, we acquired the research and diag

nostic laboratory (“RADIL”) business of the College of Veterinary Medicine from the University of Missouri. RADIL provides health monitoring and diagnostic testing services to bioresearch customers in North America, Europe and Asia.

Customer Information Management and Digital Imaging Systems

Customer Information Management

. We develop, market and sell practice management systems, including hardware, software and services that run key functions of veterinary clinics, including managing patient electronic health records, scheduling (including for boarding and grooming), client communication, billing and inventory management. Our principal practice m

anagement systems are Cornerstone, DVMAX Veterina

ry Practice Management Software and

IDEXX

Animana

.

W

e also support several

other

practice management systems installed with our customers, including IDEXX Better Choice, IDEX

X VPM,

IDEXX VetLINK

and BeeFree

. Our practice management services include Cornerstone Coaching, Practice

Profile,

VetVault Backup Solution, Payment Solutions and PetDetect Pet Identification System.

In addition, we offer services designed to strength

en

the relationship between the veterinarian and the pet owner. We commercially launched Pet Health Network Pro in March 2013, which is a subscription-based service that permits veterinarians to provide online communication and education to pet owners before, during and after each patient visit, thus strengthening the loyalty between a practice and its clients. Further, veterinarians can share VetConnect PLUS testing results directly with pet owners via Pet Health Network Pro. We also offer Pet Health Network 3D, an educational subscription-based service that replaces cumbersome plastic anatomy models with engaging, three-dimension anatomical animations on a desktop or mobile device.  Using this service in the exam room improves client communication and facilitates adherence to veterinarian recommendations.  In Sep

tember 2014, we acquired Petly Plans

, a cloud-based software solution for veterinary practices to customize, manage and monitor a range of monthly payment preventive care plans for t

heir pet owner clients.  Petly Plans

complements the Pet Health Network suite of client marketing services by making it easier for practices to increase access to

the

best care and offer plans that spread the cost of that care – including examinations, vaccines and diagnostics – over the

course of a year rather than payment in full upon each visit

. Certain of our services are compatible with non-IDEXX practice management systems.


Digital Imaging Systems

. Our digital imaging systems capture radiographic images in digital form, replacing traditional x-ray film and the film

development process, which generally requires the use of hazardous chemicals and darkrooms. We market and sell three digital imaging systems, our la

test generation IDEXX EliteVision Digital Imaging System, the IDEXX I-Vision CR and the IDEXX I-Vision DR system. The newly launched IDEXX EliteVision Digital Imaging System is a wireless system which uses advanced plate technology to capture clear, high-quality images in a short capture time.

The IDEXX EliteVision Digital Imaging

system

is promoted

for use as a portable unit in ambulatory veterinary practices, such as equine practices.

Our digital imaging systems

employ

picture archiving and communi

cation system (“PACS”) software,

IDEXX-PACS

,

allowing

for the viewing, manipulation, management, storage and retrieval of the digital images generated by the digital capture plate

. This software also permits images from our digital imaging systems to be integrated into patients’ medical records in the Cornerstone system, as well as transferred to other practice management systems. IDEXX I-Vision Mobile is an application that allows veterinarians with the I-Vision DR and IDEXX I-Vision CR systems, as well as our legacy digital radiography systems, to request, view and send images using an iPad

®

or an Android

™

mobile tablet. This application integrates with our IDEXX-PACS so

ftware. In November 2013, we launched the IDEXX ImageBank storage system, a cloud-based image storage solution which provides secure storage for an unlimited number of diagnostic images and is accessible anywhere through VetConnect PLUS.

WATER

We provide innovative testing solutions for easy, rapid and accurate detection and quantification of various microbiological parameters in water, helping to ensure water safety for billions of people around the world.

Our principal products are

the Coli

lert, Colilert-18

and Colisure tests, which simultaneously detect the presence of total coliforms and

E. coli

in water. These organisms are broadly used as microbial indicators for potential fecal contamination in water. These products utilize nutrient-indicators that produce a change in color or fluorescence when metabolized by target microbes in the sample. Our water tests are used by government laboratories, water utilities and private certified laboratories to test drinking water in compliance with regulatory standards, including U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) standards. The tests also are used in evaluating water used in production processes (for example, in beverage and pharmaceutical applications) and in evaluating bottled water, recreational water, wastewater and water from private wells.

Our Enterolert products detect the presence of enterococci in drinking, waste and recreational waters. Enterococci, bacteria normally found in human and animal waste, are organisms broadly used as microbial indicators for potential fecal contamination in water. Our Pseudalert products detect the presence of

Pseudomonas aeruginosa

in pool, spa and bottled water.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa

is a pathogen that can cause “hot-tub rash,” “swimmer’s ear” and potentially fatal infections in individuals with weakened immune systems

.

Our Filta-Max and Filta-Max

xpress

products are used in the detection of

Cryptosporidium

and

Giardia

in water.

Cryptosporidium

and

Giardia

are parasites that can cause potentially fatal gastrointestinal illness if ingested. We also

distribute certain water testing kits manufactured

by Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.

that complement our

Cryptosporidium

and

Giardi

a

t

esting products.

Our Quanti-Tray products, when used in conjunction with our Colil

ert, Colilert-18,

Colisure, Enterolert, Pseudalert or Heterotrophic Plate Count (HPC) products, provide users quantitative measurements of microbial contamination rather than a presence/absence indication. Our SimPlate for HPC product detects the total number of the most common bacteria in a water sample.

We also sell consumables, parts and accessories to be used with many of our water testing products.


LIVESTOCK, POULTRY and dairy

We sell diagnostic tests and related instrumentation that are used to manage the health status of livestock and poultry, to improve bovine reproductive efficiency, and to ensure the quality and safety of milk and food. Our livestock and poultry diagnostic p

roducts are purchased by government and private laboratories that provide testing services to cattle, swine and poultry veterinarians, producers and processors. Our principal livestock and poultry diagnostic products include tests for Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus (“BVDV”) and Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (“PRRS”). BVDV is a common and contagious viral infection that suppresses the immune system, making the ani

mal susceptible to a host of other infections, impacting beef and dairy production yields as a result. PRRS is a contagious virus causing reproductive problems and respiratory diseases in swine. In the fourth quarter of 2012, we launched pregnancy tests for detecting pregnancy in bovine, which provides a means to optimize reproductive efficiency.

Our principal dairy products use our SNAP test format and are used by dairy producers and processors worldwide to detect antibiotic drug residue in milk. Our primary product line is SNAP Beta-Lactam

ST

, which detects penicillin, amoxicillin, a

mpicillin, ceftiofur

and cephapirin residues, followed by SNAPduo Beta-Tetra

ST

, which detects certain tetracycline antibiotic residues in addition to those detected by the SNAP Beta Lactam test kits. We also sell SNAP

tests for the detection of certain other contaminants in milk, such as Aflatoxin M1.

In the third quarter of 2013, we acquired a Brazilian distributor of certain of our Livestock, Poultry and Dairy products. As part of this acquisition, we acquired the right to distribute product lines of food safety products which provide microbial monitoring and drug residue tests for bovine, poultry and swine producers, meat exporters and pharmaceutical companies.

OTHER

OPTI Medical Systems

Through OPTI

Medical Systems, we sell point-of-care analyzers and related consumables for use in human medical hospitals and clinics to measure electrolytes, blood gases, acid-base balance, glucose, lactate, blood urea nitrogen and ionized calcium, and to calculate other parameters such as base excess and anion gap. These OPTI analyzers are used primarily in emergency rooms, operating rooms, cardiac monitoring areas and other locations where time-critical diagnostic testing is performed within the hospital setting. Our latest generation OPTI CCA-TS2 Blood Gas and Electrolyte Analyzer,

which

launched

in

April 2013, contains many new features relative to previous generation blood gas analyzers including customized work flows, faster time to result, improved communication and a multi-level electronic control. Similar to our earlier generation OPTI CCA and OPTI Touch Electrolyte Analyzers, the OPTI CCA-TS2 runs whole blood, plasma and serum samples on single-use disposable cassettes that contain various configurations of analytes. The OPTI R Analyzer runs reusable cassettes in various analyte configurations, and the OPTI LION Stat Electrolyte Analyzer runs single-use electrolyte cassettes.

In addition,

OPTI Medical Systems manufactures our

VetStat analyzer, an

instrument and consumable system that is a member of the IDEXX

VetLab

suite for the veterinary market, and provides the electrolyte module and dry slide reagents that make up the electrolyte testing functionality of the

Catalyst

analyzer

s

for our CAG segment

.

Other Activities

In the fourth quarter of 2008, we sold our

Acarexx

®

and

SURPASS

®

veterinary pharmaceutical products and a feline insulin product under development. Upon completion of this transaction we restructured the remaining pharmaceutical division and realigned two of our pharmaceutical product lines to the Rapid Assay line of business, which is part of CAG, and realigned the remainder of the products, comprised of one product line and two out-licensing arrangements, to the Other segment. We retained certain drug delivery technologies that we continue to seek t

o commercialize through agreements with third parties, such as pharmaceutical companies, that are also included in the Other segment.


We earned a milestone payment of $3.5 million in 2012 in connection with the achievement of certain sales milestones by the acquirer of our feline insulin product following commercialization of that product.

S

ee Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2014, included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for additional information regarding the restructuring of our pharmaceutical business. Since realignment to the Rapid Assay line of business, we have discontinued the production and sale of the two remaining pharmaceutical product lines. Neither of these product lines is or was a significant contributor to revenue in the Rapid Assay line of business.

MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION

We market, sell and service our products worldwide through our marketing,

customer service,

sales and technical service groups, as well as through independent distributors and other resellers. We maintain sales offices outside the U.S. in all major regions, including Africa, Asia Pacific, Canada, Europe and Latin America.

Generally, we select the appropriate distribution channel for our products based on the type of product, technical s

ervice requirements, number and concentration of customers, regulatory requirements and other factors. Effective January 1, 2015, we market our companion animal diagnostic products to veterinarians directly in the U.S.

We market our Water and LPD products primarily through our direct sales force in the U.S. and Canada. Outside the U.S. and Canada, we market these products through selected independent distributors and, in certain countries, through our direct sales force. We sell our OPTI electrolyte and blood gas analyzers both directly and through independent human medical product distributors in the U.S. and we sell most of the related consumables through the distribution channel. Outside the U.S., we sell our OPTI products primarily through distributors and other resellers.

Historically, our largest customers have been

the U.S. distributors of our products in the CAG segment. Our

two largest CAG distributors were

Henry Schein Animal Health Supply, LLC (“Henry Schei

n”) and MWI Veterinary Supply, Inc. (“MWI”). Henry Schein accounted for 8% of our 2014 revenue and 9% of our 2013 and 2012 revenue, and


% and 7% of our net accounts receivable at December 31, 2014 and 2013

, respectively

. MWI accounted for 8% of our 2014, 2013 and 2012 revenue and


% and 11% of our net accounts receivable at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

Effective January 1, 2015, most U.S. distributors are no longer our customers as a result of o

ur transition to an all-direct sa

les strategy in the U.S.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

Our business includes the development and introduction of new products and services and may involve entry into new business areas. We maintain active research and development programs in each of our business areas. Our research and development expenses, which consist of salaries, employee benefits, materials and external consulting and development costs

, were $98.3 million, $88.0 million and $82.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, or 6.6%, 6.4% and 6.3% of our consolidated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.


PATENTS AND LICENSES

We actively seek to obtain patent protection in the U.S. and other countries for inventions covering our products and technologies. We also license patents and technologies from third parties.

Patents and licenses of patents and technologies from third parties are considered important to the Company based on a variety of factors, including providing protection for the Company’s inventions and other proprietary intellectual property, affording protection from competitors in certain markets, enabling the use of more effective and efficient technologies in the development and production of our product

s and offerings, strengthening the Company’s reputation and standing among customers, employees and key suppliers, and acting as a deterrent against counterfeiters, imitators and other copiers of technologies.

Important patents and licenses include:

·

Patents concerning the SNAP immunoassay platform that expire in 2015

;

·

Exclusive licenses from the University of Texas and Tulane University to patents that expire in 2017 and 2019, respectively, relating to reagents and methods for the detection of Lyme disease utilized in certain of our SNAP products and a reference laboratory diagnostic test;

·

A

n exclusive license from Cornell University to patents covering methods for detecting BVDV that expire beginning in 2017;

·

Patents relating to reagents and methods for the detection of

Anaplasma phagocytophilum

utilized in certain of our SNAP produc

ts that expire beginning in 2017

;

·

Patents relating to reagents and methods for the detection of

Ehrlichia canis

utilized in certain of our SNAP produc

ts that expire beginning in 2019

;

·

A p

atent concerning LaserCyte consumables that expires in 2020;

·

Patents concerning Catalyst

consumables that expire beginning in 2023; and

·

Patents

concerning Catalyst instruments that expire in 2026.

While we consider these proprietary technology rights to be important to the Company

, a range of factors help to mitigate the future effects of patent and license expiration on our results of operations and financial position. These factors include

our brand strength and reputation in the marketplace; the breadth, quality and integration of our product offerings; our existing customer relationships and our customer support; our sales force; the applicable regulatory approval status for certain products; our continued investments in innovative product improvements that often result in new technologies and/or additional patents;

our

significant know-how, scale and investments related to manufacturing processes of associated product offerings and certain supply arrangements for consumables that are compatible with our instruments.

Although the Company had and will have

several patents

expire during

2014 and


,

the expiration of these patents, individually or in the aggregate, is not expected to have a material effect on the Company’s financial position or future operations.

In addition

, we already face notable competition in certain areas as other companies have been successful in bringing competitive products to market, despite the protections afforded by these proprietary technology rights

.

To the extent some of our products may now or in the future embody technologies protected by patents, copyrights or trade secrets of others, we may be required to obtain licenses to such technologies in order to continue to sell our products. These licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our failure to obtain any

such licenses may delay or prevent the sale of certain new or existing products. See “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.”

PRODUCTION AND SUPPLY

Many of the instruments that we sell are manufactured by third parties and we rely on third parties to supply us with certain important components, raw materials and consumables used in or with our products. In some cases these third parties are sole or single source suppliers.

Instruments and consumables

. Significant products supplied by sole and single source providers include VetTest

analyzers and consumables,

Catalyst Dx and Catalyst One

consumables (other than electrolyte consumables and the fructosamine and T


slides), LaserCyte

and

LaserCyte Dx consumables, VetAutoread, VetLyte and ProCyte Dx analyzers and consumables and components of our SNAP Pro Mobile Device.


VetTest and Catalyst chemistry slides are supplied by Ortho under supply agreements that are currently set to expire at the end of 2028. We are required to purchase all of our requirements for our current menu of VetTest

and

Catalyst

chemistry slides from Ortho to the extent Ortho is able to supply those requirements. The agreements provide for pricing based on purchase volumes and a fixed annual inflationary adjustment. The agreements also prohibit Ortho from promoting and selling these chemistry slides in the veterinary market other than to IDEXX.

We purchase other analyzers and consumables under supply agreements with terms extending through 2032, which in some cases may be extended at our option. We have minimum purchase obligations under some of these agreements, and our failure to satisfy these obligations may result in loss of some or all of our rights under these agreements. See “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.”

Other components

. We purchase certain other products, raw materials and components from sole and single source suppliers. These products include certain digital radiography systems and certain components used in our SNAP rapid assay and dairy devices, livestock and poultry testing kits and water testing products.

Certain components incorporated into our SNAP products and certain livestock and poultry testing kits are supplied by Moss, Inc. (“Moss”) under a supply agreement that either party may terminate with 24 months prior written notice. Pursuant to the terms of the supply agreement, Moss has escrowed its manufacturing information relating to the components, which may be released to us upon certain triggering events that would render Moss incapable of supplying the components to us. If such a triggering event occurs, we will make royalty payments to Moss for the use of such information until Moss is able to again begin manufacturing.

We have been successful in ensuring an uninterrupted supply of products purchased from sole and single source suppliers. However, there can be no assurance that uninterrupted supply can be maintained if these agreements terminate for any reason or our suppliers otherwise are unable to satisfy our requirements for products. See “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.”

BACKLOG

We do not generally maintain significant backlog

orders

and believe that our backlog at any particular date historically has not been indicative of future sales.

COMPETITION

We compete with many companies ranging from large human pharmaceutical and medical diagnostics companies to small businesses focused on animal health. Our companion animal veterinary diagnostic products and services compete with both reference laboratory service and in-clinic product providers. Our competitors vary in our different markets. In some markets, academic institutions, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations conduct research activities and may commercialize products or services which could compete with our products, on their own or through joint ventures. Se

veral of our direct and potential

competitors have substantially greater capital, manufacturing, marketing, and research and development resources than we do.

Competitive factors in our different business areas are detailed below:

·

Companion animal diagnostic offerings.

We compete primarily on the basis of ease of use and speed of our products, diagnostic accuracy, product quality, breadth of our product line and services, technology, information management capability, availability of medical consultation, effectiveness of our sales and distribution channels, quality of our technical and customer service and our pricing relative to the value of our products and services in comparison with competitive products and services. Our major competitors in most geographic locations in North America are Antech Di

. We compete primarily on the basis of functionality, connectivity to equipment and other systems, performance characteristics, effectiveness of our implementation, training process and customer service, information handling capabilities, advances in technologies and our pricing relative to the value of our products and services. We sell these products primarily in North America where our largest competitor is Henry Schein.

·

Electrolyte and blood gas analyzers for the human point-of-care medical diagnostics market

. We compete primarily on the basis of the ease of use, menu, convenience, international distribution and service, instrument reliability, and our pricing relative to the value of our products. We compete primarily with large human medical diagnostics companies such as Radiometer A/S, Siemens Medical Solutions Diagnostics, Instrumentation Laboratory Company, Abbott Diagnostics, a division of Abbott Laboratories and Roche Diagnostics Corporation.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION

Many of ou

r products are subject to comprehensive regulation by U.S. and foreign regulatory agencies that relate to, among other things, product approvals, manufacturing, distribution, marketing and promotion, labeling, recordkeeping, testing, quality, storage and product disposal. The following is a description of the principal regulations affecting our businesses.

Veterinary diagnostic products

. Diagnostic tests for animal health infectious diseases, including most of our livestock and poultry products and our rapid assay products, are regulated in the U.S. by the Center for Veterinary Biologics within the United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (“APHIS”). These products must be approved by APHIS before they may be sold in the U.S. The APHIS regulatory approval process involves the submission of product performance data and manufacturing documentation. Following regulatory approval to market a product, APHIS requires that each lot of product be submitted for review before release to customers. In addition, APHIS requires special approval to market products where test results are used in part for government-mandated disease management programs. A number of foreign governments accept APHIS approval as part of their separate regulatory approvals. However, compliance with an extensive regulatory process is required in connection with marketing diagnostic products in Japan, Germany, the Netherlands and many other countries. We also are required to have a facility license from APHIS to manufacture USDA-licensed products. We have a facility license for our manufacturing facility in Westbrook, Maine and our distribution center in Memphis, Tennessee. Our manufacturing facility in Montpellier, France has been approved by APHIS and we have a permit to import products manufactured in Montpellier, France to the U.S. for distribution.

Our veterinary diagnostic instrument systems are veterinary medical devices regulated by

the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“

FDA”) under the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act (the “FDC Act”). While the sale of these products does not require premarket approval by the FDA and does not subject us to the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices regulations (“cGMP”), these products must not be adulterated, mislabeled or misbranded under the FDC Act.

These instrument systems also are subject to

the European Medical Device Directives, which create a single set of medical device regulations for all European Union (“EU”) member countries and require companies that wish to manufacture and distribute medical devices in EU member countries to obtain European Conformity marking for their products.


Water testing products

. Our water tests are not subject to formal premarket regulatory approval. However, before a test can be used as part of a water quality monitoring program in the U.S. that is regulated by the EPA, the test must first be approved by the EPA. The EPA approval process involves submission of extensive product performance data in accordance with an EPA-approved protocol, evaluation of the data by the EPA and publication for public comment of any proposed approval in the Federal Register before final approval. Our Colilert, Colilert-18, Colisure, Quanti-Tray, Filta-Max

xpress

, Enterolert and SimPlate for heterotrophic plate counts products have been approved by the EPA for use under various regulatory programs. Water testing products are subject to similarly extensive regulatory processes in other countries around the world.

Dairy testing products

. Dairy products used in National Conference on Interstate Milk Shipments (“NCIMS”) milk-monitoring programs in the U.S. are regulated by the FDA as veterinary medical devices. However, before products requiring FDA approval can be sold in the U.S., performance data must be submitted in accordance with an FDA-approved protocol administered by an independent body, such as the Association of Analytical Communities Research Institute (“AOAC RI”). Following approval of a product by the FDA, the product must also be approved by NCIMS, an oversight body that includes state, federal and industry representatives. Our SNAP Beta-Lactam antibiotic residue test product has been approved by the FDA, NCIMS and AOAC RI for sale in the U.S. While some foreign countries accept AOAC RI approval as part of their regulatory approval process, many countries have separate regulatory processes.

Human point-of-care electrolyte and blood gas analyzers

. Our OPTI instrument systems are classified as Class II medical devices, and their design, manufacture and marketing are regulated by the FDA. Accordingly, we must comply with cGMP in the manufacture of our OPTI products.

The FDA’s Quality System regulations further set forth standards for product design and manufacturing processes, require the maintenance of certain records and provide for inspections of our facilities by the FDA. New

OPTI

products fall into FDA classifications that require notification of and review by the FDA before marketing, and which are submitted as a 510(k) application.

OPTI Medical

products are also subject to the European Medical Device Directives and regulations governing the manufacture and marketing of medical devices in other countries in which they are sold.

In addition to the foregoing, our business is generally subject to various U.S. and foreign regulatory authorities, including the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) and other anti-competition authorities, and any acquisitions of new products and technologies may subject us to additional areas of government regulation. These may involve food safety, medical device, water-quality and other regulations of the FDA, the EPA, the USDA, the FTC and other federal agencies, as well as state, local and foreign governments. See “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.”

EMPLOYEES

As of February 6, 2015, we had approximately

6,400

employees.

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

Our future operating results involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual events or results may differ materially from those discussed in this report. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, the

factors discussed below, as well as those factors discussed elsewhere in this report.

Our Business Lines are Highly Competitive and Our Failure to Successfully Execute Certain Strategies Could Have a Material Negative Impact on Our Growth and Profitability

The companion animal healthcare industry is highly competitive and we anticipate increasing levels of competition from both existing competitors and new market entrants. Our ability to maintain or enhance our growth rates and our profitability depends on our successful execution of many elements of our strategy, including:

·

Developing, manufacturing and marketing innovative new or improved and cost competitive in-clinic laboratory analyzers

that drive sales of IDEXX VetLab instruments, grow our installed base of instruments and increase demand for related consumable products, services and accessories

;

·

Developing and introducing new proprietary diagnostic tests and services that provide valuable medical information to our customers and effectively differentiate our products and services from those of our competitors;

·

Increasing the value to our customers of our companion animal products and services by enhancing the integration of these products and the management of diagnostic information derived from our products;

·

Providing our veterinary customers with the medical and business tools, information and resources that enable them to grow their practices through increased pet visits and enhanced practice of real-time care;

·

Achieving cost improvements in our worldwide network of laboratories by implementing global best practices, including lean processing techniques, incorporating technological enhancements, including laboratory automation and a global laboratory information management system, employing purchasing strategies to maximize leverage of our global scale, increasing the leverage of existing infrastructure and consolidating testing in high volume laboratory hubs;

·

Achieving cost improvements in the manufacture and service of our in-clinic laboratory analyzers by employing the benefits of economies of scale in both negotiating supply contracts and leveraging manufacturing overhead, and by improving reliability of our instruments;

·

Continuing to expand and develop our companion animal diagnostic sales, marketing, customer support and logistics organizations in the U.S. in support of, among other things, our all-direct sales strategy for our rapid assay kits and instrument consumables (“kits and consumables”) in the U.S.;

·

Attracting, developing and retaining key leadership and talent necessary to support all elements of our strategy;

·

Expanding our served market and growing our market share by strengthening our sales and marketing activities both within the U.S. and in geographies outside of the U.S.;

·

Identifying, completing and integrating acquisitions that enhance our existing businesses or create new business or geographic areas for us; and

·

Developing and implementing new technology and licensing strategies.

If we are unsuccessful in implementing and executing on some or all of these strategies, our rate of growth or profitability may be negatively impacted.


Our Dependence on Suppliers Could Limit Our Ability to Sell Certain Products or Negatively Affect Our Operating Results

We rely on third-party suppliers to provide components in our products, manufacture products that we do not manufacture ourselves and perform services that we do not provide ourselves, including package-delivery services. Because these suppliers are independent third parties with their own financial objectives, actions taken by them could have a materially negative effect on our results of operations. The risks of relying on suppliers include our inability to enter into contracts with third-party suppliers on reasonable terms, inconsistent or inadequate quality control, relocation of supplier facilities, supplier work stoppages and suppliers’ failure to comply with their contractual obligations. Problems with suppliers could materially negatively impact our ability to supply the market, substantially decrease sales, lead to higher costs or damage our reputation with our customers.

In addition, we currently purchase many products and materials from sole or single sources. Some of the products that we purchase from these sources are proprietary and, therefore, cannot be readily or easily replaced by alternative sources. These products include the majority of our Catalyst Dx and Catalyst One consumables; ProCyte Dx hematology, IDEXX VetAutoread hematology, VetLyte

e

lectrolyte, VetTest chemistry analyzers and related consumables and accessories; image capture plates used in our digital radiography systems; and certain components and raw materials used in our SNAP

rapid assay kits and SNAP Pro Mobile Device, livestock and poultry diagnostic tests, dairy testing products, Catalyst One, LaserCyte

and

LaserCyte Dx hematology analyzer

s. To mitigate risks associated with sole and single source suppliers, we seek when possible to enter into long-term contracts that provide for an uninterrupted supply of products at predictable prices. However, some suppliers decline to enter into long-term contracts and we are required to purchase products on a purchase order basis. There can be no assurance that suppliers with which we do not have contracts will continue to supply our requirements for products, that suppliers with which we do have contracts will always fulfill their obligations under these contracts, or that any of our suppliers will not experience disruptions in their ability to supply our requirements for products. In cases where we purchase sole and single source products or components under purchase orders, we are more susceptible to unanticipated cost increases or changes in other terms of supply. In addition, under some contracts with suppliers we have minimum purchase obligations, and our failure to satisfy those obligations may result in loss of some or all of our rights under these contracts or require us to compensate the supplier. If we are unable to obtain adequate quantities of products in the future from sole and single source suppliers, we may be unable to supply the market, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

Our Biologic Products Are Complex and Difficult to Manufacture, Which Could

Negatively

Affect Our Ability to Supply the Market

Many of our rapid assay, livestock and poultry diagnostic, water and dairy products are biologic products, which are products that include materials from living organisms, such as antibodies, cells and sera. Manufacturing biologic products is highly complex due to the inherent variability of biological input materials and to the difficulty of controlling the interactions of these materials with other components of the products, samples and the environment. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain adequate sources of biological materials or that we will be able to consistently manufacture biologic products that satisfy applicable product release criteria. Further, products that meet release criteria at the time of manufacture may fall out of specification while in customer inventory, which could require us to incur expenses associated with recalling products and providing customers with new products, and could damage customer relations. Our inability to produce or obtain necessary biological materials or to successfully manufacture biologic products that incorporate such materials could result in our inability to supply the market with these products and have an adverse effect on our results of operations.


Our Business Sells Many

Products through Distributors, w

hich Present Risks that Could Negatively Affect Our Operating Results

We sell many of our products outside of the U.S. through distributors. As a result, we are dependent on these distributors to sell our products and assist us in promoting and creating a demand for our products outside the U.S. Our distributors often offer products from several different companies, and certain of our distributors may carry our competitors’ products and promote our competitors’ products over our own products. We have limited ability, if any, to cause our distributors to devote adequate resources to promoting, marketing, selling and supporting our products. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in maintaining and strengthening our relationships with our distributors or establishing relationships with new distributors who have the ability to market, sell and support our products effectively. We may rely on one or more key distributors for a product or a region, and the loss of these distributors could reduce our revenue. Distributors may face financial difficulties, including bankruptcy, which could harm our collection of accounts receivable and financial results. In addition, violations of anti-corruption or similar laws by our distributors could have a material impact on our business, and any termination of a distributor relationship may result in increased competition in the applicable jurisdiction. Failing to manage the risks associated with our use of distributors outside of the U.S. may reduce sales, increase expenses and weaken our competitive position, which could have a negative effect on our operating results.

Increased Competition and Technological Advances by Our Competitors Could Negatively Affect Our Operating Results

We face intense competition within the markets in which we sell our products and services and we expect that future competition may become even more intense. Competition could negatively affect our sales and profitability in a number of ways. New competitors may enter our markets and new or existing competitors may introduce new and competitive products and services, which could be superior to our products and services. Some of our competitors and potential competitors may choose to differentiate themselves by offering products and services similar to ours at lower sales prices, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations through loss of market share or a decision to lower our own sales prices to remain competitive. In addition, our ability to attract and retain customers depends on the effectiveness of our customer marketing and incentive programs and multiple competitors could bundle product and service offerings through co-marketing or other arrangements, which could enhance their ability to compete with our broad product and service offering. With our transition to an all-direct sales strategy for our kits and consumables in the U.S. effective January 1, 2015, we did not renew our distribution agreements with our former key U.S. distribution partners after their expiration at the end of 2014, including exclusive distribution agreements with some of the largest U.S. distributors of companion animal veterinary products. We historically sold significant amounts of our kits and consumables through our former U.S. distribution partners, and two of our previously exclusive U.S. distribution partners joined a third former U.S. distribution partner by beginning to carry competitive instruments, consumables and rapid assay products in the fourth quarter of 2014. The promotion and sale of our competitors’ products by our former U.S. distribution partners may adversely affect the retention of our customers for our kits and consumables and the sales and distribution of our products, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Some of our competitors and potential competitors, including large diagnostic and pharmaceutical companies, also have substantially greater financial resources than us, and greater experience in manufacturing, marketing, research and development and obtaining regulatory approvals than we do.

Various Government Regulations Could Limit or Delay Our Ability to Market and Sell Our Products or Otherwise Negatively Impact Our Business

In the U.S., the manufacture and sale of many of our products are regulated by agencies such as the USDA, the FDA or the EPA. Our infectious disease diagnostic tests for animal health applications, including most rapid assay canine and feline SNAP tests and livestock and poultry diagnostic tests, must be approved by the USDA prior to sale in the U.S. Our dairy testing products require approval by the FDA prior to sale in the U.S. Our water testing products must be approved by the EPA before they can be used by customers in the U.S. as a part of a water quality monitoring program required by the EPA. The manufacture and sale of our

OPTI

line of human point-of-care electrolytes and blood gas analyzers require approval by the FDA before they may be sold commercially in the U.S.  The manufacture and sale of our products are subject to similar and sometimes more stringent laws in many foreign countries. In addition, delays in obtaining regulatory approvals for new products or product upgrades could have a negative impact on our growth and profitability.


We are also subject to a variety of federal, state, local and international laws and regulations that govern, among other things, the importation and exportation of products and our business practices in the U.S. and abroad, such as anti-corruption and anti-competition laws. These legal and regulatory requirements differ among jurisdictions around the world and are rapidly changing and increasingly complex. The costs associated with compliance with these legal and regulatory requirements are significant and likely to increase in the future. In addition, any failure to comply with these legal and regulatory requirements could result in fines, penalties and sanctions; suspensions or discontinuations of our ability to manufacture, market or sell our products; and damage to our reputation.

Increase in Corporate Hospital Ownership and Prevalence of Buying Consortiums Could Negatively Affect Our Business

An increasing percentage of veterinary hospitals in the U.S. are owned by corporations that are in the business of acquiring veterinary hospitals and/or opening new veterinary hospitals nationally or regionally. Major corporate hospital owners in the U.S. include Banfield Pet Hospital, National Veterinary Associates and VCA Antech, Inc. A similar trend exists in other countries, such as in the U.K. and Nordic countries and may in the future also develop in other international markets. Furthermore, an increasing percentage of individually-owned veterinary hospitals in the U.S. are participating in buying consortiums. Corporate owners of veterinary hospitals and buying consortiums often seek to improve profitability by leveraging the buying power they derive from their scale to obtain favorable pricing from suppliers, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations. While we have strong supplier relationships with several corporate hospital groups and buying consortiums, decisions by larger corporate owners and buying consortiums to shift their purchasing of products and services away from us and to a competitor would have a negative impact on our results of operations. In addition, certain corporate owners, most notably VCA Antech, Inc., our primary competitor in the U.S. and Canadian markets for veterinary reference laboratory diagnostic services, also operate reference laboratories that serve both their hospitals and unaffiliated hospitals. Any hospitals acquired by these companies generally shift all or a large portion of their testing to the reference laboratories operated by these companies. Furthermore, because these companies compete with us in the reference laboratory services marketplace, hospitals acquired by these companies may cease to be customers or potential customers of our other companion animal products and services, which would cause our sales of these products and services to decline.

Our Success Is Heavily Dependent Upon Proprietary Technologies

We rely on a combination of patent, trade secret, trademark and copyright laws to protect our proprietary rights. We also license patents and technologies from third parties to enable the use of third-party technologies in the development and production of our products and offerings. If we do not have adequate protection of our proprietary rights or are unable to license third-party patents and technologies on reasonable terms, our business may be affected by competitors who utilize substantially equivalent technologies that compete with us.

We cannot ensure that we will obtain issued patents, that any patents issued or licensed to us will remain valid, or that any patents owned or licensed by us will provide protection against competitors with similar technologies. Even if our patents cover products sold by our competitors, the time and expense of litigating to enforce our patent rights could be substantial, and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, expiration of patent rights could result in substantial new competition in the markets for products previously covered by those patent rights.

In the past, we have received notices claiming that our products infringe third-party patents and we may receive such notices in the future. Patent litigation is complex and expensive, and the outcome of patent litigation can be difficult to predict. We cannot ensure that we will win a patent litigation case or negotiate an acceptable resolution of such a case. If we lose, we may be prohibited from selling certain products and/or we may be required to pay damages and/or ongoing royalties as a result of the lawsuit. Any such result could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.


Changes in Testing Patterns Could Negatively Affect Our Operating Results

The market for our companion animal, livestock and poultry diagnostic tests and our dairy and water testing products could be negatively impacted by a number of factors impacting testing practices. The introduction or broad market acceptance of vaccines or preventatives for the diseases and conditions for which we sell diagnostic tests and services could result in a decline in testing. Changes in accepted medical protocols regarding the diagnosis of certain diseases and conditions could have a similar effect. Eradication or substantial declines in the prevalence of certain diseases also could lead to a decline in diagnostic testing for such diseases. Our livestock and poultry products business in particular is subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in disease prevalence. For example, the demand for our bovine spongiform encephalopathy (“BSE”) testing products has been negatively impacted as a result of regulatory changes in the European Union, including the European Union’s Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health agreement to allow European Union member states the option to eliminate BSE testing of healthy cattle at slaughter effective March 2013. In addition, changes in government regulations or in the availability of government funds available for monitoring programs could negatively affect sales of our products that are driven by compliance testing, such as our livestock and poultry, dairy and water products. Declines in testing for any of the reasons described, along with lost opportunities associated with a reduction in veterinary visits, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.

Our Operations and Reputation May Be Impaired if We, Our Products or Our Services Do Not Comply with Regulations and Policies Regarding Privacy and Protection of User Data

We offer products and services that store and use practice and client information, including practice management systems for veterinary practices (e.g., Cornerstone), online client communication tools and services (e.g., Pet Health Network Pro), and cloud-based technology through VetConnect PLUS that enables veterinarians to access and analyze patients’ diagnostic data from IDEXX in-clinic analyzers, our Rapid Assays and Reference Laboratories in one place. Some of these products and services rely on third-party providers for cloud storage.  We also engage in e-commerce through various IDEXX websites and

collect contact and other personal or identifying information from our customers and visitors to our websites.

Federal, state and international laws and regulations govern the collection, use, retention, sharing and security of personal information, including data that we receive from our employees, customers and visitors to our websites and data collected by our customers and others when using our products and services. The costs associated with compliance with these legal and regulatory requirements are significant and likely to increase in the future. In addition, we have and post on our website our own privacy policy concerning the collection, use and disclosure of user data. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us or our products and services to protect employee or customer data (including as a result of a breach by or of a third-party provider) or to comply with any privacy-related laws, government regulations or directives or industry self-regulatory principles or our posted privacy policies could result in damage to our reputation or proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or otherwise, which could have an adverse effect on our business.

Strengthening of the Rate of Exchange for the U.S. Dollar Has a Negative Effect on Our Business

Any strengthening of the rate of exchange for the U.S. dollar against non-U.S. currencies, and in particular the Euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen and Australian dollar, adversely affects our results, as it reduces the dollar value of sales that are made in those currencies and reduces the profits on products manufactured or sourced in U.S. dollars and exported to international markets.

Approximately

28% o

f our consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 26% of our consolidated revenue for each of the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 was derived from products manufactured in the U.S. and sold internationally in local currencies. A strengthening U.S. dollar could also negatively impact the ability of customers outside the U.S. to pay for purchases denominated in U.S. dollars.


A Weak Economy Could Result in Reduced Demand for Our Products and Services or Increased Customer Credit Risk

A substantial percentage of our sales are made worldwide to the companion animal veterinary market. Demand for our companion animal diagnostic products and services is driven in part by the number of patient visits to veterinary hospitals and the practices of veterinarians with respect to the recommendations for diagnostic testing, as well as pet owner compliance with these recommendations. Economic weakness in our significant markets could cause pet owners to forgo or defer visits to veterinary hospitals or affect their willingness to approve certain diagnostic tests, comply with a treatment plan or, even more fundamentally, continue to own a pet. In addition, concerns about the financial resources of pet owners could cause veterinarians to be less likely to recommend certain diagnostic tests, and concerns about the economy may cause veterinarians to defer purchasing capital items such as our instruments and systems. These conditions, if they continue, could result in a decrease in sales of diagnostic products and services, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.

Demand for our water products is driven in part by the availability of funds at government laboratories, water utilities and private certified laboratories that utilize our products. Availability of funds also affects demand by government laboratories and cattle, swine and poultry producers that utilize our livestock and poultry diagnostic products, and by users of our human point-of-care diagnostic instruments. Economic weakness in our markets has caused and could continue to cause our customers to reduce their investment in such testing, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.

In all of our markets, a weak economy may also cause deterioration in the financial condition of our distributors and customers, which could inhibit their ability to pay us amounts owed for products delivered or services provided in a timely fashion or at all.

Risks Associated with Doing Business Internationally Could Negatively Affect Our Operating Results

For the year ended December 31, 2014, approximat

ely 43% of our

revenue was attributable to sales of products and services to customers outside the U.S., compared to 42% and 41% for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Although we intend to continue to expand our international operations and business, we may not be able to successfully promote, market, sell or distribute our products and services outside the U.S. Various risks associated with foreign operations may impact our international sales, including disruptions in transportation of our products, the differing product and service needs of foreign customers, difficulties in building and managing foreign operations, import/export duties and licensing requirements, natural disasters, unexpected regulatory and economic or political changes in foreign markets, security concerns and local business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices, including business practices prohibited by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws and regulations.

Further, prices that we charge to foreign customers may be different than the prices we charge for the same products in the U.S. due to competitive, market or other factors. In addition, foreign government regulations may restrict our ability to repatriate funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions, and any repatriation of such funds to the U.S. may result in higher effective tax rates for us. Our results of operations are also susceptible to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. As a result, the mix of domestic and international sales in a particular period could have an adverse impact on our results of operations for that period.

Our Limited Experience and Small Scale in the Human Point-of-Care Market Could Inhibit Our Success in this Market

We have limited experience in the human point-of-care medical diagnostics market and we operate at a small scale in this market. This market differs in many respects from the veterinary diagnostic market. Significant differences include the impact of third-party reimbursement on diagnostic testing, more extensive regulation, greater product liability risks, larger competitors, a more segmented customer base and more rapid technological innovation. Our limited experience and small scale in the human point-of-care medical diagnostics market could negatively affect our ability to successfully manage the risks and features of this market that differ from the veterinary diagnostic market. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving growth and profitability in the human point-of-care medical diagnostics market comparable to the results we have achieved in the veterinary diagnostic market.


Our Operations are Vulnerable to Interruption as a Result of Natural and Man-Made Disasters, System Disruptions and Security Breaches

The operation of all of our facilities may be vulnerable to interruption as a result of natural and man-made disasters, interruptions in power supply or other system failures. While we maintain plans to continue business under such circumstances, there can be no assurance that such plans will be successful in fully or partially mitigating the effects of such events.

We manufacture many of our significant companion animal products, including our rapid assay devices and certain instruments, many of our water testing products and certain of our livestock, poultry and dairy testing products, at a single facility in Westbrook, Maine. Certain of our companion animal products, as well as our human point-of-care products, are manufactured in Roswell, Georgia. We also manufacture certain of our livestock and poultry testing products in Bern, Switzerland and Montpellier, France. In addition, we maintain major distribution facilities in North America and in the Netherlands and major reference laboratories in Memphis, Tennessee; Leipzig, Germany; Ludwigsburg, Germany; Sacramento, California; Elmhurst, Illinois; North Grafton, Massachusetts; East Brisbane, Australia; Markham, Ontario; Wetherby, U.K; and Tokyo, Japan. Interruption of operations at any of these facilities could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.

We rely on several information systems throughout our company to keep financial records, process customer orders, manage inventory, process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions. Although we employ system backup measures, our current disaster recovery plan may be ineffective or inadequate to address all eventualities.

Further, our information systems may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers and other security breaches, including computer viruses. Any such attack or breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. If

we were to experience a system disruption, attack or security breach that impacts any of our critical functions, it could result in the loss of sales and customers, financial misstatement and significant incremental costs, which could adversely affect our business.

Furthermore, any access to, public disclosure of, or other loss of information as a result of an attack or security breach could result in governmental actions or private claims or proceedings, which could damage our reputation, cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, and adversely affect our business.

We maintain property and business interruption insurance to insure against the financial impact of certain events of this nature. However, this insurance may be insufficient to compensate us for the full amount of any losses that we may incur. In addition, such insurance will not compensate us for the long-term competitive effects of being out of the market for the period of any interruption in operations.

If Our Quarterly or Annual Results of Operations Fluctuate, This Fluctuation May Cause Our Stock Price to Decline

Our prior operating results have fluctuated due to a number of factors, including seasonality of certain product lines; changes in our accounting estimates; the impact of acquisitions; timing of distributor purchases, product launches, operating expenditures, customer marketing and incentive programs, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and litigation and claim-related expenditures; increase in the number and type of competitors; changes in competitors’ product offerings; changes in our sales and distribution model; changes in the economy affecting consumer spending; and other matters. Similarly, our future operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter or year to year due to these and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. If our operating results or projections of future operating results do not meet the expectations of market analysts or investors in future periods, our stock price may fall.


Future Operating Results Could Be Negatively Affected by Changes in Tax Rates, the Adoption of New U.S. or International Tax Legislation or Exposure to Additional Tax Liabilities

We are subject to local, state, regional and federal tax laws in the U.S. and many other international jurisdictions.  Due to economic and political conditions, the various tax rates applied to the earnings of our activities are subject to significant change.  Our future tax expense could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation.  Also, we have received tax rulings from various governments that have jurisdictional authority over our operations.  If we are unable to meet the requirements of such agreements, or if they expire or are renewed on less favorable terms, the result could negatively impact our future earnings.  Additionally, the European Commission has opened formal investigations into specific tax rulings granted by several countries to specific taxpayers.  While we believe that our rulings are different than those being discussed, the ultimate resolution of such activities cannot be predicted and could also have an adverse impact on future operating results.

Our income tax filings are regularly under audit by various tax authorities, and the final determination of tax audits could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. We regularly assess our exposures related to our worldwide provision for income taxes to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. Any reduction in these contingent liabilities or additional assessments would increase or decrease income, respectively, in the period such determination is made.

Restrictions in Our

Debt Agreements

or Our Inability to Obtain Financing on Favorable Terms May Limit Our Activities

Our ability to make scheduled payments and satisfy our other obligations under our unsecured revolving credit facility and senior notes depends on our future operating performance and on economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flows to meet these obligatio

ns or generate sufficient levels of earnings to satisfy the applicable

affirmative, negative and financial covenants

. O

ur failure to comply with these covenants and the other terms of the credit facility and senior notes could result in an event of default and acceleration of our obligations under these agreements, which may require us to seek additional financing or restructure existing debt on unfavorable terms. In addition, adverse changes in credit markets could increase our cost of borrowing and make it more difficult for us to obtain financing.

Our senior notes include provisions which stipulate a prepayment penalty for which we will be obligated in the event that we elect to repay the notes prior to their stated maturity dates. Should we elect to repay some or all of the outstanding principal balance on our senior notes, the prepayment penalty we incur could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.

We fund our operations, capital purchase requirements and strategic growth needs through cash on hand, funds generated from operations and amounts available under our credit facility. If we were unable to obtain financing on favorable terms, we could face restrictions that would limit our ability to execute certain strategies, which could have an adverse effect on our revenue growth and profitability.

Market Information

Our common stock is quoted on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol IDXX. The following table shows the quarterly range of high and low sale prices per share of our common stock as reported on the NASDAQ Global Select Market for the years 2013 and 2014.

Holders of Common Stock

As of February 6, 2015, there were 558 holders of record of ou

r common stock. Because the majority of our common stock is held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of stockholders, we are unable to estimate the total number of stockholders represented by these record holders.

Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer

During the three months ended December 31, 2014, we repurchased shares of common stock as described below:

(1)

As of December 31, 2014, our Board of Directors had approved the repurchase of up to 57 million shares of our common stock in the open market or in negotiated transactions pursuant to the Company’s share repurchase program. The program was approved and announced on August 13, 1999, and the maximum number of shares that may be purchased under the program was subsequently increased on October 4, 1999, November 16, 1999, July 21, 2000, October 20, 2003, October 12, 2004, October 12, 2005, February 14, 2007, February 13, 2008, February 10, 2010, October 12, 2011, May 7, 2013 and again on July 16, 2014. There is no specified expiration date for this repurchase program. There were no other repurchase programs outstanding during the three months ended December 31, 2014, and no repurchase programs expired during the period. Repurchases of 1,134,320 shares were made during the three months ended December 31, 2014 in transactions made pursuant to our repurchase program.

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Description of Segments

. Prior to January 1, 2013, we operated primarily through three business segments: diagnostic and information technology-based products and services for the veterinary market, which we continue to refer to as the Companion Animal Group (“CAG”); water quality products (“Water”); and diagnostic products for livestock and poultry health, which we referred to as Livestock and Poultry Diagnostics. We also operated two smaller operating segments that comprised products for milk quality and safety (“Dairy”) and products for the human point-of-care medical diagnostics market (“OPTI Medical”). Financial information about our Dairy and OPTI Medical operating segments was combined and presented with our remaining pharmaceutical product line and our out-licensing arrangements in an “Other” category because they did not meet the quantitative or qualitative thresholds for reportable segments.

In

2013, we combined the management

of our Livestock and Poultry Diagnostics, and Dairy lines of business to more effectively realize the market synergies between the product lines and to achieve operational efficiencies. We refer to this segment as Livestock, Poultry and Dairy (“LPD”). Our OPTI Medical operating segment remains combined and presented with our remaining pharmaceutical product line and our out-licensing arrangements in an “Other” category because they do not meet the quantitative or qualitative thresholds for reportable segments. The segment income (loss) from operations discussed within this report for the year ended December 31, 2012 has been retrospectively revised to reflect this change in the composition of our reportable segments. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2014 included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for financial information about our segments, including our product and service categories, and our geographic areas.

Items that are not allocated to our operating segments are as follows: a portion of corporate support function and personnel-related expenses; certain manufacturing costs; corporate research and development expenses that do not align with one of our existing business or service categories; the difference between estimated and actual share-based compensation expense; certain foreign currency exchange gains and losses; and variances from standard cost for products sold resulting from changes in certain currency exchange rates. In our segment disclosure, these amounts are shown under the caption “Unallocated Amounts.”

The following is a discussion of the strategic and operating factors that we believe have the most significant effect on the performance of our business.

Companion Animal Group

Our strategy is to provide veterinarians with both the highest quality diagnostic information to support more advanced medical care and information management solutions that help demonstrate the value of diagnostics to pet owners and enable efficient practice management.

By d

oing so

, we are able to build

a mutually successful partnership with our veterinarian customers based on healthy pets, loyal customers and expanding practice revenues.

CAG Diagnostics.

We refer to the extensiveness and integration of our diagnostic and information management offerings as

the IDEXX Diagnostic Advantage.

We provide diagnostic capabilities that meet veterinarian’s diverse needs through a variety of modalities including in-clinic diagnostic solutions and outside reference laboratories. V

eterinarians that utilize our full line of diagnostic modalities obtain a single view of a patient’s diagnostic results, which allows them to spot trends and achieve greater medical insight.

The breadth and complementary nature of our diagnostic solutions also provides us scale in sales and distribution.

During 2013, we reorganized our companion animal diagnostic sales organization in North America, transitioning our specialty sales force that represented either in-clinic or outside reference laboratory diagnostics to account representatives who represent all CAG diagnostic modalities. In addition to this reorganization, we increased the size of our sales force resulting in smaller geographically sized sales territories. These changes allowed for more frequent customer contact by a consistent sales professional.

We have experienced accelerated revenue growth subsequently to implementing this change.


To further increase our customer reach, effective January 1, 2015 we transitioned to an all-direct sales strategy in the U.S. and did not renew our current annual contracts with our U.S. distribution partners. Under this approach, we take orders, ship product, invoice and receive payment for all rapid assay test kits and instrument consumables in the U.S.,

aligning with our direct model for instruments, reference laboratory services, and other CAG products and services.

We believe these changes will continue to strengthen customer loyalty and help support growth of our diagnostic revenues in North America.

Our diagnostic capabilities generate both recurring and non-recurring revenues.  Revenues related to capital placements of our in-clinic

VetLab suite of instruments

and our SNAP Pro Mobile Device

are non-recurring in nature, while revenues from the associated propri

etary VetLab consumables, SNAP rapid a

ssay test kits, outside reference laboratory and consulting services, and extended maintenance agreements and accessories related to our VetLab instruments are recurring in nature. Instrument sales have significantly lower gross margins than those provided by our recurring revenues, especially in the case of VetLab consumables and rapid assay test kits.  Therefore, the mix of nonrecurring and recurring revenues in a particular period will impact our gross margins.

Diagnostic Capital Revenue.

Revenues related to the placement

of the

VetLab suite of instruments are non-recurring in nature, in that the customer will buy an instrument once over its respective product life cycle, but will purchase consumables for that instrument on a recurring basis as they use that instrument for testing purposes. During the early stage of an instrument’s life cycle, we derive relatively greater revenues from instrument placements, while consumable sales become relatively more significant in later stages as the installed base of instruments increases and instrument placement revenues begin to decline. In the early stage of an instrument’s life cycle, placements are made primarily through sales transactions.  As the market for the product matures, an increasing percentage of placements are made in transactions, sometimes referred to as “reagent rentals,” in which instruments are placed at customer sites at little or no cost in exchange for a long-term customer commitment to purchase instrument consumables.

Prior to the Catalyst One instrument launch during November 2014, we pre-sold the instrument under a customer marketing program through which customers preordering a Catalyst One were initially provided with the right to use a Catalyst Dx instrument. Under this marketing program, we deferred $7 million of instrument revenue in 2014, which will not be recognized until delivery of the Catalyst One instrument occurs in 2015.

We place our Catalyst chemistry analyzers through sales, leases, rental and other programs. In addition, we

continue to place VetTest

instruments through sales, lease, rental and other programs, with substantially all of our revenues from that product line currently derived from consumable sales. As of December 31, 2014, these three chemistry analyzers provided for a combined active installed base of approximately 38,000 units. Approximately half of 2014

Catalyst

analyzer placements were to customers that are new to IDEXX, including customers who had been using instruments from one of our competitors, sometimes referred to as competitive accounts. Generally, placement of an instrument with a competitive account is more attractive as the entire consumable stream associated with that placement represents incremental revenue, whereas the consumable stream associated with a Catalyst placement at a VetTest customer substitutes a Catalyst consumable stream for a VetTest consumable stream. We have found that the consumables revenues increase by approximately 25% when a customer upgrades from a VetTest analyzer to a Catalyst analyzer due to the superior capability, flexibility and ease of use of the Catalyst, which leads to additional testing by the customer.

As we continue to experience growth in placements of Catalyst

analyzers and in sales of related consumables, we expect this growth to be partly offset by a decline in placements of VetTest analyzers and in sales of related consumables.


The ProCyte Dx

analyzer is our latest generation hematology analyzer, which we launched in 2010.

In addition we sell the LaserCyte Dx

and LaserCyte

analyzers and VetAutoread an

alyzers. As of December 31, 2014

, these four hematology analyzers provided for a combined active installed base of approximately

27,000 units. A

substantial portion of ProCyte

Dx

analyzer placements continue to be made at veterinary clinics that elect to upgrade from their LaserCyte analyzer to a ProCyte

Dx

analyzer. I

n 2014

,

slightly less than half of ProCyte placements were made at competitive accounts. We als

o continue to place a substantial number of LaserCyte Dx and LaserCyte instruments, both new and

recertified

, as trade-ups from the VetAutoread analyzer and at new a

nd competitive accounts. In 2014

, a significant number of LaserCyte instruments that were placed were

recertified

instruments that had been received in trade in the sale of a ProCyte Dx analyzer. As we continue to experience growth in placements of ProCyte

Dx

analyzers and in sales of related consumables, we expect this growth to be partly offset by a decline in placements of LaserCyte and VetAutoread analyzers and in sales of related consumables.

We seek to enhance the attractiveness of our SNAP rapid assay tests by providing the

SNAP Pro Mobile Device, which

activates SNAP tests,

properly times the run,

captures and saves images of the results and

,

in conjunction with IVLS,

records invoice charges in the patient record.

This promotes practice efficiency by eliminating manual entry of test results in patient records and also helps ensure that the services are recorded and accurately invoiced. In addition, SNAP Pro Mobile Device results can be shared with pet owners on th

e SNAP Pro screen or

, in conjunction with IVLS,

via VetConnect PLUS. We also sell the

SNAPshot Dx, which automatically reads certain SNAP test results and

, in conjunction with IVLS,

records those results in the electronic medical record. We continue to work on enhancing the functionality of our analyzers to read the results of additional tests from our canine and feline family of rapid assay products.

Prior to 2014, the SNAPshot Dx was our primary in-clinic solution which screened for thyroid disease. With the recent launch of the

total thyroxine (“T


”)

slide for use with the Catalyst One analyzer

, we anticipate a decline in placements of the SNAPshot Dx, although we will continue to service the existing install base.

Our long-term success in this area of our business is dependent upon new customer acquisition, customer loyalty and retention and customer utilization of existing and new assays introduced for use on our analyzers. We continuously seek opportunities to enhance the care that veterinary professionals give to their patients and clients through supporting the implementation of real-time care testing work flows, which is performing tests and sharing test results with the client at the time of the patient visit. Our latest generation of chemistry and hematology instruments demonstrates this commitment by offering enhanced ease of use, faster time to results, greater sample throughput, broader test menu and connectivity to various information technology platforms that enhance the value of the diagnostic information generated by the instruments. In addition, we provide marketing tools and consultative services that help drive efficiencies in veterinary practice processes and allow practices to increase the number of clients they see on a daily basis.

With all of our instrument product lines, we seek to differentiate our products from our competitors’ products based on time-to-result, ease-of-use, throughput, breadth of diagnostic menu, flexibility of menu selection, accuracy, reliability, ability to handle compromised samples, analytical capability of software, integration with the IDEXX VetLab Station and

VetConnect PLUS

, client communications capabilities, education and training, and superior sales and customer service. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to differentiate our products in a way that justifies a premium price.

Recurring Diagnostic Revenue.

Revenues from our proprietary VetLab consumable products, our SNAP rapid assay test kits, outside reference laboratory and consulting services, and extended maintenance agreements and accessories related to our VetLab instruments are considered recurring in nature.

Recurring diagnostic revenue accounts for approximately 71

% of our

consolidated revenue and is both highly durable and profitable.

Our in-clinic diagnostic solutions, consisting of our VetLab consumable products and SNAP rapid assay test kits, provide real-time reference lab quality diagnostic results

for a variety of companion animal diseases and health conditions

. Our outside reference laboratories provide veterinarians with the benefits of a more comprehensive list of diagnostic tests and access to consultations with board-certified veterinary specialists and pathologists, combined with the benefit of same-day or next-day turnaround times.


We derive substantial revenues and margins from the sale of consumables that are used in VetLab instruments and the multi-year consumable revenue stream is significantly more valuable than the placement of the instrument

. Our strategy is to increase diagnostic testing within veterinary practices by placing VetLab instruments and increasing instrument utilization of consumables.  Utilization can increase due to a greater number of patient samples being run or to an increase in the number of tests being run per patient sample. Our strategy is to increase both drivers. To increase utilization, we seek to educate veterinarians about best medical practices that emphasize the importance of chemistry and hematology testing for a variety of diagnostic purposes

, as well as by introducing new testing capabilities that were previously not available to veterinarians

.

Additionally, we have found that veterinarian adoption of VetConnect PLUS drives utilization by spurring testing across all IDEXX diagnostic modalities.

In connection with the purchase of instruments, we also offer protocol-based rebate incentives when customers utilize the broad testing functionality of our analyzers.

Our in-clinic diagnostic solutions also include SNAP rapid assay tests that address important medical needs for particular diseases prevalent in the companion animal population. We seek to differentiate these tests from those of other in-clinic test providers and reference laboratory diagnostic service providers through ease-of-use, superior performance, sensitivity, specificity and by providing our customers with combination tests that test a single sample for up to six diseases at once. We further augment our product development and customer service efforts with sales and marketing programs that enhance medical awareness and understanding regarding certain diseases and the importance of diagnostic testing.

We believe that more than half of all diagnostic testing by U.S. veterinarians is provided by outside reference laboratories such as our IDEXX Reference Laboratories. In several markets outside the U.S., in-clinic testing is less prevalent and an even greater percentage of diagnostic testing is done in reference laboratories. We attempt to differentiate our reference laboratory testing services from those of competitive reference laboratories and competitive in-clinic offerings primarily on the basis of test menu, technology employed, quality, turnaround time, customer service and tools such as

VetConnect PLUS

that demonstrate the complementary manner in which our laboratory services work with our in-clinic offerings.

Profitability from our reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services is largely the result of our ability to achieve efficiencies from both volume and operational improvements.

When possible, we utilize core reference laboratories to service samples from other countries, expanding our customer reach without an associated expansion in our reference laboratory footprint.

Start-up laboratories that we open typically will operate at a loss until testing volumes achieve sufficient scale. Acquired laboratories frequently operate less profitably than our existing laboratories and acquired laboratories may not achieve the profitability of our existing laboratory network for several years until we complete the implementation of operating improvements and efficiencies. Therefore, in the short term, new and acquired reference laboratories generally will have a negative effect on our operating margin. Recurring revenue growth is achieved both through increased sales to existing customers and through the acquisition of new customers. We believe

the increased number of customer visits resulting from our all-direct sales strategy in the U.S.

will lead to increased reference laboratory opportunities with customers who already use one of our in-clinic diagnostic modalities. In recent years, re

curring

reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting revenues have also been increased through reference laboratory acquisitions, customer list acquisitions, the opening of new reference laboratories, including laboratories that are co-located with large practice customers, and as a result of our up-front customer loyalty programs. Under these arrangeme

nts, we provide incentives to customers in the form of cash payments or IDEXX Points upon entering multi-year agreements to purchase annual minimum amounts of products or services in the future.

Health Monitoring and Biological Materials Testing

.

We believe the acquisition of the research and diagnostic laboratory business of the College of Veterinary Medicine from the University of Missouri allows us to leverage our expertise in veterinary diagnostics and expand our integrated offering of reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services and in-clinic testing solutions in the adjacent bioresearch market.


Customer Information Management and Digital Imaging Systems

. Our Cornerstone practice management system provides a superior integrated information solution, backed by exceptional customer support and education, to allow the veterinarian to practice better medicine and achieve the practice’s business objectives, including a quality client experience, staff efficiency and practice profitability. We differentiate our practice management systems through enhanced function

ality, ease of use and connectivity with in-clinic VetLab instruments and outside reference laboratory test results. Our client communication services create more meaningful pet owner experiences through personalized communication. Pet Health Network Pro online client communication and education service complements the entire IDEXX product offering by educating pet owners and building loyalty through engaging the pet owner before, during and after the visit, thereby building client loyalty and driving more patient visits.

Our digital imaging systems offer a convenient system that provides superior image quality and software capability that enables sharing of these images with clients virtually anywhere and enhanced diagnostic features and customer workflow, backed by the same customer support provided for our other products and services in CAG.

Water

Our strategy in the water testing business is to develop, manufacture, market and sell proprietary products with superior performance, supported by exceptional customer service. Our customers primarily consist of water utilities, government laboratories and private certified laboratories that highly v

alue strong relationships and customer support. Sales of water testing products outside of the U.S. represented 52% of total wat

er product sales in 201


, and we expect that future growth in this business will be significantly dependent on our ability to increase international sales. Growth also will be dependent on our ability to enhance and broaden our product line. Most water microbiological testing is driven by regulation, and, in many countries, a test may not be used for compliance testing unless it has been approved by the applicable regulatory body. As a result, we maintain an active regulatory program that involves applying for regulatory approvals in a number of countries, primarily in Europe. Further, we seek to receive regulatory approvals from governing agencies as a means to differentiate our products from the competition.

Livestock, Poultry and Dairy

We develop, manufacture, market and sell a broad range of tests for various cattle, swine and poultry diseases and conditions, and have active research and development and in-licensing programs in this area. Our strategy is to offer proprietary tests with superior performance characteristics for use in government programs to control or eradicate disease and disease outbreaks and in livestock and poultry producers’ disease and reproductive management programs. Disease outbreaks are episodic and unpredictable, and certain diseases that are prevalent at one time may be substantially contained or eradicated at a later time. In response to outbreaks, testing initiatives may lead to exceptional demand for certain products in certain periods. Conversely, successful eradication programs may result in significantly decreased demand for certain products. In addition, increases in government funding may lead to increased demand for certain products and budgetary constraints may lead to decreased demand for certain products.

As result, the performance of this business can fluctuate.

Our strategy in the dairy testing business is to develop, manufacture and sell antibiotic residue and contaminant testing products that satisfy applicable regulatory requirements

or dairy processor standards

for testing of milk and provide reliable field performance. The manufacture of these testing products leverages

the SNAP platform as well as the

manufacturing

equipment of our rapid assay business, incorporating customized reagents for antibiotic and contaminant detection. To successfully increase sales of dairy testing products, we believe that we need to increase penet

ration in dairy

processor

s

and develop product line enhancements and extensions

.

We also distribute food safety products, including Randox Food Diagnostics,

a wide range of cost effective ELISAs

, sensitive and reproducible diagnostic assays,

for the detection of multiple compounds in one

test

based on a multi-analyte quantitative screening drug residue analyzer called t

he Evidence Investigator. Our technology

for food safety screening reduces the number of samples sent to confirmation laboratories, lowering costs on expensive confirmation tests.

We believe distributing food safety products provides us opportunities at a later stage in the food value chain.


In 2014, approximatel

y 90%

of our sales in this business were from markets outside of the U.S., most notably Europe

and China

. The performance of the business is particularly subject to the various risks that are associated with doing business internationally.

See “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.”

Other

OPTI Medical Systems

. Our strategy in the OPTI Medical Systems business for the human market is to

develop, manufacture, and sell electrolyte and blood gas analyzers and related consumable products for the medical point-of-care diagnostics market worldwide, with a focus on small to mid-sized hospitals. W

e seek to differentiate our products based on ease of use, convenience, international distribution and service and instrument reliability.

Similar to our veterinary instruments and consumables strategy, a

substantial portion of the revenues from this product line is derived from the sale of consumables for use on the installed base of

electrolyte and blood gas analyzers.

During the early stage of an instrument’s life cycle, relatively greater revenues are derived from instrument placements, while consumable sales become relatively more significant in later stages as the installed base of instruments increases and instrument placement revenues begin to decline. Our long-term success in this area of our business is dependent upon new customer acquisition, customer retention and increased customer utilization of existing and new assays introduced on these instruments.

Our strategy in the OPTI Medical Systems business for the veterinary market is to utilize this unit’s know-how, intellectual property and manufacturing capability to continue to expand the menu and instrument capability of the

VetStat

and

Catalyst Dx

platforms for veterinary applications while reducing our cost of consumables by leveraging experience and economies of scale.

In 2014, approximately

83%

of our sales in the OPTI Medical Systems business were from markets outside of the U.S., most notably

Asia and

Europe. The performance of the business is particularly subject to the various risks that are associated with doing business internationally.

See “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.”

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with

accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”)

. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.

We evaluate our estimates o

n an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies used in preparation of these consolidated financial statements.

We believe the following critical accounting estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on reported financial condition and operating performance and involve significant levels of judgment to account for highly uncertain matters or are susceptible to significant change.

Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenue when four criteria are m

et: (i) persuasive evidence of

an arrangement exists; (ii) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; (iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable; and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured. See Note 2(i) to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31,


included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information about our revenue recognition policy and criteria for recognizing revenue.


Multiple E

lement

A

rrangements (“MEAs”)

. Arrangements to sell products to customers frequently include multiple deliverables. Our most significant MEAs include the sale of one or more of the instruments from the

IDEXX VetLab suite of analyzers, digital imaging systems or

practice management software

, combined with one or more of the following products:

extended maintenance agreements (“EMAs”), consumables and reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services. Practice management software is frequently sold with post-contract customer support and implementation services. Delivery of the various products or performance of services within the arrangement may or may not coincide. Delivery of our IDEXX VetLab instruments, digital imaging systems and practice management software generally occurs at the onset of the arrangement. EMAs, consumables, and reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting

services typically are delivered over future periods, generally one to six years. In certain arrangements, revenue recognized is limited to the amount invoiced or received that is not contingent on the delivery of products and services in the future.

We allocate revenue to each element based on the relative selling price and recognize revenue when the elements have standalone value and the four criteria for revenue recognition, as discussed above, have been met for each element. If available, we establish the selling price of each element based on vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”), which represents the price charged for a deliverable when it is sold separately. We use third-party evidence (“TPE”) if VSOE is not available, or best estimate of selling price if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. When these arrangements include a separately-priced EMA, we recognize revenue related to the EMA at the stated contractual price on a straight-line basis over the life of the agreement to the extent the separately stated price is substantive. If there is no stated contractual price for an EMA, or the separately stated price is not substantive, we allocate revenue to each element based on the relative selling price and recognize revenue

when the elements have standalone value and the four criteria for revenue recognition, as discussed above, have been met for each element

.

When arrangements within the scope of software revenue recognition guidance include multiple elements, we allocate revenue to each element based on relative fair value, when VSOE exists for all elements, or by using the residual method when there is VSOE for the undelivered elements but no such evidence for the delivered elements. Under the residual method, the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the residual revenue is allocated to the delivered elements. Revenue is recognized on any delivered elements when the four criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element. If VSOE does not exist for the undelivered element, all revenue from the arrangement is deferred until the earlier of the point at which such sufficient VSOE does exist or all elements of the arrangement have been delivered. We determine fair value based on amounts charged separately for the delivered and undelivered elements to similar customers in standalone sales of the specific elements.

Certain arrangements with customers include discounts on future sales of products and services. We apply judgment in determining whether future discounts are significant and incremental. When the future discount offered is not considered significant and incremental, we do not account for the discount as an element of the original arrangement. If the future discount is significant and incremental, we recognize that discount as an element of the original arrangement and allocate the discount to the other elements of the arrangement based on relative selling price. To determine whether a discount is significant and incremental, we look to the discount provided in comparison to standalone sales of the same product or service to similar customers, the level of discount provided on other elements in the arrangement and the significance of the discount to the overall arrangement. If the discount in the MEA approximates the discount typically provided in standalone sales, that discount is not considered incremental.

Customer P

rograms

. We record reductions to revenue related to customer marketing and incentive programs, which include end-user rebates and other volume-based incentives. Incentives may be provided in the form of IDEXX Points, credit

s or cash and are earned by end

users upon achieving defined volume purchases or utilization levels or upon entering an agreement to purchase products or services in future periods. The summary of revenue reductions presented below reflects all revenue reductions recorded for the year for each particular program. These amounts are presented on a net basis when applicable, which accounts for any differences between estimates and actual incentives earned for the relevant customer marketing or incentive program. These differences have been insignificant in all quarterly or annual periods. Our most significant customer programs are categorized as follows:


Customer Loyalty Programs

. Our customer loyalty programs offer customers the opportunity to earn incentives on a variety of IDEXX products and services as those products and services are purchased and utilized.

R

evenue reductions related to customer loyalty programs are recorded based on the actual issuance of incentives, incentives earned but not yet issued and estimates of incentives to be earned in the future.

Up-Front Customer Loyalty Programs

. Our up-front loyalty programs provide incentives to customers in the form of cash payments or IDEXX Points upon entering multi-year agreements to purchase annual minimum amounts of future products or services. If a customer breaches its agreement, it is required to refund a prorated portion of the up-front cash or IDEXX Points, among other things. These incentives are considered to be customer acquisition costs and are capitalized and recognized as a reduction to revenue over the term of the customer agreement. If these up-front incentives are subsequently utilized to purchase IDEXX VetLab instruments, digital imaging systems or Cornerstone practice management systems, product revenue and cost is deferred and recognized over the term of the customer agreement as products and services are provided to the customer. We monitor customer purchases over the term of their agreement to assess the realizability of our capitalized customer acquisition costs. For the years ended December 31, 201


, 201


and 201


, impairments of customer acquisition costs were immaterial.

IDEXX

Instrument

Marketing Programs

. Our instrument

marketing programs require the customer to enroll at the time of instrument purchase and offer customers the opportunity to earn incentives in future periods based on the volume of the products they purchase and utilize over the term of the program. These arrangements are considered MEAs in accordance with our revenue recognition policy stated above. Revenue reductions related to instrument

marketing programs are recorded based on an estimate of customer purchase and utilization levels and the incentive the customer will earn over the term of the program. Our estimates are based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of the marketing program and require us to apply judgment to approximate future product purchases and utilization. Differences between our estimates and actual incentives earned are accounted for as a change in estimate. These differences were not material for the years ended December 31, 201


, 201


and 201

2. At December 31, 2014

, a 5% change in our estimate of future customer utilization would increase or reduce revenue by approximat

ely $0.4 million.

Reagent Rental Programs

. Our reagent rental programs provide our customers the right to use our instruments in consideration for multi-year agreements to purchase annual minimum amounts of consumables. No instrument revenue is recognized at the time of instrument installation. We recognize a portion of the revenue allocated to the instrument concurrent with the future sale of consumables. We determine the amount of revenue allocated from the consumable to the instrument based on relative selling prices and determine the rate of instrument revenue recognition in proportion to the customer’s minimum volume commitment. The cost of the instrument is charged to cost of product revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the minimum purchase agreement.

IDEXX Points may be applied against the purchase price of IDEXX products and services purchased in the future or applied to trade receivables due to us. IDEXX Points that have not yet been used by customers are classified as a liability until use or expiration occurs. We estimate the amount of IDEXX Points expected to expire, or breakage, based on historical expirations and we recognize the estimated benefit of breakage

in proportion to actual redemptions of IDEXX Points by customers

. On November 30 of each year, unused IDEXX Points earned before January 1 of the prior year generally expire and any variance from the breakage estimate is accounted for as a change in estimate. This variance was not material for t

he years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012

.

Future market conditions and changes in product offerings may cause us to change marketing strategies to increase or decrease customer incentive offerings, possibly resulting in incremental reductions of revenue in future periods as compared to reductions in the current or prior periods. Additionally, certain customer programs require us to estimate, based on historical experience, and apply judgment to approximate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive. In determining estimated revenue reductions we utilize data supplied from distributors and collected directly from end users, which includes the volume of qualifying products purchased and the number of qualifying tests run as reported to us by end users via IDEXX SmartService

.

Differences between estimated and actual customer participation in programs may impact the amount and timing of revenue recognition.

Inventory Valuation

We write down the carrying value of inventory for estimated obsolescence by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value when warranted based on assumptions of future demand, market conditions, remaining shelf life or product functionality. If actual market conditions or results of estimated functionality are less favorable than those we estimated, additional inventory write-downs may be required, which would have a negative effect on results of operations.

Valuation of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

A significant portion of the purchase price for acquired businesses is generally assigned to intangible assets. Intangible assets other than goodwill are initially valued at fair value. If a quoted price in an active market for the identical asset is not readily available at the measurement date, the fair value of the intangible asset is estimated based on discounted cash flows using market participant assumptions, which are assumptions that are not specific to IDEXX. The selection of appropriate valuation methodologies and the estimation of discounted cash flows require significant assumptions about the timing and amounts of future cash flows, risks, appropriate discount rates, and the useful lives of intangible assets.

When material, we utilize independent valuation experts to advise and assist us in determining the fair values of the identified intangible assets acquired in connection with a business acquisition and in determining appropriate amortization methods and periods for those intangible assets.

Goodwill is initially valued based on the excess of the purchase price of a business combination over the fair value of acquired net assets recognized and represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized.

We assess contingent consideration to determine if it is part of the


business combination or if it should be accounted for separately from the business combination in the postcombination period. Contingent consideration

is recognized at its fair value on the acquisition date. A liability resulting from contingent consideration is remeasured to fair value at each reporting date until the contingency is resolved. Changes in fair value of contingent consideration are recognized in earnings.

We assess goodwill for impairment annually, at the reporting unit level, in the fourth quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment may exist. An impairment charge is recorded for the amount, if any, by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. Our reporting units are the individual product and service categories that comprise our CAG operating segment, our Water and LPD operating segments and goodwill remaining from the restructuring of our pharmaceutical business in the fourth quarter of 2008, referred to herein as the Technology reporting unit. A substantial portion of the goodwill remaining from the pharmaceutical business, included in our “Other Segment”, is associated with products that have been, or that we expect to be, licensed to third parties. Realization of this goodwill is dependent upon the success of those third parties in developing and commercializing products, which will result in our receipt of royalties and other payments.

In evaluating goodwill for impairment, we have the option to first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. The more-likely-than-not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than 50 percent. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we would then perform step one of the two-step impairment test; otherwise, no further impairment test would be required. In contrast, we can opt to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to step one of the two-step impairment test. Doing so does not preclude us from performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period.

As part of our goodwill testing process, we evaluate factors specific to a reporting unit as well as industry and macroeconomic factors that are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the fair value of a reporting unit. Examples of the factors considered in assessing the fair value of a reporting unit include: the results of the most recent impairment test, the competitive environment, anticipated changes in product or labor costs, revenue growth trends, the consistency of operating margins and cash flows and current and long-range financial forecasts. The long-range financial forecasts of the reporting units, which are based upon management’s long-term view of our markets, are used by senior management and the Board of Directors to evaluate operating performance.

In the fourth quarter of 2014

, we elected to bypass the qualitative approach and instead proceeded directly to step one of the two-step impairment test to assess the fair value of all of our reporting units.

As part of step one of the two-step impairment test, we estimate the fair values of applicable reporting units using an income approach based on discounted forecasted cash flows. We make significant assumptions about the extent and timing of future cash flows, growth rates and discount rates. Model assumptions are based on our projections and best estimates, using appropriate and customary market participant assumptions. In addition, we make certain assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to individual reporting units in determining the carrying value of each reporting unit. As of September 30, 201


, the date that we performed our assessment of goodwill for impairment, the total aggregate fair value of the reporting units approximated the Company’s market capitalization. Valuation assumptions reflect our projections and best estimates, based on significant assumptions about the extent and timing of future cash flows, growth rates and discount rates. The results of our goodwill impairment test indicate an excess of estimated fair value over the carrying amount for each of our reporting units b

y a range of approximately $12.0 million to $2.1 billion and 125% to 1063

% of the reporting unit’s carrying value.


While we believe that the assumptions used to determine the estimated fair values of each of our reporting units are reasonable, a change in assumptions underlying these estimates could result in a material negative effect on the estimated fair value of the reporting units. Our fair value estimate assumes the achievement of future financial results contemplated in our forecasted cash flows, and there can be no assurance that we will realize that value. We use forecasts to estimate future cash flows and include an estimate of long-term future growth rates based on our most recent views of the long-term outlooks for our reporting units. Actual results may differ from those assumed in our forecasts. The discount rate is based on a weighted average cost of capital derived from industry peers. Changes in market conditions, interest rates, growth rates, tax rates, costs, pricing or the discount rate would affect the estimated fair values of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period. No goodwill impairments were identified during t

he years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 or 2012

.

A prolonged economic downturn

in the U.S. or internationally

resulting in lower long-term growth rates and reduced long-term profitability may reduce the fair value of our reporting units. Industry specific events or circumstances could have a negative impact on our reporting units and may also reduce the fair value of our reporting units. Should such events occur and it becomes more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value has fallen below its carrying value, we will perform an interim goodwill impairment test, in addition to the annual impairment test. Future impairment tests may result in an impairment of goodwill, depending on the outcome of future impairment tests. An impairment of goodwill would be reported as a non-cash charge to earnings.

We assess the realizability of intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. If an impairment review is triggered, we evaluate the carrying value of intangible assets based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the primary asset of the asset group and compare that value to the carrying value of the asset group. The cash flows that are used contain our best estimates, using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time. If the net carrying value of an intangible asset exceeds the related estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment to write the intangible asset to its fair value would be reported as a non-cash charge to earnings. If necessary, we would calculate the fair value of an intangible asset using the present value of the estimated future cash flows to be generated by the intangible asset and applying a risk-adjusted discount rate. No

material

impairments of intangible assets were identified during t

he years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012

.

Share-Based Compensation

Our share-based compensation programs provide for grants of stock options, restricted stock units and deferred stock units, along with the issuance of employee stock purchase rights. The total fair value of future awards may vary significantly from past awards based on a number of factors, including our share-based award practices. Therefore, share-based compensation expense is likely to fluctuate, possibly significantly, from year to year.

We use the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model to determine the fair value of options granted. Option-pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, particularly for the expected stock price volatility and the expected term of options. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield for a duration similar to the expected term at the date of grant. We have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we have no intention to pay a dividend at this time; therefore, we assume that no dividends will be paid over the expected terms of option awards.

We determine the assumptions to be used in the valuation of option grants as of the date of grant. As such, we use different assumptions during the year if we grant options at different dates. Substantially all of our options granted during t

he years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012

were granted in the first quarter of each year.

The weighted average of each of the valuation assumptions used to determine the fair value of each option grant during each of the previous three years is as follows:

(1)

Options granted after May 8, 2013 have a contractual term of ten years. Options granted between January 1, 2006 and May 8, 2013 have contractual terms of seven years.


Changes in the subjective input assumptions, particularly for the expected stock price volatility and the expected term of options, can materially affect the fair value estimate. Our expected stock price volatility assumption is based on the historical volatility of our stock over a period similar to the expected term and other relevant factors. Lower estimated volatility reduces the fair value of a stock option, while higher estimated volatility has the opposite effect. The total fair value of stock options granted during the year

ended December 31, 2014 was $10.7

millio

n. If the weighted average of the stock price volatility assumption was increased or decreased by 1%, the total fair value of stock options awarded during the year ended December 31, 2014 would have increased

or decreased by approximately $0.3 million

and the total expense recognized for the year ended December 31, 2014 for options awarded during the same period would have increased or decreased by less than $0.1 million.

We derive the expected term assumption for stock options based on historical experience and other relevant factors concerning expected behavior with regard to option exercises. The expected term is determined using a consistent method at each grant date. A longer expected term assumption increases the fair value of stock option awards, while a shorter expected term assumption has the opposite effect. If the weighted average of the expected term was increased or decreased by one year, the total fair value of stock options awarded during the year ended December 31, 2014

would have increased or decreased by approximately $1.0 million

and the total expense recognized for the year ended December 31, 2014 for options awarded during 2014 would have increased or decreased by $0.2 million.

Share-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which ranges from one to five years, depending on the award.

Share-based compensation expense is based on the number of awards ultimately expected to vest and is, therefore, reduced for an estimate of the number of awards that are expected to be forfeited. The forfeiture estimates are based on historical data and other factors; share-based compensation expense is

adjusted annually for actual results. Total share-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $18.1 million, which is net of a reduction of $3.2 million for actual and estimated forfeitures. Fluctuations in our overall em

ployee turnover rate may result in changes in estimated forfeiture rates and differences between estimated forfeiture rates and actual experience and, therefore could have a significant unanticipated impact on share-based compensation expense.

Modifications of the terms of

outstanding award

s may result in significant increases or decreases in share-based compensation. There were no material modifications to the terms of outstanding options, restricted stock units or deferred stock units during 2014, 2013 or 2012.

k units and employee stock purchase rights issued during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 totaled $24.0 million, $22.2 million and $18.2 million, respectively. The total unrecognized compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, for unvested share-based compensation awards outstandin

g at December 31, 2014

was $35.9 million, whic

h will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 1.6 years.

Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for i

ncome taxes. Under this approach, deferred taxes represent

the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between book and tax treatment of assets and liabilities and carryforwards to the extent they are realizable.

On a quarterly basis, we assess our current and projected earnings by jurisdiction to determine whether or not our earnings during the periods when the temporary differences become deductible will be sufficient to realize the related future tax benefits. Should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in a particular jurisdiction in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made. A reduction of net income before taxes in each subsidiary equal to 5% of revenue, compared to the corresponding reported amounts for the year ended December 31, 2014, would not result in the recognition of material incremental valuation allowances.


For those jurisdictions where tax carryforwards are likely to expire unused or the projected operating results indicate that realization is not more likely than not, a valuation allowance is recorded to offset the deferred tax asset within that jurisdiction. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Alternatively, in the event that we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, a reduction of the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made. Likewise, should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future, a reduction to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made.

Our net taxable temporary differences and tax carryforwards are recorded using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax liability or asset is expected to be settled or realized. Should the expected applicable tax rates chan

ge in the future, an adjustment to the net deferred tax liability would be credited or charged, as appropriate, to income in the period such determination was made. For example, an increase of one percentage point in our anticipated U.S. state income tax rate would cause us to decrease our net deferred tax liability balance by $0.2 million. This decrease in the net deferred liability would increase net income in the period that our rate was adjusted. Likewis

e, a decrease of one percentage point to our anticipated U.S. state income tax rate would have the opposite effect.

We periodically assess our exposures related to our worldwide provision for income taxes and believe that we have appropriately accrued taxes for contingencies. Any reduction of these contingent liabilities or additional assessment would increase or decrease income, respectively, in the period such determination was made.

We consider the majority of the operating earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the U.S. The cumulative earnings of these subsidiaries we

re

$431.7

million at D

ecember 31, 201


, of which approximately

$321.5 million was held in cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2014. No provision has been made for the payment of

U.S. federal and state or international taxes that may result from future remittances of these undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries. Should we repatriate these earnings in the future, we would have to adjust the income tax provision in the period in which the decision to repatriate earnings is made. A determination of the related tax liability that would be paid on these undistributed earnings if repatriated is not practicable.  For the operating earnings not considered to be indefinitely invested outside the U.S. we have accounted for the tax impact on a current basis.

We record a liability for uncertain tax positions that do not meet the

more likely than not standard as prescribed by the authoritative guidance for income tax accounting. We record tax benefits for only those positions that we believe will more likely than not be sustained. For positions that we believe that it is more likely than not that we will prevail, we record a benefit considering the amounts and probabilities that could be realized upon ultimate settlement. If our judgment as to the likely resolution of the uncertainty changes, if the uncertainty is ultimately settled or if t

he statute of limitation related to the uncertainty expires, the effects of the change would be recognized in the period in which the change, resolution or expiration occurs. Our net liability for uncertain tax positions was $6.1 million and $6.6

million as of December 31, 201


and 201


, respectively, which includes estimated interest expense and penalties.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND TRENDS

Effects of Certain Factors on Results of Operations

Distributor Purchasing and Inventories

. The instrument consumables and rapid assa

y products in our CAG segment wer

e sold in the U.S. and

continue to be sold in

certain other geographies by third party distributors, who purchase products from us and sell them to veterinary practices, which are the end users. As a result, distributor purchasing dynamics have an impact on our reported sales of these products. Distributor purchasing dynamics may be affected by many factors and in a given period may not be directly related to underlying end-user demand for our products. Consequently, reported results may reflect fluctuations in inventory levels held at distributors and not necessarily reflect changes in underlying end-user demand. Therefore, we believe it is important to track distributor sales to end users and to distinguish between the impact of end-user demand and the impact of distributor purchasing dynamics on reported revenue.


Where growth rates are affected by changes in end-user demand, we refer to this as the impact of practice-level sales on growth. Where growth rates are affected by distributor purchasing dynamics, we refer to this as the impact of changes in distributors’ inventories on growth. If during the current year, distributors’ inventories grew by less than those inventories grew in the comparable period of the prior year, then changes in distributors’ inventories have an unfavorable impact on our reported sales growth in the current period. Conversely, if during the current year, distributors’ inventories grew by more than those inventories grew in the comparable period of the prior year, then changes in distributors’ inventories have a favorable impact on our reported sales growth in the current period.

Effective January 1, 2015, we fully transitioned to an all-direct sales strategy in the U.S. and did not renew our existing contracts with our former key U.S. distribution partners after their expiration at the end of 2014. Under this approach, we take orders, ship product, invoice and receive payment for all rapid assay test kits and instrument consumables in the U.S., aligning with our direct model for instruments, reference laboratory services, and other CAG products and services.

We incurred transition costs to implement this all-direct sales strategy in the U.S

.

, including approximately $5 million in incremental expense during the year ended December 31, 2014 resulting from the ramp up of sales and operating resources. We also incurred $9.5 million in non-recurring expenses during the year ended December 31, 2014 associated with project management and other one-time costs required to implement this new strategy.

Further, w

e incurred one-time transitional impacts related to the drawdown of distributor inventory in the fourth quarter of 2014, resulting in a reduction in revenue and operating profit of $25 million and $21 million, respectively.

During the three months ended December 31, 2014, we began recognizing revenue on rapid assay kits and instrument consumables

upon delivery to end users in the U.S., instead of at distribution. We continue to expect to capture an additional $50 million to $55 million in annual revenue on these direct sales. We estimate that annual operating profit associated with this incremental revenue stream will increase approximately $5 million to $8 million in 2015 and will continue to provide accretive benefits that will scale over time based on our expected future growth rates. Also as a result of the transition to an all-direct sales strategy in the U.S., we anticipate increased working capital demands of approximately $15 million to $20 million, inclu

ding inventory costs previously held by our distributors and incremental accounts receivable resulting from a potentially longer elapsed time to collect our receivables.

Currency Impact

.

Approximately 28% of our consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 26% of our consolidated revenue for

each of

the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 was derived from products manufactured in the U.S. and sold internationally in local currencies.

Strengthening of the rate of exchange for the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies has a negative impact on our revenues derived in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and on profits of products manufactured in the U.S. and sold internationally, and a weakening of the U.S. dollar has the opposite effect. Similarly, to the extent that the U.S. dollar is stronger in current or future periods relative to the exchange rates in effect in the corresponding prior periods, our growth rate will be negatively affected. The impact of foreign currency denominated operating expenses and foreign currency denominated supply contracts partly offsets this exposure. Additionally, our designated hedges of intercompany inventory purchases and sales help delay the impact of certain exchange rate fluctuations on non-U.S. denominated revenues.

See Item 7A. “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risks” included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding currency impact.

The impact on revenue resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates is not a measure defined by

accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”), otherwise referred to herein as a

non-GAAP financial measure. As exchange rates are an important factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons, we

believe the presentation of results normalized for changes in currency in addition to reported results helps improve investors’

ability to understand our operating results and evaluate our performance in comparison to prior periods.


Effective January 1, 2014, we calculate the impact on revenue resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange

rates by applying the difference between the weighted average exchange rates during the current year period and the

comparable previous year period to foreign currency denominated revenues for the prior year period. Prior to January 1, 2014,

we calculated this impact by applying the difference between the weighted average exchange rates during the current year

period and the comparable previous year period to foreign currency denominated revenues for the current year period. This

change in methodology, which was implemented to achieve operational efficiencies, has not had a material impact on organic

revenue growth. See the subsection below titled “Results of Operations” for the definition of and other information regarding

organic revenue growth.

During the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2013, changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased total company revenue by approximately $8.3 million, due primarily to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar, Australian dollar and Japanese yen, partly offset by a weakening of the U.S. dollar against the British pound.

During the twelve months ended December 31, 2013, compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2012, changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased total company revenue by approximately $9.5 million, due primarily to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen and the Australian dollar.

Effects of Economic Conditions

. Demand for our products and services is vulnerable to changes in the economic environment, including slow economic growth, high unemployment and credit availability. Negative or cautious consumer sentiment can lead to reduced or delayed consumer spending, resulting in a decreased number of patient visits to veterinary clinics. Unfavorable economic conditions can impact sales of instruments, digital radiography and practice management systems, which are larger capital purchases for veterinarians. Additionally, economic turmoil can cause our customers to remain sensitive to the pricing of our products and services. We monitor patient visits and clinic revenue data provided by a subset of our CAG customers. Although limited and susceptible to short-term impacts such as weather, we believe that this data provides a fair and meaningful long-term representation of the trend in patient visit activity in the U.S., providing us insight regarding demand for our products and services. We believe the overall trends in patient visits and capital investments since the beginning of the economic downturn in 2008 have had a slightly negative impact on our CAG segment revenue growth rates. Although the rate of growth has not been steady, we have seen an improvement in growth of patient visits since the beginning of 2012.

Economic conditions can also affect the purchasing decisions of our Water and LPD business customers. In the past,

water testing volumes have been susceptible to declines in discretionary testing and in mandated testing as a result of

decreases in home and commercial construction. Fiscal difficulties can also reduce government funding for water and

livestock testing programs.

We believe that the diversity of our products and services and the geographic diversity of our markets partially

mitigate the effects of the economic environment and negative consumer sentiment on our revenue growth rates.

Effects of Patent Expiration

. Although the Company had

and will have several patents and licenses of patents and technologies from third parties expire during 2014 and 2015,

the expiration of these patents or licenses, individually or in the aggregate, is not expected to have a material effect on the Company’s financial position or future operations due to a range of factors including

our brand strength and reputation in the marketplace; the breadth, quality and integration of our product offerings; our existing customer relationships and our customer support; our sales force; the applicable regulatory approval status for certain products; our continued investments in innovative product improvements that often result in new technologies and/or additional patents;

and

our

significant know-how, scale and investments related to manufacturing processes of associated product offerings.


Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2013

Revenue

The following revenue analysis and discussion focuses on organic revenue growth. Organic revenue growth is a non-GAAP financial measure and represents the percentage change in revenue during the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the same period for the prior year, net of the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and acquisitions. Organic revenue growth should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for or as a superior measure to, revenues reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Management believes that reporting organic revenue growth provides useful information to investors by facilitating easier comparisons of our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to the performance of our peers. We exclude the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates because changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not under management’s control, are subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends. We exclude the effect of acquisitions because the nature, size and number of acquisitions can vary dramatically from period to period and therefore can also obscure underlying business trends.

The percentage changes in revenue from foreign currency exchange rates and acquisitions are non-GAAP financial measures. See the subsection above titled “

Effects of Certain Factors on Results of Operations – Currency Impact

” for a description of the calculation of the percentage change in revenue resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The percentage change in revenue resulting from acquisitions represents incremental revenues attributable to acquisitions that have occurred since the beginning of the prior year period.

Total Company.

The following table presents revenue by operating segment:

W

e transitioned to an all-direct sales strategy in the U.S.

during

the fourt

h quarter of 2014, resulting in a drawdown of distributors’ inventory levels which reduced

both

reported

CAG and Total Company revenue growth by 2

%

.

U.S. and International Revenue.

The following table provides further analysis of total company revenue by U.S. markets and non-U.S., or international, markets:

The increase in both U.S. and international revenues was primarily driven by CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue.  The increase in international revenues was driven by stron

g growth in Europe and Asia-Pacific markets, most significantly from the United Kingdom, Germany, China, Australia and France.

W

e transitioned to an all-direct sales strategy in the U.S.

during

the fourt

h quarter of 2014, resulting in a drawdown of distributors’ inventory levels which reduced reported U.S. revenue growth by 3%. The impact of changes in distributors’ inventory levels did not have a significant impact on reported international revenue growth.


Companion Animal Group.

The following table presents revenue by product and service category for CAG:

The increase in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue was due primarily to increased volumes and higher realized prices in both our reference laboratory diagn

ostic services and our VetLab consumables.

T

he drawdown of inventory held by distributors

, as a result of our transition to an all-direct sales strategy in the U.S. during

the fourth quarter of 2014

,

reduced

reported

CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue by 3%.

VetLab consumables revenue growth was due primarily to higher unit volumes. The increase in unit volumes resulted primarily from growth of ou

r installed base of Catalyst

and ProCyte Dx

instruments as a result of new customer acquisitions, as well as an increase in testing from existing customers, including those who upgraded to these instruments. A

dditionally, VetLab consumables revenue benefited from higher average unit sales prices resulting from price increases

. These favorable impacts were partly offset by lower consumables volumes from our VetTest chemistry instrument as customers continue to upgrade from our VetTest instrument to our Catalyst instrument

s. The

drawdown of inventory held by distributors

, resulting from our

transition to an all-direct sales strategy in the U.S.

during

the fourth quarter of 2014, reduced reported consumables revenue growth by 5%.

VetLab

service and accessories revenue growth was primarily a result of the increase in our installed base of instruments.

The decrease in rapid assay revenue was due primarily to the drawdown of inventory held by distributors as we transitioned to an all-direct sales strategy in the U.S. during the fourth quarter of 2014, which reduced reported rapid assay revenue growth by 7%. This unfavorable factor was partly offset by higher sales of both our canine and feline testing products, resulting from both an increase in U.S. practice-level sales volumes and higher average unit sales prices.

The increase in reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services revenue was due primarily to the impact of higher volumes throughout our worldwide network of laboratories resulting from increased testing from existing customers, the acquisition of new customers and improved customer retention. Additionally, the increase in revenue was favorably impacted by higher average unit sales prices due to price increases.


The decrease in CAG Diagnostics capital instruments revenue was due primarily to the unfavorable impact of deferred revenue associated with preorders for our Catalyst One analyzer, which we launched du

ring the fourth quarter of 2014 and

the impact of lower realized prices. U

nder our Catalyst One introductory offer, customers are provided with the right to use a Catalyst Dx instrument through the Catalyst One

delivery

date. As a result, we do not recognize instrument revenue for preorders relating to the Catalyst One introductory offer until the Catalyst One is delivered

. These unfavorable impacts were partly offset by higher placements of our Catalyst Dx and ProCyte Dx instruments, primarily in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region, and placements of our SNAP Pro Mobile Device

in North America

. For the year ended December 31, 2014, the majority of SNAP Pro Mobile Device placements were made under a reagent rental program for which instrument revenue will be recognized with the future sale of consumables.

The increase in customer information management and digital imaging systems revenue was due primarily to a growing Pet Health Network Pro subscriber base, higher support revenue resulting from an increase in our installed base of digital imaging and practi

ce management systems and

higher revenue from hardware upgrades as a result of Microsoft ending support for Windows XP

.

Water.

The increase in Water revenue resulted from higher revenue from our Colilert products and related acce

ssories, due primarily to increased

sales volumes worldwide resulting from the acquisition of new customers.

Live

stock, Poultry and Dairy.

The increase in LPD organic revenue was due primarily to higher sales of certain bovine test products in the Asia-Pacific region, higher volumes in Europe of our milk-based bovine pregnancy test and higher sales of poultry tests in Europe and Latin America.

Lower European bovine volumes are expected to reduce

revenue by less than $5

million for t

he year ending December 31, 2015

.

The acquisition of a Brazilian distributor of our LPD products in the third quarter of 2013 added 4% to reported

revenue growth for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the prior year.

Other.

The increase in Other revenue was due primarily to

higher milestone revenue from our pharmaceutical out-licensing arrangements earned during the year ended December 31, 201

4 and higher sales volumes associated with our OPTI Medical consumables and pharmaceutical product line. These favorable impacts were partly offset by lower sales of our OPTI Medical instrument

s in Latin America.

Gross Profit

Total Company.

The following table presents gross profit and gross profit percentages by operating segment:

(1)

“Unallocated amounts” refers to items not allocated to our operating segments, including a portion of corporate support function and personnel-related expenses, certain manufacturing costs, corporate research and development expenses that do not align with one of our existing business or service categories, the difference between estimated and actual share-based compensation expense and certain foreign currency exchange gains and losses.

Companion Animal Group.

Gross profit for CAG increased due to higher sales and a slight increase in the gross profit percentage. The increase in gross profit percentage was due primarily to lower overall VetLab product costs and price increases across our CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue portfolio.

These favorable factors were partly offset by impacts related to our transition to an all-direct sales strategy in the U.S.

during

the fourth quarter of 2014, including an unfavorable product mix resulting from the inventory drawdown of high

er

margin rapid assay test kits and VetLab consumables from our U.S. distributors and higher freight and distribution costs.


Water.

Gross profit for Water increased due primarily to higher sales. The slight increase in the gross profit percentage was due primarily to a more favorable product mix resulting from higher relative sales of our Colilert products which yield higher m

argins,

lower overall manufacturing costs resulting from

a

decrease

in

materials costs

and higher average unit sales prices due to price increases

.

These favorable factors were partly offset by the unfavorable impact of currency due primarily to lower relative hedging gains during the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the prior year.

Livestock, Poultry and Dairy.

Gross profit for LPD increased due to an improvement in the gross profit percentage to 62% from 55% and higher sales. The increase in the gross profit percentage resulted from lower overall manufacturing costs

,

driven by higher production volumes

,

a decrease in royalty expense

and higher average unit sales prices

. The decrease in r

oyalty expense was due primarily to an agreement executed in the first quarter of 2014 with a licensor of patents related to the sale of certain swine tests.

Other.

Gross profit for Ot

her increased due to higher sales and an improvement in the gross profit percentage to 53% from 50%. The increase in the gross profit percentage was due primarily to lower overall manufacturing costs in our OPTI Medical business

,

resulting from a reduction in material costs and

higher production volumes

, and

an increase in

milestone revenue related to our pharmaceutical out-licensing arrangements, for wh

ich there is no associated costs

of revenue. These favorable factors were partly offset by higher cost of service associated with OPTI Medical instruments and a decrease in average unit sales prices on related consumables.

Unallocated Amounts.

Gross profit for Unallocated Amounts decreased due primarily to an increase in certain manufacturing costs and changes in certain currency exchange rates.

The manufacturing costs reported in our operating segments include our standard cost for products sold and any variances from standard cost for products purchased or manufactured within the period. We capitalize these variances for inventory on hand at the end of the period to record inventory in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We then record these variances as cost of product revenue as that inventory is sold. The impact to cost of product revenue resulting from this variance capitalization and subsequent recognition is reported within the caption “Unallocated Amounts.” The net unfavorable impact to gross profit as a result of increased manufacturing costs was due to the capitalization of favorable manufacturing variances, primarily within our LPD business, during the year ended December 31, 2014.

In certain geographies where we maintain inventories in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, the product costs reported in our operating segments include our standard cost for products sold, which is stated at the budgeted currency exchange rate from the beginning of the fiscal year. In these geographies, the variances from standard cost for products sold related to changes in currency exchange rates are reported within the caption “Unallocated Amounts.” The U.S. dollar strengthened significantly against the Japanese yen

during the year ended December 31, 201

3. The strengthening in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the Japanese yen during the year ended December 31, 2014 was less significant, as compared to the prior year, resulting in a lower favorable variance within Unallocated Amounts relating to the cost of products sold in Japanese yen.

Operating Expenses and Operating Income

Total Company.

The following tables present operating expenses and operating income by operating segment:


The transition to

an all-direct sales strategy in the U.S. within our CAG segment

reduced operating profit by $35.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2014. These impacts consisted of a one-time reduction in operating profit related to the drawdown of inventory held by our U.S. distributors, which reduced operating income by $20.8 million, $5.0 million in incremental expenses related to the ramp up of sales and operating resources and

approximately $9.5 million

of non-recurring expenses

during the year ended December 31, 2014.  For the year e

nded December 31, 2014,

adjusted operating income, which is

t

otal Company operating income adjusted for the aforementioned transit

ion impacts was approximately $295.6 million and 19.6

% of revenue, which represents an increase in adjust

ed operating income of $24.7 million and 9.1

%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, which is adjusted for the 2013 bankruptcy of a third-party service pro

vider of approximately $4.1 million. Adjusted operating income is a non-GAAP financial measure and should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for or as a superior measure to, operating income reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Management believes that reporting adjusted operating income provides useful information to investors by facilitating easier comparisons of our operating income performance with prior and future periods and to the performance of our peers.

See the subsection above titled “Effects of Certain Factors on Results of Operations – Distributor Purchasing and Inventories” for details regarding anticipated transitional costs related to moving to an all-direct sales strategy for VetLab consumables and rapid assay products and services within our CAG segment in the U.S.

Companion Animal Group.

The following table presents CAG operating expenses by functional area:

The increase in sales and marketing expense resulted from higher personnel-related costs across all major regions, including our North American sales force transformation started in the second half of 2013 and increased commissions resulting from improved sales performance; and non-recurring consulting costs related to the aforementioned implementation of an all-direct sales strategy in the U.

S. The increase in general and administrative expense resulted primarily from higher personnel-related costs and, to a lesser extent, depreciation of

internal-use software, partly offset by the favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates

. The increase in research and development expense resulted primarily from higher person

nel-related costs and increased materials costs, partly offset by lower external consulting and development costs.


Water.

The following table presents Water

operating

expenses by functional area:

The increase in sales and marketing expense was due primarily to higher personnel-related costs

and incremental spending on promotional activities. Personnel-related costs included

commissions related to improved sales performance, and incremental costs associated with the acquisition of our distributor in South Africa in the fourth qu

arter of 2013. The increase in general and administrative expense resulted primarily from higher personnel-related costs. Th

e increase in research and development expense was due primarily to higher materials costs.

Livestock, Poultry and Dairy.

The following table presents LPD operating expenses by functional area:

The increase in sales and marketing expense resulted from higher personnel-related costs, including incremental costs associated with the acquisition of a Brazilian distributor in the third quarter of 2013 and com

mercial team investments worldwide, most significantly in the Asia-Pacific region. The increase in general and administrative expense resulted from incremental costs associated with the acquisition of the Brazilian distributor, prima

rily personnel-related costs and

higher amortization of the acquired intangible assets. The increase in research and development expense was due primarily to higher personnel-related costs.

Other.

Operating expenses for Other increased $1.5 million to $11.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the pri

or year due primarily to higher

personnel-related costs and an increase in external development and consulting costs in our OPTI Medical line of business.

Unallocated Amounts.

Operating expenses that are not allocated to our operating segments increased by $0.9 million to $13.1 millio

n for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the prior year, due primarily to cer

tain foreign exchange losses and

an increase in certain personnel-related costs

. These unfavorable factors were partly offset by the absence of a $4.1 million loss incurred during the year ended December 31, 2013 resulting from the bankruptcy of a freight payment and audit service provider.

Over the second half of 2014, the U.S. dollar experienced a continued and persistent strengthening relative to

all major foreign currencies in which we transact

, resulting in realized and unrealized losses on monetary assets, partly offset by gains on liabilities denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar.

We estimate certain personnel-related costs and allocate the estimated expenses to the operating segments. This allocation differs from actual expense and consequently yields a difference that is reported under the caption “Unallocated Amounts.”


Interest Income and Interest Expense

Interest income was $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to $1.9 million for the

prior year

. The decrease in interest income resulted from our June 2014 disposition of a debt investment and repayment of the related notes receivable, partly offset by

increased interest income earned on

higher average cash balances. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding the disposition of this strategic investment.

Interest expense was $15.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to $5.4 million for the prior year. The increase in interest expense was due primarily to senior notes that we issued and sold through three private placements between December 2013 and September 2014 in an aggregate principal amount of $350 million. Fixed interest rates on the senior notes range from 3.32% to 4.04%. See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our senior notes.

Provision for Income Taxes

Our effective income tax rate was 26.2% for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 28.7% for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease in our effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013,

was related to higher relative earnings subject to international tax rates that are lower than domestic tax rates, a non-recurring

benefit related to the deferral of intercompany profits that were included in prior year tax provisions in error, which is not material to current or prior interim or annual periods, and the resolution of domestic and international tax audits, which resulted in a net reduction in our provision for uncertain tax positions.  These favorable factors were partly offset by a reduction in the benefit from the U.S. research and development (“R&D”) tax credit.  During the three months ended March 31, 2013, legislation in the U.S. retroactively allowed the R&D tax credit for all of 2012 and extended the R&D tax credit through the year ending December 31, 2013.  As a result, in the year ending December 31, 2013 we recorded the benefit of two years of R&D tax credit as compared to the year ending December 31, 2014 in which we have recorded only the benefit related to that year’s activities.

In 2015, it is reasonably possible that we could recognize up to $0.4 million of income tax benefits that have not been recognized at December 31, 2014. The income tax benefits are primarily due to the lapse in the statutes of limitations for various tax jurisdictions.

Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2013 Compared to Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2012

Revenue

The following revenue analysis and discussion focuses on organic revenue growth. Organic revenue growth is a non-GAAP financial measure and represents the p

ercentage change in revenue during the twelve months ended December 31, 2013, as compared to the same period for the prior year, net of the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and acquisitions. Organic revenue growth should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for or as a superior measure to, revenues reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Management believes that reporting organic revenue growth provides useful information to investors by facilitating easier comparisons of our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to the performance of our peers. We exclude the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates because changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not under management’s control, are subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends. We exclude the effect of acquisitions because the nature, size and number of acquisitions can vary dramatically from period to period and therefore can also obscure underlying business trends.

The percentage changes in revenue from foreign currency exchange rates and acquisitions are non-GAAP financial measures. See the subsection above titled “

Effects of Certain Factors on Results of Operations – Currency Impact

” for a description of the calculation of the percentage change in revenue resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The percentage change in revenue resulting from acquisitions represents incremental revenues attributable to acquisitions that have occurred since the beginning of the prior year period.


Total Company.

The following table presents revenue by operating segment:

U.S. and International Revenue.

The following table provides further analysis of total company revenue by U.S. markets and non-U.S., or international, markets:

The increase in both U.S. and international revenues was primarily driven by CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue. The increase in international revenues was driven by strong growth in Europe and Asia-Pacific

markets, most significantly within

the Nordic countries

as a result of our move to a direct sales model in this region during the first quarter of 2013, Germany and

China. The impact of changes in distributors’ inventory levels reduced U.S

.

revenue growth by approximately 1% and did not have a significant impact on reported international revenue growth.

Companion Animal Group.

The following table presents revenue by product and service category for CAG:

The increase in CAG Diagnostics recurring revenue is due primarily to increased volumes and higher realized prices in both our reference laboratory diagnostic services and our VetLab consumables.


VetLab consumables revenue growth was due to higher unit volumes and higher realized prices. The increase in unit volumes resulted primarily from growth of our installed base for our Catalyst Dx and ProCyte Dx

instruments as a result of customer acquisitions, as well as an increase in testing from existing customers who upgraded to these instruments, partially offset by lower sales of consumables used with our VetTest chemistry instrument. Higher realized prices were the result of changes in certain distributor arrangements and list price increases. The impact of changes in distributors’ inventory levels reduced reported consumables revenue growth by approximately 1%.

VetLab

service and accessories revenue growth was primarily a result of the increase in our active installed base of instruments.

The increase in rapid assay product revenue was due primarily to both higher unit volumes and higher realized prices resulting from price increases and a change in a distributor arrangement. Higher sales volumes were driven by an increase in U.S. canine practice-level sales volumes and increased volumes of our canine pancreatitis products. The impact of changes in distributors’ inventory levels did not have a significant impact on revenue growth.

The increase in reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services revenue resulted from the impact of both increased testing volumes and price increases. Higher testing volumes were driven by the acquisition of new customers, increased testing volumes from existing customers and improved customer retention.

The decrease in CAG Diagnostics capital instruments revenue was due primarily to the impact of customer programs. The impact from customer programs includes a reagent rental program that we launched in North America during the fourth quarter of 2012. Under the reagent rental program, VetLab instrument revenue is recognized over the term of the minimum purchase agreement instead of at the time we place the instrument.

The increase in customer information management and digital imaging systems revenue resulted primarily from higher support revenue due to an increase in our active installed base and revenue from Pet Health Network Pro, which launched commercially in the first quarter of 2013. These favorable factors were partly offset by a decrease in digital radiography system placements.

Water.

The increase in Water revenue was due primarily to higher sales volumes of our Colilert products and related accessories in Europe and North America, driven by new account acquisitions and higher average unit sales prices.

Livestock, Poultry and Dairy.

The decrease in LPD revenue resulted primarily from lower sales volumes of BSE tests resulting from changes in European testing requirements and a reduction in sales volumes of our Dairy SNAP tests used for the detection of the contaminant Aflatoxin M1 and antibiotic residues in milk. In early 2012, Dairy SNAP sales volumes were favorably impacted by testing as a result of an Aflatoxin M1 outbreak in China; testing volumes in China subsided over the remainder of 2012. These unfavorable factors were partly offset by higher sales of certain bovine tests resulting from increased testing levels from government programs and higher sales volumes of certain poultry and swine tests.

Other.

Other revenue for the year ended December 31, 2013 was generally consistent with the prior year as lower sales volumes associated with our pharmaceutical product line were almost entirely offset by higher sales volumes of consumables and accessories used with our OPTI Medical instruments.


Gross Profit

Total Company.

The following table presents gross profit and gross profit percentages by operating segment:

Companion Animal Group.

Gross profit for CAG increased due to higher sales and an increase in the gross profit percentage to 54% from 52%. The increase in the gross profit percentage was due primarily to price increases for our reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services, VetLab consumables and, to a lesser extent, rapid assay products and volume-related efficiencies realized throughout our reference laboratory operations.

Water.

Gross profit for Water increased due primarily to higher sales. The gross profit percentage for the year ended December 31, 2013 was generally consistent with the prior year, as the unfavorable impact of currency was mostly offset by higher average unit sales prices. The unfavorable impact of currency was due primarily to hedging losses during the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to hedging gains during the prior year.

Livestock, Poultry and Dairy.

Gross profit for LPD decreased due to a decrease in the gross profit percentage to 55% from 59%, partly offset by higher sales. The decrease in the gross profit percentage was due primarily to higher overall manufacturing costs and the unfavorable impact of currency. Higher manufacturing costs were due primarily to an increase in materials costs and lower production volumes in certain product lines. The unfavorable impact of currency was due primarily to hedging losses during the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to hedging gains during the prior year.

Other.

Gross profit for Other increased due to an increase in the gross profit percentage to 50% from 42%, due primarily to lower overall OPTI Medical manufacturing costs resulting from a reduction in materials costs and higher relative sales of consumables used with our OPTI Medical instruments and milestone and royalty revenue earned from our remaining pharmaceutical out-licensing arrangements, both of which yield higher relative margins.

Unallocated Amounts.

Gross profit for Unallocated Amounts increased due primarily to changes in certain currency exchange rates and a decrease in certain manufacturing costs, partly offset by an increase in personnel-related costs.

In certain geographies where we maintain inventories in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, the product costs reported in our operating segments include our standard cost for products sold, which is stated at the budgeted currency exchange rate from the beginning of the fiscal year. In these geographies, the variances from standard cost for products sold related to changes in currency exchange rates are reported within the caption “Unallocated Amounts.” For the year ended December 31, 2013, these variances were due primarily to the cost of products sold in Japanese yen.

The manufacturing costs reported in our operating segments include our standard cost for products sold and any variances from standard cost for products purchased or manufactured within the period. We capitalize these variances for inventory on hand at the end of the period to record inventory in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We then record these variances as cost of product revenue as that inventory is sold. The impact to cost of product revenue resulting from this variance capitalization and subsequent recognition is reported within the caption “Unallocated Amounts.” The decrease in certain manufacturing costs is due primarily to the recognition of previously favorable capitalized variances.


We estimate certain personnel-related costs and allocate the estimated expenses to the operating segments. This allocation differs from actual expense and consequently yields a difference that is reported under the caption “Unallocated Amounts.” The increase in personnel-related costs for Unallocated Amounts is due primarily to higher self-insured healthcare costs during the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the prior year.

Operating Expenses and Operating Income

Total Company.

The following tables present operating expenses and operating income by operating segment:

Companion Animal Group.

The following table presents CAG operating expenses by functional area:

The increase in sales and marketing expense was due primarily to increased personnel-related costs from investment in our commercial organizations in all major regions, including the completion of our North American sales force expansion and associated marketing and consulting costs related to this transformation. The increase in general and administrative expense resulted primarily from increased personnel-related costs and an increase in costs attributable to investments in information technology. The increase in research and development expense resulted primarily from higher personnel-related costs and an increase in consulting and external development costs.

Water.

The following table presents Water

operating

expenses by functional area:


The increase in sales and marketing and general and administrative expense resulted primarily from higher personnel-related costs. Research and development expense for the year ended December 31, 2013 was generally consistent with the prior year.

Livestock, Poultry and Dairy.

The following table presents LPD operating expenses by functional area:

The increase in sales and marketing expense resulted primarily from higher personnel-related costs

, including

costs associated with the acquisition of a Brazilian distributor, and increased spending on promotional activities in the Asia

-

Pacific region. The increase in general and administrative expense was due primarily to costs associated with the acquisition and integration of the Brazilian distributor, a portion of which will not recur, partly offset by lower personnel-related costs and a decrease in intangible asset amortization. Research and development expense during the year ended December 31, 2013 was generally consistent with the prior year.

Other.

Operating expenses for Other increased $2.5 million to $10.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, due primarily to a $3.5 million milestone payment earned during the year ended December 31, 2012 related to the 2008 sale of product rights previously included in our pharmaceutical product line, partly offset by lower personnel-related costs in our OPTI Medical line of business. The pharmaceutical milestone payment was not classified as revenue because the transaction was accounted for as the sale of a business; rather it

was reflected as

a reduction

to general and administrative expenses as earned.

Unallocated Amounts.

Operating expenses that are not allocated to our operating segments

increased $4.9 million to $12.1

million

for the year

ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the prior year due primarily to losses incurred resulting from the bankruptcy of a freight payment and audit service provider (“freight service company”), partly offset by lower legal and other professional fees incurred as

a

result of the resolution of the FTC investigation in February 2013 and proceeds received during 2013 in connection with the demutualization of an insurance provider. In March 2013, the freight service company provided notice to us that all freight payment services would cease immediately and that certain amounts paid by us to the freight service company were not subsequently remitted to our freight carriers due to an employee fraud and a breakdown in internal controls, both at the freight service company, concluding in significant losses and the resulting bankruptcy. In response, we recorded a $3.9 million loss related to these unremitted amounts in general and administrative expense during the year ended December 31, 2013. We continue to monitor the freight service company’s bankruptcy proceeding, but we cannot be certain of any recovery at this time.

Interest Income and Interest Expense

Interest income was $1.9 million for both the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012.

Interest expense was $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to $3.8 million for the same period of the prior year. The increase in interest expense was due primarily to higher average balances outstanding on our unsecured revolving credit facility and senior notes that we issued and sold through a private placement in an aggregate amount of $150 million in December 2013. The senior notes consist of $75 million of 3.94% Series A Senior Notes due December 11, 2023 and $75 million of 4.04% Series B Senior Notes due December 11, 2025. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information about our senior notes.


Provision for Income Taxes

Our effective income tax rate was 28.7% for the year ended December 31, 2013 and 31.6% for the year ended December 31, 2012. The decrease in our effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2013, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012, was due primarily to the research and development (“R&D”) tax credit. For the year ended December 31, 2012, the U.S. legislation authorizing the R&D tax credit had expired and no associated tax benefit was recognized within this period. On January 2, 2013, U.S. federal legislation was enacted that retroactively allowed an R&D tax credit for all of 2012 and extended the R&D tax credit through the

year

ending December 31, 2013. Because the related legislation was enacted in 2013, the full benefit of the R&D tax credit related to the prior year’s activities was recognized in 2013. In addition, higher relative earnings subject to international tax rates that are lower than domestic tax rates also contributed to the decrease in our effective income tax rate.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

A discussion of recent accounting pronouncements is included in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for

the year ended December 31, 2014

included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

We fund the capital needs of our business through cash on hand, funds generated from operations, and amounts available under our unsecured revolving credit facility, which we refinanced in June 2014 by entering into an amended and restated five-year unsecu

red revolving credit facility in the principal amount of $700 million (the amended and restated credit facility and the previous credit facility are referred to collectively as the “Credit Facility”). In addition, we issued $150 million, $125 million, $75 million and $150 million of our senior notes in December 2013, July 2014, September 2014 and February 2015, respectively. At December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, we had $322.5

million and

$279.1

million, respectively, of cash and cash equivalents, and

negative

working capi

tal of ($61.5) million and working capital of $174.4

million, respectively. Additionally, at December 31, 201


, we had remaining borrowing availabilit

y of $150 million under our $700

million Credit Facility. We believe that, if necessary, we could obtain additional borrowings at

similar rates to our existing borrowings

to fund our growth objectives.

We further believe that current cash and cash equivalents, funds generated from operations, a

nd committed borrowing availability

will be sufficient to fund our operations, capital purc

hase requirements, and anticipated

growth needs for the next twelve months.

We believe that t

hese resources

,

coupled with our ability, as needed, to obtain additional financing on favorable terms will be

sufficient for the foreseeable future

to fund our business as currently conducted.

We consider the majority of the operating earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the U.S.

No provision has been made for the payment of U.S. federal and state or international taxes that may result from future remittances of these undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries.

Changes to this position could have adverse tax consequences.

A determination of the related tax liability that would be paid on these undistributed earnings if repatriated is not practicable.

We manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among all of our subsidiaries. Our foreign cash balances are generally available without restrictions to fund o

rdinary business operations outside the U.S.

Of our total cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2014, approximately $321.5 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries and was subject to material repatriation tax effects

. As of December 31, 2014,


% of the cash and cash equivalents held by our

foreign

subsidiaries was invested in money market funds restricted to U.S. government and agency securities and


% was held as bank deposits. As of December 31, 2014, approximately 66% of the cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries was held in U.S. dollars.

Should we require more capital in the U.S. than is generated by our operations domestically, for example to fund significant discretionary activities, we could elect to repatriate future earnings from foreign jurisdictions or raise capital in the U.S. through debt or equity issuances. These alternatives could result in higher effective tax rates or increased interest expense and other dilution of our earnings. We have borrowed funds domestically and continue to have the ability to borrow funds domestically at reasonable interest rates.


The following table presents additional key information concerning working capital:

(1)

Days sales outstanding represents the average of the accounts receivable balances at the beginning and end of each quarter divided by revenue for that quarter, the result of which is then multiplied by 91.25 days.

(2)

Inventory turns represent inventory-related cost of product revenue for the 12 months preceding each quarter-end divided by the inventory balance at the end of the quarter.

Sources and Uses of Cash

The following table presents cash provided (used):

Operating Activities.

Cash provided b

y operating activities was $235.8

million for

the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $246.0

million for the same period in 201


. The total of net income and net non-cash charges, excluding the impact of reclassifying the tax benefit from share-based compensation arrangements to a financ

ing activity, was $261.6

million for the year ended Dece

mber 31, 2014 compared to $263.2

mil

lion for the same period in 2013

, resulting in

a reduction in operating cash flows of $1.6

million driven primarily by the

de

crease in net income,

partly offset by higher depreciation and amortization.

The total of changes in operating assets and liabilities and the tax benefit from share-based compensation arra

ngements decreased cash by $25.8

million during the year ended December 31, 201


,

compared to a decrease of $17.2

million for the year ended December 31, 201


, resulting in an incr

emental increase in cash of $8.6

million.

The following table presents cash flows from changes in operating assets and liabilities and the tax benefit from share-based compensation arrangements:


The incremental cash used by inventory during the year ended December 31, 2014

as compared to the prior year

was due primarily to

support higher expected demand for our CAG diagnostic

instruments, as well as higher inventory levels for our kits and consumables to support our all-direct strategy in the U.S.

The increase in cash used by other assets during the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the prior year was due primarily to higher income taxes receivable resulting from the Tax Increase Prevention Act that was enacted late in the year and the deferred cost of Catalyst instrument placements under our Catalyst One introductory offer launched in the first quarter of 2014. The Tax Increase Prevention Act retroactively extended the R&D tax credit and bonus depreciation and reduced our income taxes due related to the year ended December 31, 20

14. The increase in cash provided by accrued liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2014 was greater than the prior year due primarily to the timing of income tax payments, higher

accruals related to

employee incenti

ve programs,

co

ntingent consideration related to business combinations and accrued interest related to higher borrowings under our senior notes at December 31, 2014 as compared to the prior year end.

The decrease in cash used by accounts receivable during the year ended December 31, 2014 resulted pri

marily from the impact of lower revenues in the fourth quarter

of


as compared to the

fourth quarter of 2013 related to our all-direct strategy in the U.S

. T

he in

crease in cash provided by accounts

payable during the year ended December 31

, 2014 as compared

to

the prior year was due primarily to the timing of vendor payments. The incremental cash provided by deferred re

venue for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to

the prior year was due primarily to sales under our Catalyst One

introductory offer

.

We historicall

y have experienced proportionally lower net cash flows from operating activities during the first

quarter and proportionally higher cash flows from operating activities for the remainder of the year and for the annual period

driven primarily by payments related to annual employee incentive programs in the first quarter following the year for which

the bonuses were earned and the seasonality of vector-borne disease testing, which has historically resulted in significant

increases in accounts receivable balances during the first quarter of the year.

Investing Activities.

Cash used by investing activities was $80.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to $86.1 million for the same period in 2013. The decrease in cash used by investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2014 was due primar

ily to reduced capital expenditures, resulting from the completion of our headquarters facility expansion in August 2013, partly offset by incremental cash used to acquire businesses during the year ended December 31, 2014. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information about our business acquisitions.

Our total capital expenditure plan for 2015 is e

stimated to be approximately $85

million, which includes capital investments in manufacturing and reference laboratory equipment, investments in internal use software and inform

ation technology infrastructure and

the renovation and expansion of our facilities and reference laboratories.

Financing Activities.

Cash used by financing activities was $103.4 million fo

r

the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to cash used of $102.5

mil

lion for the same period in 2013. The

increase in cash used to repurchase common stock was offset by higher relative net borrowings under the Credit Facility and a $50 million increase in the issuance of long-term debt during the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the prior year.


Cash used to repurchase shares of our

common stock increased by $250.4

million during

the year ended December 31, 2014

compared to the prior year. From the inception of our share repurchase program in

August 1999 to December 31, 2014

, we have repurchased

53.9 millio

n shares. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we purchased 4.9 million shares for an aggregate cost of $618.2 million compared to purchases of 4.0 million shares for an aggregate cost of $367.8 million during 2013. We believe that the repurchase of our common stock is a favorable means of returning value to our shareholders and we also repurchase our stock to offset the dilutive effect of our share-based compensation programs. Repurchases of our common stock may vary depending upon the level of other investing activities and the share price. See Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information about our share

repurchases.

As noted above, in June 2014, we refinanced our existing $450 million Credit Facility and increased the principal amount thereunder to $700 million. The Credit Facility matures on June 18, 2019 and requires no scheduled prepayments before that date.

Although the Credit Facility does not mature until June 18, 2019, all individual borrowings under the terms of the Credit Facility have a stated term between 30 and 180 days. At the end of each term, the obligation is either repaid or rolled over into a new borrowing. The Credit Facility contains a subjective material adverse event clause, which allows the debt holders to call the loans under the Credit Facility if we fail to provide prompt written notice to the syndicate of such an event. Based on the stated term and the existence of the subjective material adverse event clause, this Credit Facility is reflected in the current liabilities section of our consolidated balance sheets.

Applicable interest rates on borrowings under the Credit Facility generally range from 0.875 to 1.375 percentage points above the London interbank offered rate or the Canadian Dollar-denominated bankers’ acceptance rate, based on our leverage ratio, or the prevailing prime rate plus a maximum spread of up to 0.375%, based on our leverage ratio.

Net borrowing and repayment activity under the Credit Facility resulted in incremental cash provided of $207

.0

million during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the prior year. At December 31, 2014

, we had $549

.0 million outstanding under the Credit Facility.

The general availability of funds under the Credit Facility was further reduced by $1.0 million for a letter of

credit

that was issued in connection with claims under our workers’ compensation policy.

The Credit Facility contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants customary for financings of this type. The negative covenants include restrictions on liens, indebtedness of subsidiaries of the Company, fundamental changes, investments, transactions with affiliates and certain restrictive agreements. The financial covenant is a consolidated leverage ratio test that requires our ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and share-based compensation not to exceed 3.5-to-1. At December 31, 2014, we were in compliance with the covenants of the Credit Facility.

The obligations under the Credit Facility may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Credit Facility, which includes customary events of default including payment defaults, defaults in the performance of the affirmative, negative and financial covenants, the inaccuracy of representations or warranties, bankruptcy and insolvency related defaults, defaults relating to judgments, certain events related to employee pension benefit plans under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, the failure to pay specified indebtedness, cross-acceleration to

specified indebtedness

and a change of control default.

In December 2013, we issued and sold through a private placement an aggregate principal amount of $150 million of senior notes consisting of $75 million of 3.94% Series A Senior Notes due December 11, 2023 (the “2023 Notes”) and $75 million of 4.04% Series B Senior Notes due December 11, 2025 (the “2025 Notes” and together with the 2023 Notes, the “December Notes”) under a Note Purchase Agreement among the Company, New York Life Insurance Company and the accredited institutional purchasers named therein (the “December 2013 Note Agreement”).

In July 2014, we issued and sold through a private placement an aggregate principal amount of $125 million of senior notes consisting of $75 million of 3.76% Series B Senior Notes due July 21, 2024 (the “2024 Notes”) and $50 million of 3.32% Series A Senior Notes due July 21, 2021 (the “2021 Notes” and together with the 2024 Notes, the “Prudential Notes”) under a Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement among the Company, Prudential Investment Management, Inc. and the accredited institutional purchasers named therein (the “July 2014 Note Agreement”).


In September 2014, we issued and sold through a private placement an aggregate principal amount of $75 million of 3.72% Senior Notes due September 4, 2026 (the “2026 Notes” and together with the Prudential Notes and the December Notes, the “Senior Notes”) under a Note Purchase Agreement dated as of July 22, 2014 among the Company, New York Life Insurance Company and the accredited institutional purchasers named therein (such agreement, together with July 2014 Note Agreement and December 2013 Note Agreement, the “Senior Note Agreements”).

The Senior Note Agreements contain affirmative, negative and financial covenants customary for agreements of this type. The negative covenants include restrictions on liens, indebtedness of our subsidiaries, priority indebtedness, fundamental changes, investments, transactions with affiliates, certain restrictive agreements and violations of laws and regulations. The financial covenant is a consolidated leverage ratio test that requires our ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and share-based compensation, as defined in the Senior Note Agreements, not to exceed 3.5-to-1. At December 31, 2014, we were in compliance with the covenants of the Senior Note Agreements.

Should we elect to prepay the Senior Notes, such aggregate prepayment will include the applicable make-whole amount(s), as defined within the applicable Senior Note Agreements. Additionally,

in the event of a change in control of the Company or upon the disposition of certain assets of the Company the proceeds of which are not reinvested (as defined in the Senior Note Agreements), we may be required to prepay all or a portion of the Senior Notes.

The obligations under the Senior Notes may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an event of default under the applicable Senior Note Agreement, each of which includes customary events of default including payment defaults, defaults in the performance of the affirmative, negative and financial covenants, the inaccuracy of representations or warranties, bankruptcy and insolvency related defaults, defaults relating to judgments, certain events related to employee pension benefit plans under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, the failure to pay specified indebtedness and cross-acceleration to

specified indebtedness

.

Other Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees

Under our workers

’

compensation insurance policies for U.S. employees, we have retained the first

$300,000, $250,000 and

$250,000 in claim liability per incident with aggregate maximum claim liabilities

per year of

$2.3 million

for the year ended December 31, 2014 and $2.0 million for each of the years ended December 31,

2013 and 2012, respectively.

We have recogn

ized cumulative expenses of $1.1 million, $0.5 million, and $0.6

million for claims incurred during t

he years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012

, respectively. Our

estimated liability for worker

s

’

compensation was

$1.4 million and

$1.2 millio

n as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively

. Claims incurred during the years e

nded December 31, 2014 and 2013

are relatively undeveloped as of December 31, 201


. Therefore, it is possible that we could incur additional healthcare and wage indemnification costs beyond those previously recognized up to our aggregate liability for each of the respec

tive claim years. For the

years ended on or pr

ior to December 31, 2012

, based on our retained claim liability per incident and our aggregate claim liability per year, our maximum

liability

in excess of the amounts deemed probable and previously recognized is not material

as of December 31, 2014. As of December 31, 2014

, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling $1.3 million to the insurance companies as security for these claims in connection with these policies.

Under our current employee healthcare insurance policy for U.S. employees, we retain claims liability risk up to $37

5,000

, $325

,000

and $300

,000

per incident per year in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. We recognized employee healthcare claim expense of $32

.

0 million, $29.2 million and $23

.0

million during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, which includes actual claims paid and an estimate of our liability for the uninsured portion of employee healthcare obligations that have been incurred but not paid. Should employee health insurance claims exceed our estimated liability, we would have further obligations. Our estimated liability for healthcare claims that have been incurred but not paid as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 was $

4.

1 million and $4.3 million, respectively.

We have

total

contingent

liabilities

outstanding of up to $



.

8 million

primarily

related to the achievement of certain revenue milestones. We have recorded

$6.3

million of contingent commitments on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2014. The amount of contingent consideration recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2013 was not material. We have not accrued for

$5.

5 million of contingent liabilities, related to the acquisition of an

intangible asset in 2008

,

as we do not deem

the achievement of associated revenue milestones

to be probable of occurring as of December 31, 2014.


W

e are contractually obligated to make the following payments in the years below:

(1)

Long-term debt amounts include interest payments associated with long-term debt.

(2)

Purchase obligations include agreements and purchase orders to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities, pricing, and approximate timing of purchase transactions.

These commitments do not reflect u

nrecognized tax benefits of $5.9

million and deferred compensation liabilities of $2.7 million as of December 31, 2014 as the timing of recognitio

n is uncertain. Refer to Note 11

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK

Our market risk consists primarily of foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk. Our functional currency is the U.S. dollar and our primary manuf

acturing operations and

inventory supply contracts are in the U.S., but we distribute our products worldwide both through direct export and through our foreign subsidiaries. Our primary foreign currency transaction risk consists of intercompany purchases and sales of products and we attempt to mitigate this risk through our hedging program d

escribed below. Approximately 28

% of our consolidat

ed rev

enue for

the year

ended December 31,

2014 and 26% of our consolidated revenue for

each of

the years ended December 31, 2013 and

2012 was derived from products manufactured in the U.S. and sold internationally in local currencies.

The functional currency of most of our subsidiaries

is their local currency. For two

of our subsidiaries located in the Netherlands

and Singapore

, the functional currency is the U.S. dollar.

The primary purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to protect against the volatility associated with foreign currency transactions.

We also utilize natural hedges to mitigate our transaction and commitment exposures. Our

corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity.

We enter into foreign currency exchange contracts with large multinational financial institutions and we do not hold or engage in transactions involving derivative instruments for purposes other than risk management. Our accounting policies for these contracts are based on our designation of such instruments as hedging transactions.

If a derivative instrument qualifies for hedge accounting, changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument from the effective portion of the hedge are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. We immediately record in earnings the extent to which a hedge instrument is not effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value. We primarily utilize foreign currency exchange contracts with durations of less than 24 months.

Our subsidiaries enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to manage the exchange risk associated with their forecasted intercompany inventory purchases and sales for the next year. From time to time, we may also enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations associated with specific, significant trans

actions. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013

, we were not hedging any specific, significant transactions.


Our foreign currency hedging strategy is consistent with prior periods and there were no material changes in our market risk exposure during

the year ended December 31, 2014

.

We enter into foreign currency exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges for amounts that are less than the full value of forecasted intercompany purchases and sales and for amounts that are equivalent to, or less than, other significant transactions. As a result, no significant ineffectiveness has resulted or been recorded through the statements of operations for the years ended Decem

ber 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012

.

Our hedging strategy related to

intercompany inventory purchases and sales is to employ

the full amount of our hedges for the succeeding year at the conclusion of our budgeting process for that year. Quarterly, we enter into contracts to hedge incremental portions of anticipated foreign currency transactions for the current and following year. Accordingly, our risk with respect to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may vary throughout each annual cycle.

We enter into hedge agreements where we believe we have meaningful exposure to foreign currency exchange risk.

The notional amount of foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge forecasted intercompany purchase

s

and sales t

otaled $186.7 million and $168.3

million at Dec

ember 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013

, respectively

. At December 31, 2014, we had $8.1

million

of

net unrealized gains on foreign currency exchange contracts recorded in

accumulated

other comprehensive income, net of tax expense.

Our foreign currency exchange risk is comprised of three components: 1) local currency revenues and expenses; 2) the impact of settled hedge contracts; and 3) intercompany and monetary balances for our subsidiaries that are denominated in a currency that is di

fferent from the functional currency used by each subsidiary. Based on projecte

d revenues and expenses for 2015

, excluding the impact of intercompany and trade balances denominated in currencies other than the functional subsidiary currencies, a 10% strengthening of the U.S. dollar would reduce oper

ating income by approximately $9

million. The impact of the intercompany and monetary balances referred to in the third component above have been excluded, a

s they are transacted at multiple times during the year and we are not able to reliably forecast the impact that changes in exchange rates would have.

In June 2014, we refinanced our existing $450.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility by entering into an amended and restated credit agreement relating to a five-year unsecured revolving credit facility in the principal amount of $700 million with a syndicate of multinational banks, which matures on June 18, 2019. We are subject to interest rate risk based on the terms of the Credit Facility to the extent that the London interbank rate (“LIBOR”) or the Canadian Dollar-denominated bankers’ acceptance rate (“CDOR”) increases. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest in the range from 0.875 to 1.375 percentage points (“Credit Spread”) above the LIBOR or the CDOR, dependent on our consolidated leverage ratio, and the interest period terms for the outstanding borrowings, which range from one to six months. As discussed below, we have entered into forward fixed interest rate swaps to mitigate a portion of our interest rate risk in future periods. Borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility at December 31, 2014 were $549 million at a weighted-a

verage effective interest rate of 1.5%. Based on amounts outstanding and our interest rate swap effective at December 31, 2014, an increase in the LIBOR or the CDOR of 1% would increase interest expense by approximately $4.7 million on an annualized basis.

Beginning on March 30, 2012, the variable interest rate associated with $40 million of borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility became effectively fixed at 1.36% plus the Credit Spread through June 30, 2016. Beginning on March 28, 2013, the variable interest rate associated with an additional $40 million of borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility became effectively fixed at 1.64% plus the Credit Spread through June 30, 2016. We have designated these swaps as qualifying instruments to be accounted for as cash flow hedges

. At December 31, 2014, we

had $0.7 million in unrealized losses, net of income tax benefit, on interest rate swaps designated as hedging instruments.

See

Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of our derivative instruments and hedging activities.

ITEM 9A.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures, as defined by the SEC in its Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures at December 31, 2014, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that, as of such date, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.

Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that:

·

Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;

·

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and

·

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions and that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.

We conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (


) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, we concluded that, at December 31, 2014, our internal control over financial reporting was effective.

The effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting at December 31, 2014 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.


Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the three months ended December 31, 2014 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Certifications

The certifications with respect to disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting of the Company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer are attached as Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

F-


REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31,


and


, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,


in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial r

eporting as of December 31, 2014

, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

(2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1.      NATURE OF BUSINESS, BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

The accompanying consolidated financial statements of IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and with the requirements of Regulation S-X.

These statements include the accounts of IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. and our wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries (“IDEXX,” the “Company,” “we” or “our”). We do not have any variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.

We develop, manufacture and distribute products and provide services for the veterinary, bioresearch, water, livestock, poultry and dairy markets. We also sell a line of portable electrolytes and blood gas analyzers for the human point-of-care medical diagnostics market. Our principal line of business, which we refer to as our Companion Animal Group (“CAG”) operating segment, provides diagnosti

c capabilities and information management solutions for the veterinary market as well as and biological materials testing and services for the bioresearch market. Our principal markets for these products and services are the United States (“U.S.”) and Europe, but we also sell to customers and distributors

in many other countries around the

world. Ou

r Water operating segment provides innovative testing solutions for the quality and safety of water in our principal markets the U.S. and Europe, but we also sell to customers in many other countries around the world. Our Livestock, Poultry and Dairy (“LPD”) operating segment provides diagnostic tests and related instrumentation that are used to manage the health status of livestock and poultry, to improve bovine reproductive efficiency, and to ensure the quality and safety of milk and food. Our principal market for these tests and products is Europe but we also sell to customers in many other countries around the world. We also operate a smaller operating segment that comprises products for the human point-of-care medical diagnostics market (“OPTI Medical”). Financial information about the OPTI Medical operating segment is combined and presented with our pharmaceutical product line and out-licensing arrangements remaining from our pharmaceutical business in an “Other” category because they do not meet the quantitative or qualitative thresholds for reportable segments. See Note 14 for additional information regarding our reportable operating segments, products and services and geographical areas.

Reclassificatio

ns

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation. Reclassifications had no material impact on previously reported results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

NOTE 2.      SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

(a)

Estimates

The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates, including those related to reserves for accounts receivable; goodwill and other intangible assets; income taxes; inventory valuation; revenue recognition, product returns, customer programs and multiple element arrangements; share-based compensation; warranty reserves; self-insurance reserves; fair value measurements and loss contingencies. We accrue contingent liabilities when it is probable that future expenditures will be made and such expenditures can be reasonably estimated. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

(

b

)

Cash and Cash E

quivalents

We consider all highly liquid investments with original maturities of ninety days or less to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of demand deposits and money market funds.

As of December 31, 2013, our reported cash and cash equivalents balances contained restricted cash in the aggregate of $

0.7

million securing various obligations.

There is

no

restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheet for the year ended December 31, 2014.

(c)

Inventories

Inventories

, which are stated

at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market,

include material, conversion costs and inbound freight charges. We write down the carrying value of inventory for estimated obsolescence by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value when warranted based on assumptions of future demand, market conditions, remaining shelf life, or product functionality. If actual market conditions or results of estimated functionality are less favorable than those we estimated, additional inventory write-downs may be required, which would have a negative effect on results of operations.

(d)

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. The costs of additions and improvements are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. When an item is sold or retired, the cost and related accumulated depreciation is relieved, and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognized in the consolidated statements of income. We provide for depreciation and amortization primarily using the straight-line method by charges to income in amounts that allocate the cost of property and equipment over their estimated useful lives as follows:

F-


We capitalize interest on the acquisition and construction of significant assets that require a substantial period of time to be made ready for use. The capitalized interest is included in the cost of the completed asset and depreciated over the asset’s estimated useful life. The amount of interest capitalized during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 was not material.

We capitalize certain costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining software designated for internal use based on three distinct stages of development. Qualifying costs incurred during the application development stage, which consist primarily of internal payroll and direct fringe benefits and external direct project costs, including labor and travel, are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset. Costs incurred during the preliminary project and post-implementation and operation phases are expensed as incurred. These costs are general and administrative in nature and relate primarily to the determination of performance requirements, data conversion and training.

Software developed to deliver hosted services to our customers has been designated as internal use.

See Note 6 for further information regarding costs capitalized in connection with software developed for internal use.

(e)

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

A significant portion of the purchase price for acquired businesses is generally assigned to intangible assets. Intangible assets other than goodwill are initially valued at fair value. If a quoted price in an active market for the identical asset is not readily available at the measurement date, the fair value of the intangible asset is estimated based on discounted cash flows using market participant assumptions, which are assumptions that are not specific to IDEXX. The selection of appropriate valuation methodologies and the estimation of discounted cash flows require significant assumptions about the timing and amounts of future cash flows, risks, appropriate discount rates, and the useful lives of intangible assets.

When material, we utilize independent valuation experts to advise and assist us in determining the fair values of the identified intangible assets acquired in connection with a business acquisition and in determining appropriate amortization methods and periods for those intangible assets. Goodwill is initially valued based on

the excess of the purchase price of a business combination over the fair value of acquired net assets recognized and represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized.

We assess contingent consideration to determine if it is part of the business combination or if it should be accounted for separately from the business combination in the postcombination period. Contingent consideration

is recognized at its fair value on the acquisition date. A liability resulting from contingent consideration is remeasured to fair value at each reporting date until the contingency is resolved. Changes in fair value of contingent consideration are recognized in earnings.

We provide for amortization primarily using the straight-line method by charges to income in amounts that allocate the intangible assets over their estimated useful lives as follows:

(1)

Product rights comprise certain technologies,

intellectual property,

licenses and trade names acquired from third parties.

(2)

Customer-related intangible assets comprise customer lists and customer relationships acquired from third parties.

F-


We assess goodwill for impairment annually, at the reporting unit level, in the fourth quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment may exist. In evaluating goodwill for impairment, we have the option to first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. The more-likely-than-not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than 50 percent. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we would then perform step one of the two-step impairment test; otherwise, no further impairment test would be required. In contrast, we can opt to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to step one of the two-step impairment test. Doing so does not preclude us from performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period.

In the fourth quarter of


, we elected to bypass the qualitative approach and instead proceeded directly to step one of the two-step impairment test to assess the fair value of all of our reporting units. As part of step one of the two-step impairment test, we estimate the fair values of applicable reporting units using an income approach based on discounted forecasted cash flows. We make significant assumptions about the extent and timing of future cash flows, growth rates and discount rates. Model assumptions are based on our projections and best estimates, using appropriate and customary market participant assumptions. In addition, we make certain assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to individual reporting units in determining the carrying value of each reporting unit. Changes in forecasted cash flows or the discount rate would affect the estimated fair values of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period.

No

goodwill impairments were identified during the years ended December 31, 201


, 201


or 201


.

We assess the realizability of intangible assets other than goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. If an impairment review is triggered, we evaluate the carrying value of intangible assets based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the primary asset of the asset group and compare that value to the carrying value of the asset group. The cash flows that are used contain our best estimates, using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time. If the net carrying value of an intangible asset exceeds the related estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment to write the intangible asset to its fair value would be reported as a non-cash charge to earnings. If necessary, we would calculate the fair value of an intangible asset using the present value of the estimated future cash flows to be generated by the intangible asset, and applying a risk-adjusted discount rate.

No

material

impair

ments of our intangible assets

were identified during the years ended December 31, 201


, 201


and 201


. See Note 8 for further information regarding our goodwill and intangible assets.

(f)

Warranty Reserves

We provide a standard twelve month warranty on all instruments sold. We recognize the cost of instrument warranties

in cost of product revenue at the time revenue is recognized based on the estimated cost to repair the instrument over its warranty period. Cost of product revenue reflects not only estimated warranty expense for instruments sold in the current period, but also any changes in estimated warranty expense for the portion of the aggregate installed base that is under warranty. Estimated warranty expense is based on a variety of inputs, including historical instrument performance in the customers’ environment, historical costs incurred in servicing instruments and projected instrument reliability. Should actual service rates or costs differ from our estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required. The liability for warranties is included in accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

F-


(g)

Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes. Under this approach, deferred taxes represent the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between book and tax treatment of

assets and liabilities

and carryforwards to the extent they are realizable.

We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. While we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance, in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, a reduction of the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made. Likewise, should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future, a reduction to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made.

We record a liability for uncertain tax positions that do not meet the

more likely than not standard as prescribed by the authoritative guidance for income tax accounting. We record tax benefits for only those positions that we believe will more likely than not be sustained. Unrecognized tax benefits are the differences between tax positions taken, or expected to be taken, in tax returns, and the benefits recognized for accounting purposes.

Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and our income tax filings are regularly under audit by tax authorities. Any audit result differing from amounts recorded would increase or decrease income in the period that we determine such adjustment is likely. Interest expense and penalties associated with the underpayment of income taxes are included in income tax expense. See Note 1


for additional information regarding income taxes.

(h)

Taxes Remitted to Governmental Authorities by IDEXX on Behalf of Customer

We calculate, collect from our customers, and remit to governmental authorities sales, value added and excise taxes assessed by governmental authorities in connection with revenue-producing transactions with our customers. We report these taxes on a net basis and do not include these tax amounts in revenue or cost of product or service revenue.

(i)

Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenue when four criteria are m

et: (i) persuasive evidence of

an arrangement exists; (ii) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; (iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable; and (iv)

collectability is reasonably assured. Revenue-generating transactions generally fall into one of the following categories of revenue recognition:

·

Revenue from substantially all U.S. distributors is recognized upon delivery to the distributor because title and risk of loss remains with IDEXX until the product is delivered. Effective December 31, 2014, we did not renew our existing contracts with our key U.S. distribution partners and transitioned to an all-direct sales strategy for our rapid assay test kits and instrument consumables.  We recognize revenue for the remainder of our customers, including most distributors outside of the U.S., when the product is delivered to the customer, except as noted below.

·

We recognize revenue from the sales of instruments, non-cancelable software licenses and hardware systems upon installation and the customer’s acceptance of the instrument or system as we have no significant further obligations after this point in time.

·

We recognize service revenue at the time the service is performed.

·

We recognize revenue associated with extended maintenance agreements (“EMAs”) over the life of the contracts using the straight-line method, which approximates the expected timing in which applicable services are performed. Amounts collected in advance of revenue recognition are recorded as current or long-term deferred revenue based on the time from the balance sheet date to the future date of revenue recognition.

F-


·

We recognize revenue on certain instrument systems under rental programs over the life of the rental agreement using the straight-line method. Amounts collected in advance of revenue recognition are recorded as current or long-term deferred revenue based on the time from the balance sheet date to the future date of revenue recognition.

·

We recognize revenue on practice management systems sales, where the system includes software that is considered more than incidental, either by allocating the revenue to each element of the sale based on relative fair values of the elements, including post-contract support when fair value for all elements is available, or by use of the residual method when only the fair value of the post-contract support is available. We recognize revenue for the system upon installation and customer acceptance and recognize revenue equal to the fair value of the post-contract support over the support period.

·

Shipping costs reimbursed by the customer are included in revenue. These same costs are also included in cost of product revenue.

Multiple Element A

rrangements (“MEAs”)

. Arrangements to sell products to customers frequently include multiple deliverables. Our most significant MEAs include the sale of one or more of the instruments from the IDEXX VetLab suite of analyzers, digital imaging systems or practice management software, combined with one or more of the following products: EMAs, consumables and reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services. Practice management software is frequently sold with post-contract customer support and implementation services. Delivery of the various products or performance of services within the arrangement may or may not coincide. Delivery of our IDEXX VetLab instruments, digital imaging systems, and practice management software generally occurs at the onset of the arrangement. EMAs, consumables, and reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services typically are delivered over future periods, generally

one to six years

. In certain arrangements, revenue recognized is limited to the amount invoiced or received that is not contingent on the delivery of products and services in the future.

W

e allocate revenue to each element based on the relative selling price and recognize revenue when the elements have standalone value and the four criteria for revenue recognition, as discussed above, have been met for each element.

If available, we establish the selling price of each element based on vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”), which represents the price charged for a deliverable when it is sold separately. We use

third-party evidence (“TPE”) if VSOE is not available or best estimate of selling price if neither VSOE nor TPE is available.

When these arrangements include a separately-priced EMA, we recognize revenue related to the EMA at the stated contractual price on a straight-line basis over the life of the agreement to the extent the separately stated price is substantive. If there is no stated contractual price for an EMA, or the separately stated price is not substantive, we allocate revenue to each element based on the relative selling price and recognize revenue

when the elements have standalone value and the four criteria for revenue recognition, as discussed above, have been met for each element

.

When arrangements within the scope of software revenue recognition guidance include multiple elements, we allocate revenue to each element based on relative fair value, when VSOE exists for all elements, or by using the residual method when there is VSOE for the undelivered elements but no such evidence for the delivered elements. Under the residual method, the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the residual revenue is allocated to the delivered elements. Revenue is recognized on any delivered elements when the four criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element. If VSOE does not exist for the undelivered element, all revenue from the arrangement is deferred until the earlier of the point at which such sufficient VSOE does exist or all elements of the arrangement have been delivered. We determine fair value based on amounts charged separately for the delivered and undelivered elements to similar customers in standalone sales of the specific elements.

F-


Certain arrangements with customers include discounts on future sales of products and services. We apply judgment in determining whether future discounts are significant and incremental. When the future discount offered is not considered significant and incremental, we do not account for the discount as an element of the original arrangement. If the future discount is significant and incremental, we recognize that discount as an element of the original arrangement and allocate the discount to the other elements of the arrangement based on relative selling price. To determine whether a discount is significant and incremental, we look to the discount provided in comparison to standalone sales of the same product or service to similar customers, the level of discount provided on other elements in the arrangement, and the significance of the discount to the overall arrangement. If the discount in the MEA approximates the discount typically provided in standalone sales, that discount is not considered incremental.

Customer P

rograms

. We record reductions to revenue related to customer marketing and incentive programs, which include end-user rebates and other volume-based incentives. Incentives may be provided in the form of IDEXX Points, credits or cash and are earned by

end

users upon achieving defined volume purchases or utilization levels or upon entering an agreement to purchase products or services in future periods. Our most significant customer programs are categorized as follows:

Customer Loyalty Programs

. Our customer loyalty programs offer customers the opportunity to earn incentives on a variety of IDEXX products and services as those products and services are purchased and utilized. Revenue reductions related to customer loyalty programs are recorded based on the actual issuance of incentives, incentives earned but not yet issued and estimates of incentives to be earned in the future.

Up-Front Customer Loyalty Programs

. Our up-front loyalty programs provide incentives to customers in the form of cash payments or IDEXX Points upon entering multi-year agreements to purchase annual minimum amounts of future products or services. If a customer breaches its agreement, it is required to refund a prorated portion of the up-front cash or IDEXX Points, among other things. These incentives are considered to be customer acquisition costs and are capitalized and recognized as a reduction to revenue over the term of the customer agreement. If these up-front incentives are subsequently utilized to purchase IDEXX VetLab instruments, digital imaging systems or Cornerstone practice management systems, product revenue and cost is deferred and recognized over the term of the customer agreement as products and services are provided to the customer. We monitor customer purchases over the term of their agreement to assess the realizability of our capitalized customer acquisition costs. For t

he years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012

, impairments of customer acquisition costs were immaterial.

IDEXX

Instrument

Marketing Programs

. Our instrument

marketing programs require the customer to enroll at the time of instrument purchase and offer customers the opportunity to earn incentives in future periods based on the volume of the products they purchase and utilize over the term of the program. These arrangements are considered MEAs in accordance with our revenue recognition policy stated above. Revenue reductions related to instrument marketing programs are recorded based on an estimate of customer purchase and utilization levels and the incentive the customer will earn over the term of the program. Our estimates are based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of the marketing program and require us to apply judgment to approximate future product purchases and utilization. Differences between our estimates and actual incentives earned are accounted for as a change in estimate. These differences were not material for the year

s ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012

.

Reagent Rental Programs

. Our reagent rental programs provide our customers the right to use our instruments in consideration for multi-year agreements to purchase annual minimum amounts of consumables. No instrument revenue is recognized at the time of instrument installation. We recognize a portion of the revenue allocated to the instrument concurrent with the future sale of consumables. We determine the amount of revenue allocated from the consumable to the instrument based on relative selling prices and determine the rate of instrument revenue recognition in proportion to the customer’s minimum volume commitment. The cost of the instrument is charged to cost of product revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the minimum purchase agreement.

F-


IDEXX Points may be applied against the purchase price of IDEXX products and services purchased in the future or applied to trade receivables due to us. IDEXX Points that have not yet been used by customers are classified as a liability until use or expiration occurs. We estimate the amount of IDEXX Points expected to expire, or breakage, based on historical expirations and we recognize the

estimated benefit of breakage in proportion to actual redemptions of IDEXX Points by customers

. On November 30 of each year, unused IDEXX Points earned before January 1 of the prior year generally expire and any variance from the breakage estimate is accounted for as a change in estimate. This variance was not material for the years ended December 31, 201


, 201


and 201


.

Future market conditions and changes in product offerings may cause us to change marketing strategies to increase or decrease customer incentive offerings, possibly resulting in incremental reductions of revenue in future periods as compared to reductions in the current or prior periods. Additionally, certain customer programs require us to estimate, based on historical experience, and apply judgment to approximate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive. In determining estimated revenue reductions we utilize data supplied from distributors

and collected directly from end

users, which includes the volume of qualifying products purchased and the number of qualifying tes

ts run as reported to us by end

users via IDEXX SmartService

, a secure Internet link that enables us to extract data and provide diagnostic service and support for certain IDEXX VetLab instruments through remote access.

Differences between estimated and actual customer participation in programs may impact the amount and timing of revenue recognition.

Doubtful Accounts R

eceivable

. We recognize revenue when collection from the customer is reasonably assured. We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for potentially uncollectible receivables. We base our estimates on a detailed analysis of specific customer situations and a percentage of our accounts receivable by aging category. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, additional allowances might be required. Account balances are charged off against the allowance when we believe it is probable the receivable will not be recovered. We do not have any off-balance sheet credit exposure related to our customers.

(j)

Research and Development Costs

Research and development costs, which consist of salaries, employee benefits, materials and external consulting and product development costs, are expensed as incurred. We evaluate our software research and development costs for capitalization after the technological feasibility of software and products containing software has been established. No costs were capitalized during t

he years ended December 31, 2014

, 201


and 201


.

(k)

Advertising Costs

Advertising costs, which are recognized as sales and marketing expense in the period in which they are incurred, w

ere $

1.2

million, $

1.5

million and $

1.1

million for the years ended

December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012

, respectively.

(l)

Legal Costs

Legal costs are considered period costs and accord

ingly are expensed in the

year services are provided.

(m)

Share-Based Compensation

We provide for various forms of share-based compensation awards to our employees and non-employee directors. With the exception of stock options, the fair value of our awards is equal to the closing stock price of IDEXX common stock on the date of grant. We calculate the fair value of our stock option awards using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. Share-based compensation expense is recognized net of estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award. See Note 4 for additional information regarding share-based compensation.

F-


(n)

Self-Insurance Accruals

We self-insu

re costs associated with worker

s

’

compensation and health and general welfare claims incurred by our U.S. employees up to certain limits. The insurance company provides insurance for claims above these limits.

Claim liabilities are recorded for estimates of the loss that we will ultimately incur on reported claims, as well as estimates of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported. Such liabilities are based on individual coverage, the average time from when a claim is incurred to the time it is paid and judgments about the present and expected levels of claim frequency and severity. Estimated claim liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Estimated claim liabilities are included in accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

(o)

Earnings per Share

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and vested deferred stock units outstanding during the year. The computation of diluted earnings per share is similar to the computation of basic earnings per share, except that the denominator is increased for the assumed exercise of dilutive options and assumed issuance of unvested restricted stock units and unvested deferred stock units using the treasury stock method unless the effect is anti-dilutive.

The treasury stock method assumes that proceeds, including cash received from the exercise of employee stock options, the

total unrecognized compensation expense for unvested share-based compensation awards

and the excess tax benefits resulting from share-based compensation tax deductions in excess of the related expense recognized for financial reporting purposes, would be used to purchase our common stock at the average market price during the period.

Vested deferred stock units outstanding are included in shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per share because the associated shares of our common stock are issuable for no cash consideration, the number of shares of our common stock to be issued is fixed and issuance is not contingent. See Note 4 for additional information regarding deferred stock units.

(p)

Foreign Currency

The fu

nctional currency of all but two

of our subsidiaries is their local currency. Assets and liabilities of these foreign subsidiaries are translated to the U.S. dollar using the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date. Revenue and expense accounts are translated to the U.S. dollar using the exchange rate at the date which those elements are recognized, and where it is impractical to do so, an average exchange rate in effect during the period is used to translate those elements. Cumulative translation gains and losses are shown in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income

(“AOCI”)

.

Revenues and expenses denominated in a currency other than the respective subsidiary’s functional currency are recorded at the current exchange rate when the transaction is recognized. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the resp

ective subsidiary’s functional currency are remeasured at each balance sheet date using the exchange rate in effect at each balance sheet date. These foreign currency gains and losses are included in general and administrative expenses. We recognized aggregate foreign currency losses of

$2.0

million, less than $

0.1

million and $

0.2

million for the years ended December 31,

2014,

2013 and 2012, respectively.

F-


(q)

Derivative Instruments and Hedging

We recognize all derivative instruments, including our foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate swap agreements, on the balance sheet at fair value at the balance sheet date. Derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment must be recorded at fair value through earnings. To qualify for hedge accounting treatment, cash flow hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to expected future cash flows on hedged transactions. If a derivative instrument qualifies for hedge accounting, changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument from the effective portion of the hedge are deferred in AOCI, net of tax, and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. We immediately record in earnings the extent to which a hedge instrument is not effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value. We de-designate derivative instruments from hedge accounting when the likelihood of the hedged transaction occurring becomes less than probable. For de-designated instruments, the gain or loss from the time of de-designation through maturity of the instrument is recognized in earnings. Any gain or loss in AOCI at the time of de-designation is reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.

We enter into master netting arrangements with the counterparties to our derivative transactions which permit outstanding receivables and payables to be offset in the event of default. Our derivative contracts do not require either party to post cash collateral. We elect to present our derivative assets and liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets on a gross basis. All cash flows related to our foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate swaps are classified as operating cash flows, which is consistent with the cash flow treatment of the underlying items being hedged. See Note 16 for additional information regarding our derivative and hedging instruments.

(r)

Fair Value Measurements

U.S. GAAP

defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.

U.S. GAAP

requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs, where available, and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.

The Company has certain financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities that may be measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis and certain financial assets and liabilities that are not measured at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets but for which we disclose the fair value. The fair value disclosures of these assets and liabilities are based on a three-level hierarchy, which is defined as follows:

Level 1

Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date.

Level 2

Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.

Level 3

Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.

F-


Our foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate swap agreements are measured at fair value on a recurring basis in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets. We measure the fair value of our foreign currency exchange contracts classified as derivative instruments using an income approach, based on prevailing market forward rates less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount. The product of this calculation is then adjusted for counterparty risk. We measure the fair value of our interest rate swaps classified as derivative instruments using an income approach, utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis based on the terms of the contract and the interest rate curve adjusted for counterparty risk.

The amount outstanding under our unsecured revolving credit facility, notes receivable and long-term debt are measured at carrying value in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets

though we disclose the fair value of these financial instruments

. We determine the fair value of the amount outstanding under our credit facility, notes receivable and long-term debt using an income approach, utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis based on current market interest rates for debt issues with similar remaining years to maturity, adjusted for applicable credit risk. Our credit facility and long-term debt

are valued using

L

evel 2 inputs. The estimated fair value of our credit facility approximates its carrying value. At December 31, 2014, the estimated fair value and carrying value of our long-term

debt were

$367.3

million and

$350.0

million, respectively. As of December 31, 2013, the carrying value of our long-term debt approximated its fair value. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we disposed of notes receivable representing a strategic investment in a privately held company. As of December 31, 2013, these notes receivable had a carrying value that approximated their fair value of

$5.1

million and were valued using Level 3 inputs. See Note 3 for further information regarding the disposition of the notes receivable during June 2014.

(s)

Comprehensive Income

We report all changes in equity during a period, resulting from net income and transactions or other events and circumstances from non-owner sources, in a financial statement for the period in which they are recognized. We have chosen to retrospectively present comprehensive income, which encompasses net income, foreign currency translation adjustments and the difference between the cost and the fair market value of investments in debt and equity securities, forward currency exchange contracts and interest rate swap agreements, in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. S

ee Note 18

for

information about the effects on net income of significant amounts reclassified out of each component of AOCI for t

he years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013

. We consider the foreign currency cumulative translation adjustment to be permanently invested and, therefore, have not provided income taxes on those amounts.

(t)

Concentrations of Risk

Financial Instruments

. Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are principally cash, cash equivalents, accounts and notes receivable and derivatives. To mitigate such risk with respect to cash and cash equivalents, we place our cash with highly-rated financial institutions, in non-interest bearing accounts that are insured by the U.S. government and money market funds invested in government securities.

Concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is limited to certain customers to whom we make substantial sales. To reduce risk, we routinely assess the financial strength of our most significant customers and monitor the amounts owed to us, taking appropriate action when necessary. As a result, we believe that accounts receivable credit risk exposure is limited. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts, but historically have not experienced any material losses related to an individual customer or group of customers in any particular industry or geographic area.

To mitigate concentration of credit risk with respect to derivatives we enter into transactions with highly-rated financial institutions, enter into master netting arrangements with the counterparties to our derivative transactions and frequently monitor the credit worthiness of our counterparties. Our master netting arrangements reduce our exposure in that they permit outstanding receivables and payables with the counterparties to our derivative transactions to be offset in the event of default. We have not incurred such losses and consider the risk of counterparty default to be minimal.

F-


Inventory

. If we are unable to obtain adequate quantities of the inventory we need to sell our products, we could face cost increases or delays or discontinuations in product shipments, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Many of the third parties that provide us with the instruments we sell and certain components, raw materials and consumables used in or with our products are obtained from sole or single source suppliers. Some of the products that we purchase from these sources are proprietary or complex in nature, and, therefore, cannot be readily or easily replaced by alternative sources.

Customers

. Our largest customers are our U.S. distributors of our products in the CAG segment. Our two largest CAG distributors are Henry Schein Animal Health Supply, LLC (“Henry Schein”) and MWI Veterinary Supply (“MWI”). Henry Schein accounted for


% of our 2014 consolidated revenue and

9%

of our 2013 and 2012 consolidated revenue, and

2%

and

7%

of our net accounts receivable at December 31, 2014 and 2013.

MWI accounted for

8%

of our 2014, 2013 and 2012 consolidated revenue, respectively, and

8%

and

11%

of our net accounts receivable at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Effective January 1, 2015, most U.S. distributors are no longer our customers as

a

result of o

ur transition to an all-direct sales strategy in the U.S.

(u)

New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued an amendment which will replace most of the existing revenue recognition guidance within U.S. GAAP. The core principle of this guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue for the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that it expects to be entitled to receive for those goods or services. In doing so, companies will be required to make certain judgments and estimates, including identifying contract performance obligations, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price among separate performance obligations. Additionally, the amendment requires disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, significant judgments reached in the application of the guidance and assets recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract. Effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2017, the amendment allows for two methods of adoption, a full retrospective method or a modified retrospective approach with the cumulative effect recognized at the date of initial application. Early adoption is not permitted. We are in the process of determining the method of adoption and the impact of this amendment on our consolidated financial statements.

In August 2014, the FASB issued an amendment that requires management to assess an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are currently in U.S. auditing standards. The amendments in this update provide guidance about management’s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern for one year after the date that the financial statements are issued and to provide related footnote disclosures. In doing so, the amendments should reduce diversity in the timing and content of footnote disclosures. The amendments in this update apply to all entities and are effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. Early application is permitted. This amendment is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements.

NOTE 3.      ACQUISITIONS AND

DISPOSITION OF STRATEGIC INVESTMENT

We believe that our acquisitions of businesses and other assets enhance our existing businesses by either expanding our geographic range or expanding our existing product lines.

During the year ended December 31, 2014, we paid an aggregate of $25.1 million, to acquire

seven

businesses, each accounted for as separate business combinations.

F-


We paid an aggregate of

$18.7

million in cash and recorded contingent consideration of

$4.2

million upon the acquisition of substantially all outstanding shares of a business and the assets of

two

other businesses, both that offer cloud-based veterinary practice software. As part of the business acquisitions, we recorded

$11.7

million in amortizable intangible assets and

$12.4

million in goodwill. Amortizable intangible assets primarily consisted of customer lists and software which were assigned weighted average useful lives of

16.4

years and

7.0

years, respectively.

The weighted average useful life of all recognized amortizable intangible assets wa

s

11.4

years.

Goodwill is calculated as the consideration in excess of net assets recognized and represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately rec

ognized.

Of the total goodwill and amortizable assets acquired,

$5.6

million of a

mortizable intangible assets

are deductible for income tax purposes.

All assets acquired in connection with these business combinations were assigned to our Comp

anion Animal Group segment.

Two

out of

three

businesses acquired are located outside of the U.S. and, as such, the assets and liabil

ities recorded are subject to impacts of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

T

he results of operations of these

acquired business

es

have been included since the acquisition date.

Pro forma information has not been p

resented for these business acquisitions because such information is not material to the financial statements.

We paid an aggregate of

$6.2

million in cash and recorded contingent consideration of

$1.5

million upon the acquisition of all outstanding shares of

two

veterinary reference laboratory testing businesses and to acquire the assets of

two

veterinary reference laboratory testing businesses. The purchase price in these business acquisitions was allocated primarily to customer list intangible assets, which were assigned a weighted average useful life of

13.3

years

.

$4.9

million of amortizable intangible assets associated with these acquisitions are deductible for income tax purposes.

All assets acquired in connection with these business acquisitions were assigned to our Companion Animal Grou

p segment. Certain of these business acquisitions were of businesses located outside of the U.S. and, as such, the assets and liabilities recorded are subject to impacts of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

The results of operation

s of these

acquired business

es

have been included since the acquisition date.

Pro forma information has not been presented for these business acquisitions because such information is not material to the financial statements.

In June 2014, we divested our investment in a company that owns and operates veterinary hospitals. Upon the closing date, we received proceeds of

$5.4

million in exchange for

two

outstanding promissory notes of the company and its subsidiaries and our

11%

equity interest in the company. This investment has been accounted for under the equity method of accounting since acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2010. Upon the disposition of this strategic investment, we realized a

$0.7

million gain, which has been reflected as a reduction to general and administrative.

During the year ended December 31, 2013, we paid an aggregate of

$10.8

million in cash to acquire all outstanding shares of a distributor of certain of our bovine and dairy test products, as well as other food safety testing products, in Brazil. As part of this business acquisition, we recorded

$4.8

million in amortizable intangible assets other than goodwill and

$6.5

million in goodwill. The amortizable assets acquired consisted of a customer list, non-compete agreement and a trademark, which were assigned useful lives of


,


, and


years, respectively. The weighted average useful life of all recognized amortizable intangible assets was

9.9

years. Additionally, we recorded

$0.7

million of cash and cash equivalents,

$1.0

million in working capital,

$0.5

million of fixed assets

,

$2.1

million in other assets and net deferred tax liabilities of

$1.7

million

. W

e deemed certain pre-acquisition contingent liabilities probable and recorded

$3.1

million in other liabilities at December 31, 2013.

Goodwill is calculated as the consideration in excess of net assets recognized and represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized. The goodwill and amortizable intangible assets recorded from this business acquisition are not deductible for income tax purposes. All assets acquired in connection with this business acquisition were assigned to our LPD segment. The results of operation

s

of this acquired business have been included since the acquisition date.  Pro forma information has not been presented for this business acquisition because such information is not material to the financial statements.

F-


During the year ended December 31, 2012, we paid an aggregate of $

3.6

million in cash to acquire

three

businesses, each accounted for as separate business combinations, and to acquire a product right unrelated to business acquisitions. As part of these business acquisitions, we acquired amortizable intangible assets consisting of customer lists with a fair value of $

1.7

million and other intangible assets of $

0.7

million, which were assigned weighted average useful lives of


years and


years, respectively. All assets acquired in connection with these business acquisitions were assigned to the CAG segment. The results of operations of these acquired businesses have been included since the acquisition date. Pro forma information has not been presented for these acquisitions because such information is not material to the financial statements.

NOTE 4.      SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

Share-Based Awards

Our share-based compensation plans allow for the issuance of a mix of stock options, restricted stock, stock appreciation rights, employee stock purchase rights and other stock unit awards. Other stock unit awards include

restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and deferred stock units (“DSUs”). Stock options permit a holder to buy IDEXX stock upon vesting at the stock’s price on the date the option was granted. An RSU is an agreement to issue shares of IDEXX stock at the time of vesting. DSUs are granted under our Executive Deferred Compensation Plan

(the “Executive Plan”)

and non-employee Director Deferred Compensation Plan

(the “Director Plan”)

. DSUs may or may not have vesting conditions depending on the plan under w

hich they are issued. We did not issue

any restricted stock or stock appreciation rights during t

he years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012

nor were any restricted stock or stock appreciation rights outstanding as of those years ended. There were no material modifications to the terms of outstanding options, RSUs or DSUs during t

he years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 or 2012

.

We primarily issue shares of common stock to satisfy stock option exercises and employee stock purchase rights and to settle RSUs and DSUs.

We issue

shares of treasury stock to settle certain restricted stock units and upon the exercise of certain stock options. The number of shares of treasury stock issued during t

he years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012

was not material. The number of shares of common stock and treasury stock issued are equivalent to the number of awards exercised or settled.

With the exception of employee stock purchase rights, equity awards are issued to employees and non-employee directors under the 2009 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2009 Stock Plan”).

Our board of directors has authorized the issuance of

9,950,000

shares of our common stock under this

share-based

incentive plan. Any shares that are subject to awards of stock options or stock appreciation rights will be counted against the share limit as

one

share for every share granted. Any shares that are issued other than stock options and stock appreciation rights will be counted against the share limit as

two

shares for every share granted. If any shares iss

ued under our prior plans are forfeited, settled for cash or expire, these shares, to the extent of such forfeiture, cash settlement or expiration, will again be available for issuance under the 2009 Stock Plan.

As of Dec

ember 31, 2014, there were

Employee stock purchase rights are issued under the 1997 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, under which we reserved and may issue up to an aggregate of

shares of common stock in periodic offerings. Under this plan, stock is sold to employees at a


% discount off the closing price of the stock on the last day of each quarter. The dollar value of t

his discount is equal to the fair value of purchase rights recognized as share-based compensation. We issued

Share-Based Compensation

Share-based compensation costs are classified in our consolidated financial statements consistent with the classification of cash compensation paid to the employees receiving such share-based compensation. The following is a summary of share-based compensation costs and related tax benefits recorded in our consolidated statements of income for t

he years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012

(in thousands)

:

Share-based compensation expense is reduced for an estimate of the number of awards that are expected to be forfeited. We use historical data and other factors to estimate employee termination behavior and to evaluate whether particular groups of employees have significantly different forfeiture behaviors.

The total unrecognized compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, for unvested share-based compensation awards at December 31, 2014 was $

35.9

million, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately

1.6

years.

Stock Options

Option awards are granted with an exercise price equal to the closing market price of our common stock at the date of grant. Options granted to employees primarily vest ratably over

five

years

on each anniversary of the date of grant

and

options granted to non-employee directors vest fully on the

first anniversary

of the date of grant. Vesting of option awards issued is conditional based on continuous service. Options granted after May 8, 2013 have a contractual term of

ten

years, options granted between January 1, 2006 and May 8, 2013 have contractual terms of

seven

years and options granted prior to January 1, 2006 have contractual terms of ten years.

Upon any change in control of the company,

25%

of the unvested stock options then outstanding will vest and become exercisable. However, if the acquiring entity does not assume outstanding options, then all options will vest immediately prior to the change in control.

We use the

Black-Scholes-Merton

option-pricing model to determine the fair value of options granted. Option-pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, particularly for the expected stock price volatility and the expected term of options. Changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate. Our expected stock price volatility assumptions are based on the historical volatility of our stock over periods that are similar to the expected terms of grants and other relevant factors. We derive the expected term based on historical experience and other relevant factors concerning expected employee behavior with regard to option exercise. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury yields for a maturity approximating the expected term calculated at the date of grant. We have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we have no intention to pay a dividend at this time; therefore, we assume that no dividends will be paid over the expected terms of option awards.

F-


We determine the assumptions used in the valuation of option awards as of the date of grant. Differences in the expected stock price volatility, expected term or risk-free interest rate may necessitate distinct valuation assumptions at those grant dates. As such, we may use different assumptions for options granted throughout the year. The weighted averages of the valuation assumptions used to determine the fair value of each option award on the date of grant and the weighted average estimated fair values were as follows:

A summary o

f the status of options granted under our share-based compensation plans at December 31, 2014, and changes during the year then ended, are presented in the table below:

The total fair value of options vested during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 wa

s

$

7.8

million, $

8.4

million and

$

8.3

million, respectively

.

Intrinsic value of stock options exercised represents the amount by which the market price of the common stock exceeded the exercise price, before applicable inc

ome taxes. During the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 the total intrinsic value of stock options exercised was

$51.2

million,

$49.0

million and

$45.8

million, respectively.

Restricted Stock Units

RSUs granted to employees vest ratably over

five

years

on each anniversary of the date of grant or fully on the

third anniversary

of the date of grant, depending on the employee group receiving the award. RSUs granted to non-employee directors vest fully on the

first anniversary

of the date of grant. Vesting as it relates to RSUs issued is conditional based on continuous service

.

Upon any change in control of the company,

25%

of the unvested RSUs then outstanding will vest, provided, however, that if the acquiring entity does not assume the RSUs, then all such units will vest immediately prior to the change in control.

F-


A summary of the status of RSUs granted under our share-based compensation plans at December 31, 201


, and changes during the period then ended, are presented in the table below:

The total fair value of RSUs vested during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $

15.4

million, $

12.7

million and $

13.3

million, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value of nonvested RSUs as of December 31, 2014 is equal to the

fair value of IDEXX’s common stock as of December 31, 2014 multiplied by the number of nonvested units as of December 31, 2014.

Deferred Stock Units

Under our Director Plan, non-employee directors may defer a portion of their cash fees in the form of vested DSUs. Prior to 2014, certain members of our management could elect to defer a portion of their cash compensation in the form of vested deferred stock units under our Executive Plan. Each DSU represents the right to receive

one

unissued share of our common stock. These recipients receive a number of DSUs equal to the amount of cash fees or compensation deferred divided by the closing sale price of the common stock on the date of deferral. Also under the Director Plan, non-employee directors are awarded annual grants of DSUs that vest fully on the first anniversary of the date of grant. Vesting for these annual DSU grants is conditional based on continuous service. DSUs are exchanged for a fixed number of shares of common stock, upon vesting if vesting criteria apply, subject to the limitations of the Director and Executive Plans and applicable law.

There were approximately

118,000

and

122,000

vested DSUs outstanding under our share-based compensation plans as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Unvested DSUs as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 were not material.

In June



, we refinanced our existing $

450.0

million unsecured revolving credit facility by entering into an amended and restated credit agreement relating to a five-year unsecured revolving credit facility in the principal amount of $


million with a syndicate of multinational banks, which matures on

June 18, 2019

(the

new credit facility and the previous credit facility are referred to collectively as the

“Credit Facility”) and requires no scheduled prepayments before that date.

Alt

hough the Credit Facility does not

mature until June


8, 201


, all

individual borrowings

under the terms of the Credit Facility

have a stated term between 30 and 180 days. At the end of each term, the obligation is either repaid or rolled over into a new borrowing. The Credit Facility contains a subjective material adverse event clause, which allows the debt holders to call the loans under the Credit Facility if we fail to provide prompt written notice to the syndicate of such an event. Based on the stated term and the existence of the subjective material adverse event clause, this Credit Facility is reflected in the current liabilities section of our consolidated balance sheets.

At December 31, 201


and 201


, we ha

d $

549.0

million and $

277.0

million, respectively, outstanding under the Credit Facility with weighted average effective interest rates of

1.5

% and

1.6

%, respectively. The funds available under the Credit Facility at December 31, 2014 and De

cember 31, 2013

reflect a further reduction due to the issuance of a letter of credit for $

1.0

million, which was issued in connection with our workers’ compensation policy.

Applicable interest rates on borrowings under the Credit Facility generally range from

0.875

to

1.375

percentage points (“Credit Spread”) above the London interbank offered rate or the Canadian Dollar-denominated bankers’ acceptance rate, based on our leverage ratio, or the prevailing prime rate plus a maximum spread of up to

0.375

%, based on our leverage ratio. We have entered into forward fixed interest rate swap agreements to manage the economic effect of the first $


million of variable interest rate borrowings. As such, we continue to designate the existing interest rate swaps

as cash flow hedges. See Note 16

for a discussion of our derivative instruments and hedging activities. Under the Credit Facility, we pay quarterly commitment fees of

0.15

% to

0.35

%, based on our leverage ratio, on any unused commitment.

The obligations under the Credit Facility may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Credit Facility, which includes customary events of default including payment defaults, defaults in the performance of the affirmative, negative and financial covenants,

the inaccuracy of representations or warranties, bankruptcy and insolvency related defaults, defaults relating to judgments, certain events related to employee pension benefit plans under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, the failure to pay specified indebtedness,

cross-acceleration to

specified indebtedness

and a change of control default. The Credit Facility contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants customary for financings of this type. The negative covenants include restrictions on liens, indebtedness of subsidiaries of the Company, fundamental changes, investments, transactions with affiliates and certain restrictive agreements. The financial covenant is a consolidated leverage ratio test that

requires our ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and share-based compensation defined as the consolidated leverage ratio under the terms of the Credit Facility, not to exceed

3.5

-to-1. At December 31, 2014, we were in compliance with the covenants of the Credit Facility.

INCOME TAXES

Earnings before income taxes were as follows (

in thousands

):

The provision (benefit) for income taxes comprised the following (

in thousands

):

The provision for income taxes differs from the amounts computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate as follows:

Our effective income tax rate was

26.2

% for the year ended December 31, 2014 and

28.7

% for the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease in our effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2014, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013,

was related to higher relative earnings subject to international tax rates that are lower than domestic tax rates, a non-recurring

benefit related to the deferral of intercompany profits that were included in prior year tax provisions in error, which is not material to current or prior interim or annual periods, and the resolution of domestic and international tax audits, which resulted in a net reduction in our provision for uncertain tax positions.  These favorable factors were partly offset by a reduction in the benefit from the U.S. research and development (“R&D”) tax credit.  During the three months ended March 31, 2013, legislation

F-


in the U.S. retroactively allowed the R&D tax credit for all of 2012 and extended the R&D tax credit through the year ending December 31, 2013.  As a result, in the year ending December 31, 2013 we recorded the benefit of two years of R&D tax credit as compared to the year ending December 31, 2014 in which we have recorded only the benefit related to that year’s activities.

Our effective income tax rate was

28.7

% for the year ended December 31, 201


and

31.6

% for

the year ended December 31, 2012

.

The decrease in our effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2013, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2012, was due primarily to the

R&D

tax credit. For the year ended December 31, 2012, the U.S. legislation authorizing the R&D tax credit had expired and no associated tax benefit was recognized within this period. On January 2, 2013, U.S. federal legislation was enacted that retroactively allowed an R&D tax credit for all of 2012 and extended the R&D tax credit through the year ended December 31, 2013. Because the related legislation was enacted in 2013, the full benefit of the R&D tax credit related to the prior year’s activities was recognized in 2013. In addition, higher relative earnings subject to international tax rates that are lower than domestic tax rates also contributed to the decrease in our effective income tax rate.

We have business operations in Switzerland and the Netherlands and have been granted tax

rulings

by each jurisdiction. Our tax

rulings

in Switzerland and the Netherlands are set to expire on

December 31, 2015

and

December 31, 2022

, respectively. As a result of the tax

rulings

, our net income was higher by $

8.5

million, $

6.5

million and $

6.0

million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The benefit from these tax

rulings

is reflected within the overall benefit received from international income taxes in the table above.

We consider the majority of the operating earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries to be indefin

itely invested outside the U.S.

The cumulative earnings of these subsidiaries w

ere $

mill

ion at December 31, 2014. No provision has been made for U.S. federal and state, or international taxes that may result from future remittances of the undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries. Should we repatriate these earnings in the future, we would have to adjust the income tax provision in the period in which the decision to repatriate earnings is made. A determination of the related tax liability that would be paid on these undistributed earnings if repatriated is not practicable.

For the operating earnings not considered to be indefinitely invested outside the U.S., we have accounted for the tax impact on a current basis.

The components of the net deferred tax assets (liabilities) included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets are as follows (

in thousands

):

F-


We record a liability for uncertain tax positions that do not meet the

more likely than not standard as prescribed by the authoritative guidance for income tax accounting. We record tax benefits for only those positions that we believe will more likely than not be sustained. Unrecognized tax benefits are the differences between tax positions taken, or expected to be taken, in tax returns, and the benefits recognized for accounting purposes.

We classify certain uncertain tax positions as long-term liabilities.

The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2014 a

nd December 31, 2013 was $

5.9

million and $

6.3

million, respectively. Of the total unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2014 and 2013, $

5.0

million and $

5.7

million, respectively, comprise unrecognized tax positions that woul

d, if recognized, affect our effective tax rate. The ultimate deductibility of the remaining unrecognized tax positions is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting, other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of the shorter deductibility period would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the payment of cash to the taxing authority to an earlier period.

During each of the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we recorded interest expense and penalties of $

0.3

million as income tax expense in our consolidated statement of income. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, we had $

0.5

million and $

0.6

million, respectively, of estimated interest expense and penalties accrued in our consolidated balance sheets.

The following table summarizes the changes in unrecognized tax benefits during the years ended December 31, 201


, 201


and 201


(

in thousands

):

In 2015, it is reasonably possible that we could recognize u

p to $

0.4

mill

ion of income tax benefits that have not been recognized at December 31, 2014. The income tax benefits are due primarily to the lapse in the statutes of limitations for various U.S. and international tax jurisdictions.

In the ordinary course of our business, our income tax filings are regularly under audit by tax authorities. While we believe we have appropriately provided for all uncertain tax positions, amounts asserted by taxing authorities could be greater or less than our accrued position. Accordingly, additional provisions on income tax matters, or reductions of pre

viously accrued provisions, could be recorded in the future as we revise our estimates due to changing facts and circumstances or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved.

W

e are currently under tax examinations by various state and international tax authorities. We anticipate that these examinations will be concluded within the next year.

We are no longer subject to U.S. federal examinations for tax years before


. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to income tax examinations in any state and local, or international jurisdictions in which we conduct significant taxable activities for years before


.

At December 31, 2014, we had net operating loss carryforwards in certain state and international jurisdictions of approximately $

41.6

million available to offset future taxable income. Most of these net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates through 2018 and the remainder have indefinite lives. We have recorded a valuation allowance of $

4.7

million against certain deferred

tax assets related to

temporary differences including

net operating loss carryforwards, as it is more likely than not that they will not be

realized or

utilized within the carryforward period.

We have various minimum royalty payments due through 2027 of $

3.3

million. If these obligations are not satisfied, the related license arrangements may be terminated, resulting in either a loss in ex

minimum purchase commitments under these arrangements.

F-


Contingencies

We are subject to claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, including with respect to actual and threatened litigation and other matters. We accrue for loss contingencies when it is probable that future expenditures will be made and such expenditures can be reasonably estimated. However, our actual losses with respect to these contingencies could exceed our accruals.

Under our worker

$

2.3

We have recognized cumulative expenses of $

1.1

million, $

0.5

estimated liability for worker

compensatio

n was

$1.4

million and

$1.2

million as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Claims incurred during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 201

3 are relatively undeveloped as of December 31, 2014. Therefore, it is possible that we could incur additional healthcare and wage indemnification costs beyond those previously recognized up to our aggregate liability for each of the respective claim years.

For the years ended on or prior to December 31, 2012, based on our retained claim liability per incident and our aggregate claim liability per year,

our maximum liability in excess of the amounts deemed probable and previously recognized is not material as of December 31, 2014. As of December 31, 2014, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling $

1.3

million to the insurance companies as security for these claims in connection with these policies.

Under our current employee healthcare insurance policy for U.S. employees, we retain claims liability risk up to $

375,000

million during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, which includes actual claims paid and an estimate of our liability for the uninsured portion of employee healthcare obligations that have been incurred but not paid. Should employee health insurance claims exceed our estimated liability, we would have further obligations. Our estimated liability for healthcare claims that have been incurred but not paid as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 was $

4.1

million and $

4.3

million, respectively.

We have entered into an employment agreement with our chief executive officer whereby payment may be required if we terminate his employment without cause other than following a change in control. The amount payable is based upon the executive’s salary at the time of termination and the cost to us of continuing to provide certain benefits. Had this officer been terminated without cause at December 31, 2014, other t

han following a change in control, we would have had an obligation for salaries and benefits of approximately $

1.6

million u

nder such agreement. In addition, the agreement provides for continued vesting of his outstanding equity awards for a period of

two years

.

We have entered into employment agreements with each of our officers that require us to make certain payments in the event the officer’s employment is terminated under certain circumstances within a certain period following a change in control. The amount payable by us under each of these agreements is based on the officer’s salary and bonus history at the time of termination and the cost to us of continuing to provide certain benefits. Had all of our officers been terminated in qualifying terminations following a change in control at December 31, 2014, we would have had aggregate obligations of approximat

ely $

24.8

million under these agreements. These agreements also provide for the acceleration of the vesting of all stock options and restricted stock units upon any qualifying termination following a change in control. At this time, we believe the likelihood of terminations as a result of the scenarios described is remote, and therefore, we have not accrued for such loss contingencies.

We have

total

contingent

liabilities

outstanding of up to $

11.8

million

primarily

related to the achievement of certain revenue milestones. We have recorded

$6.3

million of contingent commitments on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2014. The amount of contingent consideration recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2013 was not material. We have not accrued for

$5.5

million of contingent liabilities, related to the acquisition of an

intangible asset in 2008

,

as we do not deem

the achievement of associated revenue milestones

to be probable of occurring as of December 31, 2014.

F-


From time to time, we have received notices alleging that our products infringe third-party proprietary rights, although we are not aware of any pending litigation with respect to such claims. Patent litigation frequently is complex and expensive, and the outcome of patent litigation can be difficult to predict. There can be no assurance that we will prevail in any infringement proceedings that may be commenced against us. If we lose any such litigation, we may be stopped from selling certain products and/or we may be required to pay damages as a result of the litigation.

Guarantees

We enter into agreements with third parties in the ordinary course of business under which we are obligated to indemnify such third parties for and against various risks and losses. The precise terms of such indemnities vary with the nature of the agreement. In many cases, we limit the maximum amount of our indemnification obligations, but in some cases those obligations may be theoretically unlimited. We have not incurred material expenses in discharging any of these indemnification obligations, and based on our analysis of the nature of the risks involved, we believe that the fair value of these agreements is minimal. Accordingly, we have recorded no liabilities for these obligations at December 31, 2014 and 2013.

When acquiri

ng a business, we sometimes assume liability for certain events or occurrences that took place prior to the date of acquisition. We have recor

ded $

2.5

millio

n and

$3.1

million of probable pre-acquisition liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

NOTE 14

.      SEGMENT REPORTING

Prior to January 1, 2013, we operated primarily through

three

business segments: diagnostic and information technology-based products and services for the veterinary market, which we continue to refer to as CAG; water quality products (“Water”); and diagnostic products for livestock and poultry health, which we referred to as Livestock and Poultry Diagnostics. We also operated

two

smaller operating segments that comprised products for milk quality and safety (“Dairy”) and products for the human point-of-care medical diagnostics market (“OPTI Medical”). Financial information about our Dairy and OPTI Medical operating segments was combined and presented with our remaining pharmaceutical product line and our out-licensing arrangements in an “Other” category because they did not meet the quantitative or qualitative thresholds for reportable segments.

In 2013, we combined the management of our Livestock and Poultry Diagnostics and Dairy lines of business into our LPD segment to more effectively realize the market synergies between the product lines and to achieve operational efficiencies. Our OPTI Medical operating segment remains combined and presented with our remaining pharmaceutical product line and our out-licensing arrangements in an “Other” category because they do not meet the quantitative or qualitative thresholds for reportable segments. The segment income (loss) from operations discussed within this report for the years

ended December 31, 2012

has been retrospectively revised to reflect this change in the composition of our reportable segments.

Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision-maker, or decision-making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Our chief operating decision-maker is our Chief Executive Officer.

Our operating

segments include: CAG, Water, LPD, and Other. Assets are not allocated to segments for internal reporting purposes.

F-


CAG develops, designs, manufactures and distributes products and performs services for veterinarians and the bioresearch market, primarily related to diagnostics and information management. Water develops, designs, manufactures and distributes a range of products used in the detection of various microbiological parameters in water. LPD develops, designs, manufactures and distributes

diagnostic tests and related instrumentation that are used to manage the health status of livestock and poultry, to improve bovine reproductive efficiency, and to ensure the quality and safety of milk and food

. OPTI Medical develops, designs, manufactures and distributes point-of-care electrolyte and blood gas analyzers and related consumable products for the human medical diagnostics market.

The accounting policies of our segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies in Note 2 except for inventories, as discussed below. Intersegment revenues, which are not included in the table below, were not material for the years ended December 31, 201

4, 2013

and 201


.

Items that are not allocated to our operating segments are as follows: a portion of corporate support function and personnel-related expenses; certain manufacturing costs; corporate research and development expenses that do not align with one of our existing business or service categories; the difference between estimated and actual share-based compensation expense; and certain foreign currency exchange gains and losses. These amounts are shown under the caption “Unallocated Amounts.”

We estimate our share-based compensation expense, corporate support function expenses and certain personnel-related costs and allocate the estimated expense

s

to the operating segments. T

his allocation differs from

actual expense and consequently yields a difference that is reported under the caption “Unallocated Amounts.”

With respect to manufacturing costs, the costs reported in our operating segments include our standard cost for products sold and any variances from standard cost for products purchased or manufactured within the period. We capitalize these variances for inventory on hand at the end of the period to record inventory in accordance with U.S.

GAAP. We then record these variances

as cost of product revenue as that inventory is sold. The impact to cost of product revenue resulting from this variance capita

lization and subsequent

recognition is reported within the caption “Unallocated Amounts.”

Additionally, in certain geographies where we maintain inventories in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, the product costs reported in our operating segments include our standard cost for products sold, which is stated at the budgeted currency exchange rate from the beginning of the fiscal year. In these geographies, the variances from standard cost for products sold related to changes in currency exchange rates are reported within the caption “Unallocated Amounts.”

Derivative Instruments and Hedging

Disclosure within this footnote is presented to provide transparency about how and why we use derivative instruments and how the instruments and related hedged items affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. See Note 2 for a discussion surrounding our derivative instrument and hedging

accounting policies, Note 15

for additional information regarding the fair value of our derivative instruments and Note 1


for additional information regarding the effect of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges on the consolidated statement of operations.

We are exposed to certain risks related to our ongoing business operations. The primary risks that we manage by using derivative instruments are foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk. Our subsidiaries enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to manage the exchange risk associated with their forecasted intercompany inventory purchases and sales for the next year.

From time to time, we may also enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations associated with specific, significant transactions. We enter into interest rate swaps to minimize the impact of interest rate fluctuations associated with our variable-rate Credit Facility

.

The primary purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to protect against the volatility associated with foreign currency transactions, includi

ng transactions denominated in e

uro, British pound, Japanese yen, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar and Swiss franc.

We also utilize natural hedges to mitigate our transaction and commitment exposures. Our

corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity.

We enter into foreign currency exchange contracts with large multinational financial institutions and we do not hold or engage in transactions involving derivative instruments for purposes other than risk management. Our accounting policies for these contracts are based on our designation of such instruments as hedging transactions.

Cash Flow Hedges

We have designated our foreign currency exchange contracts and variable-to-fixed interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges as these derivative instruments mitigate the exposure to variability in the cash flows of forecasted transactions attributable to foreign currency exchange and interest rates. Unless noted otherwise, we have also designated our derivative instruments as qualifying for hedge accounting treatment.

We did not de-designate any instruments from hedge accounting treatment during t

he years ended December 31, 2014

,

2013 and 2012

. Gains or losses related to hedge ineffectiveness recognized in earnings during the

years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012

were not material

.

At December 31, 2014, the estimated amount of net gains, net of income tax expense, which are expected to be reclassified out of AOCI and into earnings within the next twelve months is $

7.4

million if exchange and interest rates do not fluctuate from the levels at December 31, 2014.

F-


We enter into foreign currency exchange contracts for amounts that are less than the full value of forecasted intercompany inventory purchases and sales.

Our hedging strategy related to

intercompany inventory purchases and sales

is to employ the full amount of our hedges for the succeeding year at the conclusion of our budgeting process for that year. We primarily utilize foreign currency exchange contracts with durations of

less than 24 months

. Quarterly, we enter into contracts to hedge incremental portions of anticipated foreign currency transactions for the current and following year. As a result, our risk with respect to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and the notional value of foreign currency exchange contracts may vary throughout the year.

The U.S. dollar is the currency purchased or sold in all of our foreign currency exchange contracts. The notional amount of foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge forecasted intercompany inventory purch

ases and sales totaled $


86.7

million and

$168.3

million at December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively

.

We have entered into forward fixed interest rate swap agreements to manage the economic effect of variable interest obligations on amounts borrowed under the terms of the Credit Facility. Beginning on March 30, 2012, the variable interest rate associated with $


million of borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility became effectively fixed at

1.36

% plus the Credit Spread through June 30, 2016. Beginning on March 28, 2013, the variable interest rate associated with an additional $


million of borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility became effectively fixed at

1.64

% plus the Credit Spread through June 30, 2016. Two of our forward fixed interest rate swap agreements expired on March 31, 2012. Under these agreements, the variable interest rate associated with $


million of borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility had been effectively fixed at


% plus the Credit Spread.

REPURCHASES OF COMMON STOCK

Our board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to

57,000,000

shares of our common stock in the open market or in negotiated transactions pursuant to the Company’s share repurchase program. We believe that the repurchase of our common stock is a favorable means of returning value to our shareholders, and we also repurchase to offset the dilutive effect of our share-based compensation programs. Repurchases of our common stock may vary d

epending upon the level of other investing activities and the share price. As of December 31, 2014, there are

DISPOSITION OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCT LINES AND RESTRUCTURING

In the fourth quarter of 2008, we sold our

Acarexx

®

and

SURPASS

®

veterinary pharmaceutical products and a feline insulin product under development, which were a part of our CAG segment, for cash proceeds of $

7.0

million, a short-term receivable of $

1.4

million and up to $

11.5

million of future payments based on the achievement of certain development and sales milestones by the acquirer of the feline insulin product. In the fourth quarter of 2009 we earned and received a milestone payment of $

2.0

million in connection with the achievement of certain development milestones by the acquirer.

We earned milestone payments of $

3.5

million, $

3.0

million and $

3.0

million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, in connection with the achievement of certain sales milestones by the acquirer following commercialization of the feline insulin product. These aggregate milestone payments were received in the first quarter of 2013, 2012 and 2011 respectively. The 2013 milestone payment was included in other current assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet for the year ended December 31, 2012.

Because we had no obligation to deliver product or services, or otherwise provide support to the third party under this agreement, and because collectability was reasonably assured, these milestone payments were included in results of operations when earned. The payments were not classified as revenue because the transaction was accounted for as the sale of a business; rather they

were reflected as reductions to general and administrative expenses as earned. We are not eligible to receive any further milestone payments under this agreement.

F-


In the fourth quarter of 2008, we also entered into a separate royalty bearing license agreement related to certain intellectual property of our pharmaceutical division. Under this agreement we received $

0.3

million up front, $

1.6

million in the fourth quarter of 2014 and $

0.3

million in the fourth quarters of 2013 and 2010 in connection with the achievement of certain production and clinical field trial milestones by the licensee. We had no obligation to deliver produc

t or services, or otherwise provide support to the third party under this agreement. Due to these circumstances, and because collectability is reasonably assured, milestone payments earned under this agreement were included in results of operations when earned. The payments received during the year ended December 31, 2014 satisfied the licensee’s milestone payment obligation. Under the agreement, future royalties are due to us contingent upon commercialization of the product.
