PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

We
operate primarily through three business segments: products and services for the
veterinary market, which we refer to as our Companion Animal Group (“CAG”),
water quality products (“Water”) and products for production animal health and
dairy quality, which we refer to as the Food Diagnostics Group (“FDG”). See Note
18 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2005 included
in this Form 10-K for financial information about our business segments, including
geographic information, and about our product and service categories.

COMPANION ANIMAL GROUP

Instruments
and Consumables

We
currently market several instrument systems, as well as associated consumable products,
for use in veterinary clinics. These instruments, which we refer to collectively as the
IDEXX VetLab®, are described below.

Blood
and Urine Chemistry

. Our VetTest

®

Chemistry Analyzer is used to measure levels of
certain enzymes and other substances in blood or urine in order to assist the veterinarian
in diagnosing physiologic conditions. Twenty-four separate tests can be performed on the
VetTest

®

Chemistry Analyzer and additional parameters can be calculated. Blood tests
commonly run include glucose, alkaline phosphatase, ALT (alanine aminotransferase),
creatinine, BUN (blood urea nitrogen) and total protein. The VetTest

®

Chemistry
Analyzer also runs tests for urine protein/urine creatinine ratio, which assists in the
detection of early renal disease. Tests are sold individually and in prepackaged panels,
such as the Preanesthetic Panel, the General Health Profile, the Equine Panel, the NSAID
(“nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug”) Monitoring Panel and the Quality Control
Panel.

We
purchase all of the reagents used in the VetTest

®

Chemistry Analyzer (“dry
chemistry slides” or “VetTest

®

slides”) from Ortho-Clinical
Diagnostics, Inc. (“Ortho”), a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson. See
“Business-Production and Supply.” In October 2003, we entered into an agreement
with Ortho under which we are developing a next-generation chemistry analyzer for the
veterinary market based on Ortho’s dry-slide technology, and Ortho will supply the
slide consumables used in both the VetTest

®

Chemistry Analyzer and the new analyzer
through 2020. We do not expect this new instrument to be commercially available before the
latter part of 2007.

Hematology

.
          We sell two hematology analyzers: the LaserCyte

®

Hematology
Analyzer, which           uses laser-flow cytometry technology to analyze components of
blood, including           red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets; and the
VetAutoread™          Hematology Analyzer.

Electrolytes
and Blood Gases

. Our VetLyte

®

analyzer measures three electrolytes—sodium,
potassium and chloride—to aid in evaluating acid-base and electrolyte balances and
assessing plasma hydration. We purchase our VetLyte

®

Electrolyte Analyzers and
consumables from Roche Diagnostics Corporation.

Our
VetStat™ analyzer measures electrolytes, blood gases, acid-base balance, glucose and
ionized calcium, and calculates other parameters, such as bicarbonate and anion gap. These
measurements aid veterinarians in evaluating fluid therapy choices and measuring
respiratory function. The VetStat™ Electrolyte and Blood Gas Analyzer runs single-use
disposable cassettes that contain various configurations of analytes. We purchase all of
our VetStat™ Electrolyte and Blood Gas Analyzers and consumables from Osmetech, Inc.

Quantitative
Immunoassay Testing

. The IDEXX SNAP

®

Reader allows the veterinarian to obtain
quantitative measurements of total thyroxine (T


), cortisol and bile acids. These
measurements assist in diagnosing and monitoring the treatment of certain endocrine
diseases, such as hyper- and hypothyroidism, Cushing’s syndrome and Addison’s
disease. Samples and reagents are introduced to the analyzer using our SNAP

®

platform.

Rapid
Assays

We
provide a broad range of single-use, handheld test kits that allow quick, accurate and
convenient test results for a variety of companion animal diseases and health conditions.
These products enable veterinarians to provide improved service to animal owners by
delivering test results and a diagnosis at the time of the patient visit, allowing the
veterinarian to initiate therapy or prevention, if required.


Our
principal single-use tests are sold under the SNAP

®

name, and include a feline
combination test, the SNAP

®

Combo FIV antibody/FeLV antigen test, which enables
veterinarians to test simultaneously for feline immunodeficiency virus (“FIV”)
(which is similar to the human AIDS virus) and feline leukemia virus (“FeLV”); a
canine combination test, the SNAP

®

3Dx

®

, which tests simultaneously for Lyme
disease, Ehrlichia canis and heartworm; a canine heartworm-only test; a canine test for
parvovirus; a feline test for FeLV only; and canine and feline tests for Giardia, a
parasitic disease. Sales of heartworm tests are greater in the first half of our fiscal
year due to seasonality of the disease.

In
addition to our single-use tests, we sell a line of microwell-based test kits, under the
PetChek

®

name, that are used by larger clinics and laboratories to test multiple
samples. PetChek

®

tests offer accuracy, ease of use and cost advantages to high-volume
customers. We currently sell PetChek

®

tests for canine heartworm disease, FIV, and
FeLV.

Veterinary
Reference Laboratory and Consulting Services

We
offer commercial veterinary reference laboratory and consulting services to veterinarians
in the U.S., Europe, Australia and Japan. Veterinarians use our services by submitting
samples by courier or overnight delivery to one of our facilities. Our laboratories offer
a large selection of tests and diagnostic panels to detect a number of disease states and
other conditions in production and companion animals.

Additionally,
we provide specialized veterinary consultation, telemedicine and advisory services,
including cardiology, radiology, internal medicine and ultrasound consulting. These
services permit veterinarians to obtain readings and interpretations of test results
transmitted by telephone and over the Internet from the veterinarians’ offices.

Practice
Information Management and Digital Radiography Systems

Practice
Information Management Systems and Services

. We develop, market and sell practice
information management systems (“PIMS”) including hardware and software that run
key functions of veterinary clinics, including patient electronic health records
management, scheduling (including boarding and grooming), billing and inventory
management. Our principal system is the Cornerstone® system. We believe we are one of
the leading providers of veterinary practice information management systems in North
America, with an installed base of more than 7,200 of the approximately 28,000 veterinary
hospitals in North America. We also provide software and hardware support to our PIMS
customers, and related supplies and services to veterinarian PIMS users in general, and we
derive a significant portion of our revenues for this product line from ongoing service
contracts.

Digital
Radiography Systems and Services

. Our digital radiography systems capture radiograph
images in digital form, replacing traditional x-ray film. Use of digital radiography
systems eliminates the need for the film and processor, hazardous chemicals and darkroom
required for the production of film images, and provides for image manipulation and
enhancement through contrast management. We market and sell the IDEXX Digital Radiography
System, which is appropriate for use in the small animal veterinary clinic, and two
systems that are primarily used as portable units in ambulatory veterinary practices, such
as equine practices: the IDEXX Equiview™ Digital Radiography System and the IDEXX
Digital Radiography Compact System. Our digital radiography systems use IDEXX-PACS™
picture archiving and communication system (“PACS”) software for the viewing,
manipulation, management, storage and retrieval of the digital images generated by the
digital capture plate. The IDEXX-PACS™ software also permits images from our digital
radiography systems to be integrated into patients’ medical records in the
Cornerstone

®

system, as well as transferred to other practice information management
systems.

Pharmaceutical
Products

We
develop, market and sell therapeutics for the veterinary market. We currently market and
sell four pharmaceutical products: PZI VET

®

, an insulin product for the treatment of
diabetic cats; ACAREXX

®

(.01% ivermectin) otic suspension for the treatment of ear
mites in cats; SURPASS

®

(1% diclofenac sodium), a topical, nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drug for equine use; and Navigator

®

(32% nitazoxanide) Antiprotozoal
Oral Paste, a treatment for equine protozoal myeloencephalitis (EPM). We are developing a
long-acting, injectable form of the antibiotic tilmicosin for cats.


WATER

We
offer a range of products used in the detection of various microbiological analytes in
water.

Our
Colilert

®

, Colilert

®

-18 and Colisure

®

tests simultaneously detect total
coliforms and E. coli in water. These organisms are broadly used as indicators of
microbial contamination in water. These products utilize indicator-nutrients that produce
a change in color or fluorescence when metabolized by target microbes in the sample. Our
water tests are used by government laboratories, water utilities and private certified
laboratories to test drinking water in compliance with U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency (“EPA”) standards. The tests also are used in evaluating water used in
production processes (for example, in beverage and pharmaceutical applications) and in
evaluating bottled water, recreational water, waste water and water from private wells.

Our
Enterolert™ product detects enterococci in drinking and recreational waters. Our
Quanti-Tray

®

products, when used in conjunction with our Colilert

®

,
Colilert

®

-18, Colisure

®

or Enterolert™ products, provide users quantitative
measurements of microbial contamination, rather than a presence/absence indication. The
Colilert

®

, Colilert-18

®

, Colisure

®

and Quanti-Tray

®

products have been approved
by the EPA and by regulatory agencies in certain other countries.

Our
Filta-Max

®

product is used in the detection of

Cryptosporidia

in water.

Cryptosporidia

are parasites that can cause potentially fatal gastrointestinal illness if ingested.
Testing of water supplies for

Cryptosporidia

is mandated by regulation in the United
Kingdom, but is not regulated in other countries at this time.

FOOD DIAGNOSTICS GROUP

Production
Animal Services

We
sell diagnostic tests and related instrumentation and software that are used to detect a
wide range of diseases and to monitor health status in production animals. Our production
animal products are purchased primarily by government laboratories and poultry and swine
producers. Significant products include diagnostic tests for porcine reproductive and
respiratory syndrome and pseudorabies virus in pigs; Newcastle disease in poultry; and
Johne’s disease, bovine viral diarrhea virus, and brucellosis in cattle. In December
2004, we completed the acquisition of Dr. Bommeli AG, a Swiss manufacturer of production
animal tests, for cash consideration of approximately $15.8 million, net of cash acquired.

We
have developed a postmortem test for bovine spongiform encephalopathy (“BSE” or
“mad cow disease”). This test was approved for use in the U.S. by the United
States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) in 2004 and for use in the European
Union (“EU”) by the European Commission in February 2005. We also offer a
related kit for the detection of a similar disease, scrapie, in small ruminants, including
sheep. Testing for BSE in the U.S. is limited and we do not know when or if the USDA will
expand its testing program, which would increase the domestic market for these tests.

Dairy
Testing

Our
principal product for use in testing for antibiotic residue in milk is the SNAP

®

beta-lactam test. Dairy producers and processors use our tests for quality assurance of
raw milk, and government and food-quality managers use them for ongoing surveillance.

In
March 2003, we entered into an agreement with the FDA under which we agreed, among other
things, to perform specified lot release and stability testing of our SNAP

®

beta-lactam products and to provide related data to the FDA. If the FDA were to determine
that one or more lots of product failed to meet applicable criteria for product
performance or stability, the FDA could take various actions, including requiring us to
recall products or restricting our ability to sell these products. Sales of dairy
antibiotic residue testing products were $15.6 million in 2005.

MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION

We
market, sell and service our products worldwide through our marketing, sales and technical
service groups, as well as through independent distributors and other resellers. We
maintain sales offices outside the U.S. in Australia, China, France, Germany, Italy,
Japan, the Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland, Taiwan and the United Kingdom. In 2005, 2004
and 2003, we spent $102.0 million, $85.7 million, and $71.8 million or 16%, 16%, and 15%
of sales, respectively, on sales and marketing.


Generally,
we select the appropriate distribution channel for our products based on the type of
product, technical service requirements, number and concentration of customers, regulatory
requirements and other factors. We market our veterinary diagnostic and pharmaceutical
products to veterinarians both directly and through independent veterinary distributors in
the U.S., with most instruments sold directly by IDEXX sales personnel, and test kits,
pharmaceutical products and instrument consumables supplied primarily by the distribution
channel. Outside the U.S., we sell our veterinary diagnostic products through our direct
sales force and, in certain countries, through distributors and other resellers. We sell
our reference laboratory services worldwide through our direct sales force. We market our
software products through our direct sales force primarily in the U.S. We market our water
and food diagnostics products primarily through our direct sales force in the U.S. and
Canada. Outside the U.S. and Canada, we market these products through selected independent
distributors and, in certain countries, through our direct sales force.

In
2005, two of our CAG distributors, The Butler Company and Burns Veterinary Supply, Inc.,
merged and, as a result, they collectively accounted for 10% of our 2005 revenue and 4% of
our net accounts receivable at December 31, 2005. In 2004 and 2003, no customer accounted
for greater than 10% of our revenue. Our largest customers are our U.S. distributors of
our products in the CAG segment. The largest consumer of our products and services
accounts for approximately 1% of our sales.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

Our
business includes the development and introduction of new products and may involve entry
into new business areas. Our research and development activity is focused primarily on
development of new diagnostic instrument platforms and information systems, new
immunoassay devices, new diagnostic tests, new animal drugs, enhanced practice information
systems, and improvements in the performance, connectivity and interoperability of our
products and services. Our research and development expenses, which consist of salaries,
employee benefits, materials and consulting costs, were approximately $40.9 million, $35.4
million and $32.3 million, or 6%, 6% and 7% of sales, in 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.

PATENTS AND LICENSES

We
actively seek to obtain patent protection in the U.S. and other countries for inventions
covering our products and technologies. We also license patents and technologies from
third parties. These licenses include an exclusive royalty-bearing license of certain
patents relating to diagnostic products for FIV that expire in 2009, from The Regents of
the University of California; and exclusive licenses from Tulane University and the
University of Texas to certain patents and patent applications expiring beginning in 2019
that relate to the detection of Lyme disease. We also have an exclusive royalty-bearing
license of certain patents expiring in 2007 relating to defined substrate technology
(“DST”) that is utilized in the Colilert

®

, Colilert-18

®

, Colisure

®

and
Enterolert™ water-testing products, although we do not believe the expiration of the
DST patents in 2007 will have a material effect on our water business. In addition, we
hold a U.S. patent expiring in 2014 that specifically covers the Colilert®-18 product
and another patent expiring in 2014 that relates to certain methods and kits for
simultaneously detecting antigens and antibodies, and which covers certain of our
SNAP

®

products, including our SNAP

®

Combo FIV/FeLV and Canine SNAP

®

3Dx

®

combination tests.

To
the extent some of our products may now, or in the future, embody technologies protected
by patents, copyrights or trade secrets of others, we may be required to obtain licenses
to such technologies in order to continue to sell our products. These licenses may not be
available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our failure to obtain any such
licenses may delay or prevent the sale of certain new or existing products. See
“Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.”


PRODUCTION AND SUPPLY

VetTest

®

Chemistry Analyzers are manufactured for us by Tokyo Parts Industrial Company, Ltd. under
an agreement that renews annually unless either party notifies the other of its decision
not to renew. VetTest

®

slides are supplied exclusively by Ortho under supply
agreements with Ortho (the “Ortho Agreements”). We are required to purchase all
of our requirements for our current menu of VetTest

®

slides from Ortho to the extent
Ortho is able to supply those requirements. In addition, we have committed to minimum
annual purchase volumes of certain VetTest

®

slides through 2010. The Ortho Agreements
expire on December 31, 2020.

The
VetAutoread™ Hematology Analyzer is manufactured for us by QBC Diagnostics, Inc.
(“QBCD”) under a supply agreement that expires on December 31, 2020. The
VetLyte

®

Electrolyte Analyzer is manufactured for us by Roche Diagnostics Corporation
under an agreement that requires Roche Diagnostics to supply analyzers through December
31, 2006, and consumables and spare parts through December 31, 2013. The VetStat™
Electrolyte and Blood Gas Analyzer is manufactured for us by Osmetech, Inc. under an
agreement that requires Osmetech to supply analyzers and consumables through 2015 and we
have an option to extend this agreement for an additional four years. We have certain
minimum purchase obligations under these agreements.

We
purchase certain other products, raw materials and components from a single supplier.
These include active ingredients for our pharmaceutical products, certain digital
radiography systems, instrument consumables, and certain components used in our SNAP

®

rapid assay devices, water testing products and LaserCyte

®

Hematology Analyzers. We
have in the past been successful in ensuring an uninterrupted supply of products purchased
from single source suppliers. However, there can be no assurance that uninterrupted supply
can be maintained if these agreements terminate for any reason or our suppliers otherwise
are unable to satisfy our requirements for products.

We
do not generally maintain significant backlog and believe that our backlog at any
particular date historically has not been indicative of future sales.

COMPETITION

We
face intense competition within the markets in which we sell our products and services. We
expect that future competition will become even more intense, and that we will have to
compete with changing technologies, which could affect the marketability of our products
and services. Our competitive position also will depend on our ability to develop
proprietary products, attract and retain qualified scientific and other personnel, develop
and implement production and marketing plans, obtain or license patent rights, and obtain
adequate capital resources.

We
compete with many companies ranging from small businesses focused on animal health to
large pharmaceutical companies. Our competitors vary in our different markets. Academic
institutions, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations
also conduct research activities and may commercialize products, which could compete with
our products, on their own or through joint ventures. Some of our competitors have
substantially greater capital, manufacturing, marketing, and research and development
resources than we do.

Competitive
factors in our different business areas are detailed below:

•

Veterinary
diagnostic products and food and water testing products

. We compete primarily on the
basis of the ease of use, speed, accuracy and other performance characteristics of our
products and services (including unique tests), the breadth of our product line and
services, the effectiveness of our sales and distribution channels, the quality of our
technical and customer service, and our pricing relative to the value of our products.

•

Veterinary
laboratory and consulting services

. In this market, we compete primarily on the basis of
quality, service, technology, and our pricing relative to the value of our services. We
compete in certain geographic locations in the U.S. with Antech Diagnostics, a unit of
VCA Antech, Inc.

•

Veterinary
pharmaceuticals

. We compete primarily on the basis of the performance characteristics of
our products.

•

Practice
Information Management and Digital Radiography Systems

. We compete primarily on the basis
of ease of use, connectivity to equipment and other systems, performance characteristics,
effectiveness of our customer service, information handling capabilities, advances in
technologies, and our pricing relative to the value of our products and services.


GOVERNMENT REGULATION

Many
of our products are subject to regulation by U.S. and foreign regulatory agencies. The
following is a description of the principal regulations affecting our businesses.

Veterinary
diagnostic products

. Most diagnostic tests for animal health applications are veterinary
biological products that are regulated in the U.S. by the Center for Veterinary Biologics
within the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (“APHIS”). The APHIS
regulatory approval process involves the submission of product performance data and
manufacturing documentation. Following regulatory approval to market a product, APHIS
requires that each lot of product be submitted for review before release to customers. In
addition, APHIS requires special approval to market products where test results are used
in part for government-mandated disease management programs. A number of foreign
governments accept APHIS approval as part of their separate regulatory approvals. However,
compliance with an extensive regulatory process is required in connection with marketing
diagnostic products in Japan, Germany, the Netherlands and many other countries. We also
are required to have a facility license from APHIS to manufacture USDA-licensed products.
We have obtained such a license for our manufacturing facility in Westbrook, Maine and
Memphis, Tennessee.

Our
instrument systems are medical devices regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(“FDA”) under the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act (the “FDC Act”). While
the sale of these products does not require premarket approval by FDA and does not subject
us to the FDA’s Good Manufacturing Practices regulations (“GMPs”), these
products must not be adulterated or misbranded under the FDC Act.

Veterinary
pharmaceuticals

. The manufacture and sale of veterinary pharmaceuticals are regulated by
the Center for Veterinary Medicine (“CVM”) of the FDA. A new animal drug may not
be commercially marketed in the U.S. unless it has been approved as safe and effective by
CVM. Approval may be requested by filing an NADA with CVM containing substantial evidence
as to the safety and effectiveness of the drug. Data regarding manufacturing methods and
controls also are required to be submitted with the NADA. Manufacturers of animal drugs
must also comply with GMPs and Good Laboratory Practices (“GLPs”). Sales of
animal drugs in countries outside the U.S. require compliance with the laws of those
countries, which may be extensive.

Water
testing products

. Our water tests are not subject to formal premarket regulatory approval.
However, before a test can be used as part of a water-quality monitoring program in the
U.S. that is required by the EPA, the test must first be approved by the EPA. The EPA
approval process involves submission of extensive product performance data in accordance
with an EPA-approved protocol, evaluation of the data by the EPA and publication for
public comment of any proposed approval in the Federal Register before final approval. Our
Colilert®, Colilert®-18, Colisure®, Quanti-Tray®, Filta-Max® and
SimPlate® for heterotropic plate counts (“HPC”) products have been approved
by the EPA. The sale of water-testing products also is subject to extensive and lengthy
regulatory processes in many other countries around the world.

Dairy
testing products

. The sale of dairy testing products in the U.S. is regulated by the FDA
in conjunction with the AOAC Research Institute (“AOAC RI”). Before a product
can be sold, extensive product performance data must be submitted in accordance with a
protocol that is approved by the FDA and the AOAC RI. Following approval of a product by
the FDA, the product must also be approved by the National Conference on Interstate Milk
Shipments (“NCIMS”), an oversight body that includes state, federal and industry
representatives. Our dairy antibiotic residue testing products have been approved by the
FDA and NCIMS. While some foreign countries accept AOAC RI approval as part of their
regulatory approval process, many countries have separate regulatory processes.

Any
acquisitions of new products and technologies may subject us to additional areas of
government regulation. These may involve food, drug and water-quality regulations of the
FDA, the EPA and the USDA, as well as state, local and foreign governments. See
“Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.”

EMPLOYEES

At
December 31, 2005, we had approximately 3,300 full-time and part-time employees. We are
not a party to any collective bargaining agreement and we believe that relations with our
employees are good.


ITEM 1A.      RISK FACTORS

Our
future operating results involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual events or
results may differ materially from those discussed in this report. Factors that could
cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, the factors
discussed below, as well as those discussed elsewhere in this report.

IDEXX's
Future Growth and Profitability Depend on Several Factors

The
future success of our business depends upon our ability to successfully implement various
strategies, including:

•

Developing,
manufacturing and marketing new products with new features and capabilities, including
pharmaceutical products; a new clinical chemistry instrument; and rapid assay, water
testing and production animal diagnostic products, as well as improving and enhancing
existing products;

•

Developing
and implementing new technology and licensing strategies; and identifying, completing and
integrating acquisitions that enhance our existing businesses or create new business
areas for us;

•

Increasing
the value to our customers of our companion animal products and services by enhancing the
connectivity of these products, including the connectivity among the IDEXX VetLab

®

instrument
suite, Cornerstone

®

practice information management system, the IDEXX-PACS™ software
and IDEXX Reference Laboratories;

•

Expanding
our market by expanding the installed base of our instrumentation through customer
acquisition and retention and increasing use of our products by our customers;

•

Strengthening
our sales and marketing activities both within the U.S. and in geographies outside of the
U.S.; and

•

Reducing
the costs of manufacturing our products and providing services through operating
efficiencies and increased focus on quality.

However,
we may not be able to successfully implement some or all of these strategies and increase
or sustain our rate of growth or profitability.

Our
Products and Services Are Subject to Various Government Regulations

In
the U.S., the manufacture and sale of our products are regulated by agencies such as the
U.S. Department of Agriculture (“USDA”), U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(“FDA”) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”). Most
diagnostic tests for animal health applications, including our canine, feline, poultry and
livestock tests, must be approved by the USDA prior to sale. Our water testing products
must be approved by the EPA before they can be used by customers in the U.S. as a part of
a water quality monitoring program required by the EPA. Our pharmaceutical and dairy
testing products require approval by the FDA. The manufacture and sale of our products are
subject to similar laws in many foreign countries. Any failure to comply with legal and
regulatory requirements relating to the manufacture and sale of our products in the U.S.
or in other countries could result in fines and sanctions against us or removals of our
products from the market, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations.

We
have entered into an agreement with the FDA under which we have agreed, among other
things, to perform specified lot release and stability testing of our SNAP®
beta-lactam dairy-testing products and to provide related data to the FDA. If the FDA were
to determine that one or more lots of product failed to meet applicable criteria for
product performance or stability, the FDA could take various actions, including requiring
us to recall products or restricting our ability to sell these products. Sales of dairy
antibiotic residue-testing products were $15.6 million for the year ended December 31,
2005.

Commercialization
of animal health pharmaceuticals in the U.S. requires prior approval by the FDA. To obtain
such approvals, we are required to submit substantial clinical, manufacturing and other
data to the FDA. Regulatory approval for products submitted to the FDA may take several
years and, following approval, the FDA continues to regulate all aspects of the
manufacture, labeling, storage, record keeping and promotion of pharmaceutical products.
Failure to obtain, or delays in obtaining, FDA approval for new pharmaceutical products
would have a negative impact on our future growth.


We
Purchase Materials for Our Products from a Limited Number of Sources

We
currently purchase many products and materials from single sources or a limited number of
sources. Some of the products that we purchase from these sources are proprietary, and,
therefore, cannot be readily replaced by alternative sources. These products include our
VetTest

®

Chemistry, VetAutoread™ Hematology, VetLyte

®

Electrolyte, and
VetStat™ Electrolyte and Blood Gas Analyzers and related consumables; certain digital
radiography system components, specifically image capture plates and readers; active
ingredients for pharmaceutical products; and certain components of our SNAP

®

rapid
assay devices, water testing products and LaserCyte

®

Hematology Analyzers. If we are
unable to obtain adequate quantities of these products in the future, we could face cost
increases or reductions or delays in product shipments, which could have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations.

The
slides sold for use in our VetTest

®

Chemistry Analyzers are purchased under an
agreement with Ortho that, as of December 31, 2005, required us to purchase a minimum of
$92.7 million of slides through 2010. We purchase our electrolyte instruments, components
and consumables under an agreement with Roche Diagnostics, under which we are required to
purchase a minimum of $4.1 million of these products through 2006. We purchase our
VetAutoread™ Hematology Analyzers, components and consumables under an agreement with
QBCD, under which we are required to make aggregate minimum purchases of $18.0 million
through 2020. If demand for any of the products purchased under these agreements is
insufficient to support our minimum purchase obligations for those products, we could
incur losses related to those obligations. In addition, because we purchase the products
at predetermined prices, our profits on sales of these products could decline if we are
unable to maintain current pricing levels for such products.

Our
Biologic Products Are Complex and Difficult to Manufacture

Many
of our rapid assay and production animal diagnostic products are biologics, which are
products that are comprised of materials from living organisms, such as antibodies, cells
and sera. Manufacturing biologic products is highly complex. Unlike products that rely on
chemicals for efficacy (such as most pharmaceuticals), biologics are difficult to
characterize due to the inherent variability of biological input materials. Difficulty in
characterizing biological materials or their interactions creates greater risk in the
manufacturing process. We attempt to mitigate risk associated with the manufacture of
biologics by continuing to improve the characterization of all of our input materials,
utilizing multiple vendors, manufacturing some of these materials ourselves and
maintaining substantial inventories of materials that have demonstrated the appropriate
characteristics. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain
adequate sources of biological materials or that biological materials that we maintain in
inventory will yield finished products that satisfy applicable product release criteria.
Our inability to obtain necessary biological materials or to successfully manufacture
biologic products that incorporate such materials could have a material adverse effect on
our results of operations.

Our
Success Is Heavily Dependent Upon Our Proprietary Technologies

We
rely on a combination of patent, trade secret, trademark and copyright laws to protect our
proprietary rights. If we do not have adequate protection of our proprietary rights, our
business may be affected by competitors who develop substantially equivalent technologies
that compete with us.

We
cannot ensure that we will obtain issued patents, that any patents issued or licensed to
us will remain valid, or that any patents owned or licensed by us will provide protection
against competitors with similar technologies. Even if our patents cover products sold by
our competitors, the time and expense of litigating to enforce our patent rights could be
substantial, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In
addition, expiration of patent rights could result in substantial new competition in the
markets for products previously covered by those patent rights.

In
the past, we have received notices claiming that our products infringe third-party patents
and we may receive such notices in the future. Patent litigation is complex and expensive,
and the outcome of patent litigation can be difficult to predict. We cannot ensure that we
will win a patent litigation case or negotiate an acceptable resolution of such a case. If
we lose, we may be stopped from selling certain products and/or we may be required to pay
damages and/or ongoing royalties as a result of the lawsuit. Any such adverse result could
have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.


Our
Sales Are Dependent on Distributor Purchasing Patterns

We
sell many of our products, including substantially all of the rapid assays and instrument
consumables sold in the U.S., through distributors. Because significant product sales are
made to a limited number of customers, unanticipated changes in the timing and size of
distributor purchases can have a negative effect on quarterly results. Our financial
performance, therefore, is subject to an unexpected downturn in product demand and may be
unpredictable.

Distributors
of veterinary products have entered into business combinations resulting in fewer
distribution companies. Consolidation within distribution channels would increase our
customer concentration level, which could increase the risks described in the preceding
paragraph.

Our
Markets Are Competitive and Subject to Rapid and Substantial Technological Change

We
face intense competition within the markets in which we sell our products and services. We
expect that future competition will become even more intense, and that we will have to
compete with changing and improving technologies. Some of our competitors and potential
competitors, including large pharmaceutical and diagnostic companies, have substantially
greater capital, manufacturing, marketing, and research and development resources than we
do.

Changes
in Diagnostic Testing Could Negatively Affect Our Operating Results

The
market for diagnostic tests could be negatively impacted by the introduction or broad
market acceptance of vaccines or preventatives for the diseases and conditions for which
we sell diagnostic tests and services. Eradication or substantial declines in the
prevalence of certain diseases also could lead to a decline in diagnostic testing for such
diseases. Our production animal services business in particular is subject to fluctuations
resulting from changes in disease prevalence and government-mandated testing programs.
Such declines in diagnostic testing could have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations.

International
Revenue Accounts for a Significant Portion of Our Total Revenue

For
the year ended December 31, 2005, 34% of our revenue was attributable to sales of products
and services to customers outside the U.S. Various risks associated with foreign
operations may impact our international sales. Possible risks include fluctuations in the
value of foreign currencies, disruptions in transportation of our products, the differing
product and service needs of foreign customers, difficulties in building and managing
foreign operations, import/export duties and quotas, and unexpected regulatory, economic
or political changes in foreign markets. Prices that we charge to foreign customers may be
different than the prices we charge for the same products in the U.S. due to competitive,
market or other factors. As a result, the mix of domestic and international sales in a
particular period could have a material impact on our results for that period. In
addition, many of the products for which our selling price may be denominated in foreign
currencies are manufactured, sourced, or both, in the U.S. and our costs are incurred in
U.S. dollars. We utilize nonspeculative forward currency exchange contracts to mitigate
foreign currency exposure, however, an appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the
foreign currencies in which we sell these products would reduce our operating margins.

The Loss of Our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman Could Adversely Affect
         Our Business

We
rely on the management and leadership of Jonathan W. Ayers, our President, Chief Executive
Officer and Chairman. We do not maintain key man life insurance coverage for Mr. Ayers.
The loss of Mr. Ayers could have a material impact on our business.


We Could Be Subject to Class Action Litigation Due to Stock Price Volatility, which, if
Occurs, Could Result in Substantial Costs or Large Judgments Against Us

The
market for our common stock may experience extreme price and volume fluctuations, which
may be unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance or prospects. In the
past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against companies
following periods of volatility in the market prices of their securities. We may be the
target of similar litigation in the future. Securities litigation could result in
substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources, which could
have a negative effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.

If Our Quarterly Results of Operations Fluctuate, This Fluctuation May Cause Our Stock Price
to Decline, Resulting in Losses to You

Our
prior operating results have fluctuated due to a number of factors, including seasonality
of certain product lines; changes in our accounting estimates; the impact of acquisitions;
timing of distributor purchases, product launches, research and development expenditures,
litigation and claim-related expenditures; changes in competitors’ product offerings;
and other matters. Similarly, our future operating results may vary significantly from
quarter to quarter due to these and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.
If our operating results or projections of future operating results do not meet the
expectations of market analysts or investors in future periods, our stock price may fall.

Future Operating Results Could Be Materially Affected By the Resolution of Various Uncertain Tax
Positions and Adversely Affected by Potential Changes to Tax Incentives

In
the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where
the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Significant judgment is required in
determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and our income tax filings are
regularly under audit by tax authorities. We believe that we have adequately accrued for
all potential tax liabilities and, although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable,
the final determination of tax audits could be materially different than that which is
reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals. Additionally, we benefit from
certain tax incentives offered by various jurisdictions. If we are unable to meet the
requirements of such incentives, our inability to use these benefits could have a material
negative effect on future earnings.

ITEM 1B.      UNRESOLVED
STAFF COMMENTS

ITEM 2.       PROPERTIES

We
lease approximately 329,000 square feet of office and manufacturing space in Westbrook,
Maine, under leases expiring in 2013 and 2018. On January 17, 2006, we entered into an
agreement with the owner to purchase the building in which our headquarters facility is
located, which includes an additional 130,000 square feet of vacant space, for $18.0
million less the face value of the existing mortgage of approximately $6.5 million. Our
acquisition of this facility is subject to certain conditions to closing, including
completion of our due diligence review and receipt of certain state and local incentives.
We lease approximately 97,500 square feet of industrial space in Memphis, Tennessee, for
use as a distribution facility, under a lease expiring in 2013; approximately 40,000
square feet of office and manufacturing space in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, for our veterinary
practice information management software business, under a lease expiring in 2009; and
approximately 48,000 square feet of warehouse and office space in the Netherlands for use
as our headquarters for European operations, under a lease expiring in 2008.

We
also lease a total of approximately 43,000 square feet of smaller office, manufacturing
and warehouse space in the U.S. and elsewhere in the world. In addition, we own or lease
approximately 235,000 square feet of space in the U.S., Australia, Germany, Switzerland
and the United Kingdom for use as veterinary reference laboratories and office space for
our veterinary consulting services. Of this space, 63,000 square feet is owned by us and
the remaining amount is leased, under leases having expiration dates up to the year 2012.


We
consider that the properties are generally in good condition, are well-maintained, and are
generally suitable and adequate to carry on our business.

ITEM 7.
      MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS

BUSINESS OVERVIEW

We
operate primarily through three business segments: the Companion Animal Group
(“CAG”), Water testing business (“Water”) and the Food Diagnostics
Group (“FDG”). CAG is comprised of the following product and service categories:
instruments and consumables, rapid assays, reference laboratory and consulting services,
practice information management and digital radiography systems, and pharmaceuticals.
Water develops, designs, manufactures and distributes products to detect contaminants in
water. FDG develops, designs, manufactures and distributes products to detect disease and
contaminants in production animals and dairy products. Other items that are not included
in our reportable segments are comprised primarily of corporate research and development
and interest income.


For
the three years ended December 31, 2005, revenues by product and service categories were
as follows

(in thousands)

:

The
following is a discussion of the strategic and operating factors that we believe have the
most significant effect on the performance of our business.

Companion
Animal Group

In
the CAG segment, we believe we have developed a strategic advantage over companies with
more narrow product or service offerings. The breadth of our products and services gives
us scale in sales and distribution, permits us to offer integrated disease-management
solutions that leverage the advantages of both point-of-care and outside laboratory
testing, and facilitates the flow of medical and business information in the veterinary
practice by connecting practice information software systems, including connecting the
electronic health record with laboratory test data, in-clinic test data from our IDEXX
VetLab

®

suite of analyzers, and radiographic data in the IDEXX-PACS™ software
taken by our digital radiography systems.

In
the U.S., we sell instrument consumables, rapid assays and pharmaceuticals primarily
through distributors, and, therefore, our reported sales of these products are sales made
to distributors, rather than sales to veterinarians, the end-users. Because distributor
inventory levels and purchasing patterns may fluctuate, sales of a particular product line
in a particular period may not always be representative of the underlying customer demand
for the product. Therefore, we closely track sales of these products by our U.S.
distributors to the veterinarians (“practice-level sales”), which we think
provides a more accurate picture of the real growth rate for these products. In the
discussion of results below, we note certain instances where we believe reported sales
have been influenced, positively or negatively, by changes in distributor inventories.

Instruments
and Consumables

. Our instrument strategy is to provide veterinarians with an integrated
set of instruments that, individually and together, provide superior diagnostic
information in the clinic, enabling veterinarians to practice better medicine and, in
doing so, achieve their practice objectives, including growth and economic success. We
derive substantial revenues from the sale of consumables that are used in these
instruments. During the early stage of an instrument’s life cycle, we derive
relatively greater revenues from instrument placements, while consumable sales become
relatively more significant in later stages as the installed base of instruments increases
and instrument placement revenues begin to decline.

We
have a large installed base of VetTest

®

Chemistry Analyzers, and substantially all of
our revenues from that product line are now derived from consumables sales, although in
recent years we have grown the annual number of unit instrument placements through sales,
lease, rental and other programs. Our long-term success in this area of our business is
dependent upon new customer acquisition, customer retention and increased customer
utilization of existing and new assays introduced on these instruments. To increase
utilization, we seek to educate veterinarians about best medical practices that emphasize
the importance of blood and urine chemistry testing for a variety of diagnostic purposes.


We
purchase the consumables used in VetTest

®

Chemistry Analyzers from Ortho under a
supply agreement that continues through 2020. This supply agreement provides us with a
long-term source of slides at costs that improve annually through 2010, and also improve
over the term of the agreement as a result of increasing volume. Under this agreement, we
are developing and expect to introduce a next-generation chemistry analyzer for the
veterinary market based on the Ortho dry-slide technology, and Ortho will supply us with
slide consumables used in both the new instrument and the VetTest

®

Chemistry Analyzer.
We do not expect this next-generation analyzer to be commercially available before the
latter part of 2007.

In
the fourth quarter of 2002, we introduced the LaserCyte

®

Hematology Analyzer, which
provides more extensive hematological diagnostic information than our original platform,
the VetAutoread™ Hematology Analyzer. A substantial portion of LaserCyte

®

placements have been made at veterinary clinics that already own our VetAutoread™
Hematology Analyzers. Although we have experienced growth in sales of hematology
consumables, LaserCyte

®

consumable sales have been partially offset by declines in
sales of VetAutoread™ consumables. Because the gross margin percentage of
LaserCyte

®

consumables exceeds the gross margin percentage of the VetAutoread™
consumables, gross margin from hematology consumables is expected to increase with
continued penetration of the LaserCyte

®

Hematology Analyzer. Our gross margins on
LaserCyte

®

Hematology Analyzer sales have been low in the early years of the program
due to higher manufacturing, service and warranty costs associated with a new analyzer. As
we have gained experience with the analyzer, we have improved manufacturing efficiency and
reduced warranty and service costs, which have improved gross margins on these products,
particularly in 2005. While we expect that LaserCyte

®

gross margins will continue to
improve, they will continue to have a negative impact on overall CAG gross margins.

With
all of our instrument lines, we seek to differentiate our products based on breadth of
diagnostic menu, flexibility of menu selection, accuracy, reliability, ease of use,
ability to handle compromised samples, time to result, analytical capability of software,
integration with the IDEXX VetLab

®

system, education and training, and superior sales
and customer service. Our equipment and consumables typically are sold at a premium price
to competitive offerings. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to maintain a
premium price strategy.

Rapid
Assays

. Our rapid assay business comprises single-use kits for in-clinic testing and
microwell-based kits for large clinic and laboratory testing for canine and feline
diseases and conditions. Our rapid assay strategy is to develop, manufacture, market and
sell proprietary tests with superior performance that address important medical needs. As
in our other lines of business, we also seek to differentiate our products through
superior sales and customer service. These products carry price premiums over competitive
products that we believe do not offer equivalent performance and diagnostic capabilities,
and which we believe do not include a similar level of support. We augment our product
development and customer service efforts with sales and marketing programs that enhance
medical awareness and understanding regarding our target diseases and the importance of
diagnostic testing.

Reference
Laboratory and Consulting Services

. We believe that more than half of all diagnostic
testing by U.S. veterinarians is done at outside reference laboratories such as our IDEXX
Reference Laboratories. We attempt to differentiate our laboratory testing services from
those of our competitors primarily on the basis of quality, customer service, technology
employed and specialized test menu. Revenue growth in this business is achieved both
through increased sales at existing laboratories and through the acquisition of new
customers, including through laboratory acquisitions and opening new laboratories. In
2004, we acquired a laboratory in Columbus, Ohio, opened a laboratory in Seattle,
Washington, and acquired Vet Med Lab, which is based in Germany and is the largest
European veterinary reference laboratory. In 2005, we acquired laboratories in
Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and France and acquired veterinary laboratory customer
lists in the U.S. and Germany. Profitability of this business is largely the result of our
ability to achieve efficiencies from both volume and operational improvements. New
laboratories that we open typically will operate at a loss until testing volumes reach a
level that permits profitability. Acquired laboratories frequently operate less profitably
than our existing laboratories and those laboratories may not achieve profitability
comparable to our existing laboratories for a year or more while we implement operating
improvements. Therefore, in the short term, new and acquired reference laboratories
generally will have a negative effect on the operating margin of the laboratory and
consulting services business.


Practice
Information Management and Digital Radiography Systems

. These businesses consist of
veterinary practice information management systems (“PIMS”) including hardware
and software and veterinary-specific digital radiography systems. Our strategy in the PIMS
business is to provide superior total software and hardware integrated information
solutions, backed by superior customer support and education, to allow the veterinarian to
practice better medicine and achieve the practice’s business objectives. We
differentiate our software systems through continually enhanced functionality through
regular software releases. Our veterinary-specific digital radiography systems allow
veterinarians to capture digital radiographs with ease and without the use of hazardous
chemicals. The digital radiography systems also incorporate IDEXX-PACS™ picture
archiving and communication software developed by IDEXX that allows for image enhancement,
manipulation, storage and retrieval, and integration with the practice information
software. Our strategy in digital radiography is to offer a system that provides superior
image quality and software capability at a competitive price, backed by the same customer
support provided for our other products and services in the Companion Animal Group.

Water

Our
strategy in the water testing business is to develop, manufacture, market and sell
proprietary products with superior performance, supported by exceptional customer service.
Our customers are primarily water utilities to whom strong relationships and customer
support are very important. Over the past several years, the rate of growth of this
product line has slowed as a result of increased competition and market penetration.
International sales of water-testing products represented 41% of total water product sales
in 2005, and we expect that future growth in this business will be significantly dependent
on our ability to increase international sales. Growth also will be dependent on our
ability to enhance and broaden our product line. Most water microbiological testing is
driven by regulation, and, in many countries, a test may not be used for regulatory
testing unless it has been approved by the applicable regulatory body. As a result, we
maintain an active regulatory program under which we are seeking regulatory approvals in a
number of countries, primarily in Europe.

Food
Diagnostics Group

Production
Animal Services

. We develop, manufacture, market and sell a broad range of tests for
various poultry, cattle and swine diseases and conditions, and have an active research and
development and in-licensing program in this area. Our strategy is to offer proprietary
tests with superior performance characteristics. Disease outbreaks are episodic and
unpredictable, and certain diseases that are prevalent at one time may be substantially
contained or eradicated. In response to outbreaks, testing initiatives may lead to
exceptional demand for certain products in certain periods. Conversely, successful
eradication programs may result in significantly decreased demand for certain products.
The performance of this business, therefore, can be subject to fluctuation. In 2005,
approximately 77% of our sales in this business was international. Because of the
significant dependence of this business on international sales, the performance of the
business is particularly subject to the various risks described below that are associated
with doing business internationally.

In
2004, we received USDA approval of our postmortem test for BSE (mad cow disease) and, in
February 2005, we were informed that this test was approved by the European Commission for
sale in EU member countries. While BSE testing is very limited in the U.S., a larger
market for BSE testing exists in Europe.

Dairy
Testing

. Our strategy in the dairy testing business is to develop, manufacture and sell
antibiotic residue testing products that satisfy applicable regulatory requirements for
testing of bulk milk by producers and provide reliable field performance. These testing
products use, almost exclusively, the SNAP® platform and manufacturing processes of
our rapid assay business, incorporating customized reagents for antibiotic detection.
Sales of dairy testing products have declined slightly over the last several years largely
as a result of increased competition in the domestic market. To increase sales of dairy
testing products, we look to increase penetration in geographies outside the United States
and in the farm segment of the dairy market, and to develop product line enhancements and
extensions.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING
POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

The
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based
upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial
statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of
assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related
to inventory, goodwill and other intangible assets, warranty reserves, income taxes,
contingencies, and revenue recognition. We base our estimates on historical experience and
on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the
results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets
and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may
differ from these estimates. Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for the year
ended December 31, 2005 included in this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting
policies used in preparation of these financial statements.


We
believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments
and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.

Inventory

Inventories
include material, labor and overhead, and are stated at the lower of cost (first-in,
first-out) or market. We write down inventory for estimated obsolescence when warranted by
estimates of future demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less
favorable than those we estimated, additional inventory write-downs may be required, which
would have a negative effect on results of operations. Certain major components of
inventory are discussed in more detail below.

LaserCyte

®

Hematology Analyzer

. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, our net inventories included $9.8
million and $11.9 million, respectively, of component parts and finished goods associated
with our LaserCyte

®

hematology instrument. In addition, we had firm purchase
commitments for an additional $2.6 million of component parts as of December 31, 2005. At
December 31, 2005 and 2004, $2.3 million and $1.9 million of the net LaserCyte

®

inventory, respectively, required rework before it could be used to manufacture finished
goods. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the inventory subject to rework was net of $0.7
million and $0.3 million write-downs, respectively, for inventory estimated to be
obsolete. We expect to fully realize our net investment in inventory and purchase
commitments. However, if we alter the design of this product, we may be required to write
off some or all of the remaining associated inventory.

VetTest
Chemistry

®

Slides

. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, our net inventories included $14.4
million and $22.7 million, respectively, of slides used in our VetTest

®

Chemistry
Analyzers. The decrease in slide inventory at December 31, 2005, compared to December 31,
2004, was primarily due to the delay of inventory receipts from the fourth quarter of 2005
to the first quarter of 2006. Most of the slides have a shelf-life of 24 months at the
date of manufacture. The average remaining shelf-life at December 31, 2005 was 16.4
months. In addition, we are required to purchase a minimum of $92.7 million of slides from
Ortho through December 31, 2010. During the quarter ended December 31, 2003, we entered
into a new contract with Ortho, which extended the term of the supply agreement through
2018 and left the contract minimum purchase commitments unchanged. In June 2005, we
further amended this agreement to, among other things, extend its term from 2018 to 2020.
As a result of the current and projected demand for VetTest® slides, our commitment to
develop a next-generation chemistry analyzer that will utilize these slides, and the
ratable decrease in required annual slide purchases from Ortho through 2010, we believe
that we will not incur a loss under the contract. See Note 11 to the consolidated
financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2005 included in this Form 10-K for
additional discussion of our development commitment.

Nitazoxanide

. Our
nitazoxanide product, Navigator®, for the treatment of equine protozoal
          myeloencephalitis (“EPM”) was approved by the FDA in November 2003.
At           December 31, 2005, our inventories included $9.4 million of inventory
associated           with Navigator®, consisting of $0.2 million of finished goods
and $9.2           million of active ingredient and other raw materials. In December
2004, we           entered into an amendment to our agreement with our supplier of
nitazoxanide           under which we paid the supplier $0.9 million in January 2005 and
the supplier           agreed until 2017 to replace any expiring inventory of
nitazoxanide with           longer-dated material. The payment was capitalized as
inventory cost. We believe           that this agreement has substantially mitigated the
risk that we would be           required to write down nitazoxanide inventory due to its
anticipated expiration           prior to sale.

Valuation
of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Intangible
assets, other than goodwill, are valued at fair value when acquired. If a market value is
not readily available, the fair value of the intangible asset is estimated based on
expected cash flows of the associated business acquired that are attributable to the
intangible asset. Goodwill is initially valued based on the excess of the purchase price
of a business combination over the other net assets acquired.


We
assess the impairment of identifiable intangible assets and other long-lived assets
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be
recoverable. Factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review
include, but are not limited to, the following:

•

Significant
under-performance relative to historical or projected future operating results;

•

Failure
to obtain regulatory approval of certain products;

•

Significant
changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall
business;

•

Significant
increase in the discount rate assumed to calculate the present value of future cash flow;

•

Significant
negative industry or economic trends;

•

Significant
advancements or changes in technology; and

•

Cancellation
or significant changes in contractual relationships.

We
continually assess the realizability of intangible assets other than goodwill in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 144,
“Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets” (“SFAS No.
144”). If an impairment review is triggered, we evaluate the carrying value of
long-lived assets by determining if impairment exists based on estimated undiscounted
future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the assets and comparing that value to
the carrying value of the assets. If the carrying value of the asset is greater than the
estimated future cash flows, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value. In
determining expected future cash flows, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which
cash flows are identifiable and independent of cash flows from other asset groups. The
cash flow estimates that are used contain our best estimates, using appropriate and
customary assumptions and projections at the time.

Under
SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” (“SFAS No. 142”),
we are required to perform annual tests of goodwill for impairment or additional tests
whenever events or circumstances indicate an impairment may exist. For our annual
impairment tests, we identify our reporting units, allocate assets and liabilities
(including goodwill) to the reporting units and compare the reporting units’ net book
value to their estimated fair value. The fair value of the reporting units is estimated
using a discounted cash flow approach. The cash flow estimates used contain our best
estimates, using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time. If a
reporting unit’s net book value exceeds its fair value, then the implied fair value
of goodwill is determined. If the net book value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair
value of goodwill, a goodwill impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that
excess. No impairment has been identified as a result of the annual reviews.

Warranty
Reserves

We
provide for the estimated cost of product warranties in cost of product revenue at the
time revenue is recognized. Our actual warranty obligation is affected by product failure
rates and service costs incurred in correcting a product failure. Should actual product
failure rates or service costs differ from our estimates, which are based on historical
data, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required. At December 31,
2005 and 2004, we had accrued $3.2 million and $3.7 million for estimated warranty
expense, respectively, including warranty reserves of $2.5 million and $3.3 million,
respectively, for LaserCyte® Hematology Analyzers. Warranty expense was $2.2 million,
$3.6 million and $3.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.

The
decrease in the warranty liability during 2005, compared to 2004, was due to the improved
reliability of the LaserCyte® Hematology Analyzer, partially offset by the impact of
the growing installed base of LaserCyte® Hematology Analyzers. The increase in
warranty liability during 2004 compared to 2003 was due to the impact of the growing
installed base of LaserCyte® Hematology Analyzers, partially offset by a reduction of
warranty cost resulting from our improved service experience for these instruments. We
charge warranty expense to the cost of LaserCyte® revenue at the time revenue is
recognized on the system based on the estimated cost to repair the instrument over its
warranty period. Cost of revenue reflects not only estimated warranty expense for the
systems sold in the current period, but also any changes in estimated warranty expense for
the installed base that results from our quarterly evaluation of service experience. The
reduction in estimated warranty costs per instrument resulted in a reduction of $0.3
million and $0.6 million in cost of product revenue for the years ended December 31, 2005
and 2004, respectively.


Income
Taxes

We
account for income taxes under SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.” This
statement requires that we recognize a current tax liability or asset for current taxes
payable or refundable, respectively; and a deferred tax liability or asset, as the case
may be, for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between book and tax
treatment of assets and liabilities and carryforwards to the extent they are realizable.
We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is
more likely than not to be realized. While we consider future taxable income and ongoing
prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation
allowance, in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred
tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, an adjustment to the
deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made.
Likewise, should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net
deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged
to income in the period such determination was made. Significant judgment is required in
determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and our income tax filings are
regularly under audit by tax authorities. We periodically assess our exposures related to
our worldwide provision for income taxes and believe that we have appropriately accrued
taxes for contingencies. Any reduction of these contingent liabilities or additional
assessment would increase or decrease income, respectively, in the period such
determination was made.

We
consider the operating earnings of non-United States subsidiaries to be indefinitely
invested outside the United States, the cumulative amount of which was $79.6 million at
December 31, 2005. No provision has been made for United States federal and state, or
international taxes that may result from future remittances of undistributed earnings of
non-United States subsidiaries. During 2005, we repatriated approximately $30.0 million
under the

American Jobs Creation Act of 2004

and recorded a tax provision of $1.0 million
related to this repatriation. Should we repatriate non-United States earnings in the
future, we would have to adjust the income tax provision in the period in which the
decision to repatriate earnings is made.

Estimates
for Certain Contingencies

Under
our workers’ compensation insurance policy for U.S. employees for the years ended
December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, we retain the first $250,000 in claim liability per
incident and $2.8 million, $3.0 million and $1.4 million, respectively, in aggregate claim
liability. We entered into a similar workers’ compensation insurance policy effective
January 1, 2006. We estimate claim liability based on claims incurred and the estimated
ultimate cost to settle the claims. Based on this analysis, we have recognized cumulative
expenses of $0.7 million, $0.6 million and $0.7 million for claims incurred during the
years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Under
our employee health care insurance policy, we retain claims liability risk up to $125,000
per incident and an aggregate claim limit based on the number of employees enrolled in the
plan per month, which was estimated to be $13.9 million at December 31, 2005. We estimate
our liability for the uninsured portion of employee health care obligations based on
individual and aggregate coverage, our claims experience, the number of employees enrolled
in the program, and the average time from when a claim is incurred to the time it is
reported. Should actual employee health care claims liability exceed estimates, we are
liable for up to an additional $1.7 million for potential uninsured obligations at
December 31, 2005. We have insurance coverage of $1.0 million for claims above the
aggregate limit. Should employee health insurance claims exceed this coverage, we would
have further obligations for the amount in excess of such coverage.

From
time to time, we are notified that a claim is being made against us. We evaluate each
claim based on the facts and circumstances of that claim. If warranted, we provide for our
best estimate of the cost to settle or litigate the claim and evaluate the liability
recorded quarterly.


Revenue
Recognition

We
recognize revenue when four criteria are met. These include (i) persuasive evidence that
an arrangement exists, (ii) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, (iii)
the sales price is fixed and determinable, and (iv) collectibility is reasonably assured.

•

We
recognize revenue at the time of shipment to distributors for substantially all products
sold through distributors, as title and risk of loss pass to these customers on delivery
to the common carrier. We recognize revenue for the remainder of our customers when the
product is delivered, except as noted below. Our distributors do not have the right to
return products.

•

We
recognize revenue from the sales of instruments, noncancelable software licenses and
hardware systems upon installation (and completion of training if applicable) and the
customer’s acceptance of the instrument or system because at this time we have no
significant further obligations.

•

We
recognize service revenue at the time the service is performed.

•

We
recognize revenue associated with extended maintenance agreements ratably over the life
of the contracts. Amounts collected in advance of revenue recognition are recorded as a
current or long-term liability based on the time from the balance sheet date to the
future date of revenue recognition.

•

We
recognize revenue on certain instrument systems under rental programs over the life of
the rental agreement. Amounts collected in advance of revenue recognition are recorded as
a current or long-term liability based on the time from the balance sheet date to the
future date of revenue recognition.

When
instruments are sold together with extended maintenance agreements, we allocate revenue to
the extended maintenance agreement under the Emerging Issues Task Force consensus on Issue
00-21, “Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables.”
Accordingly, the total consideration received is allocated to the elements based on their
relative fair values, which is determined by amounts charged separately for the delivered
and undelivered elements to other customers. The deferred revenue related to the extended
maintenance agreements is recognized ratably over the maintenance period. The delivered
elements are recognized as revenue when appropriate under the policies described above.
Shipping costs reimbursed by the customer are included in revenue.

We
record estimated reductions to revenue in connection with customer programs and incentive
offerings, which may give customers credits, award points, or trade-in rights. Awards
points may be applied to trade receivables owed to us and/or toward future purchase of our
products and services. We estimate these reductions based on our experience with similar
customer programs in prior years. Revenue reductions are recorded on a quarterly basis
based on issuance of credits, points actually awarded, and estimates of points to be
awarded in the future based on current revenue. For the SNAP-Up-the-Savings™ program,
estimates of future points are revised quarterly and finalized annually in the third
quarter of each year upon the issuance of points to customers. For our Practice
Developer™ volume discount program, we have reduced revenue assuming all points
granted will result in future credits because we do not have sufficient experience with
this program to estimate customer point forfeitures. During 2005, we notified customers
that, effective November 30, 2005, unused points awarded prior to January 1, 2004,
including points issued under the SNAP-Up-the-Savings™ program, would be canceled
and, that on November 30 of each subsequent year, unused points issued prior to January 1
of the prior year would also be canceled. The value of points canceled in 2005 was less
than $0.1 million.

We
may offer customers the right to trade in instruments for credit against the purchase
price of other instruments acquired in the future. For trade-in rights, we have reduced
revenue using estimates regarding the percentage of qualifying instruments that will be
traded in and the average trade-in value.

We
recognize revenue only in those situations where collection from the customer is
reasonably assured. We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses
resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. We base our
estimates on detailed analysis of specific customer situations and the percentage of our
accounts receivable by aging category. If the financial condition of our customers were to
deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional
allowances might be required.

The
following revenue analysis reflects the results of operations net of the impact of
currency exchange rates on sales outside the U.S.

Because
our instrument consumables, rapid assay products, and pharmaceutical products are sold in
the U.S. and certain other geographies by distributors, distributor purchasing dynamics
have an impact on our reported sales of these products. Distributors purchase products
from us and sell them to veterinary practices, who are the end-users. Distributor
purchasing dynamics may be affected by many factors and may be unrelated to underlying
end-user demand for our products. Fluctuations in distributors’ inventories may cause
reported results in a period not to be representative of underlying end-user demand.
Therefore, we believe it is important to track distributor sales to end-users and to
distinguish between the impact of end-user demand and the impact of distributor purchasing
dynamics on reported revenue growth.


Where
growth rates are affected by changes in end-user demand, we refer to the impact of
practice-level sales on growth. Where growth rates are affected by distributor purchasing
dynamics, we refer to the impact of changes in distributors’ inventories. If during
the comparable period of the prior year, distributors’ inventories grew by more than
those inventories grew in the current year, then changes in distributors’ inventories
have a negative impact on our reported sales in the current period. Conversely, if during
the comparable period of the prior year, distributors’ inventories grew by less than
those inventories grew in the current year, then distributors’ inventories have a
positive impact on our reported sales in the current period.

The
increase in sales of instruments and consumables was due mainly to increased sales volume.
The increased sales volume of consumables was due primarily to higher worldwide
practice-level sales of VetTest

®

slides. To a lesser extent, increased domestic sales
of consumables used with our VetLyte

®

Electrolyte Analyzers and higher practice-level
sales of tubes used with our hematology instruments also resulted in increased sales
volume of consumables. Increased VetTest

®

chemistry and hematology consumables sales
volume was due primarily to an increase in our installed base of instruments throughout
2004 and 2005. The increase in sales of VetLyte

®

consumables was due, in part, to
lower sales in the fourth quarter of 2004 due to product unavailability, which had a
favorable impact of 1% on the growth rate for instruments and consumables during 2005.
Increased instrument sales volume resulted mainly from higher sales of LaserCyte

®

Hematology Analyzers and, to a lesser extent, the launch of our VetStat™ Electrolyte
and Blood Gas Analyzer.

The
increase in sales of rapid assay products was due primarily to increased domestic
practice-level sales volume of our canine combination test, the SNAP

®

3Dx

®

Canine
Test, and to higher average unit sales prices for canine and feline products.

The
increase in sales of laboratory and consulting services resulted primarily from the
inclusion of sales from laboratories acquired in the fourth quarter of 2004 and in 2005
and, to a lesser extent, the impact of price increases and higher testing volume.
Incremental sales from laboratories acquired in the fourth quarter of 2004 and in 2005
contributed approximately 23% to laboratory and consulting services revenue growth during
2005.

The
increase in sales of practice information management and digital radiography systems
resulted from increased sales volume of digital radiography instruments. The increase in
digital radiography revenue was primarily due to an increase in the number of systems
sold, including sales attributable to a business acquired in the third quarter of 2005.
Incremental sales from this acquired business contributed approximately 7% to practice
information management and digital radiography systems revenue growth during 2005.

The
increase in sales of pharmaceutical products resulted primarily from increased
practice-level demand and, to a lesser extent, from price increases on certain products.
We expect pharmaceutical revenue for 2006, as a percentage of 2005 revenue, to grow at a
lower rate of 15% to 20%.

Water.

Revenue
for Water increased $3.7 million, or 7%, to $56.8 million from $53.1           million
for the prior year. The increase resulted primarily from higher           worldwide sales
volume, partly offset by lower average unit sales prices           attributable to both
greater price competition in certain geographies and higher           relative sales in
geographies where products are sold at lower unit prices. The           favorable impact
of currency exchange rates contributed an aggregate of $0.2           million, or less
than 1%, to the increase in Water revenue.

Food
Diagnostics Group.

Revenue for FDG increased $13.1 million, or 28%, to $60.5 million from
$47.4 million for the prior year. Incremental sales from businesses acquired during 2004
contributed approximately 11% to FDG revenue growth during the year. The following table

The
following revenue analysis reflects the results of operations net of the impact of
currency exchange rates on sales outside the U.S.

The
increase in sales of production animal products resulted primarily from higher worldwide
sales volume of livestock and, to a lesser extent, poultry diagnostics, including sales
attributable to acquisitions in 2004. Incremental sales from businesses acquired during
2004 contributed approximately 17% to production animal products revenue growth during the
period.

The
decrease in sales of dairy testing products resulted primarily from the divestiture of the
Parallux™ product line and from lower average unit sales prices attributable to greater
price competition in certain geographies and to higher relative sales in geographies where
products are sold at lower unit prices. These decreases were partially offset by higher
unit sales of SNAP

®

tests.

We
adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R),
“Share-Based Payment” and will expense share-based compensation beginning on
January 1, 2006, which will have a negative impact on our future gross profit percentages
and on operating margins for all of our segments.

Companion
Animal Group.

Gross profit for CAG increased $35.5 million, or 17%, to $250.4 million from
$214.9 million for the prior year due primarily to increased sales volume across the CAG
product lines. As a percentage of revenue, CAG gross profit was approximately constant at
48%. The gross profit percentage was positively impacted by relatively higher selling
prices, particularly for laboratory and consulting services and rapid assay products;
lower product and service costs associated with the LaserCyte

®

Hematology Analyzer and
lower product cost of slides sold for use in our VetTest

®

Chemistry Analyzers under
the agreement with our supplier; and the favorable impact of foreign currency rates on
sales denominated in those currencies, net of foreign exchange hedge contract losses. The
increases in the gross profit percentage were largely offset by higher overall net product
and service costs, apart from the favorable LaserCyte

®

and slide costs mentioned
above; greater relative sales of lower margin products and services, mainly from higher
sales growth of laboratory services; and write-downs of excess pharmaceutical product
inventory.

Water.

Gross
profit for Water increased $2.4 million, or 7%, to $38.3 million from           $35.9
million for the prior year due primarily to increased sales volume, partly
          offset by a slight decrease in the gross profit percentage to 67% from 68%. The
          gross profit percentage was unfavorably impacted by costs related to a
          manufacturing issue during the third quarter of 2005 and by lower average unit
          sales prices. These decreases in the gross profit percentage were partly offset
          by the favorable impact of foreign currency rates on sales denominated in those
          currencies, net of foreign exchange hedge contract losses.

Food
Diagnostics Group.

Gross profit for FDG increased $6.0 million, or 21%, to $34.2 million
from $28.2 million for the prior year due to increased sales volume, partly offset by a
decrease in the gross profit percentage to 57% from 60%. During the same period of the
prior year, a reduction of approximately $1.8 million in an estimated liability for a
third party claim was accounted for as a reduction in cost of revenue and increased the
2004 gross profit percentage by four percentage points. For 2005, an unfavorable impact on
the gross margin percentage of two percentage points was attributable to incremental
acquisition integration costs. The gross profit percentage was favorably impacted by
higher relative sales of higher margin livestock products and by the favorable impact of
foreign currency rates on sales denominated in those currencies, net of foreign exchange
hedge contract losses, partially offset by higher net product costs.


Operating Expenses and
Operating Income

Total
Company.

Total operating expenses increased $36.6 million to $207.6 million from $171.0
million for the prior year. As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses increased to
33% from 31% for the prior year.

Operating
income increased $7.3 million to $115.3 million from $108.0 million for the prior year. As
a percentage of revenue, operating income decreased to 18% from 20%. During 2005,
operating income was reduced by acquisition integration costs associated with businesses
acquired in the fourth quarter of 2004 and in 2005, including costs incurred in connection
with the centralization of our European production animal diagnostics operations in Bern,
Switzerland. During 2004, operating income benefited from the settlement of a third party
claim, described above, and a payment received in settlement of litigation, partly offset
by acquisition integration costs. These discrete items in both years resulted in a
reported decrease in operating income as a percentage of total company revenue of one
percentage point. The remaining difference in the operating income percentage for 2005,
compared to the prior year, was attributable, in part, to the expansion of the CAG sales,
customer service and marketing organization during 2004 and the first half of 2005;
amortization expense for intangible assets purchased in connection with businesses
acquired in the fourth quarter of 2004 and in 2005; and other changes in gross profit and
operating expenses described in this narrative.

Operating expenses for CAG increased $29.6 million, or 22%, to $167.4
million from $137.8 million for the prior year and, as a percentage of revenue, increased
to 32% from 31%. The increase was attributable to a 21% ($15.1 million) increase in sales
and marketing expense, a 25% ($10.1 million) increase in general and administrative
expense, and a 17% ($4.4 million) increase in research and development expense. The
increase in sales and marketing expense resulted primarily from the expansion of the
worldwide sales, customer service and marketing organization; ongoing expenses
attributable to the Vet Med Lab business acquired in the fourth quarter of 2004 and, to a
lesser extent, the digital radiography business acquired in the third quarter of 2005 and
higher sales commissions as a result of revenue performance. The increase in general and
administrative expense resulted primarily from expenses attributable to businesses
acquired in the fourth quarter of 2004 and in 2005, comprised of general and
administrative expenses of a recurring nature, amortization expense for intangible assets
acquired, and integration costs. To a lesser extent, the increase in general and
administrative expense was also attributable to higher spending on information technology
and other general support functions; the unfavorable impact of exchange rates on foreign
currency denominated expenses; and the positive impact in 2004 of a payment received in
the second quarter of 2004 to settle certain litigation. The increase in research and
development expense resulted primarily from increased spending related to instrument
development and, to a lesser extent, rapid assay and pharmaceutical product development.


Water.

Operating
expenses for Water increased $0.7 million, or 6%, to $12.3 million           from $11.6
million for the prior year and, as a percentage of revenue, were           approximately
constant at 22%. The dollar increase was attributable to a 13%           ($0.6 million)
increase in general and administrative expense and a 12% ($0.2           million)
increase in research and development expense, partly offset by a 2%           ($0.1
million) decrease in sales and marketing expense. The increase in general           and
administrative expense resulted primarily from higher spending on           information
technology and other corporate functions, and, to a lesser extent,           from the
unfavorable impact of exchange rates on foreign currency denominated           expenses.
The increase in research and development expense resulted primarily           from
increased spending on Cryptosporidium testing product development. There           were
no significant individual events or fluctuations in the nature and amounts           of
sales and marketing expense.

Food
Diagnostics Group.

Operating expenses for FDG increased $5.9 million, or 32%, to $24.3
million from $18.4 million for the prior year and, as a percentage of revenue, increased
to 40% from 39%. The increase resulted from a 72% ($4.0 million) increase in general and
administrative expense, a 16% ($1.3 million) increase in sales and marketing expense, and
a 13% ($0.6 million) increase in research and development expense. The increase in general
and administrative expense resulted primarily from expenses associated with the
acquisition of Bommeli in the fourth quarter of 2004 and the subsequent centralization of
our European production animal diagnostics operations in Bern, Switzerland. These costs
are composed mainly of general and administrative expenses of a recurring nature to
support the Bommeli business, costs related to the cessation of production in our
Sweden-based facility, and amortization expense for intangible assets acquired. To a
lesser extent, higher spending on information technology and other corporate functions and
the unfavorable impact of exchange rates on foreign currency denominated expenses also
contributed to the increase in general and administrative expense. The increase in sales
and marketing expense resulted primarily from the addition of Bommeli sales and marketing
activities and from sales and marketing costs to support the launch of our HerdChek

®

BSE Antigen Test Kit. The increase in research and development expense was due primarily
to the addition of Bommeli research and development activities and to higher compensation
costs, partly offset by reduced development activity following the launch of our
HerdChek

®

BSE Antigen Test Kit.

Other.

Operating
expenses, consisting primarily of corporate research and development,           increased
$0.3 million, or 10%, to $3.5 million from $3.2 million for the prior           year due
mainly to increased long-term development activities.

Interest Income

Net
interest income was $3.1 million for 2005 and 2004. The impact of higher interest rates
was substantially offset by the impact of lower average invested cash balances.

Provision for Income Taxes

Our
effective income tax rate was 34.2% for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared with
29.7% for the year ended December 31, 2004. The majority of this rate differential
resulted from the favorable impact of the resolution in 2004 of an IRS income tax audit through
the year 2001. As a result of completing this audit, we reduced previously accrued taxes. Other rate reductions
resulted from the release in 2004 of a valuation allowance on international deferred tax
assets as a result of a foreign subsidiary demonstrating consistent sustained
profitability and changes in certain state and international tax estimates. In addition,
2005 tax expense increased by $1.0 million and the 2005 effective income tax rate
increased by 0.8 percentage points due to incremental taxes on the repatriation of $30.0 million pursuant to
the

American Jobs Creation Act of 2004

.

The
following revenue analysis reflects the results of operations net of the impact of
currency exchange rates on sales outside the U.S.

The
increase in sales of instruments and consumables (an increase of $20.6 million, or 12%)
was due mainly to increased sales volume, including higher domestic practice-level sales
of VetTest

®

slides and, to a lesser extent, tubes used with our hematology
instruments, as well as higher volume outside the U.S.; the favorable impact of currency
exchange rates on sales outside the U.S.; increased instrument sales, due primarily to
increased sales of the LaserCyte

®

Hematology Analyzer; and the impact of changes in
distributors’ inventory levels. Increased consumables sales volume was due primarily
to an increase in our installed base of instruments during 2003 and 2004. Shipments to
distributors during the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 were reduced as a result of
the Company’s continuing efforts to improve efficiency in the distribution channel.
The reduced shipments during 2003 had a positive impact on sales growth in the 2004
period. The collective impact of favorable currency exchange and favorable comparisons
resulting from lower distributor purchases in 2003 caused reported growth for 2004 to be
higher than our estimates of the underlying practice-level growth of instruments and
consumables.


The
increase in sales of rapid assay products (an increase of $10.5 million, or 13%) was due
primarily to increased domestic practice-level sales volume of canine and, to a lesser
extent, feline products, as well as demand for our SNAP

®

test to screen dogs and cats
for Giardia infection, which was launched during the first quarter of 2004; the impact of
changes in distributors’ inventory levels; and the favorable impact of currency
exchange rates on sales outside the U.S. Shipments to distributors during 2003 were
reduced as a result of the Company’s efforts to improve efficiency in the
distribution channel, which contributed to a reported sales growth in the 2004 period. The
collective impact of changes in distributor inventory levels and favorable currency
exchange caused reported growth for 2004 to be higher than our estimates of the underlying
practice-level growth of rapid assay products.

The
increase in sales of laboratory and consulting services (an increase of $23.9 million, or
25%) resulted primarily from higher testing volume at established laboratories, mainly in
the U.S. and, to a lesser extent, in the United Kingdom and Australia; the inclusion of
sales from laboratories acquired in late 2003 and in 2004; and, to a lesser extent, the
favorable impact of currency exchange rates on sales at our laboratories outside the U.S.
and higher pricing.

The
increase in sales of practice information management and digital radiography systems (an
increase of $5.7 million, or 25%), resulted primarily from higher volume of complete
system sales and increased hardware sales and placements of digital radiography systems,
partly offset by lower service sales.

The
increase in sales of pharmaceutical products (an increase of $3.5 million, or 51%)
resulted in part from sales of new products launched in 2003 and 2004.

Water.

Revenue
for Water increased $6.2 million, or 13%, to $53.1 million from $46.9           million
for the same period of the prior year. The increase resulted primarily           from
higher sales volume and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of           currency
exchange rates on sales outside the U.S., partly offset by lower           average unit
prices due to price competition in certain foreign countries and           higher
relative sales in geographies where products are sold at lower unit           prices. The
favorable impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the           U.S.
contributed an aggregate of $1.9 million, or 4%, to the increase in Water
          revenue.

Food
Diagnostics Group.

Revenue for FDG increased $2.8 million, or 6%, to $47.4 million from
$44.6 million for the same period of the prior year. Businesses acquired during 2004
contributed approximately 1% to FDG revenue growth during the year. The following table

The
increase was due primarily to the favorable impact of currency exchange rates on sales
outside the U.S. and higher sales volume of production animal diagnostics. These increases
were partly offset by lower average unit prices of production animal diagnostics and
dairy-testing products, and by decreased sales volume of dairy-testing products. The
increase in production animal diagnostics sales was due to increased sales volume of
livestock products outside the U.S. The lower average unit prices were attributable to
greater price competition in certain geographies and, to a lesser extent, to higher
relative sales in geographies where products are sold at lower unit prices. The favorable
impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the U.S. contributed an aggregate of
$2.4 million, or 5%, to the increase in FDG revenue.

Animal Group.

Gross profit for CAG increased $39.3 million, or 22%, to $214.9 million from
$175.6 million in the same period of the prior year due to increased sales volume across
the CAG product lines and to an increase in the gross profit percentage. As a percentage
of CAG revenue, gross profit increased to 48% from 46% for the same period in the prior
year. The increase in gross profit percentage was attributable primarily to productivity
improvements across CAG product lines and services; the favorable impact of foreign
currency rates on sales denominated in those currencies, net of foreign exchange hedge
contract losses; and, to a lesser extent, favorable pricing from our supplier of slide
consumables compared to the same period of the prior year. The productivity improvements
were partly due to manufacturing efficiencies and reductions in service costs related to
our LaserCyte

®

Hematology Analyzer and, to a lesser extent, to fixed costs spread over
a higher revenue base. The LaserCyte

®

service cost improvements generated a favorable
change in our accruals for cost of product warranties and extended maintenance agreements
for all placed instruments for which we have such future obligations.

These
increases in gross profit percentage were partially offset by a lower gross margin
percentage recognized from laboratories acquired in 2004, including due to the purchase
accounting impact of writing off supplies and, to a lesser extent, by other laboratory
service expansion costs, including start-up costs of laboratories opened in the fourth
quarters of 2003 and 2004.

Water.

Gross
profit for Water increased $4.4 million, or 14%, to $35.9 million from           $31.5
million for the same period in the prior year, primarily due to increased
          revenue. As a percentage of Water revenue, gross profit increased to 68% from
          67% for the same period in the prior year. The increase in gross profit
          percentage was attributable primarily to the favorable impact of foreign
          currency rates on sales denominated in those currencies, net of foreign
exchange           hedge contract losses.

Food
Diagnostics Group.

Gross profit for FDG increased $5.0 million, or 22%, to $28.2 million
from $23.2 million for the same period in the prior year, primarily due to an increase in
the gross profit percentage. As a percentage of FDG revenue, gross profit increased to 60%
from 52% for the same period in the prior year. The increase in gross profit percentage
was attributable primarily to reductions in an accrual related to a third-party claim
resulting from the settlement of that claim and the favorable impact of foreign currency
rates on sales denominated in those currencies, net of foreign exchange hedge contract
losses, partly offset by unfavorable product costs. The reduction in the accrual for the
third-party claim resulted in an aggregate benefit recognized in 2004 of $1.8 million or a
four-percentage-point increase in the gross margin percentage. The unfavorable product
costs were due to fixed costs spread over lower production volume in Europe and, to a
lesser extent, the impact of expensing a portion of the purchase accounting fair market
value adjustment of inventory obtained in connection with the 2004 acquisitions.


Operating Expenses

Total
Company.

Total company operating expenses increased $21.1 million to $171.0 million from
$149.9 million for the same period of the prior year. As a percentage of revenues,
operating expenses remained relatively constant at 31%. The following tables present

Companion
Animal Group.

Operating expenses for CAG increased $17.4 million, or 14%, to $137.8
million from $120.4 million in the same period of the prior year and were approximately
constant at 31% from year to year as a percent of sales. The increase was attributable to
a 23% ($13.4 million) increase in sales and marketing expense, a 10% ($2.4 million)
increase in research and development expense, and a 4% ($1.6 million) increase in general
and administrative expense. The increase in sales and marketing expense resulted primarily
from increased sales and sales support personnel and marketing program costs; the
unfavorable impact of foreign currency denominated expenses; and, to a lesser extent,
expenses associated with the Vet Med Lab acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2004. The
increase in research and development expense resulted primarily from increased staffing
and higher spending to support instrument and pharmaceutical product development. The
increase in general and administrative expense reflects higher spending on information
technology and other corporate functions, partly due to expenses associated with
Sarbanes-Oxley Act compliance efforts; expenses associated with laboratory acquisitions in
the first and fourth quarters of 2004, including amortization of intangible assets; and
the unfavorable impact of foreign currency denominated expenses, partly offset by the
nonrecurrence in 2004 of expenses incurred in 2003 in connection with the write-down of
fixed assets of $7.4 million associated with the discontinuation of development of a
clinical chemistry instrument. In October 2003, we extended our relationship with Ortho,
the supplier of our VetTest

®

slides. We committed to develop a next-generation
clinical chemistry system based on Ortho’s dry-slide technology and discontinued
efforts to develop the alternative system.

Water.

Operating
expenses for Water increased $1.1 million, or 10%, to $11.6 million           from $10.5
million in the same period of the prior year and were approximately           constant at
22% from year to year as a percent of sales. The increase was           attributable to a
25% ($0.8 million) increase in general and administrative           expense, a 7% ($0.1
million) increase in research and development expense, and a           2% ($0.1 million)
increase in sales and marketing expense. The increase in           general and
administrative expense reflects higher spending on information           technology and
other corporate functions, partly due to expenses associated with
          Sarbanes-Oxley Act compliance efforts; the unfavorable impact of foreign
          currency denominated expenses; and the impact of a gain from a legal settlement
          in 2003 that was recorded as a reduction to general and administrative expense.
          There were no significant fluctuations in the nature and amounts of research
and           development expense or of sales and marketing expense.


Food
Diagnostics Group.

Operating expenses for FDG increased $2.8 million, or 18%, to $18.4
million from $15.6 million in the same period of the prior year and, as a percent of
sales, increased to 39% from 35% in the same period of the prior year. The increase was
attributable to a 25% ($1.1 million) increase in general and administrative expense, a 14%
($0.6 million) increase in research and development expense, a 5% ($0.3 million) increase
in sales and marketing expense, and a $0.7 million decrease in other income. The increase
in general and administrative expense resulted primarily from ongoing expenses associated
with the China joint venture formed in 2003; higher spending on information technology and
other corporate functions, partly due to expenses associated with Sarbanes-Oxley Act
compliance efforts; the unfavorable impact of foreign currency denominated expenses; and
expenses associated with the Bommeli acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2004. The
increase in research and development expense was due primarily to higher compensation
costs for additional personnel; increased spending in support of our HerdChek

®

BSE
Antigen Test Kit; and integration expenses associated with the Bommeli acquisition in the
fourth quarter of 2004. The increase in sales and marketing expense resulted primarily
from increased spending in support of our HerdChek

®

BSE Antigen Test Kit and the
unfavorable impact of foreign currency-denominated expenses, partly offset by the
nonrecurrence in 2004 of expenses incurred in 2003 in connection with the formation of the
China joint venture. The decrease in other income results from the nonrecurrence in 2004
of the reduction in an accrual related to a third-party claim recorded as other income in
2003.

Other.

Operating
expenses for 2004, consisting primarily of corporate research and           development,
decreased $0.2 million, or 6%, to $3.2 million from $3.4 million           for the same
period of the prior year.

Interest Income

Net
interest income was $3.1 million for 2004 compared with $2.9 million during 2003. The
increase in interest income was due to higher average invested cash balances partially
offset by lower effective interest rates.

Provision for Income Taxes

Our
effective income tax rate was 29.7% for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared with
31.5% for the year ended December 31, 2003. The majority of this rate reduction resulted
from the resolution in 2004 of an IRS income tax audit through the year 2001. As a result of
completing this audit, the Company reduced previously accrued taxes. Other rate reductions
resulted from the release in 2004 of a valuation allowance on international deferred tax
assets as a result of a foreign subsidiary demonstrating consistent sustained
profitability and changes in certain state and international tax estimates, partially
offset by revisions in 2003 to international tax estimates and a charge to write-down
fixed assets occurring in a high-tax jurisdiction.

RECENT ACCOUNTING
PRONOUNCEMENTS

A
discussion of recent accounting pronouncements is included in Note 2(p) to the
consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2005 included in this
Form 10-K.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL
RESOURCES

Liquidity

We
fund the capital needs of our business through cash generated from operations. At December
31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, we had $132.7 million and $137.3 million of cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments, respectively, and working capital of $192.7
million and $201.6 million, respectively. At December 31, 2004, we also had long-term
investments, primarily in municipal bonds, of $19.7 million.

We
consider the operating earnings of non-United States subsidiaries to be indefinitely
invested outside the U.S. Subject to this policy, we manage our worldwide cash
requirements considering available funds among all of our subsidiaries. While the
repatriation of foreign earnings could have adverse tax consequences, foreign cash
balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business
operations.

We
believe that current cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and funds generated
from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations, capital purchase requirements,
and strategic growth needs.


Sources
and Uses of Cash

Cash
provided by operating activities was $116.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005,
compared to $95.4 million for 2004. In 2005, cash increased $10.7 million due to changes
in operating assets and liabilities, whereas in 2004 cash decreased by $13.6 million due
to changes in operating assets and liabilities, resulting in a year-to-year change of $24.4
million. The increase in cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities, compared to 2004, was
attributable to incremental changes in cash provided by accrued liabilities of $15.6
million, accounts payable of $10.7 million, and inventories of
$6.7 million, partly offset by incremental uses of cash attributable to accounts receivable of $4.1 million
and to other assets and liabilities of $4.5 million.

The
increase in accrued expenses was due to the impact of higher income tax accruals in 2005,
compared to 2004, and the impact of higher accruals for points granted to customers under
our Practice Developer™ volume discount program in 2005, compared to 2004. The higher
income tax accruals were due in part to the rate reduction in 2004 resulting from the
resolution of an IRS income tax audit through the year 2001, which lowered the accrual in
2004 relative to 2005, and the impact of differences in the timing of expense recognition
in the financial statements compared to income tax deductibility. The incremental cash
generated from accounts payable was due primarily to the timing of payments to vendors,
including contractual purchase commitments to Ortho for VetTest

®

slides. The
incremental cash generated from inventory was due to lower inventories of VetTest

®

slides and LaserCyte

®

Hematology Analyzers, partially offset by higher VetAutoread™
instrument and consumable inventory. The decrease in the VetTest

®

slide inventory was
due to the deferral of receipts of slides from Ortho from the fourth quarter of 2005 to
the first quarter of 2006. The decrease in cash to fund accounts receivable was due to
higher sales. The $5.9 million increase in depreciation and amortization was due primarily
to acquisitions in the fourth quarter of 2004 and in 2005.

Cash
provided by investing activities was $12.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2005,
compared to cash used by investing activities of $36.8 million for 2004. The increase in
cash provided by investing activities for 2005, compared to 2004, was primarily due to the
reduction in cash used for acquisitions. In 2005, we utilized cash of $7.6 million to
acquire veterinary reference laboratories in Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and France,
a veterinary laboratory customer list in the U.S. and a digital radiography business. In
2004, we used $53.9 million to purchase veterinary reference laboratories in the U.S. and
Germany and production animal diagnostic companies in the U.S. and Switzerland. We
generated $44.3 million from net sales of short- and long-term investments for the year
ended December 31, 2005, compared to $48.9 million in 2004.

Since
1999, the Board of Directors has authorized the purchase of up to 16,000,000 shares of our
common stock in the open market or in negotiated transactions. At December 31, 2005, we
had 2,052,000 shares remaining under our share repurchase authorization. During 2005, we
repurchased approximately 1,993,000 shares of our common stock for $123.8 million at an
average price of $62.11 per share. At December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, approximately
13,948,000, 11,955,000, and 9,541,000 cumulative shares, respectively, had been
repurchased under this program. During 2004 and 2003, the Company received approximately
1,000 and 133,000 shares of stock, respectively, which were owned by the holders for
greater than six months, in payment for the exercise price of stock options. The shares of
stock had a fair market value of $0.1 million and $4.9 million, respectively. See Note 14
to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2005 included in
this Form 10-K.

Commitments

Effective
January 1, 2003, we entered into a workers’ compensation insurance policy for U.S.
employees under which we retain the first $250,000 in claim liability per incident and up
to specific limits, based on payroll, in claim liability in the aggregate. We have entered
into similar workers’ compensation policies effective January 1, 2004, and 2005. The
insurance company administers and pays these claims, and we reimburse the insurance
company for our portion of these claims. The insurance company provides insurance for
claims above the individual occurrence and aggregate limits. In connection with these
policies, we have outstanding letters of credit totaling $1.6 million to the insurance
companies as security for these claims at December 31, 2005. See Note 11 to the
consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2005 included in this
Form 10-K.

We
purchased $24.2 million in fixed assets and $2.6 million in rental instruments sold under
recourse during the year ended December 31, 2005, principally related to the CAG segment.
Our total capital budget for 2006 for fixed assets and rental instruments is approximately
$37.0 million.


We
have a 40% equity interest in a joint venture formed to assemble and market veterinary
diagnostic products for production animals in China. During the year ended December 31,
2005, we made capital contributions of $0.6 million to the joint venture. We agreed to
purchase an additional 55% equity interest in the joint venture from our partner, subject
to approval by the Chinese government of the ownership change, and committed to pay $0.8
million over two years in consideration for the additional equity. In addition, the joint
venture entered into a contract with the joint venture partner where the partner will
provide promotional and agency services and will receive sales commissions at rates escalating from
2.5% to 8.5% annually based on sales volume. See Note 17 to the consolidated financial
statements for the year ended December 31, 2005 included in this Form 10-K.

In
January 2006, we entered into an agreement to purchase the building in which our
headquarters facility is located for $18.0 million less the face value of the existing
mortgage of $6.5 million and also agreed to assume the mortgage. The closing is subject to
certain conditions to closing, including completion of our due diligence review and
receipt of certain state and local incentives. In addition, we expect to incur an
estimated additional $20 million over the next two years primarily to renovate the
unoccupied portion of the building for the purpose of expanding our research and
development, manufacturing and office space. The purchase of the headquarters facility and
subsequent renovation is in addition to the 2006 capital budget.

Under
the terms of certain supply agreements with suppliers of our veterinary instruments,
slides for our VetTest

®

Chemistry Analyzers; electrolyte instruments, components and consumables;
our VetAutoread™ Hematology Analyzers, components and consumables; and certain raw materials, we have aggregate commitments to purchase approximately $138.7
million of products through 2020. In addition, we have various minimum royalty payments
due through 2019 of $13.5 million.

We
committed up to an aggregate of $4.0 million of capital purchase obligations in connection
with the design and construction of automated production equipment at Ortho’s
facility that will be used to manufacture consumables for use in our next-generation
chemistry analyzer. We expect to pay $1.9 million of our total commitment in 2006, $1.2 million in 2007 and the
remainder in 2008.

In
October 2005, our former supplier of VetAutoread™ Hematology Analyzers and
consumables sold this business (including the human hematology testing products division)
and we simultaneously entered into a new supply agreement for veterinary products with
QBCD, the acquirer of the business. Under this new supply agreement, we received fixed
pricing on certain products through December 31, 2020. In partial consideration for this
new supply agreement, we paid cash of $2.5 million to QBCD and guaranteed QBCD’s note
in the principal amount of $3.5 million given to our former supplier in partial
consideration for the business. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for
the year ended December 31, 2005 included in this Form 10-K.

ITEM 7A.
     QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK

Our
financial market risk consists primarily of foreign currency exchange rate risk. We
operate subsidiaries in 15 foreign countries and transact business in local currencies. We
attempt to hedge the majority of our cash flow on intercompany sales to minimize foreign
currency exposure.


The
primary purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to protect against the
volatility associated with foreign currency transactions. Corporate policy prescribes the
range of allowable hedging activity. We primarily utilize forward exchange contracts with
durations of less than 18 months. Gains and losses related to qualifying hedges of foreign
currency from commitments or anticipated transactions are deferred in prepaid expenses or
accruals, as appropriate, and are included in the basis of the underlying transaction. Our
hedging strategy is consistent with prior periods. Our hedging strategy provides that we
employ the full amount of our hedges for the succeeding year at the conclusion of our
budgeting process for that year, which is complete by the end of the preceding year.
Quarterly, we enter into contracts to hedge incremental portions of anticipated foreign
currency transactions for the following twelve months. Accordingly, our risk with respect
to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may vary throughout each annual cycle. At
December 31, 2005, we had $0.6 million in net unrealized gains on foreign exchange
contracts designated as hedges recorded in other comprehensive income, which is net of
$0.3 million in taxes.

Our
currency rate exposure at December 31, 2005 consisted of local currency revenues and
expenses, the impact of hedge contracts and balances denominated in a currency other than
the Company’s or its subsidiaries’ functional currency. Based on our overall
currency rate exposure, excluding unrealized gains of $0.8 million at December 31, 2005
and unrealized losses of $4.3 million at December 31, 2004 on foreign exchange
contracts designated as hedges, a 10% strengthening of the
U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies would reduce operating income by approximately
$2.6 million for 2006 and a 10% strengthening of the U.S. dollar from December 31, 2004
would have reduced operating income for 2005 by approximately $3.3 million. A 10%
weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies at December 31, 2005 would
increase operating income by approximately $2.6 million in 2006. A 10% weakening of the
U.S. dollar from December 31, 2004 would have increased operating income by approximately
$3.3 million in 2005. As of December 31, 2005, a 10% strengthening of the U.S. dollar
relative to foreign currencies, excluding the impact of hedge contracts currently in
place, would reduce operating income by approximately $9.7 million in 2006, compared to
$9.9 million in 2005, and the effects of a 10% weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to
foreign currencies, excluding the impact of hedge contracts currently in place, would
increase operating income by approximately $9.7 million in 2006, compared to $9.9 million
in 2005.

ITEM 9A.      CONTROLS
AND PROCEDURES

Disclosure Controls and
Procedures

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and
procedures, as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission in its Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Generally, these are controls and
procedures designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed in the reports
that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and
forms. Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief
financial officer, has concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report,
our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to achieve their stated purpose.

Report of Management on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We
are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States of America. Internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America,
and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or
disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
consolidated financial statements.


Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to
future periods are subject to risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes
in conditions and that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may
deteriorate.

We
conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
based on the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway commission. Based on this
evaluation, we conclude that, as of December 31, 2005, our internal control over financial
reporting was effective.

Our
assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2005 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent
registered public accounting firm, as indicated in their report that is included herein.

Changes in Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter
ended December 31, 2005 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Certifications

The
certifications with respect to disclosure controls and procedures and internal control
over financial reporting of the Company’s chief executive officer and chief financial
officer are attached as Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT
REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and
Stockholders of IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.:

We have completed integrated audits
of IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.’s 2005 and 2004 consolidated financial statements and of
its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005 and an audit of its
2003 consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Our opinions based on our audits, are
presented below.

Consolidated financial statements and
financial statement schedule

In our opinion, the consolidated
financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. and its
subsidiaries at December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the results of their operations and their
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005 in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In
addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing
under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth
therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. These
financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the
Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits
of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Internal control over financial
reporting

Also, in our opinion,
management’s assessment, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A, that the Company maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005 based on criteria
established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated
Framework issued by the COSO. The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to
express opinions on management’s assessment and on the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted
our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An
audit of internal control over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment,
testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and
performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

F-2

A company’s internal control
over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and
(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have
a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations,
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1        NATURE OF
BUSINESS

We
develop, manufacture and distribute products and provide services for the veterinary and
the food- and water-testing markets. We operate primarily through three business segments:
products and services for the veterinary market, which is referred to as the Companion
Animal Group (“CAG”), water quality products (“Water”) and products
for production animal health and dairy quality, which is referred to as the Food
Diagnostics Group (“FDG”). Our products and services are sold worldwide. See
Note 18 for additional information regarding our reportable operating segments, products
and services, and geographical areas.

NOTE 2        SUMMARY OF
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

(a) Consolidation

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements include our accounts, our wholly-owned
subsidiaries, and all other entities in which we have a variable interest and are
determined to be the primary beneficiary. All material intercompany transactions and
balances have been eliminated in consolidation.

(b) Estimates

The
preparation of these financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make estimates and
judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses,
and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we
evaluate these estimates, including those related to customer programs and incentives,
product returns, bad debts, inventory, investments, goodwill and other intangible assets,
income taxes, warranty reserves, and contingencies. We accrue contingent liabilities when
it is probable that future expenditures will be made and such expenditures can reasonably
be estimated. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other
assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which
form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities
that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these
estimates.

(c) Inventories

Inventories
include material, labor and overhead, and are stated at the lower of cost (first-in,
first-out) or market. We write down inventory for estimated obsolescence when warranted by
estimates of future demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less
favorable than those we estimated, additional inventory write-downs may be required, which
would have a negative effect on results of operations. Certain major components of
inventory are discussed in more detail below.

LaserCyte

®

Hematology Analyzer

. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, our net inventories included $9.8
million and $11.9 million, respectively, of component parts and finished goods associated
with the LaserCyte

®

Hematology Analyzer. In addition, we have firm purchase
commitments for an additional $2.6 million of component parts at December 31, 2005. At
December 31, 2005 and 2004, $2.3 million and $1.9 million of the net LaserCyte

®

inventory, respectively, required rework before it could be used to manufacture finished
goods. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the inventory subject to rework was net of $0.7
million and $0.3 million write-downs, respectively, for inventory estimated to be
obsolete. We expect to fully realize our investment in inventory and purchase commitments.
However, if we alter the design of this product, we may be required to write off some or
all of the remaining associated inventory.

F-8

VetTest

®

Chemistry Slides

. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, our net inventories included $14.4
million and $22.7 million, respectively, of slides used in our VetTest

®

Chemistry
Analyzers. The decrease in slide inventory at December 31, 2005, compared to December 31,
2004, was primarily due to the delay of inventory receipts from the fourth quarter of 2005
to the first quarter of 2006. Most of the slides have a shelf-life of 24 months at the
date of manufacture. The average remaining shelf-life at December 31, 2005 was 16.4
months. In addition, we are required to purchase a minimum of $92.7 million of slides from
Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, Inc. (“Ortho”) through December 31, 2010. During the
quarter ended December 31, 2003, we entered into a new contract with Ortho, which extended
the term of the supply agreement through 2018 and left the contract minimum purchase
commitments unchanged. In June 2005, we further amended this agreement to, among other
things, extend its term from 2018 to 2020. As a result of the current and projected demand
for VetTest® slides, our commitment to develop a next-generation chemistry analyzer
that will utilize these slides, and the ratable decrease in required annual slide
purchases from Ortho through 2010, we believe that we will not incur a loss under the
contract. See Note 11 for additional discussion of our development commitment.

Nitazoxanide.

Our
nitazoxanide product, Navigator

®

, for the treatment of equine protozoal
          myeloencephalitis (“EPM”) was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
          Administration (“FDA”) in November 2003. At December 31, 2005, our
          inventories included $9.4 million of inventory associated with Navigator

®

,
          consisting of $0.2 million of finished goods and $9.2 million of active
          ingredient and other raw materials. In December 2004, we entered into an
          amendment to our agreement with our supplier of nitazoxanide under which we
paid           the supplier $0.9 million in January 2005 and the supplier agreed until
2017 to           replace any expiring inventory of nitazoxanide with longer-dated
material. The           payment was capitalized as inventory cost. We believe that this
agreement has           substantially mitigated the risk that we would be required to
write down           nitazoxanide inventory due to its anticipated expiration prior to
sale.

(d) Property and Equipment

We
record property and equipment at cost net of accumulated depreciation and amortization.
When an item is sold or retired, the cost and related accumulated depreciation is
relieved, and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognized in the statement of
operations. We provide for depreciation and amortization using the declining-balance and
straight-line methods by charges to operations in amounts that allocate the cost of
property and equipment over their estimated useful lives as follows:

Asset Classification

Estimated Useful Life

Leasehold improvements

Shorter of life of lease or useful life

Machinery and equipment

3-5 years

Office furniture and equipment

3-7 years

Buildings

40 years

We
recorded depreciation expense of $17.8 million, $14.7 million and $14.5 million for the
years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

(e) Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets

Intangible
assets, other than goodwill, are valued at fair value when acquired. If a market value is
not readily available, the fair value of the intangible asset is estimated based on
expected cash flows of the associated business acquired that are attributable to the
intangible asset. Goodwill is initially valued based on the excess of the purchase price
of a business combination over the other net assets acquired.

provide for amortization using the straight-line and accelerated methods by charges to
operations in amounts that allocate the intangible assets over their estimated useful
lives as follows:

Asset Classification

We
assess the impairment of identifiable intangible assets and other long-lived assets
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be
recoverable. Factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review
include, but are not limited to, the following:

•

Significant
under-performance relative to historical or projected future operating results;

•

Failures
to obtain regulatory approval of certain products;

•

Significant
changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall
business;

•

Significant
increase in the discount rate assumed to calculate the present value of future cash flow;

•

Significant
negative industry or economic trends;

•

Significant
advancements or changes in technology; and

•

Cancellation
or significant changes in contractual relationships.

We
continually assess the realizability of intangible assets other than goodwill in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 144,
“Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets” (“SFAS No.
144”). If an impairment review is triggered, we evaluate the carrying value of
long-lived assets by determining if impairment exists based on estimated undiscounted
future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the assets and comparing that value to
the carrying value of the assets. If the carrying value of the asset is greater than the
estimated future cash flows, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value. In
determining expected future cash flows, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which
cash flows are identifiable and independent of cash flows from other asset groups. The
cash flow estimates that are used contain our best estimates, using appropriate and
customary assumptions and projections at the time.

Under
SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” (“SFAS No. 142”),
we are required to perform annual tests of goodwill for impairment or additional tests
whenever events or circumstances indicate an impairment may exist. For our annual
impairment tests, we identify our reporting units, allocate assets and liabilities
(including goodwill) to the reporting units and compare the reporting units’ net book
value to their estimated fair value. The fair value of the reporting units is estimated
using a discounted cash flow approach. The cash flow estimates used contain our best
estimates, using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time. If a
reporting unit’s net book value exceeds its fair value, then the implied fair value
of goodwill is determined. If the net book value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair
value of goodwill, a goodwill impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that
excess. No impairment has been identified as a result of the annual reviews.

F-10

(f) Warranty and Extended
Maintenance Agreement Reserves

We
provide for the estimated cost of product warranties in cost of product revenue at the
time revenue is recognized. Our actual warranty obligation is affected by product failure
rates and service costs incurred in correcting a product failure. Should actual product
failure rates or service costs differ from our estimates, which are based on historical
data, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required. Following is a
summary of changes in accrued warranty reserve for products sold to customers for the
years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively

The
decrease in the warranty liability during 2005, compared to 2004, was due to the improved
reliability of the LaserCyte® Hematology Analyzer, partially offset by the impact of
the growing installed base of LaserCyte® Hematology Analyzers. We charge warranty
expense to the cost of LaserCyte® revenue at the time revenue is recognized on the
system based on the estimated cost to repair the instrument over its warranty period. Cost
of revenue reflects not only estimated warranty expense for the systems sold in the
current period, but also any changes in estimated warranty expense for the installed base
that results from our quarterly evaluation of service experience.

We
sell extended maintenance agreements covering our instruments and recognize associated
revenue over the life of the contracts. At December 31, 2004, we anticipated that $0.1
million in losses would be incurred for certain of these contracts and recognized a
provision for the estimated loss. No loss on extended maintenance agreements is
anticipated as of December 31, 2005.

(g) Income Taxes

We
account for income taxes under SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.” This
statement requires that we recognize a current tax liability or asset for current taxes
payable or refundable, respectively; and a deferred tax liability or asset, as the case
may be, for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between book and tax
treatment of assets and liabilities and carryforwards to the extent they are realizable.
We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is
more likely than not to be realized. While we consider future taxable income and ongoing
prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation
allowance, in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred
tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, an adjustment to the
deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made.
Likewise, should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net
deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged
to income in the period such determination was made. Significant judgment is required in
determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and our income tax filings are
regularly under audit by tax authorities. We periodically assess our exposures related to
our worldwide provision for income taxes and believe that we have appropriately accrued
taxes for contingencies. Any reduction of these contingent liabilities or additional
assessment would increase or decrease income, respectively, in the period such
determination was made. See Note 9 for additional information regarding income taxes.

(h) Revenue Recognition

We
recognize revenue when four criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence that an arrangement
exists, (ii) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, (iii) the sales price
is fixed and determinable, and (iv) collectibility is reasonably assured.

•

We
recognize revenue at the time of shipment to distributors for substantially all products
sold through distributors as title and risk of loss pass to these customers on delivery
to the common carrier. We recognize revenue for the remainder of our customers when the
product is delivered to the customer except as noted below. Our distributors do not have
the right to return products.

F-11

•

We
recognize revenue from the sales of instruments, noncancelable software licenses and
hardware systems upon installation (and completion of training if applicable) and the
customer’s acceptance of the instrument or system because at this time we have no
significant further obligations.

•

We
recognize service revenue at the time the service is performed.

•

We
recognize revenue associated with extended maintenance agreements over the life of the
contracts. Amounts collected in advance of revenue recognition are recorded as a current
or long-term liability based on the time from the balance sheet date to the future date
of revenue recognition.

•

We
recognize revenue on certain instrument systems under rental programs over the life of
the rental agreement. Amounts collected in advance of revenue recognition are recorded as
a current or long-term liability based on the time from the balance sheet date to the
future date of revenue recognition.

When
instruments are sold together with extended maintenance agreements, we allocate revenue to
the extended maintenance agreement under the Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”)
consensus on Issue 00-21, “Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple
Deliverables.” Accordingly, the total consideration received is allocated to the
elements based on their relative fair values, which is determined by amounts charged
separately for the delivered and undelivered elements to other customers. The deferred
revenue related to the extended maintenance agreements is recognized ratably over the
maintenance period. The delivered elements are recognized as revenue when appropriate
under the policies described above. Shipping costs reimbursed by the customer are included
in revenue.

We
record estimated reductions to revenue in connection with customer programs and incentive
offerings, which may give customers credits, award points, or trade-in rights. Awards
points may be applied to trade receivables owed to us and/or toward future purchase of our
products and services. We estimate these reductions based on our experience with similar
customer programs in prior years. Revenue reductions are recorded on a quarterly basis
based on issuance of credits, points actually awarded, and estimates of points to be
awarded in the future based on current revenue. For the SNAP-Up-the-Savings™ program,
estimates of future points are revised quarterly and finalized annually in the third
quarter of each year upon the issuance of points to customers. For our Practice
Developer™ volume discount program, we have reduced revenue assuming all points
granted will result in future credits because we do not have sufficient experience with
this program to estimate customer point forfeitures. During 2005, we notified customers
that, effective November 30, 2005, unused points awarded prior to January 1, 2004,
including points issued under the SNAP-Up-the-Savings™ program, would be canceled
and, that on November 30 of each subsequent year, unused points issued prior to January 1
of the prior year would also be canceled. The value of points canceled in 2005 was less
than $0.1 million.

We
may offer customers the right to trade in instruments for credit against the purchase
price of other instruments acquired in the future. For trade-in rights, we have reduced
revenue using estimates regarding the percentage of qualifying instruments that will be
traded in and the average trade-in value.

We
recognize revenue only in those situations where collection from the customer is
reasonably assured. We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses
resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. We base our
estimates on detailed analysis of specific customer situations and a percentage of our
accounts receivable by aging category. If the financial condition of our customers were to
deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payment, additional
allowances might be required.

(i) Research and
Development and Software Development Costs

Research
and Development costs are expensed as incurred. In accordance with SFAS No. 86,
“Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise
Marketed” (“SFAS No. 86”), we evaluate our software research and
development costs for capitalization after the technological feasibility of software and
products containing software has been established. No software development costs have been
capitalized by us because costs eligible for capitalization under SFAS No. 86 have been
insignificant. Research and development expenses consist of salaries, employee benefits,
materials and consulting costs.

F-12

(j) Advertising and
Promotion Costs

We
expense advertising costs to sales and marketing expense in the period they are incurred.

(k) Share-Based
Compensation

Prior
to January 1, 2006, we measured costs related to employee share-based compensation plans
in accordance with Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 25,
“Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees” (“APB No. 25”), and elected
to disclose the pro forma impact of accounting for share-based compensation plans under
the provisions of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” and
SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation—Transition and
Disclosure—An Amendment of FASB No. 123” (collectively, “SFAS No. 123, as
Amended”). Accordingly, no employee compensation cost has been recognized for these
plans based on SFAS No. 123, as Amended.

Had
compensation cost for our share-based compensation and employee stock purchase plans been
determined consistent with the provisions of SFAS No. 123, as Amended, our net income and
net income per common and common equivalent share would have been reduced to the following
pro forma amounts (

(l) Foreign Currency
Translation

Assets
and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries are translated using the exchange rate in
effect at the balance sheet date. Revenue and expense accounts are translated using a
weighted average of exchange rates in effect during the period. Cumulative translation
gains and losses are shown in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as a separate
component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Exchange gains and losses
arising from transactions denominated in foreign currencies other than our
subsidiary’s functional currency are included in current operations. Included in
general and administrative expenses are aggregate foreign exchange currency transaction
losses of $0.8 million, and gains of $0.4 million and $1.0 million for the years ended
December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Additionally, for the year ended December
31, 2005, a cumulative translation loss of $0.5 million was transferred from accumulated
other comprehensive income and included in general and administrative expenses as a result
of the closure of our Sweden-based operation and the associated centralization of our
European production animal diagnostics operations products manufacturing in Switzerland.

(m) Derivative
Instruments and Hedging

We
follow SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities” as amended by SFAS No. 137, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities—Deferral of the Effective Date of SFAS No. 133” and SFAS
No. 138, “Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities—An Amendment of SFAS No. 133” (“SFAS No. 133, as Amended”).
SFAS No. 133, as Amended requires that all derivatives, including forward currency
exchange contracts, be recognized on the balance sheet at fair value. Derivatives that are
not hedges must be recorded at fair value through earnings. If a derivative is a hedge,
depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative are
either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged item through earnings or
recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings.
We immediately record in earnings the extent to which a hedge is not effective in
achieving offsetting changes in fair value.

F-13

Our
subsidiaries enter into foreign currency exchange contracts of their anticipated
intercompany inventory purchases for the next twelve months in order to minimize the
impact of foreign currency fluctuations on these transactions. Our accounting policies for
these contracts are based on our designation of such instruments as hedging transactions.
We also utilize some natural hedges to mitigate our transaction and commitment exposures.
The contracts we enter into are firm foreign currency commitments, and, therefore, market
gains and losses are deferred until the contract matures, which is the period when the
related obligation is settled. We enter into these exchange contracts with large
multinational financial institutions. We do not hold or engage in transactions involving
derivative instruments for purposes other than risk management. We hedge less than the
full value of forecasted intercompany sales and thus no significant ineffectiveness has
resulted or been recorded through the statement of operations. At December 31, 2005, we
recorded $0.8 million in unrealized gains through accumulated other comprehensive income
from foreign exchange contracts with 2006 expiration dates. At December 31, 2004, we
recorded $4.3 million in unrealized losses through accumulated other comprehensive loss
from foreign exchange contracts with 2005 expiration dates. The foreign currency
contracts, which extend through December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, consisted of the
following

losses of $0.1 million, $5.2 million and $6.7 million for the years ended December 31,
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

(n)    
          Disclosure of Fair Value of Financial Instruments and Concentration of Risk

Financial
instruments consist mainly of cash and cash equivalents, investments, accounts receivable,
accounts payable and notes payable. Financial instruments that potentially subject us to
concentrations of credit risk are principally cash, cash equivalents, investments and
accounts receivable. We place our investments in highly rated financial institutions and
investment grade money market funds, municipal bonds and preferred stock. Concentration of
credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is limited to certain customers to whom we
make substantial sales. To reduce risk, we routinely assess the financial strength of our
customers and, as a consequence, believe that our accounts receivable credit risk exposure
is limited. We maintain an allowance for potential credit losses, but historically have
not experienced any significant credit losses related to an individual customer or group
of customers in any particular industry or geographic area. The carrying amounts of our
financial instruments approximate fair market value. See Note 18 for further discussion of
concentration of credit risk of accounts receivable.

We
currently purchase certain products and materials from single sources or a limited number
of sources. Some of the products that we purchase from these sources are proprietary, and,
therefore, may not be available from other sources. If we are unable to obtain adequate
quantities of these products in the future, we could face cost increases or reductions or
delays in product shipments, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations.

F-14

(o) Comprehensive Income

SFAS
No. 130, “Reporting Comprehensive Income,” requires us to report all changes in
equity during a period, resulting from net income and transactions or other events and
circumstances from non-owner sources, in a financial statement for the period in which
they are recognized. We have chosen to disclose comprehensive income, which encompasses
net income, foreign currency translation adjustments and the difference between the cost
and the fair market value of investments in debt securities and foreign exchange
contracts, in the Consolidated Statement of Stockholders’ Equity. We consider the
foreign currency cumulative translation adjustment to be permanently invested and,
therefore, have not provided income taxes on those amounts.

Accumulated
other comprehensive income (loss) consists of the following at December 31, 2005 and 2004,
respectively,

(p) Recent Accounting
Pronouncements

In
October 2004, the

American Jobs Creation Act of 2004

(the “Jobs Creation Act”)
was signed into law. The Jobs Creation Act allows for a reduced rate of United States tax
on qualifying repatriations of earnings held outside the United States in either the last
tax year that began before the enactment date or the first tax year that began during the
one-year period beginning on the date of enactment. In December 2004, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Staff Position 109-2,
“Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision
within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004” (“FSP 109-2”). FSP 109-2
allows time beyond the financial reporting period of enactment to evaluate the effect of
the Jobs Creation Act on a company’s plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign
earnings. FSP 109-2 was effective upon its issuance. Accordingly, we recognized the tax
impact of foreign earnings repatriated in December 2005 when we decided on our
repatriation plan during the fourth quarter of 2005.

In
December 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(“SFAS”) No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS No.
123(R)”), which is a revision of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation” and SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation—Transition and Disclosure—An Amendment of FASB No. 123”
(collectively, “SFAS No. 123, as Amended”) and supersedes Accounting Principles
Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees”. During 2005, the FASB also issued Staff Positions No. FAS 123(R)-1, 2,
and 3 to provide application guidance related to SFAS No. 123(R). SFAS No. 123(R)
requires all share-based compensation to employees, including grants of employee stock
options, to be valued at fair value on the date of grant, and to be expensed over the
applicable vesting period. Pro forma disclosure of the income statement effects of
share-based payments is no longer an alternative. Implementation of SFAS No. 123(R)
is required as of the beginning of the first annual period that begins after June 15,
2005. Compensation expense related to any awards that are not fully vested must also be
recognized as of the effective date. Compensation expense for the unvested awards will be
measured based on the fair value of the awards previously calculated in developing the pro
forma disclosures in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123, as Amended. We
adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R) on January 1, 2006 and do not plan to adjust
financial statements for prior periods. In 2006, we modified our share-based compensation
programs to shift from the grant of stock options only to the grant of a mix of restricted
stock and stock options. Also in connection with the adoption of SFAS 123(R), we adopted
the straight-line method to prospectively expense future share-based grants. Previously,
we utilized and we will continue to utilize the graded method to expense stock option
grants prior to January 1, 2006. We expect our 2006 share-based compensation expense, as a
percentage of net income excluding share-based compensation expense, to be slightly less
than the pro forma expense disclosed in accordance with SFAS No. 123, as Amended, above in
the financial statements for prior periods. The total compensation cost for unvested
awards granted prior to January 1, 2006, before future forfeitures, that will be
recognized in the years ending December 31, 2006 through December 31, 2010 is $16.6
million. Approximately half of this expense will be recognized in 2006 and decreasing
amounts of the total expense will be recognized over the subsequent four years, resulting
in a weighted average expense period of approximately 1.7 years. We do not expect the
adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) to have a material impact on our cash flows or financial
position.

F-15

In
March 2005, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation (“FIN”) 47, “Accounting for
Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations” (“FIN 47”). FIN 47 clarifies the
timing of liability recognition for conditional asset retirement obligations in accordance
with SFAS No. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations”. The provisions
of FIN 47 are effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after December 15,
2005. The adoption of FIN 47 did not have a material impact on our results of operations
or financial position for the year ended December 31, 2005.

In
May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, “Accounting Changes and Error
Corrections—a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3”
(“SFAS No. 154”). SFAS No. 154 replaces APB Opinion No. 20, “Accounting
Changes” and SFAS No. 3 “Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial
Statements” and changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a
change in accounting principle. SFAS No. 154 applies to all voluntary changes in
accounting principle. It also applies to changes required by an accounting pronouncement
in the unusual instance that the pronouncement does not include specific transition
provisions. When a pronouncement includes specific transition provisions, those provisions
should be followed. SFAS No. 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods’
financial statements of changes in accounting principle. The provisions of SFAS No. 154
are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. We do not expect the
adoption of SFAS No. 154 to have a material impact on our results of operations or
financial position.

In
June 2005, the FASB ratified the EITF consensus on Issue 05-6, “Determining the
Amortization Period for Leasehold Improvements Purchased After Lease Inception or Acquired
in a Business Combination” (“EITF 05-6”). EITF 05-6 requires that leasehold
improvements acquired in a business combination or placed in service significantly after
the beginning of the lease term be amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the
assets or the lease term, including renewal periods that are reasonably assured. EITF 05-6
is effective for leasehold improvements acquired in reporting periods beginning after June
29, 2005. The adoption of EITF 05-6 did not have a material impact on our results of
operations or financial position for the year ended December 31, 2005.

In
November 2005, the FASB ratified the EITF consensus on Issue 04-10, “Determining
Whether to Aggregate Operating Segments That Do Not Meet the Quantitative Thresholds”
(“EITF 04-10”). EITF 04-10 provides implementation guidance regarding the
aggregation of operating segments referenced by SFAS No. 131, “Disclosures about
Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information” (“SFAS No. 131”). EITF
04-10 concludes that operating segments that do not meet the quantitative thresholds
described by SFAS No. 131 can be aggregated only if aggregation is consistent with the
objective and basic principles of SFAS No. 131, the segments have similar economic
characteristics, and the segments share a majority of the aggregation criteria listed in
SFAS No. 131. EITF 04-10 is effective for fiscal years ending after September 15, 2005.
The adoption of EITF 04-10 did not have an impact on our determination of our reportable
operating segments and the related disclosures.

NOTE 3        BUSINESS
ACQUISITIONS

In
February 2004, we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of a veterinary
reference laboratory located in Ohio. We paid cash of $5.3 million, issued a note for $1.0
million and assumed liabilities of $0.5 million, for a total purchase price of $6.8
million. Goodwill and amortizable intangible assets of $1.9 million and $3.9 million,
respectively, were assigned to the Companion Animal Group segment.

In
August 2004, we paid cash of $1.5 million to acquire all of the shares of a production
animal diagnostics company located in New York. Amortizable intangible assets of $2.2
million were assigned to the Food Diagnostics Group segment.

In
November 2004, we acquired all of the shares of the Institut für klinische
Prüfung Ludwigsburg GmbH, which conducted business under the name Vet Med Lab
(“Vet Med Lab”). Vet Med Lab and subsidiaries comprise veterinary reference
laboratories in Germany and Switzerland, and additional customer service locations in the
Netherlands, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Austria and Denmark. We paid cash,
including acquisition costs and net of cash acquired, of $31.0 million and assumed
liabilities of $10.7 million for a total purchase price of $41.7 million. Goodwill and
amortizable intangible assets of $26.1 million and $11.2 million, respectively, were
assigned to the Companion Animal Group segment.

F-16

In
December 2004, we acquired all of the shares of Dr. Bommeli AG, a production animal
diagnostics company based in Switzerland. We paid cash, including acquisition costs and
net of cash acquired, of $15.8 million, and assumed liabilities of $3.1 million for a
total purchase price of $18.9 million. Goodwill and amortizable intangible assets of $7.4
million and $8.8 million, respectively, were assigned to the Food Diagnostics Group.

In
2005, we paid cash of $5.5 million and assumed liabilities of $0.7 million to acquire
certain assets of veterinary reference laboratories in Switzerland, the UK, Germany and
France and customer lists in the U.S. and Germany. Goodwill and other intangible assets of
$2.1 million and $2.8 million, respectively, were assigned to the Companion Animal Group
segment.

In
September 2005, we paid cash of $2.0 million and assumed liabilities of $1.3 million to
acquire the business of a Georgia-based veterinary-specific digital radiography systems
company. Intangible assets of $2.5 million were assigned to the Companion Animal Group
segment. We also agreed to make additional purchase price payments of up to $2.3 million,
contingent on the achievement by the acquired business of certain milestones.

The
final purchase price allocation of certain businesses acquired in 2005 is subject to
finalization of the valuation of certain assets and liabilities.

The
results of operations of the acquired businesses have been included with our results since
the respective acquisition dates. Pro forma information has not been presented because
such information is not material to our financial statements taken as a whole.

NOTE 4        CASH
EQUIVALENTS, SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS

Cash
equivalents are highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of less than
three months.

We
account for investments under SFAS No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in
Debt and Equity Securities” as available-for-sale. Investments are recorded at
amortized cost and adjusted to fair market value through other comprehensive income. Gains
on sales of investments were not significant for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004
and 2003. Short-term investments, which had cost bases of $65.7 million and $90.2 million
at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, are investment securities with maturities of
greater than three months, but less than one year, and consist of the following

At
December 31, 2005 and 2004, we held $65.6 million and $90.1 million, respectively, of
short-term investments, which included $44.6 million and $40.4 million, respectively, of
auction rate municipal securities classified as available-for-sale securities. Our
investments in these securities are recorded at cost, which approximates fair market value
due to their variable interest rates, which typically reset every 28 to 35 days, and,
despite the long-term nature of their stated contractual maturities, we have the ability
to quickly liquidate these securities. As a result, we had no cumulative gross unrealized
holding gains (losses) or gross realized gains (losses) from these short-term investments.
All income generated from these short-term investments was recorded as interest income.

We
include auction rate municipal bonds in short-term investments. Previously, such
investments had been classified as cash and cash equivalents. We adjusted our Consolidated
Statements of Cash Flows for the period ended December 31, 2003 to reflect the gross
purchases and sales of these securities as investing activities rather than as a component
of cash and cash equivalents. This change does not affect previously reported cash flows
from operations or from financing activities in our previously reported Consolidated
Statements of Cash Flows, or our previously reported Consolidated Statements of Operations
for any period. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2003, net cash used in investing
activities related to these current investments of $45.5 million, respectively, was
included in cash and cash equivalents in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

F-17

Long-term
investments, which had a cost basis of $19.8 million at December 31, 2004 are investment
securities with maturities of greater than one year and less than five years and consist
of municipal bonds. We held no long-term investments at December 31, 2005.

NOTE 6        IMPAIRMENT
OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

During
the fourth quarter of 2003, we entered into a new agreement with Ortho. Under this
agreement, we are developing and will introduce a next-generation chemistry analyzer for
the veterinary market based on Ortho’s dry-slide technology, and Ortho will supply us
with the slide consumables used in both the new instrument and the VetTest

®

Chemistry
Analyzer currently sold by us. As a result of this agreement, we decided to discontinue
efforts to develop an alternative chemistry system and incurred a noncash charge of $7.4
million to write down equipment purchased to manufacture the consumable used in the
alternative chemistry system, which was included in general and administrative expenses in
the consolidated statement of operations.

NOTE 7        NOTES
PAYABLE

In
connection with the acquisition of a water testing products business in August 2000, we
issued $8.5 million in notes payable to a former shareholder of Genera, of which $7.0
million was collateralized by cash in escrow. The remaining $1.5 million was unsecured and
noninterest bearing, and was discounted at 6% to a fair value of $1.3 million. In April
2002, we repaid $7.5 million, of which $7.0 million was paid from the cash held in escrow.
The remaining unsecured portion of $1.0 million was due in three annual installments,
beginning in August 2002. The note holder elected to defer the August 2002 payment of $0.5
million until April 2003. The note holder elected to defer the August 2003 payment of
$0.25 million until February 2004. The note holder elected to defer the August 2004
payment of $0.25 million until February 2005. The interest rate on the deferred notes was
3%.

In
connection with the February 2004 acquisition of a veterinary reference laboratory
described in Note 3, we issued a note payable to the sellers for $1.0 million. The note
bears interest at the prime rate. The balance outstanding at December 31, 2005 and 2004
was $0.6 million and $0.9 million, respectively. We paid $0.4 million in February 2005 and
the remaining $0.5 million, plus accrued interest, in March 2006.

In
connection with the November 2004 acquisition of Vet Med Lab described in Note 3, we
assumed a note payable to a bank of $0.6 million. The interest rate on the note was 2.9%.
The balance outstanding at December 31, 2004 was $0.6 million. We paid the note in full
during the first quarter of 2005.

NOTE 8        EXIT
ACTIVITY

During
the year ended December 31, 2005, we centralized our European production animal
diagnostics manufacturing operations in Bern, Switzerland, the location of the production
animal diagnostics company acquired in December 2004. In connection with this
centralization, we ceased operations in Sweden. We recognized expenses of $1.0 million
associated with this exit activity during the year ended December 31, 2005 and do not
expect to incur any future costs. The total costs include a cumulative translation
adjustment write-off of $0.5 million, one-time employee termination benefits of $0.2
million, and building lease termination costs of $0.1 million, which are included in
general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations. The total
costs also include one-time employee termination benefits of $0.2 million that are
included in costs of product revenue. These expenses are attributable to the Food
Diagnostics Group segment. At December 31, 2005, accrued expenses include building lease
termination costs of $0.1 million which were subsequently paid in January 2006.

Effective tax rate

34.2

31.5

%

Our
effective tax rate was 34.2% for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared with 29.7% for
the year ended December 31, 2004. The majority of this rate differential resulted from the
favorable impact of several rate reducing items occurring in 2004 (that are described
below). In addition, 2005 tax expense increased by $1.0 million and the 2005 effective
income tax rate increased by 0.8 percentage points due to incremental taxes on
repatriation of $30.0 million pursuant to the

American Jobs Creation Act of 2004

.

Our
effective rate was 29.7% for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared with 31.5% for the
year ended December 31, 2003. The reduction in the effective tax rate from 2004 compared
to 2003 primarily resulted from the resolution in 2004 of an IRS income tax audit through
the year 2001. As a result of completing this audit, we reduced previously accrued taxes.
Other rate reductions resulted from the release in 2004 of a valuation allowance on
international deferred tax assets as a result of a foreign subsidiary demonstrating
consistent sustained profitability and changes in certain state and international tax
estimates, partially offset by revisions in 2003 to international tax estimates and a
charge to write down fixed assets occurring in a high-tax jurisdiction.

F-20

The
components of the net deferred tax asset (liability) included in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets are as follows

(in thousands)

:

At
December 31, 2005, we had United States federal domestic net operating loss carryforwards
of approximately $0.2 million available to offset future taxable income. Net operating
loss carryforwards expire at various dates through 2014. The Tax Reform Act of 1986
contains provisions that limit annual availability of the net operating loss carryforwards
due to a more than 50% change in ownership that occurred upon the acquisition of some
companies.

At
December 31, 2005, we had net operating loss carryforwards in foreign and state
jurisdictions of approximately $62.6 million available to offset future taxable income.
Most of these net operating loss carryforwards expire at various dates through 2022 and
the remainder have indefinite lives. We have recorded a valuation allowance for these
assets because realizability is uncertain.

We
consider the operating earnings of non-United States subsidiaries to be indefinitely
invested outside the United States. No provision has been made for United States federal
and state, or international taxes that may result from future remittances of undistributed
earnings of non-United States subsidiaries, the cumulative amount of which is $79.6
million at December 31, 2005. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we repatriated
approximately $30.0 million under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Should we
repatriate non-United States earnings in the future, we would have to adjust the income
tax provision in the period in which the decision to repatriate earnings is made.

NOTE 10  EARNINGS PER
SHARE

Basic
earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of
shares of common stock and deferred stock units outstanding during the year. The
computation of diluted earnings per share is similar to the computation of basic earnings
per share, except that the denominator is increased for the assumed exercise of dilutive
options and other potentially dilutive securities using the treasury stock method unless
the effect is anti-dilutive.

F-21

The
following is a reconciliation of shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per
share

(in thousands)

:

Deferred
stock units outstanding are included in shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings
per share because the associated shares of our common stock are issuable for no cash
consideration, the number of shares of our common stock to be issued is fixed and issuance
is not contingent. See Note 15 for additional information regarding deferred compensation
plans.

In
connection with our acquisition of the capital stock of Blue Ridge Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
(“Blue Ridge”) in 1998, we issued warrants to acquire 806,000 shares of common
stock at $31.59 per share that expired on September 30, 2003. As of December 31, 2003, all
of the warrants were exercised or had expired.

Certain
options to acquire shares have been excluded from the calculation of shares
outstanding for dilutive earnings per share because they were anti-dilutive. Information

Under
the terms of certain supply agreements with suppliers of our veterinary instruments,
slides for our VetTest

®

Chemistry Analyzers; electrolyte instruments, components and consumables;
our VetAutoread™ Hematology Analyzers, components and consumables; and certain raw materials, we have aggregate commitments to purchase approximately $138.7
million of products through 2020. In addition, we have various minimum royalty payments
due through 2019 of $13.5 million.

We
committed up to an aggregate of $4.0 million of capital purchase obligations in connection
with the design and construction of automated production equipment at Ortho’s
facility that will be used to manufacture consumables for use in our next-generation
chemistry analyzer. We expect to pay $1.9 million of our total commitment in 2006, $1.2 million in 2007 and the
remainder in 2008.

In
January 2006, we entered into an agreement to purchase the building in which our
headquarters facility is located for $18.0 million less the face value of the mortgage in
cash and also agreed to assume the mortgage. We believe the face value of the mortgage
will be approximately $6.5 million (unaudited) on the closing date with a fair market
value of $7.6 million (unaudited). The closing is subject to certain conditions to
closing, including completion of our due diligence review and receipt of certain state and
local incentives.

We
have a 40% equity interest in a joint venture formed to assemble and market veterinary
diagnostic products for production animals in China. During the year ended December 31,
2005, we made capital contributions of $0.6 million to the joint venture. We agreed to
purchase an additional 55% equity interest in the joint venture from our partner, subject
to approval by the Chinese government of the ownership change, and committed to pay $0.8
million over two years in consideration for the additional equity. In addition, the joint
venture entered into a contract with the joint venture partner where the partner will
provide promotional and agency services and will receive sales commissions at rates escalating from
2.5% to 8.5% annually based on sales volume. See Note 17 for additional information
regarding the joint venture.

Contingencies

We
are subject to claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, including with
respect to actual and threatened litigation and other matters. We accrue contingent
liabilities when it is probable that future expenditures will be made and such
expenditures can reasonably be estimated. However, our actual losses with respect to these
contingencies could exceed our accruals.

In
October 2004, we resolved a contingent liability for a third-party claim related to
alleged patent infringement. As a result, we recognized reductions of previously accrued
expenses during 2004 of $1.8 million in cost of product revenue.

F-23

Under
our workers’ compensation insurance policy for U.S. employees for the years ended
December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, we retain the first $250,000 in claim liability per
incident and $2.8 million, $3.0 million and $1.4 million, respectively, in aggregate claim
liability. We entered into a similar workers’ compensation insurance policy effective
January 1, 2006. We estimate claim liability based on claims incurred and the estimated
ultimate cost to settle the claims. Based on this analysis, we have recognized cumulative
expenses of $0.7 million, $0.6 million and $0.7 million for claims incurred during the
years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In connection with these
policies, we have outstanding letters of credit totaling $1.6 million to the insurance
companies as security for these claims at December 31, 2005. In 2006, we agreed to
increase an existing letter of credit by $0.6 million for the 2006 policy year and we
reduced another letter of credit for the policy years 2003 and 2004 by $0.6 million.

Under
our employee health care insurance policy, we retain claims liability risk up to $125,000
per incident and an aggregate claim limit based on the number of employees enrolled in the
plan per month, which was estimated to be $13.9 million at December 31, 2005. We estimate
our liability for the uninsured portion of employee health care obligations based on
individual and aggregate coverage, our claims experience, the number of employees enrolled
in the program, and the average time from when a claim is incurred to the time it is
reported. Should actual employee health care claims liability exceed estimates, we are
liable for up to an additional $1.7 million for potential uninsured obligations at
December 31, 2005. We have insurance coverage of $1.0 million for claims above the
aggregate limit. Should employee health insurance claims exceed this coverage, we would
have further obligations for the amount in excess of such coverage.

We
have entered into employment agreements with two of our officers whereby payments may be
required if we terminate their employment without cause. The amounts payable are based
upon the executives’ salaries at the time of termination and the cost to us of
continuing to provide certain benefits. Had both of such officers been terminated as of
December 31, 2005, we would have had aggregate obligations for salaries and benefits of
approximately $1.9 million under such agreements. We have entered into employment
agreements with each of our officers that require us to make certain payments in the event
the officer’s employment is terminated under certain circumstances within a certain
period following a change in control of our stock. The amounts payable by us under these
agreements is based on the officer’s salary and bonus history at the time of
termination and the cost us of continuing to provide certain benefits. Had all of our
officers been terminated following a change in control as of December 31, 2005, we would
have had aggregate obligations of approximately $10.1 million under these agreements.
These agreements also provide for the acceleration of the vesting of all stock options
held by two of the officers immediately upon a change in control, and of all stock options
held by our other executive officers upon any qualifying termination following a change in
control. We also have employment agreements with other employees through 2009 that provide
for total payments of $1.0 million.

We
currently purchase many products and materials from single sources or a limited number of
sources. Some of the products that we purchase from these sources are proprietary, and,
therefore, cannot be readily replaced by alternative sources. These products include our
VetTest

®

Chemistry, VetAutoread™ Hematology, VetLyte

®

Electrolyte, and
VetStat™ Electrolyte and Blood Gas Analyzers and related consumables; certain digital
radiography system components, specifically image capture plates and readers; active
ingredients for pharmaceutical products; and certain components of our SNAP

®

rapid
assay devices, water testing products and LaserCyte

®

Hematology Analyzers. If we are
unable to obtain adequate quantities of these products in the future, we could face cost
increases or reductions or delays in product shipments, which could have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations.

From
time to time, we have received notices alleging that our products infringe third-party
proprietary rights, although we are not aware of any pending litigation with respect to
such claims. Patent litigation frequently is complex and expensive, and the outcome of
patent litigation can be difficult to predict. There can be no assurance that we will
prevail in any infringement proceedings that may be commenced against us. If we lose any
such litigation, we may be stopped from selling certain products and/or we may be required
to pay damages as a result of the litigation.

In
connection with a business acquisition in September 2005, we have a contingent obligation
of up to $2.3 million for additional purchase price payments to sellers, contingent on the
achievement by the acquired business of certain milestones. See Note 3 for additional
information regarding business acquisitions.

F-24

Guarantees

The
following is a summary of our agreements and obligations that we have determined to be
within the scope of FIN 45, “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements
for Guarantees Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others, an Interpretation
of FASB No. 5, 57 and 107 and a Rescission of FASB Interpretation No. 34” (“FIN
45”).

Our
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that we will indemnify our
officers and directors to the maximum extent permitted by Delaware law. The maximum
payment that we may be required to make under such provisions is theoretically unlimited
and is impossible to determine. We maintain directors’ and officers’ liability
insurance, which may provide reimbursement to us for payments made to, or on behalf of,
officers and directors pursuant to the indemnification provisions. Our indemnification
obligations are not within the scope of the provisions of FIN 45. Accordingly, we have
recorded no liability for such obligations as of December 31, 2005 and 2004.

In
October 2005, our former supplier of VetAutoread™ Hematology Analyzers and
consumables sold this business (including the human hematology testing products division)
and we simultaneously entered into a new supply agreement for veterinary products with the
acquirer of the business. Under this new supply agreement, we received fixed pricing on
certain products through December 31, 2020, among other benefits. In partial consideration
for this new supply agreement, we paid cash of $2.5 million to the acquirer and guaranteed
the acquirer’s note (the “Note”) in the principal amount of $3.5 million
given to our former supplier in partial consideration for the business. The acquirer is
obligated to pay the Note through quarterly principal and interest payments through 2008.
We are obligated to make a second payment of $1.25 million upon the achievement of certain
milestones by the acquirer, which we expect to occur in approximately 2008, and a third
payment of $1.25 million twelve months later. Our obligations to make the second and third
payments are subject to the acquirer’s payment of all amounts under the Note and the
release of our guaranty. We recorded the fair value of the guaranty of $0.5 million and
recognized the associated assets and liabilities as of the effective date of the
agreements.

We
enter into agreements with third parties in the ordinary course of business under which we
are obligated to indemnify such third parties for and against various risks and losses.
The precise terms of such indemnities vary with the nature of the agreement. In many
cases, we limit the maximum amount of our indemnification obligations, but in some cases,
those obligations may be theoretically unlimited. We have not incurred material expenses
in discharging any of these indemnification obligations, and based on our analysis of the
nature of the risks involved, we believe that the fair value of these agreements is
minimal. Accordingly, we have recorded no liabilities for these obligations as of December
31, 2005 and 2004.

When
acquiring a business, we sometimes assume liability for certain events or occurrences that
took place prior to the date of acquisition. However, we do not believe we have any probable
pre-acquisition liabilities or guarantees that should be recognized as of December 31, 2005 and 2004.

NOTE 12
      STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY

(a) Preferred Stock

Our
Board of Directors is authorized, subject to any limitations prescribed by law, without
further stockholder approval, to issue from time to time up to 500,000 shares of Preferred
Stock, $1.00 par value per share (“Preferred Stock”), in one or more series.
Each such series of Preferred Stock shall have such number of shares, designations,
preferences, voting powers, qualifications and special or relative rights or privileges as
shall be determined by the Board of Directors, which may include, among others, dividend
rights, voting rights, redemption and sinking fund provisions, liquidation preferences,
conversion rights and preemptive rights.

F-25

(b) Series A Junior
Participating Preferred Stock

On
December 17, 1996, we designated 100,000 shares of Preferred Stock as Series A Junior
Participating Preferred Stock (“Series A Stock”) in connection with our
Shareholder Rights Plan. In general, each share of Series A Stock will: (i) be entitled to
a minimum preferential quarterly dividend of $10 per share and to an aggregate dividend of
1,000 times the dividend declared per share of Common Stock, (ii) in the event of
liquidation, be entitled to a minimum preferential liquidation payment of $1,000 per share
(plus accrued and unpaid dividends) and to an aggregate payment of 1,000 times the payment
made per share of Common Stock, (iii) have 1,000 votes, voting together with the Common
Stock, (iv) in the event of any merger, consolidation or other transaction in which Common
Stock is exchanged, be entitled to receive 1,000 times the amount received per share of
Common Stock and (v) not be redeemable. These rights are protected by customary
anti-dilution provisions. There are no shares of Series A Stock outstanding. See Note 13
for additional information regarding preferred stock purchase rights.

NOTE 13       PREFERRED
STOCK PURCHASE RIGHTS

On
December 17, 1996, we adopted a Shareholder Rights Plan and declared a dividend of one
preferred stock purchase right for each outstanding share of Common Stock to stockholders
of record at the close of business on December 30, 1996. Under certain conditions, each
right may be exercised to purchase one one-thousandth of a share of Series A Stock at a
purchase price of $200.00. The rights will be exercisable only if a person or group has
acquired beneficial ownership of 25% or more of the Common Stock or commenced a tender or
exchange offer that would result in such a person or group owning 30% or more of the
Common Stock. We generally will be entitled to redeem the rights, in whole, but not in
part, at a price of $.01 per right at any time until the tenth business day following a
public announcement that a 25% stock position has been acquired and in certain other
circumstances.

If
any person or group becomes a beneficial owner of 25% or more of the Common Stock (except
pursuant to a tender or exchange offer for all shares at a fair price as determined by the
outside members of our Board of Directors), each right not owned by a 25% stockholder will
enable its holder to purchase such number of shares of Common Stock as is equal to the
exercise price of the right divided by one-half of the current market price of the Common
Stock on the date of the occurrence of the event. In addition, if we thereafter are
acquired in a merger or other business combination with another person or group in which
we are not the surviving corporation or in connection with which our Common Stock is
changed or converted, or if we sell or transfer 50% or more of our assets or earning power
to another person, each right that has not previously been exercised will entitle its
holder to purchase such number of shares of common stock of such other person as is equal
to the exercise price of the right divided by one-half of the current market price of such
common stock on the date of the occurrence of the event.

NOTE 14       TREASURY
STOCK

Our
Board of Directors has approved the repurchase of up to 16,000,000 shares of our common
stock in the open market or in negotiated transactions. During the years ended December
31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, we repurchased approximately 1,993,000, 2,413,000 and 927,000
shares, respectively, of common stock for $123.8 million, $128.8 million and $36.2
million, respectively. Additionally, during 2004 and 2003, we received approximately 1,000 and 133,000 shares of stock,
respectively, which were owned by the holder for greater than six months, in payment for
the exercise price of stock options. The shares of stock had a fair market value of $0.1
million and $4.9 million, respectively. From the inception of the stock repurchase program in August 1999
to December 31, 2005, we repurchased 13,948,000 shares for $466.1 million and received 170,000 shares
of stock with a market value of $6.0 million in payment for the exercise price of stock options.

NOTE 15       SHARE-BASED
COMPENSATION PLANS

Our
share-based compensation plans are described below. These plans, and any amendments
increasing the number of shares issuable thereunder, were approved by our
stockholders.

Stock Incentive Plan

During
2003, our Board of Directors approved the 2003 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended (the
“2003 Stock Plan”) pursuant to which our employees and Directors may receive
various types of share-based incentives, including stock options, restricted stock, stock
appreciation rights and deferred stock units. A total of 1,850,000 shares of common stock
are authorized for issuance under the 2003 Stock Plan, as amended, provided that no more
than 1,500,000 shares will be available for the grant of incentive stock options, and no
more than 600,000 shares will be available for awards other than stock options and stock
appreciation rights (such as restricted stock). In addition, if any options granted under
our prior plans, including the 1991 Stock Plan, the 1998 Stock Plan or the 2000 Director
Plan, terminate, expire or are forfeited without having been exercised in full, the shares
subject to such unexercised options are available for issuance under the 2003 Stock Plan.
Options granted under the 2003 Stock Plan and prior plans may not be granted at an
exercise price less than the fair market value of the common stock on the date granted (or
less than 110% of the fair market value in the case of incentive stock options granted to
holders of more than 10% of our Common Stock). Options may not be granted for a term of
more than ten years. The vesting schedule of all options granted under the 2003 Stock Plan
is determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors at the time of
grant.

F-26

Deferred Compensation
Plans

Under
our Director Deferred Compensation Plan, non-employee Directors may defer a portion of
their cash fees in the form of vested Deferred Stock Units, each of which represents the
right to receive one unissued share of our common stock. Directors receive a number of
Deferred Stock Units equal to the amount of cash fees deferred divided by the closing sale
price of the common stock on the date of deferral. In addition, beginning in 2006, we will
grant $75,000 of Deferred Stock Units to Directors annually in lieu of granting stock
options under the 2003 Stock Plan (“Vesting Deferred Stock Units”). Vesting Deferred Stock Units vest one year from the date
of grant. Except upon a change in control, as defined in the Director Deferred
Compensation Plan, or certain limited circumstances, all Deferred Stock Units will be
exchanged for an equivalent number of shares of common stock by us one year following a
Director’s resignation or retirement. The value of Deferred Stock Units is
expensed as compensation when earned.

Under our
Executive Deferred Compensation Plan (the
“Executive Plan”), certain members of our management may elect to
defer a portion of their cash compensation in Deferred Stock Units. These Deferred Stock Units will be exchanged for a
fixed number of shares of common stock on dates determined by the employee, subject to the
limitations of the Executive Plan and applicable law. Except upon a change in control, as
defined in the Executive Plan, or certain other limited circumstances, officers may not
receive shares of common stock in settlement of Deferred Stock Units earlier than one year
following the termination of their employment.

Deferred Stock Units are presented in
the stockholders’ equity section of the balance sheet as deferred share-based
compensation. During the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, approximately
11,300, 10,400 and 3,300 Deferred Stock Units, respectively, valued at $0.7 million, $0.5
million and $0.1 million, respectively, were issued.

Employee Stock Purchase
Plans

During
1997, the Board of Directors approved the 1997 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, under which
we reserved and may issue up to an aggregate of 620,000 shares of Common Stock in periodic
offerings. Also during 1997, the Board of Directors approved the 1997 International
Employee Stock Purchase Plan, under which we reserved and could issue up to an aggregate
of 30,000 shares of Common Stock in semiannual offerings. The 1997 International Employee
Stock Purchase Plan was terminated in February 2005, and there were no shares remaining
thereunder at the time of termination. Prior to July 1, 2005, stock was sold under each of
these plans at 85% of its fair market value, as defined in the plans as the lower of the
closing price of our common stock at the beginning of the period and the closing price of
our common stock at the end of the period. Effective July 1, 2005, we amended the 1997
Employee Stock Purchase Plan to provide that stock is sold at 85% of the closing price of
the stock on the last day of the period. Therefore, the fair value of the purchase rights
under the program equals the discount from the market price at the exercise date. Shares
subscribed to and issued under the plans during the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004
and 2003 were 39,000, 44,000 and 50,000, respectively.

and the 2003 Stock Plan will vest and become exercisable.

Fair Value of Share-Based
Compensation

As
discussed in Note 2(k), we account for share-based compensation to employees in accordance
with APB No. 25, and elect to disclose the pro forma impact of accounting for share-based
compensation plans under the provisions of SFAS No. 123 and SFAS No. 148. Accordingly, no
SFAS No. 123-based employee compensation cost has been recognized for these plans.

F-28

In
order to determine the pro forma impact under SFAS No. 123, as Amended, the fair value of
each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing
model with the following weighted average assumptions:

Effective
July 1, 2005, we amended our employee stock purchase plan to eliminate the look-back
option feature. Therefore, the fair value of the purchase rights under the program equals
the discount from the market price at the exercise date. For periods ending prior to July
1, 2005, in order to determine the pro forma impact under SFAS No. 123, as Amended, the
fair value of the purchase rights issued under the employee stock purchase plans is
estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the

NOTE 16       IDEXX
RETIREMENT AND INCENTIVE SAVINGS PLAN

We
have established the IDEXX Retirement and Incentive Savings Plan (the “401(k)
Plan”). Employees eligible to participate in the 401(k) Plan may contribute specified
percentages of their salaries, a portion of which will be matched by us. We matched $2.4
million, $2.0 million, and $1.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and
2003, respectively. In addition, we may make contributions to the 401(k) Plan at the
discretion of the Board of Directors. There were no discretionary contributions in 2005,
2004 and 2003.

NOTE 17       JOINT
VENTURE

On
June 18, 2003, we formed a joint venture, Beijing IDEXX-Yuanheng Laboratories Co. Limited (the “Venture”),
with Beijing Anheal Laboratories Company Ltd. (“Anheal”), formerly known as Beijing Fortunate Century Animal Health Co.,
Ltd., to assemble and market veterinary diagnostic products for production
animals in China. The Venture is headquartered in Beijing, China. Our initial equity
interest in the Venture is 40%, however, we are committed to acquire an additional 20% of
the Venture from Anheal within two years of the formation of the joint venture, subject to
Chinese government approval. We bear an economic risk that is greater than our equity
interest and also have the ability to make decisions that significantly affect the results
of the activities of the Venture through majority board representation. Therefore, the
Venture is consolidated into our financial statements in accordance with FIN 46(R), “Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities - an interpretation of ARB No. 51.” We
contributed $1.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2003, and $0.6 million during
the year ended December 31, 2005. In addition, we are obligated to pay $0.6 million for
the additional 20% interest discussed above and to make an additional $1.5 million
capital contribution to the Venture within three months after the approval by the Chinese
government of the additional 20% interest. However, as discussed in Note 11, we modified the joint venture agreement and agreed to acquire
55% of the Venture from Anheal, subject to Chinese government approval, where upon the commitments above will become void.

F-29

We
are also obligated to make available to the Venture selected technology, know-how and
licenses and to assist with certain logistical, management training and operating matters.
In connection with the joint venture agreement, we have not entered into indemnification
agreements or assumed liabilities predating the establishment of the Venture.

NOTE 18       SEGMENT
REPORTING

We
disclose information regarding its segments in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No.
131, “Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information”
(“SFAS No. 131”). SFAS No. 131 requires disclosures about operating segments in
annual financial statements and requires selected information about operating segments in
interim financial statements. It also requires related disclosures about products and
services and geographic areas. Operating segments are defined as components of an
enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated
regularly by the chief operating decision-maker, or decision-making group, in deciding how
to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Our chief operating decision-maker is
the Chief Executive Officer.

We
are organized into business units by market and customer group. Our reportable operating
segments include the Companion Animal Group (“CAG”), the Water testing business
(“Water”) and the Food Diagnostics Group (“FDG”) and other. CAG
develops, designs, manufactures, and distributes products and performs services for
veterinarians. Water develops, designs, manufactures and distributes products to detect
contaminants in water. FDG develops, designs, manufactures and distributes products to
detect disease and contaminants in food animals and food. Other encompasses activities
that are not included in our reportable segments and is primarily comprised of corporate
research and development and interest income. Assets categorized as other include cash,
short-term investments, long-term investments, deferred tax assets and other miscellaneous
current and long-term assets.

F-30

The
accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in the
summary of significant accounting policies except that most interest income and expense
are not allocated to individual operating segments and income taxes are provided
(benefited) on each segment using the overall effective rate. Below is our segment
information

Expenditures for property for the year ended December 31, 2005 include $0.6
          million for property acquired in connection with CAG business acquisitions.
          Expenditures for property for the year ended December 31, 2004 include $2.1
          million and $0.7 million for property acquired in connection with CAG and FDG
          business acquisitions, respectively.

Revenue
by principal geographic area, based on customers’ domiciles, was as follows

(in
thousands)

:

In
2005, two of our CAG distributors, The Butler Company and Burns Veterinary Supply, Inc.,
merged and, as a result, they collectively accounted for 10% of our 2005 revenue and 4% of
our net accounts receivable at December 31, 2005. In 2004 and 2003, no customer accounted
for greater than 10% of our revenue. Our largest customers are our U.S. distributors of
our products in the CAG segment. The largest consumer of our products and services
accounts for approximately 1% of our sales.

F-32

Net
long-lived assets by principal geographic areas include net property and equipment,
goodwill and other intangible assets. These long-lived assets are subject to geographic
risks because they are generally difficult to move and effectively utilize in another
geographic area in a reasonable time period and because they are relatively illiquid. Net
long-lived assets by principal geographic areas were as follows
