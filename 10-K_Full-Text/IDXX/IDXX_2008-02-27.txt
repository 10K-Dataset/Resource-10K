RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

On October 25, 2007, our board of directors approved a two-for-one split of the outstanding
shares of our common stock, to be effected in the form of a 100% stock dividend. Each holder of
common stock of record as of November 5, 2007 received one additional share of common stock. The
additional shares of common stock were distributed on November 26, 2007. All share and per share
data (except par value) in this Form 10-K have been adjusted to reflect the effect of the stock
split for all periods presented.

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

During 2007, we operated primarily through three business segments: products and services for
the veterinary market, which we refer to as our Companion Animal Group (“CAG”), water quality
products (“Water”) and products for production animal health, which we refer to as the Production
Animal Segment (“PAS”). We also operate two smaller segments that comprise products for dairy
quality, which we refer to as Dairy, and products for the human medical diagnostic market, which we
refer to as OPTI Medical. Financial information about the Dairy and OPTI Medical operating segments
are combined and presented in an “Other” category because they do not meet the quantitative or
qualitative thresholds for reportable segments. We added the OPTI Medical operating segment in
connection with our acquisition of substantially all of the assets and assumption of certain
liabilities of the Critical Care Division of Osmetech plc in January 2007. See Note 17 to the
consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2007 included in this Annual
Report on Form 10-K for financial information about our segments, including geographic information,
and about our product and service categories.

COMPANION ANIMAL GROUP

Instruments and Consumables

We currently market an integrated and highly flexible suite of in-house laboratory analyzers
for use in veterinary practices that we refer to as the IDEXX VetLab

®

suite of
analyzers. The IDEXX VetLab

®

Suite includes several instrument systems, as well as
associated proprietary consumable products that are described below:

Blood and Urine Chemistry

. Our VetTest

®

Chemistry Analyzer is used to
measure levels of certain enzymes and other substances in blood or urine in order to assist the
veterinarian in diagnosing physiologic conditions. Twenty-six separate tests can be performed on
the VetTest

®

Chemistry Analyzer and additional parameters can be calculated. Blood tests
commonly run include glucose, alkaline phosphatase, ALT (alanine aminotransferase), creatinine,
blood urea nitrogen (“BUN”) and total protein. The VetTest

®

Chemistry Analyzer also runs
tests for urine protein/urine creatinine ratio, which assists in the detection of early renal
disease. Tests are sold individually and in prepackaged panels, such as the Preanesthetic Panel,
the General Health Profile, the Equine Health Panel, the Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug
(“NSAID”) Monitoring Panel, the Avian Health Profile, the Quality Control Panel and the Diagnostic
Health Profile.

Our VetLyte

®

Analyzer measures three electrolytes—sodium, potassium and chloride—to
aid in evaluating acid-base and electrolyte balances and assessing plasma hydration.

Our VetStat

®

Analyzer measures electrolytes, blood gases, glucose and ionized
calcium, and calculates other parameters, such as bicarbonate and anion gap. These measurements aid
veterinarians in evaluating fluid therapy choices and measuring respiratory function. The
VetStat

®

Electrolyte and Blood Gas Analyzer runs single-use disposable cassettes that
contain various configurations of analytes.

We purchase all of the reagents used in the VetTest

®

Chemistry Analyzer (“dry
chemistry slides” or “VetTest

®

slides”) from Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, Inc. (“Ortho”),
a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson. See the section below within Item I, “Production and Supply.” In
October 2003, we entered into an agreement with Ortho under which we are developing a
next-generation chemistry analyzer for the veterinary market, named Catalyst Dx™, which is based
primarily on Ortho’s dry-slide technology. Ortho will provide slide consumables used in both the
VetTest

®

Chemistry Analyzer and the new analyzer, Catalyst Dx™, through 2025. Catalyst
Dx™ will provide significantly improved throughput, ease of use and menu, including the ability to
run electrolytes. We expect Catalyst Dx™ to be commercially available in early 2008 and we will be
manufacturing this instrument. We also expect to be selling and supporting VetTest

®

for
the foreseeable future.



Chemistry reagent sales for use in our installed base of chemistry analyzers provide the
majority of consumables volumes and revenues generated from our installed base of IDEXX
VetLab

®

equipment.

Hematology

. We sell two hematology analyzers: the LaserCyte

®

Hematology
Analyzer, which uses laser-flow cytometry technology to analyze components of blood, including red
blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets; and the VetAutoread™ Hematology Analyzer.

Quantitative Immunoassay Testing

. The IDEXX SNAP

®

Reader allows the
veterinarian to obtain quantitative measurements of total thyroxine (“T


”), cortisol and
bile acids, which assist in the evaluation of thyroid, adrenal and liver function.

We have under development and plan to launch a new quantitative immunoassay platform called
SNAPshot Dx™

in early 2008. This product will replace the IDEXX SNAP

®

Reader.
SNAPshot Dx™ is designed to significantly improve ease of use, throughput and menu. We will
manufacture this instrument and its consumables internally.

Blood Coagulation

. In late 2007 we introduced the Coag Dx™ Analyzer, which permits
the detection and diagnosis of blood clotting disorders.

Urinalysis

. Our IDEXX VetLab

®

UA™ Urinalysis Analyzer provides rapid,
semi-quantitative urinalysis and is validated specifically for veterinary use.

IDEXX VetLab

®

Station

. We sell IDEXX VetLab

®

Station (“IVLS”)
as an integral component of the LaserCyte system (and Catalyst Dx™ following launch) and also as a
standalone hardware platform. In both cases, IVLS physically connects and integrates all the IDEXX
VetLab

®

equipment and provides a laboratory information management system capability.
IVLS includes a user interface to run the individual equipment; generates one integrated patient
report; stores, retrieves and analyzes historical patient diagnostics data, including
SNAP

®

test results; and connects to practice information management systems, including
IDEXX Cornerstone

®

and Better Choice

®

systems, as well as a wide variety of
third-party systems.

Rapid Assays

We provide a broad range of single-use, handheld test kits under the SNAP

®

name
that allow quick, accurate and convenient test results for a variety of companion animal diseases
and health conditions. These products enable veterinarians to provide improved service to animal
owners by delivering test results and a diagnosis at the time of the patient visit, allowing the
veterinarian to initiate therapy or prevention, if required. These kits work without the use of
instrumentation.

Our principal single-use tests include canine combination parasite tests called
SNAP

®

3Dx

®

, which tests simultaneously for Lyme disease,

Ehrlichia canis

and
heartworm, and SNAP

®

4Dx

®

, which additionally tests for

Anaplasma
phagocytophilum

; a canine heartworm-only test; canine tests for parvovirus and pancreatitis; a
feline combination test, the SNAP

®

Combo FIV antibody/FeLV antigen test, which enables
veterinarians to test simultaneously for feline immunodeficiency virus (“FIV”) (which is similar to
the human AIDS virus) and feline leukemia virus (“FeLV”); a feline test for FeLV only; and canine
and feline tests for

Giardia

, a parasitic disease. Sales of canine parasite tests, including the
heartworm only test, are greater in the first half of our fiscal year due to seasonality of disease
testing in the veterinary practice.

In addition to our single-use tests, we sell a line of microwell-based test kits, under the
PetChek

®

name, that are used by larger clinics and laboratories to test multiple
samples. PetChek

®

tests offer accuracy, ease of use and cost advantages to high-volume
customers. We currently sell PetChek

®

tests for canine heartworm disease, FIV, and FeLV.

Veterinary Reference Laboratory and Consulting Services

We offer commercial veterinary reference laboratory and consulting services to veterinarians
in the U.S., Canada, Europe, Australia, Japan, and South Africa. Veterinarians use our services by
submitting samples by courier or overnight delivery to one of our facilities. Our laboratories
offer a large selection of tests and diagnostic panels to detect a number of disease states and
other conditions in production and companion animals.



Additionally, we provide specialized veterinary consultation, telemedicine and advisory
services, including cardiology, radiology, internal medicine and ultrasound consulting. These
services permit veterinarians to obtain readings and interpretations of test results transmitted by
telephone and over the Internet from the veterinarians’ offices.

Practice Information Systems and Digital Radiography

Practice Information Systems and Services

. We develop, market and sell practice
information systems, including hardware and software that run key functions of veterinary clinics,
including patient electronic health records management, scheduling (including boarding and
grooming), billing, and inventory management. Our principal system is the Cornerstone

®

system. We also provide software and hardware support to our practice information system customers,
and related supplies and services to veterinary practice information system users in general, and
we derive a significant portion of our revenues for this product line from ongoing service
contracts.

Digital Radiography Systems and Services

. Our digital radiography systems capture
radiograph images in digital form, replacing traditional x-ray film. Use of digital radiography
systems eliminates the need for the film and processor, hazardous chemicals and darkroom required
for the production of film images, and provides for image manipulation and enhancement through
contrast management. We market and sell three digital radiography systems, the IDEXX-DR™ 1417 and
the IDEXX-CR™ 1417 systems for use in the small animal (e.g., dog and cat) veterinary hospital, and
the IDEXX EquiView

®

DR system for use as a portable unit in ambulatory veterinary
practices, such as equine practices. Our digital radiography systems use IDEXX-PACS™ picture
archiving and communication system (“PACS”) software for the viewing, manipulation, management,
storage and retrieval of the digital images generated by the digital capture plate. The IDEXX-PACS™
software also permits images from our digital radiography systems to be integrated into patients’
medical records in the Cornerstone

®

system, as well as transferred to other practice
information management systems.

Pharmaceutical Products

We develop and commercialize pharmaceuticals for the veterinary market. We currently market
and sell four pharmaceutical products: PZI VET

®

, an insulin product for the treatment of
diabetic cats; Acarexx

®

(0.01% ivermectin) otic suspension for the treatment of ear
mites in cats; SURPASS

®

(1% diclofenac sodium), a topical, nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drug for equine use; and Navigator

®

(32% nitazoxanide) Antiprotozoal
Oral Paste, a treatment for equine protozoal myeloencephalitis (“EPM”). See “Part I, Item 1A. Risk
Factors – We May be Required to Discontinue Sales of One of Our Veterinary Pharmaceutical
Products.”

WATER

We offer a range of products used in the detection of various microbiological analytes in
water.

Our Colilert

®

, Colilert

®

-18 and Colisure

®

tests
simultaneously detect total coliforms and

E. coli

in water. These organisms are broadly used as
indicators of microbial contamination in water. These products utilize indicator-nutrients that
produce a change in color or fluorescence when metabolized by target microbes in the sample. Our
water tests are used by government laboratories, water utilities and private certified laboratories
to test drinking water in compliance with regulatory standards, including U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (“EPA”) standards. The tests also are used in evaluating water used in production
processes (for example, in beverage and pharmaceutical applications) and in evaluating bottled
water, recreational water, waste water and water from private wells.

Our Enterolert™ product detects enterococci in drinking and recreational waters. Our
Quanti-Tray

®

products, when used in conjunction with our Colilert

®

,
Colilert

®

-18, Colisure

®

or Enterolert™ products, provide users quantitative
measurements of microbial contamination, rather than a presence/absence indication. The
Colilert

®

, Colilert

®

-18, Colisure

®

and Quanti-Tray

®

products have been approved by the EPA and by regulatory agencies in certain other countries.



Our Filta-Max

®

product is used in the detection of

Cryptosporidium

in water.

Cryptosporidium

is a parasite that can cause potentially fatal gastrointestinal illness if
ingested. Testing of water supplies for

Cryptosporidium

has been mandated by regulation only in the
United Kingdom. On December 29, 2006, the Drinking Water Inspectorate in the U.K. published a
proposal to discontinue the regulation that requires testing water supplies for

Cryptosporidium

.
Subsequently, regulatory changes were approved and will become effective January 1, 2009.
Beginning in 2009, therefore, we believe that we may lose a substantial portion of our sales
of Filta-Max

®

products in England and Wales, which were $2.8 million in the year ended
December 31, 2007. Effective September 2007, we commenced distribution of certain water testing
kits manufactured by Invitrogen Corporation (“Invitrogen”). The Invitrogen kits complement our
IDEXX developed

Cryptosporidium

and

Giardia

testing products.

PRODUCTION ANIMAL SEGMENT

We sell diagnostic tests and related instrumentation that are used to detect a wide range of
diseases and to monitor health status in production animals. Our production animal products are
purchased primarily by government laboratories and poultry, cattle and swine producers. Our largest
product is a post-mortem test for bovine spongiform encephalopathy (“BSE” or “mad cow disease”).
Other significant products include ante-mortem diagnostic tests for porcine reproductive and
respiratory syndrome (“PRRS”), pseudorabies (“PRV”) in pigs and bovine viral diarrhea (“BVDV”)
virus in cattle.

OTHER

Dairy

Our principal product for use in testing for antibiotic residue in milk is the
SNAP

®

Beta-Lactam test. Our primary customers are dairy producers and processors who use
our tests worldwide for quality assurance of raw milk.

OPTI Medical Systems

We sell OPTI

®

point-of-care analyzers and related consumables for use in human
medical hospitals and clinics to measure electrolytes, blood gases, acid-base balance, glucose and
ionized calcium, and to calculate other parameters such as bicarbonate and anion gap. These
analyzers are used primarily in emergency rooms, operating rooms, cardiac monitoring areas and any
locations where time-critical diagnostic testing is performed within the hospital setting. The
OPTI

®

CCA Touch Electrolyte and Blood Gas Analyzer runs single-use disposable cassettes
that contain various configurations of analytes; the OPTI

®

R Analyzer runs reusable
cassettes in various analyte configurations; and the OPTI

®

Lion Analyzer runs single-use
electrolyte cassettes.

MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION

We market, sell and service our products worldwide through our marketing, sales and technical
service groups, as well as through independent distributors and other resellers. We maintain sales
offices outside the U.S. in Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the
Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland, Taiwan and the United Kingdom. Sales and marketing expense was
$151.9 million, $115.9 million and $102.0 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, or 16% of
sales in each year.

Generally, we select the appropriate distribution channel for our products based on the type
of product, technical service requirements, number and concentration of customers, regulatory
requirements and other factors. We market our veterinary diagnostic and pharmaceutical products to
veterinarians both directly and through independent veterinary distributors in the U.S., with most
instruments sold directly by IDEXX sales personnel, and test kits, pharmaceutical products and
instrument consumables supplied primarily by the distribution channel. Outside the U.S., we sell
our veterinary diagnostic products through our direct sales force and, in certain countries,
through distributors and other resellers. We sell our reference laboratory services worldwide
through our direct sales force. We market our software and digital radiography products through our
direct sales force primarily in the U.S. We market our water and food diagnostics products
primarily through our direct sales force in the U.S. and Canada. Outside the U.S. and Canada, we
market these products through selected independent distributors and, in certain countries, through
our direct sales force. We sell our OPTI

®

electrolyte and blood gas analyzers both
directly and through independent human medical product distributors in the U.S. and sell most of
the related consumables through the distribution channel. Outside the U.S., we sell our
OPTI

®

electrolyte and blood gas analyzers and related consumables primarily through
distributors and other resellers.



Our largest customers are our U.S. distributors of our products in the CAG segment. One of our
CAG distributors, Butler Animal Health Supply, LLC, accounted for 8%, 9% and 10% of our 2007, 2006
and 2005 revenue, respectively, and 5% of our net accounts receivable at December 31, 2007 and
2006, and 4% of our net accounts receivable at December 31, 2005.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

Our business includes the development and introduction of new products and services and may
involve entry into new business areas. Our research and development activity is focused primarily
on development of new diagnostic instrument platforms and information systems, new immunoassay
devices, new diagnostic tests, new animal drugs, enhanced practice information systems, and
improvements in the performance, connectivity, usability, and interoperability of our products and
services. Our research and development expenses, which consist of salaries, employee benefits,
materials and consulting costs, were $67.3 million, $53.6 million and $40.9 million, or 7.3% of
sales in 2007 and 2006, respectively, and 6.4% of sales in 2005.

PATENTS AND LICENSES

We actively seek to obtain patent protection in the U.S. and other countries for inventions
covering our products and technologies. We also license patents and technologies from third

technologies in order to continue to sell our products. These licenses may not be available on
commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our failure to obtain any such licenses may delay or
prevent the sale of certain new or existing products. See “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.”

PRODUCTION AND SUPPLY

Many of the instruments that we sell are manufactured by third parties and we rely on third
parties, who are in some cases sole source suppliers, to supply us with certain important
components, raw materials and consumables used in or with our products.

VetTest

®

Chemistry Analyzers are manufactured for us by Tokyo Parts Industrial
Company, Ltd. under an agreement that renews annually unless either party notifies the other of its
decision not to renew. VetTest

®

slides are supplied exclusively by Ortho under supply
agreements with Ortho (the “Ortho Agreements”). We are required to purchase all of our requirements
for our current menu of VetTest

®

slides from Ortho to the extent Ortho is able to supply
those requirements. In addition, we have committed to minimum annual purchase volumes of certain
VetTest

®

slides through 2010. Under these agreements Ortho will also supply the slide
consumables used in the Catalyst Dx™ Chemistry Analyzer. The Ortho Agreements expire on December
31, 2025.



The VetAutoread™ Hematology Analyzer and related consumables are manufactured for us by QBC
Diagnostics, Inc. (“QBCD”) under a supply agreement that expires on December 31, 2020. The
VetLyte

®

Electrolyte Analyzer is manufactured for us by Roche Diagnostics Corporation
under an agreement that requires Roche Diagnostics to supply analyzers through December 31, 2009
provided that we achieve specified purchase levels, and consumables and spare parts through
December 31, 2013.

IDEXX VetLab

®

UA™ urinalysis strips are manufactured for us by Roche Diagnostics
under agreements that expire on December 31, 2010 but are renewable at our option through December
31, 2020 if we achieve certain purchase levels under those agreements.

IDEXX VetLab

®

UA™ Analyzers are manufactured for us by 77 Elektronika Kft. under
agreements that expire on December 31, 2022, and which require 77 Elektronika to supply spare parts
for five years following expiration.

The IDEXX Coag Dx™ Analyzer and associated cartridges are manufactured for us by International
Technidyne Corporation (“ITC”) under an agreement that expires on February 6, 2017, but which we
may extend until February 6, 2022 if we achieve certain minimum purchase levels under the
agreement, and which requires ITC to supply consumables and spare parts for five years following
expiration.

We purchase certain other products, raw materials and components from a single supplier. These
include active ingredients for our pharmaceutical products, certain digital radiography systems,
certain other instruments, instrument consumables, and certain components used in our
SNAP

®

rapid assay devices, water testing products, and instruments, including in
LaserCyte

®

Hematology Analyzers. We have in the past been successful in ensuring an
uninterrupted supply of products purchased from single source suppliers. However, there can be no
assurance that uninterrupted supply can be maintained if these agreements terminate for any reason
or our suppliers otherwise are unable to satisfy our requirements for products.

We do not generally maintain significant backlog and believe that our backlog at any
particular date historically has not been indicative of future sales.

COMPETITION

We face intense competition within the markets in which we sell our products and services. We
expect that future competition will become even more intense, and that we will have to compete with
changing technologies, which could affect the marketability of our products and services. Our
competitive position also will depend on our ability to develop proprietary products, integrate our
products, develop and maintain effective sales channels, attract and retain qualified scientific
and other personnel, develop and implement production and marketing plans, obtain or license patent
rights, and obtain adequate capital resources.

We compete with many companies ranging from small businesses focused on animal health to large
pharmaceutical and human medical diagnostics companies. Our competitors vary in our different
markets. Academic institutions, governmental agencies and other public and private research
organizations also conduct research activities and may commercialize products, which could compete
with our products, on their own or through joint ventures. Some of our competitors have
substantially greater capital, manufacturing, marketing, and research and development resources
than we do.

Competitive factors in our different business areas are detailed below:

•

Veterinary diagnostic products and food and water testing products

. We
compete primarily on the basis of the ease of use, speed, accuracy, quality of the
information provided, and other performance characteristics of our products and
services (including unique tests), the breadth of our product line and services, the
effectiveness of our sales and distribution channels, the quality of our technical and
customer service, and our pricing relative to the value of our products.



•

Veterinary laboratory and consulting services

. In this market, we compete
primarily on the basis of quality, consistency of service levels, technology, and our
pricing relative to the value of our services. We compete in most geographic locations
in the U.S. with Antech Diagnostics, a unit of VCA Antech, Inc.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION

Many of our products are subject to comprehensive regulation by U.S. and foreign regulatory
agencies that relate to, among other things, product approvals, manufacturing, marketing and
promotion, recordkeeping, testing, quality, storage, and product disposal. The following is a
description of the principal regulations affecting our businesses.

Veterinary diagnostic products

. Most diagnostic tests for animal health applications,
including our production animal products and our rapid assay lines of business, are veterinary
biological products for infectious diseases that are regulated in the U.S. by the Center for
Veterinary Biologics within the United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) Animal and Plant
Health Inspection Service (“APHIS”). The APHIS regulatory approval process involves the submission
of product performance data and manufacturing documentation. Following regulatory approval to
market a product, APHIS requires that each lot of product be submitted for review before release to
customers. In addition, APHIS requires special approval to market products where test results are
used in part for government-mandated disease management programs. A number of foreign governments
accept APHIS approval as part of their separate regulatory approvals. However, compliance with an
extensive regulatory process is required in connection with marketing diagnostic products in Japan,
Germany, the Netherlands and many other countries. We also are required to have a facility license
from APHIS to manufacture USDA-licensed products. We have obtained such a license for our
manufacturing facility in Westbrook, Maine and our distribution center in Memphis, Tennessee.

Our veterinary diagnostic instrument systems are medical devices regulated by the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration (“FDA”) under the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act (the “FDC Act”). While the
sale of these products does not require premarket approval by the FDA and does not subject us to
the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices regulations (“cGMP”), these products must not be
adulterated or misbranded under the FDC Act.

These products also are subject to the European Medical Device Directives, which create a
single set of medical device regulations for all European Union (“EU”) member countries and require
companies that wish to manufacture and distribute medical devices in EU member countries to obtain
European Conformity (“CE”) marking for their products.

Veterinary pharmaceuticals

. The manufacture and sale of veterinary pharmaceuticals
are regulated by the Center for Veterinary Medicine (“CVM”) of the FDA. A new animal drug may not
be commercially marketed in the U.S. unless it has been approved as safe and effective by CVM.
Approval may be requested by filing a new animal drug application (“NADA”) with CVM containing
substantial evidence as to the safety and effectiveness of the drug. Data regarding manufacturing
methods and controls also are required to be submitted with the NADA. Manufacturers of animal drugs
must also comply with cGMP and Good Laboratory Practices (“GLP”). Sales of animal drugs in
countries outside the U.S. require compliance with the laws of those countries, which may be
extensive.



Water testing products

. Our water tests are not subject to formal premarket
regulatory approval. However, before a test can be used as part of a water quality monitoring
program in the U.S. that is required by the EPA, the test must first be approved by the EPA. The
EPA approval process involves submission of extensive product performance data in accordance with
an EPA-approved protocol, evaluation of the data by the EPA and publication for public comment of
any proposed approval in the Federal Register before final approval. Our Colilert

®

,
Colilert

®

-18, Colisure

®

, Quanti-Tray

®

, Filta-Max

®

and
SimPlate

®

for heterotropic plate counts (“HPC”) products have been approved by the EPA.
The sale of water testing products also is subject to extensive and lengthy regulatory processes in
many other countries around the world.

Dairy testing products

. The sale of dairy testing products in the U.S. is regulated
by the FDA in conjunction with the AOAC Research Institute (“AOAC RI”). Before a product can be
sold, extensive product
performance data must be submitted in accordance with a protocol that is approved by the FDA
and the AOAC RI. Following approval of a product by the FDA, the product must also be approved by
the National Conference on Interstate Milk Shipments (“NCIMS”), an oversight body that includes
state, federal and industry representatives. Our dairy antibiotic residue testing products have
been approved by the FDA and NCIMS. While some foreign countries accept AOAC RI approval as part of
their regulatory approval process, many countries have separate regulatory processes.

Human point-of-care electrolyte and blood gas analyzers

. Our OPTI

®

instrument systems are classified as Class II medical devices, and their design, manufacture and
marketing are regulated by the FDA. Accordingly, we must comply with cGMP in the manufacture of our
OPTI

®

products. The FDA’s Quality System regulations further set forth standards for
product design and manufacturing processes, require the maintenance of certain records, and provide
for inspections of our facilities by the FDA. New OPTI

®

products fall into FDA
classifications that require notification of and review by the FDA before marketing, submitted as a
510(k) application.

OPTI

®

products are also subject to the European Medical Device Directives and
regulations governing the manufacture and marketing of medical devices in other countries in which
they are sold.

Any acquisitions of new products and technologies may subject us to additional areas of
government regulation. These may involve food, drug, medical device and water-quality regulations
of the FDA, the EPA and the USDA, as well as state, local and foreign governments. See “Part I,
Item 1A. Risk Factors.”

EMPLOYEES

At December 31, 2007, we had approximately 4,700 full-time and part-time employees.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Our future operating results involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual events or
results may differ materially from those discussed in this report. Factors that could cause or
contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, the factors discussed below, as
well as those discussed elsewhere in this report.

We May Be Unsuccessful in Maintaining Our Growth Rate

Our ability to maintain our growth rate depends on our successful implementation of various
strategies, including:

•

Developing, manufacturing and marketing innovative new products with new features,
functions and capabilities, including in-house laboratory analyzers such as Catalyst
Dx™ and SNAPshot Dx™, rapid assay and other specialized diagnostic tests and services,
water testing products, production animal diagnostic products, and companion animal
veterinary pharmaceuticals, as well as improving and enhancing existing products;

•

Developing and implementing new technology and licensing strategies; and
identifying, completing and integrating acquisitions that enhance our existing
businesses or create new business areas for us;



•

Increasing the value to our customers of our companion animal products and services
by enhancing the integration of these products, including the interoperability among
the IDEXX VetLab

®

instrument suite, Cornerstone

®

practice
information management system, IDEXX VetLab

®

Station, IDEXX-PACS™ software
and IDEXX Reference Laboratories;

•

Expanding our market by expanding the installed base of our instrumentation through
customer acquisition and retention and increasing use of our products by our customers;
and

•

Strengthening our sales and marketing activities both within the U.S. and in
geographies outside of the U.S.

However, we may not be able to successfully implement some or all of these strategies and
increase or sustain our rate of growth or profitability.

Our Dependence on a Limited Number of Suppliers Could Limit Our Ability to Sell Certain
Products or Reduce Our Profitability

We currently purchase many products and materials from single sources or a limited number of
sources. Some of the products that we purchase from these sources are proprietary, and, therefore,
cannot be readily or easily replaced by alternative sources. These products include our
VetAutoread™ hematology, VetLyte

®

electrolyte and IDEXX VetLab

®

UA™
urinalysis, CoagDx™ blood coagulation analyzers and related consumables and accessories; the
consumables associated with our VetTest

®

Chemistry Analyzers; image capture plates used
in our digital radiography system; active ingredients for pharmaceutical products; and certain
components and raw materials used in our SNAP

®

rapid assay devices, water testing
products and LaserCyte

®

Hematology Analyzers. If we are unable to obtain adequate
quantities of these products in the future, we could face cost increases or reductions, or delays
or discontinuations in product shipments, which could have a material adverse effect on our results
of operations.

Our Biologic Products Are Complex and Difficult to Manufacture, Which Could Negatively
Affect Our Ability to Supply the Market

Many of our rapid assay and production animal diagnostic products are biologics, which are
products that are comprised of materials from living organisms, such as antibodies, cells and sera.
Manufacturing biologic products is highly complex. Unlike products that rely on chemicals for
efficacy (such as most pharmaceuticals), biologics are difficult to characterize due to the
inherent variability of biological input materials. Difficulty in characterizing biological
materials or their interactions creates greater risk in the manufacturing process. There can be no
assurance that we will be able to maintain adequate sources of biological materials or that
biological materials that we maintain in inventory will yield finished products that satisfy
applicable product release criteria. Our inability to produce or obtain necessary biological
materials or to successfully manufacture biologic products that incorporate such materials could
result in our inability to supply the market with these products, which could have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations.

We May be Required to Discontinue Sales of One of Our Veterinary Pharmaceutical Products

For the year ended December 31, 2007, 2% of CAG revenue (or $15.4 million) was attributable to
sales of our highest-selling pharmaceutical product. This product is sold under the FDA’s
regulatory discretion and we believe that the FDA would require us to discontinue sales of the
product within a short period if and when the FDA approves another product to treat the same
condition, whether such new product was our product or that of another commercial supplier. In
addition, we have a finite inventory of the raw materials used in the manufacture of this product,
and these raw materials are no longer commercially available. We believe that our remaining
inventory of raw materials will be adequate to satisfy existing market demand until late 2008 or
early 2009. We are seeking FDA approval of a new product for the same application based on
different raw materials. FDA approval of this new product would mitigate the commercial risk that
we would be required to stop selling our current product due either to FDA approval of another
manufacturer’s product or to the full depletion of our inventory of raw materials. While we hope to
transition smoothly to our new product, we cannot predict when or if the FDA will approve our new
product or any product that treats the same condition from another manufacturer. Further, there can
be no assurances that the new product would achieve the same revenue and profitability as our
existing product.



Various Government Regulations Could Limit or Delay Our Ability to Market and Sell Our
Products

In the U.S., the manufacture and sale of our products are regulated by agencies such as the
USDA, the FDA and the EPA. Most diagnostic tests for animal health applications, including our
canine, feline, poultry and livestock tests, must be approved by the USDA prior to sale in the U.S.
Our water testing products must be approved by the EPA before they can be used by customers in the
U.S. as a part of a water quality monitoring program required by the EPA. Our pharmaceutical and
dairy testing products require approval by the FDA. The manufacture and sale of our
OPTI

®

line of human point-of-care electrolytes and blood gas analyzers are regulated by
the FDA and require approval by the FDA before they may be sold commercially in the U.S. The
manufacture and sale of our products are subject to similar laws in many foreign countries. Any
failure to comply with legal and regulatory requirements relating to the manufacture and sale of
our products in the U.S. or in other countries could result in fines and sanctions against us or
removals of our products from the market, which could have a material adverse effect on our results
of operations.

Our Success Is Heavily Dependent Upon Our Proprietary Technologies

We rely on a combination of patent, trade secret, trademark and copyright laws to protect our
proprietary rights. If we do not have adequate protection of our proprietary rights, our business
may be affected by competitors who develop substantially equivalent technologies that compete with
us.

We cannot ensure that we will obtain issued patents, that any patents issued or licensed to us
will remain valid, or that any patents owned or licensed by us will provide protection against
competitors with similar technologies. Even if our patents cover products sold by our competitors,
the time and expense of litigating to enforce our patent rights could be substantial, and could
have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, expiration of patent
rights could result in substantial new competition in the markets for products previously covered
by those patent rights. In this regard, we expect that revenues and profit margins associated with
sales of our SNAP

®

FIV/FeLV tests are likely to decline following the expiration in June
2009 of a U.S. patent that we exclusively license that broadly covers products that diagnose feline
immunodeficiency virus.

In the past, we have received notices claiming that our products infringe third-party patents
and we may receive such notices in the future. Patent litigation is complex and expensive, and the
outcome of patent litigation can be difficult to predict. We cannot ensure that we will win a
patent litigation case or negotiate an acceptable resolution of such a case. If we lose, we may be
stopped from selling certain products and/or we may be required to pay damages and/or ongoing
royalties as a result of the lawsuit. Any such adverse result could have a material adverse effect
on our results of operations.

Distributor Purchasing Patterns Could Negatively Affect Our Operating Results

We sell many of our products, including substantially all of the rapid assays and instrument
consumables sold in the U.S., through distributors. Distributor purchasing patterns can be
unpredictable and may be influenced by factors unrelated to the end-user demand for our products.
In addition, our agreements with distributors may generally be terminated by the distributors for
any reason on 60 days notice. Because significant product sales are made to a limited number of
distributors, the loss of a distributor or unanticipated changes in the frequency, timing or size
of distributor purchases, could have a negative effect on our results of operations. Our financial
performance, therefore, is subject to an unexpected downturn in product demand and may be
unpredictable.

Distributors of veterinary products have entered into business combinations resulting in fewer
distribution companies. Consolidation within distribution channels would increase our customer
concentration level, which could increase the risks described in the preceding paragraph.

Increased Competition and Technological Advances by Our Competitors Could Negatively Affect
Our Operating Results

We face intense competition within the markets in which we sell our products and services. We
expect that future competition will become even more intense, and that we will have to compete with
changing and improving technologies. Competitors may develop products that that are superior to our
products, and as a result, we may lose existing customers and market share. Some of our competitors
and potential competitors, including large human pharmaceutical and diagnostic companies, have
substantially greater financial resources than us, and greater
experience in manufacturing, marketing, research and development, obtaining regulatory
approvals and conducting clinical trials than we do.



Changes in Testing Could Negatively Affect Our Operating Results

The market for our companion and production animal diagnostic tests and our dairy and water
testing products could be negatively impacted by a number of factors. The introduction or broad
market acceptance of vaccines or preventatives for the diseases and conditions for which we sell
diagnostic tests and services could result in a decline in testing. Changes in accepted medical
protocols regarding the diagnosis of certain diseases and conditions could have a similar effect.
Eradication or substantial declines in the prevalence of certain diseases also could lead to a
decline in diagnostic testing for such diseases. Our production animal products business in
particular is subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in disease prevalence. In addition,
changes in government regulations could negatively affect sales of our products that are driven by
compliance testing, such as our dairy and water products. Declines in testing for any of the
reasons described could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

On December 29, 2006, the Drinking Water Inspectorate in the U.K. published a proposal to
discontinue the regulation that requires testing water supplies for

Cryptosporidium

. Subsequently,
regulatory changes were approved and will become effective January 1, 2009. Beginning in 2009, we
believe that we may lose a substantial portion of our sales of Filta-Max

®

products in
England and Wales, which were $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2007.

Consolidation of Veterinary Hospitals Could Negatively Affect Our Business

An increasing
percentage of veterinary hospitals in the U.S. are owned by corporations that are
in the business of acquiring veterinary hospitals and/or opening new veterinary hospitals
nationally or regionally. Major corporate hospital owners in the U.S. include VCA Antech, Inc. and
Banfield, The Pet Hospital, both of which are currently customers of IDEXX. A similar trend is
developing in the U.K. and may in the future also develop in other countries. Corporate owners of
veterinary hospitals could attempt to improve profitability by leveraging the buying power they
derive from their scale to obtain favorable pricing from suppliers, which could have a negative
impact on our results. In addition, certain corporate owners, most notably VCA Antech, our primary
competitor in the U.S. market for reference laboratory services, also operate reference
laboratories that serve both their hospitals and unaffiliated hospitals. Any hospitals acquired by
these companies are likely to use their laboratory services almost exclusively. In addition,
because these companies compete with us in the laboratory services business, hospitals acquired by
these companies may cease to be customers or potential customers of our other companion animal
products and services.

Our Inexperience in the Human Point-of-Care Market Could Inhibit Our Success in this Market

Upon acquiring the Critical Care Division of Osmetech plc in January 2007, we entered the
human point-of-care medical diagnostics market for the first time with the sale of the
OPTI

®

line of electrolyte and blood gas analyzers. The human point-of-care medical
diagnostics market differs in many respects from the veterinary medical market. Significant
differences include the impact of third party reimbursement on diagnostic testing, more extensive
regulation, greater product liability risks, larger competitors, a more segmented customer base,
and more rapid technological innovation. Our inexperience in the human point-of-care medical
diagnostics market could negatively affect our ability to successfully manage the risks and
features of this market that differ from the veterinary medical market. There can be no assurance
that we will be successful in achieving growth and profitability in the human point-of-care medical
diagnostics market comparable to the results we have achieved in the veterinary medical market.



Risks Associated with Doing Business Internationally Could Negatively Affect Our Operating
Results

For the year ended December 31, 2007, 40% of our revenue was attributable to sales of products
and services to customers outside the U.S. Various risks associated with foreign operations may
impact our international sales. Possible risks include fluctuations in the value of foreign
currencies, disruptions in transportation of our products, the differing product and service needs
of foreign customers, difficulties in building and managing foreign operations, import/export
duties and quotas, and unexpected regulatory, economic or political changes in foreign markets.
Prices that we charge to foreign customers may be different than the prices we charge for the same
products in the U.S. due to competitive, market or other factors. As a result, the mix of domestic
and international
sales in a particular period could have a material impact on our results for that period. In
addition, many of the products for which our selling price may be denominated in foreign currencies
are manufactured, sourced, or both, in the U.S. and our costs are incurred in U.S. dollars. We
utilize non-speculative forward currency exchange contracts and natural hedges to mitigate foreign
currency exposure. However, an appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the foreign currencies
in which we sell these products would reduce our operating margins.

The Loss of Our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman Could Adversely Affect Our
Business

We rely on the management and leadership of Jonathan W. Ayers, our President, Chief Executive
Officer and Chairman. We do not maintain key man life insurance coverage for Mr. Ayers. The loss of
Mr. Ayers could have a material adverse impact on our business.

We Could Be Subject to Class Action Litigation Due to Stock Price Volatility, which, if it
Occurs, Could Result in Substantial Costs or Large Judgments Against Us

The market for our common stock may experience extreme price and volume fluctuations, which
may be unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance or prospects. In the past,
securities class action litigation has often been brought against companies following periods of
volatility in the market prices of their securities. We may be the target of similar litigation in
the future. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s
attention and resources, which could have a negative effect on our business, operating results and
financial condition.

If Our Quarterly Results of Operations Fluctuate, This Fluctuation May Cause Our Stock Price
to Decline, Resulting in Losses to You

Our prior operating results have fluctuated due to a number of factors, including seasonality
of certain product lines; changes in our accounting estimates; the impact of acquisitions; timing
of distributor purchases, product launches, operating expenditures, litigation and claim-related
expenditures; changes in competitors’ product offerings; and other matters. Similarly, our future
operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to these and other factors,
many of which are beyond our control. If our operating results or projections of future operating
results do not meet the expectations of market analysts or investors in future periods, our stock
price may fall.

Future Operating Results Could Be Negatively Affected By the Resolution of Various Uncertain
Tax Positions and by Potential Changes to Tax Incentives

In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the
ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Significant judgment is required in determining our
worldwide provision for income taxes. We periodically assess our exposures related to our worldwide
provision for income taxes and believe that we have appropriately accrued taxes for contingencies.
Any reduction of these contingent liabilities or additional assessment would increase or decrease
income, respectively, in the period such determination was made. Our income tax filings are
regularly under audit by tax authorities and the final determination of tax audits could be
materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals.
Additionally, we benefit from certain tax incentives offered by various jurisdictions. If we are
unable to meet the requirements of such incentives, our inability to use these benefits could have
a material negative effect on future earnings.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

On June 30, 2006, Cyntegra, Inc. filed suit against us in the U.S. District Court for the
Central District of California alleging that we had violated U.S. federal antitrust laws and
California state unfair trade practices laws. The complaint alleged, among other things, that we
were monopolizing the U.S. market for companion animal diagnostic products. On October 26, 2007 the
Court granted summary judgment in our favor on all of Cyntegra’s claims and dismissed the suit.
Cyntegra has appealed this decision. We will continue to defend ourselves vigorously, as we believe
Cyntegra’s claims are without merit.

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSES OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

During 2007, we operated primarily through three business segments: products and services for
the veterinary market, which we refer to as our Companion Animal Group (“CAG”), water quality
products (“Water”) and products for production animal health, which we refer to as the Production
Animal Segment (“PAS”). We also operate two smaller segments that comprise products for dairy
quality, which we refer to as Dairy, and products for the human medical diagnostic market, which we
refer to as OPTI Medical. Financial information about the Dairy and OPTI Medical operating segments
are combined and presented in an “Other” category because they do not meet the quantitative or
qualitative thresholds for reportable segments. We added the OPTI Medical operating segment in
connection with our acquisition of substantially all of the assets and assumption of certain
liabilities of the Critical Care Division of Osmetech plc in January 2007. The segment information
for the year ended December 31, 2005 has been restated to conform to our presentation of reportable
segments for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006. Previously, PAS and Dairy were aggregated
into a single reportable segment, which we referred to as the Food Diagnostics Group. See Note 17
to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2007 included in this
Annual Report on Form 10-K for financial information about our segments, including geographic
information, and about our product and service categories.

CAG develops, designs, manufactures, and distributes products and performs services for
veterinarians. Water develops, designs, manufactures and distributes products to detect
contaminants in water. PAS develops, designs, manufactures and distributes products to detect
diseases in production animals. Dairy develops, designs, manufactures and distributes products to
detect contaminants in dairy products. OPTI Medical develops, designs, manufactures, and
distributes point-of-care electrolyte and blood gas analyzers and related consumable products for
the human medical diagnostics market.

Items that are not allocated to our operating segments are comprised primarily of corporate
research and development expenses, interest income and expense, and income taxes. Share-based
compensation expense was also reported in “unallocated amounts” in 2006. Beginning in 2007, we
allocate a portion of share-based compensation expense to the operating segments. This allocation
differs from the actual expense and consequently yields a difference between the total allocated
share-based compensation expense and the actual expense for the total company, which was
categorized as “unallocated amounts.”

The following is a discussion of the strategic and operating factors that we believe have the
most significant effect on the performance of our business.

Companion Animal Group

In the CAG segment, we believe we have developed a strategic advantage over companies with
more narrow product or service offerings. The breadth and complementary nature of our products and
services gives us scale in sales and distribution, permits us to offer integrated
disease-management solutions that leverage the advantages of both point-of-care and outside
laboratory testing, and facilitates the flow of medical and business information in the veterinary
practice by connecting practice information software systems, including connecting the electronic
health record with laboratory test data, in-clinic test data from our IDEXX VetLab

®

suite of analyzers, and radiographic data in the IDEXX-PACS™ software taken by our digital
radiography systems.

In the U.S., we sell instrument consumables, rapid assay products and pharmaceutical products
primarily through distributors, and, therefore, our reported sales of these products are sales made
to distributors, rather than sales to veterinarians, the end users. Because distributors’ inventory
levels and purchasing patterns may fluctuate, sales of a particular product line in a particular
period may not always be representative of the underlying end-user demand for the product.
Therefore, we closely track sales of these products by our U.S. distributors to the veterinarians
which we refer to as practice-level sales. We believe these sales often provide a more accurate
picture of the real growth rate for these products.

Instruments and Consumables

. Our strategy in our IDEXX VetLab

®

instrument
business is to provide veterinarians with an integrated set of instruments that, individually and
together, provide superior diagnostic information in the clinic, enabling veterinarians to practice
better medicine and, in doing so, achieve their practice economic objectives, including growth and
profitability. We derive substantial revenues and margins from the sale of consumables that are
used in these instruments. The principal instruments used by veterinarians for in-clinic diagnostic
testing are chemistry and hematology analyzers. In addition we sell instruments used for
endocrinology,
blood gas, electrolytes, urinalysis, and blood coagulation testing. Our IDEXX
VetLab

®

Station is an in-clinic laboratory information management system that records
and integrates patient diagnostic information from our analyzers for better practice management.



During the early stage of an instrument’s life cycle, we derive relatively greater revenues
from instrument placements, while consumable sales become relatively more significant in later
stages as the installed base of instruments increases and instrument placement revenues begin to
decline. Instrument sales have significantly lower gross margins than sales of consumables, and
therefore the mix of instrument and consumable sales in a particular period will impact our gross
margins in this line of business.

We have an installed base of approximately 30,000 active VetTest

®

Chemistry
Analyzers, and substantially all of our revenues from that product line are now derived from
consumables sales, although we continue to place instruments through sales, lease, rental and other
programs. Our long-term success in this area of our business is dependent upon new customer
acquisition, customer retention and increased customer utilization of existing and new assays
introduced on these instruments. To increase utilization, we seek to educate veterinarians about
best medical practices that emphasize the importance of blood and urine chemistry testing for a
variety of diagnostic purposes.

In the first quarter of 2008 we announced the launch of our next-generation chemistry
analyzer, Catalyst Dx™. As a result of this launch, we expect that in 2008 we will derive a greater
portion of our IDEXX VetLab

®

revenues from the sale of instruments than we have derived
in recent years.

We purchase the consumables used in our VetTest

®

and Catalyst Dx™ Chemistry
Analyzers from Ortho under a supply agreement that continues through 2025. This supply agreement
provides us with a long-term source of slides at costs that improve annually through 2010, and also
improve over the term of the agreement as a result of increasing volume.

Our principal hematology analyzer is the LaserCyte

®

Hematology Analyzer, and in
addition we sell the VetAutoread™ Hematology Analyzer. A substantial portion of
LaserCyte

®

placements have been made at veterinary clinics that already own our
VetAutoread™ Hematology Analyzers. Although we have experienced growth in sales of hematology
consumables, LaserCyte

®

consumable sales have been partly offset by declines in sales of
VetAutoread™ consumables. Because the gross margin percentage of LaserCyte

®

consumables
exceeds the gross margin percentage of the VetAutoread™ consumables, gross margin from hematology
consumables is expected to increase with continued penetration of the LaserCyte

®

Hematology Analyzer.

With all of our instrument lines, we seek to differentiate our products based on breadth of
diagnostic menu, flexibility of menu selection, accuracy, reliability, ease of use, ability to
handle compromised samples, time to result, analytical capability of software, integration with the
IDEXX VetLab

®

Station, education and training, and superior sales and customer service.
Our instruments and consumables typically are sold at a premium price to competitive offerings. Our
success depends, in part, on our ability to differentiate our products in a way that justifies
premium pricing.

Rapid Assay Products

. Our rapid assay business consists primarily of single-use kits
for point-of-care testing and, to a limited degree, microwell-based kits for laboratory testing for
canine and feline diseases and conditions. Our rapid assay strategy is to develop, manufacture,
market and sell proprietary tests that address important medical needs for particular diseases
prevalent in the companion animal population. We seek to differentiate our tests through superior
performance, including by providing our customers with proprietary combination tests that test a
single sample for multiple analytes. Where alternative point-of-care offerings exist, we seek to
differentiate our tests with superior performance. As in our other lines of business, we also seek
to differentiate our products through superior customer service. These products carry price
premiums over competitive products that we believe do not offer equivalent performance and
diagnostic capabilities, and which we believe do not include a similar level of support. We further
augment our product development and customer service efforts with sales and marketing programs that
enhance medical awareness and understanding regarding our target diseases and the importance of
diagnostic testing.



Veterinary Reference Laboratory and Consulting Services

. We believe that more than
half of all diagnostic testing by U.S. veterinarians is done at outside reference laboratories such
as our IDEXX Reference Laboratories. In markets outside the U.S., in-clinic testing is less
prevalent and an even greater percentage of diagnostic testing is done in reference laboratories.
We attempt to differentiate our laboratory testing services from those of our
competitors primarily on the basis of quality, customer service, technology employed and
specialized test menu. Revenue growth in this business is achieved both through increased sales at
existing laboratories and through the acquisition of new customers, including through laboratory
acquisitions and opening new laboratories. In 2005, we acquired laboratories in Switzerland, the
United Kingdom, and France and acquired veterinary laboratory customer lists in the U.S. and
Germany. In 2006, we acquired laboratories in the U.S., South Africa, and Canada and acquired a
veterinary laboratory customer list in the U.S. In 2007, we acquired laboratories in the U.S. and
Canada and acquired veterinary laboratory customer lists in the U.S., Switzerland, and United
Kingdom. Profitability of this business is largely the result of our ability to achieve
efficiencies from both volume and operational improvements. New laboratories that we open typically
will operate at a loss until testing volumes reach a level that permits profitability. Acquired
laboratories frequently operate less profitably than our existing laboratories and those
laboratories may not achieve profitability comparable to our existing laboratories for several
years while we implement operating improvements and efficiencies. Therefore, in the short term, new
and acquired reference laboratories generally will have a negative effect on the operating margin
of the laboratory and consulting services business.

Practice Information Systems and Digital Radiography

. These businesses consist of
veterinary practice information systems including hardware and software and veterinary-specific
digital radiography systems. Our strategy in the practice information systems business is to
provide superior total software and hardware integrated information solutions, backed by superior
customer support and education, to allow the veterinarian to practice better medicine and achieve
the practice’s business objectives. We differentiate our software systems through enhanced
functionality and ease of use. Our veterinary-specific digital radiography systems allow
veterinarians to capture digital radiographs with ease and without the use of hazardous chemicals.
The digital radiography systems also incorporate IDEXX-PACS™ picture archiving and communication
software developed by IDEXX that allows for image enhancement, manipulation, storage and retrieval,
and integration with the practice information software. Our strategy in digital radiography is to
offer a system that provides superior image quality and software capability at a competitive price,
backed by the same customer support provided for our other products and services in the Companion
Animal Group.

Pharmaceutical Products

. We currently offer pharmaceutical products to regulate feline
diabetes, eradicate internal parasites, and treat lameness in horses. Our pharmaceutical strategy
is to develop and commercialize proprietary pharmaceutical products for the veterinary market. We
seek to differentiate our pharmaceutical products through ease of use, which in turn enhances
customers’ compliance with prescribed treatment programs. Our product development efforts are
focused on applying superior and proprietary delivery technologies to existing pharmaceutical
compounds.

Water

Our strategy in the water testing business is to develop, manufacture, market and sell
proprietary products with superior performance, supported by exceptional customer service. Our
customers are primarily water utilities to whom strong relationships and customer support are very
important. Over the past several years, the rate of growth of this product line has slowed as a
result of market penetration by competitors and increased competition. International sales of water
testing products represented 45% of total water product sales in 2007, and we expect that future
growth in this business will be significantly dependent on our ability to increase international
sales. Growth also will be dependent on our ability to enhance and broaden our product line. Most
water microbiological testing is driven by regulation, and, in many countries, a test may not be
used for regulatory testing unless it has been approved by the applicable regulatory body. As a
result, we maintain an active regulatory program under which we are seeking regulatory approvals in
a number of countries, primarily in Europe.



Production Animal Segment

We develop, manufacture, market and sell a broad range of tests for various poultry, cattle
and swine diseases and conditions, and have an active research and development and in-licensing
program in this area. Our strategy is to offer proprietary tests with superior performance
characteristics. Disease outbreaks are episodic and unpredictable, and certain diseases that are
prevalent at one time may be substantially contained or eradicated at a later time. In response to
outbreaks, testing initiatives may lead to exceptional demand for certain products in certain
periods. Conversely, successful eradication programs may result in significantly decreased demand
for certain products. The performance of this business, therefore, can be subject to fluctuation.
In 2007, approximately 83% of our sales in this business were international. Because of the
significant dependence of this business on international
sales, the performance of the business is particularly subject to the various risks described
above that are associated with doing business internationally.

Other

Dairy

. Our strategy in the dairy testing business is to develop, manufacture and sell
antibiotic residue testing products that satisfy applicable regulatory requirements for testing of
bulk milk by producers and provide reliable field performance. The manufacture of these testing
products leverage, almost exclusively, the SNAP

®

platform as well as the production
equipment and lines of our rapid assay business, incorporating customized reagents for antibiotic
detection. To successfully increase sales of dairy testing products, we believe that we need to
increase penetration in geographies outside the U.S. and in the farm segment of the dairy market,
and to develop product line enhancements and extensions.

OPTI Medical Systems

. Our strategy in the OPTI Medical Systems business for the human
market is to develop, manufacture, and sell electrolyte and blood gas analyzers and related
consumable products for the medical point-of-care diagnostics market worldwide, with a focus on
small- to mid-sized hospitals. We seek to differentiate our products based on ease of use, menu,
convenience, international distribution and service, and instrument reliability. Similar to our
veterinary instruments and consumables strategy, a substantial portion of the revenues from this
product line is derived from the sale of consumables for use on the installed base of electrolyte
and blood gas analyzers. During the early stage of an instrument’s life cycle, relatively greater
revenues are derived from instrument placements, while consumable sales become relatively more
significant in later stages as the installed base of instruments increases and instrument placement
revenues begin to decline. Our long-term success in this area of our business is dependent upon new
customer acquisition, customer retention and increased customer utilization of existing and new
assays introduced on these instruments.

OPTI Medical Systems is also the supplier, including development and manufacturing, of our
VetStat

®

Analyzer, an instrument and consumable system that is a member of the IDEXX
VetLab for the veterinary market. In addition, OPTI Medical Systems provides the electrolyte module
and dry slide reagents that make up the electrolyte testing functionality of Catalyst Dx™. Our
strategy in the OPTI Medical Systems business for the veterinary market is to utilize this unit’s
know-how, intellectual property and manufacturing capability to continue to expand the menu and
instrument capability of the VetStat

®

Analyzer and Catalyst Dx™ platforms for veterinary
applications.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon
our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires us
to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues
and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we
evaluate our estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other
assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the
basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily
apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Note 2 to the
consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2007 describes the significant accounting policies used in preparation of these
consolidated financial statements.

We believe the following critical accounting estimates and assumptions may have a material
impact on reported financial condition and operating performance and involve significant levels of
judgment to account for highly uncertain matters or are susceptible to significant change.



Revenue Recognition

Customer programs

. We record estimated reductions to revenue in connection with
customer marketing programs and incentive offerings that may give customers credits or award
points. Award points may be applied to trade receivables owed to us and/or toward future purchases
of our products or services. We establish accruals for estimated revenue reductions attributable to
customer programs and incentive offerings for each program based on numerous factors, including:

•

program design and award levels;

•

forecasted purchasing patterns of those enrolled in the program based on historical
experience with similar programs, current sales trends and market analyses;

•

inventory levels of eligible products in the distribution channel; and

•

estimated number of participants that will ultimately reach volume purchase
thresholds.

Revenue reductions are recorded quarterly based on issuance of credits, points earned but not
yet issued, and estimates of credits and points to be earned in the future based on current
revenue. In our analysis, we utilize data supplied from distributors and collected in-house that
details the volume of qualifying products purchased as well as price paid per clinic
(“practice-level sales data”).

Our two most
significant customer programs are Practice

Our Practice Developer

®

program is a Companion Animal Group awards program that
permits customers to earn points by purchasing quarterly minimums in certain product and service
categories, including IDEXX Reference Laboratories services, VetTest

®

slides,
VetTest

®

Snapreader reagents, LaserCyte

®

tubes, Feline and Canine
SNAP

®

tests, and service and maintenance agreements. Points may then be applied against
the purchase price for IDEXX products and services purchased in the future or applied to trade
receivables due to us. SUTS is our volume incentive program for selected SNAP

®

tests
that provides customers with benefits in the form of (1) discounts off invoice at the time of
purchase and (2) points under the Practice Developer

®

program awarded quarterly
throughout the SUTS program year (which ends on August 31) based on total purchase volume of
qualified SNAP

®

products during the year.

For the Practice Developer program, the accrued revenue reduction is calculated each quarter
based on sales to end users during the quarter by either us or our distributors and on our estimate
of future points to be issued upon sale of applicable product inventories held by distributors at
the end of the quarter. As points are redeemed we recognize the benefit of points expected to
expire, or breakage, using historical forfeiture rates. On November 30 of each year, unused points
granted before January 1 of the prior year expire and any variance from the breakage estimate is
accounted for as a change in estimate.

Under the SUTS program, commencing September 1, 2007, customers receive a 5% rebate of their
purchase price if they purchase a minimum volume of products, either from us or our distributors.
We cannot be certain what percentage of customers will purchase the minimum volume of products
until that program year has ended. At the beginning of the program year, we develop an estimate of
the percentage of customers that we expect to meet the minimum purchase threshold over the program
period based on program enrollee purchasing patterns, historical experience with similar programs,
current sales trends, and marketing analysis. The percentage of customers expected to meet the
minimum purchase threshold is adjusted quarterly during the program year based on our experience
with the program and finalized when the program year ends in August. The 5% revenue reduction is
calculated quarterly based on the applicable gross sales during the period, at end-user prices, and
the estimated percentage of end users that are expected to meet the minimum purchase threshold by
the end of the program year. The accrued revenue reduction also includes our estimate of future
points to be issued upon sale of applicable product inventories held by distributors at the end of
the quarter.

If the estimated percentage of customers expected to meet the minimum purchase threshold
required to receive the 5% rebate under the SUTS program were to increase or decrease by 5%, we
would be required to further reduce revenue or increase revenue, respectively, by $0.1 million.

Doubtful accounts receivable

. We recognize revenue only in those situations where
collection from the customer is reasonably assured. We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts
for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. We
base our estimates on detailed analysis of specific customer situations and a percentage of our
accounts receivable by aging category. If the financial condition of our customers were to
deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances
might be required. Account balances are charged off against the allowance when we believe the
receivable will not be recovered. Write-offs of customer accounts during the years ended December
31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, were $0.7 million, $0.5 million and $0.4 million, respectively.

Inventory Valuation

We write down inventory for estimated obsolescence when warranted by estimates of future
demand, market conditions, and remaining shelf life. If actual market conditions are less favorable
than those we estimated, additional inventory write-downs may be required, which would have a
negative effect on results of operations. Certain major components of inventory for which we have
made critical valuation judgments are discussed in more detail below.

LaserCyte

®

Hematology Analyzer

. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, $2.7
million and $1.7 million, respectively, of inventory associated with our LaserCyte

®

hematology instrument required rework before it could be used to manufacture finished goods, which
was net of $1.7 million and $0.9 million, respectively, of write-downs for inventory estimated to
be obsolete. We determined write-downs based on our estimate of the costs to rework inventory
compared to replacement cost and the probability of success, primarily based on historical
experience. We expect to fully realize our net investment in this inventory. However, if we are
unsuccessful reworking this inventory, if we revise our judgment of our ability to successfully
rework inventory due to new experience in
reworking this inventory, or if we alter the design of this product, we may be required to
write off some or all of the remaining associated inventory.



Nitazoxanide

. At December 31, 2006, our inventories included $9.3 million of
inventory associated with Navigator

®

, our nitazoxanide product for the treatment of
equine protozoal myeloencephalitis. This inventory consisted of $0.2 million of finished goods and
$9.1 million of active ingredient and other raw materials. We have an agreement with our supplier
of nitazoxanide under which the supplier agreed until 2017 to replace any expiring inventory of
nitazoxanide with longer-dated material. During 2007, we recognized a write-down of nitazoxanide
raw materials inventory of $9.1 million and a write-off of a prepaid royalty license of $1.0
million associated with Navigator

®

. Our analysis of the realizability of these assets
was triggered upon our receipt of notice from the third-party contract manufacturer of finished
goods that it would discontinue manufacturing the product in 2009. Because of the low production
volume of Navigator

®

, we believed that we would not be able to enter into a replacement
manufacturing arrangement on economically feasible terms, and therefore we would not be able to
obtain the product after termination of the existing manufacturing arrangement. Accordingly, we
evaluated our associated inventory for obsolescence based on our changed estimates of product
availability and estimated future demand and market conditions. This inventory comprised $9.1
million of active ingredient and other raw materials, for which we recognized a full write-down
during 2007. At December 31, 2007, this inventory, net of reserves, comprised less than $0.1
million of finished goods. Sales of Navigator

®

were $0.4 million for the year ended
December 31, 2007.

Valuation of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

A significant portion of the purchase price for acquired businesses is assigned to intangible
assets. Intangible assets other than goodwill are initially valued at the lesser of fair value or,
if applicable, fair value proportionately reduced by the excess of the fair value of acquired net
assets over the purchase price (collectively, “fair value”) of the acquired business. If a market
value is not readily available, the fair value of the intangible asset is estimated based on
discounted cash flows using market participant assumptions, which are assumptions that are not
specific to IDEXX. The selection of appropriate valuation methodologies and the estimation of
discounted cash flows require significant assumptions about the timing and amounts of future cash
flows, risks, appropriate discount rates, and the useful lives of intangible assets. When deemed
appropriate by management, we utilize independent valuation experts to advise and assist us in
allocating the purchase prices for acquired businesses to the fair values of the identified
intangible assets and in determining appropriate amortization methods and periods for those
intangible assets. Goodwill is initially valued based on the excess of the purchase price of a
business combination over the fair values of acquired net assets.

We assess goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances indicate an
impairment may exist, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No.
142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” (“SFAS No. 142”). For impairment testing, the fair
values of the reporting units that include goodwill are estimated using a discounted cash flow
approach. The cash flows used contain our best estimates, using appropriate and customary
assumptions and projections at the time. Because our pharmaceutical business is still substantially
in an investment stage, the determination of the fair value of this business unit requires
significant assumptions about the timing and amounts of the unit’s future cash flows, including
assumptions about the markets for our products and proprietary technologies, the future success of
research and development activities, the attainment and timing of regulatory approvals to
manufacture and sell new products, the introduction and success of competitive products by other
market participants, and other business risks. Changes in forecast cash flows or the discount rate
would affect the estimated fair values of reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment
charge in a future period. However, a 25% decrease in the current estimated fair value of any of
our reporting units would not result in a goodwill impairment charge for any of our reporting units
that include goodwill. No impairments were identified as a result of the annual or event-driven
reviews during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 or 2005.

We assessed goodwill attributable to our pharmaceutical business for impairment at June 30,
2007 due to the matters discussed above and the resulting Nitazoxanide inventory write-down and
prepaid royalty license impairment charge. The goodwill attributable to our pharmaceutical business
of $13.7 million was not impaired at June 30, 2007, or subsequently, when evaluated as part of the
annual assessment.



We assess the realizability of intangible assets other than goodwill whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with
SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets” (“SFAS No. 144”). If
an impairment review is triggered, we evaluate the carrying value of intangible assets based on
estimated undiscounted future cash flows
over the remaining useful life of the assets and comparing that value to the carrying value of
the assets. The cash flows that are used contain our best estimates, using appropriate and
customary assumptions and projections at the time. No impairments were identified during the years
ended December 31, 2006 or 2005.

During 2007, we recognized an impairment charge to write off a prepaid royalty license of $1.0
million associated with Navigator

®

paste. We also recognized a related inventory
write-down and the circumstances are described in the above discussion of critical accounting
estimates and assumptions used in inventory valuation and in Note 6 to the consolidated financial
statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on our changed estimates of product
availability and estimated future demand and market conditions, we determined that we would not
realize our investment in prepaid royalties and, therefore, fully expensed this asset. No other
impairments were identified during the year ended December 31, 2007.

Share-Based Compensation

We adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS No. 123(R)”) on
January 1, 2006. Beginning in 2006, we modified our share-based employee compensation programs to
shift from the grant of stock options and employee stock purchase rights only to the grant of a mix
of restricted stock units and stock options, along with employee stock purchase rights. There were
no modifications to the terms of outstanding options during 2007 or 2006.

In connection with the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), we adopted the straight-line method to
prospectively expense share-based awards granted subsequent to December 31, 2005. The
graded-vesting, or accelerated, method has been used to calculate the expense for stock options
granted prior to January 1, 2006. If the total fair value of share-based compensation awards, as
well as other features that impact expense, including forfeitures and capitalization of costs, was
consistent from year-to-year in each of the last five years and through 2010, this change in
expense method from graded-vesting to straight-line expensing would yield decreasing annual expense
through 2010 until awards granted prior to January 1, 2006 were fully expensed. However, the total
fair value of future awards may vary significantly from past awards based on a number of factors,
including our share-based award practices. Therefore, share-based compensation expense is likely to
fluctuate, possibly significantly, from year to year.

The fair value of options, restricted stock units, deferred stock units with vesting
conditions, and employee stock purchase rights awarded during the years ended December 31, 2007,
2006 and 2005 totaled $18.2 million, $11.9 million and $15.7 million, respectively. The total
unrecognized compensation cost for unvested share-based compensation awards outstanding at December
31, 2007, before consideration of estimated forfeitures, was $24.2 million. The weighted average
remaining expense recognition period is approximately 2.0 years.

The weighted average valuation assumptions used to determine the fair value of each option
grant on the date of grant were as follows:

We use the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model to determine the fair value of options
granted. Option-pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, particularly for
the expected stock price volatility and the expected term of options. Changes in the subjective
input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate. Our expected stock price
volatility assumptions are based on the historical volatility of our stock over periods that are
similar to the expected terms of grants and other relevant factors. Lower estimated volatility
reduces the fair value of an option. The total fair value of options awarded during the year ended
December 31, 2007 ($7.4 million) would have increased or
decreased by approximately 7% if the stock price volatility assumption were increased or decreased by 10%,
respectively. The total cost recognized for options awarded during the year ended December 31, 2007
would have increased or decreased by $0.1 million if the stock price volatility assumption were
increased or decreased by 10%, respectively.



To develop the expected term assumption for 2007 and 2006 option awards, we elected to use the
simplified method described in the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
107, which is based on vesting and contractual terms. The application of the simplified method is
allowable for options granted through December 31, 2007. We will transition to developing expected
term assumptions for future awards based on historical experience and other relevant factors
concerning expected employee behavior with regard to option exercise. Longer expected term
assumptions increase the fair value of option awards, and therefore increase the expense recognized
per award. The total fair value of options awarded during the year ended December 31, 2007 ($7.4
million) would have increased by approximately 12% or decreased by approximately 9% if the
expected term assumption were increased or decreased by one year, respectively. The total cost
recognized for options awarded during the year ended December 31, 2007 would have increased by $0.2
million or decreased by $0.1 million if the expected term assumption were increased or decreased by
one year, respectively.

Share-based compensation expense is based on the number of awards ultimately expected to vest
and is, therefore, reduced for an estimate of the number of awards that are expected to be
forfeited. The forfeiture estimates are based on historical data and other factors, and
compensation expense is adjusted for actual results. At December 31, 2007, we applied annual
forfeiture rates ranging from 4% to 16% to estimate future forfeitures of previously granted
options and restricted stock units that had vesting dates after December 31, 2007. Net share-based
compensation costs for the year ended December 31, 2007 were $8.6 million, which is net of a
reduction of $2.0 million for estimated forfeitures. Changes in estimated forfeiture rates and
differences between estimated forfeiture rates and actual experience may result in significant,
unanticipated increases or decreases in share-based compensation expense from period to period. The
termination of employment by certain employees who hold large numbers of share-based compensation
instruments may also have a significant, unanticipated impact on forfeiture experience and,
therefore, on share-based compensation expense.

Income Taxes

We recognize a current tax liability or asset for current taxes payable or refundable,
respectively, and a deferred tax liability or asset, as the case may be, for the estimated future
tax effects of temporary differences between book and tax treatment of assets and liabilities and
carryforwards to the extent they are realizable.

The future tax benefit arising from net deductible temporary differences and tax
carryforwards, net of valuation allowances, was $15.4 million and $12.9 million at December 31,
2007 and 2006, respectively. We believe that our earnings during the periods when the temporary
differences become deductible will be sufficient to realize the related future tax benefits. Should
we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the
future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such
determination was made. A reduction of net income before taxes in each subsidiary equal to 5% of
revenue, compared to the corresponding reported amounts for the year ended December 31, 2007, would
not result in the recognition of incremental valuation allowances except in one subsidiary where a
5% reduction could result in our recording a valuation allowance of $0.7 million for that
subsidiary.

For those jurisdictions where the expiration date of tax carryforwards or the projected
operating results indicate that realization is not likely, a valuation allowance is recorded to
offset the deferred tax asset within that jurisdiction. In assessing the need for a valuation
allowance, we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning
strategies. In the event that we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred
tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax
asset would increase income in the period such determination was made. Similarly, a determination
that a higher valuation allowance is required would decrease income in the period such
determination was made.



Our net deductible temporary differences and tax carryforwards are recorded using the enacted
tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax liability or
asset is expected to be settled or realized. Should the expected applicable tax rates change in the
future, an adjustment to the net deferred tax asset would be credited or charged, as appropriate,
to income in the period such determination was made. For example, an increase of one percentage
point in our anticipated U.S. state income tax rate would cause us to increase our net deferred tax
asset balance by $0.5 million. This increase in the net deferred asset would increase net income in
the period that our rate was adjusted. Likewise, a decrease of one percentage point to our
anticipated U.S. state income tax rate would have the opposite effect.

We periodically assess our exposures related to our worldwide provision for income taxes and
believe that we have appropriately accrued taxes for contingencies. Any reduction of these
contingent liabilities or additional assessment would increase or decrease income, respectively, in
the period such determination was made.

We consider certain operating earnings of non-United States subsidiaries to be indefinitely
invested outside the U.S. The cumulative earnings of these subsidiaries was $129.6 million at
December 31, 2007. No provision has been made for U.S. federal and state, or international taxes
that may result from future remittances of these undistributed earnings of non-United States
subsidiaries. Should we repatriate these earnings in the future, we would have to adjust the income
tax provision in the period in which the decision to repatriate earnings is made. For the operating
earnings not considered to be indefinitely invested outside the United States we have accrued taxes
on a current basis.

Estimates for Certain Contingencies

Under our workers’ compensation insurance policies for U.S. employees since January 1, 2003,
we have retained the first $250,000 in claim liability per incident and aggregate claim liability
based on payroll for each year. The insurance company provides insurance for claims above the
individual occurrence and aggregate limits. We estimate claim liability based on claims incurred
and the estimated ultimate cost to settle the claims. Claims incurred during the year ended
December 31, 2007 and year ended December 31, 2006 are relatively new and significant additional
healthcare and wage indemnification costs could arise from those claims. Our liability for claims
incurred during the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 could exceed our estimates and we could
be liable for up to $2.5 million and $1.0 million, respectively, in excess of the expense we have
recognized. For the three years ended on or prior to December 31, 2005, based on our retained claim
liability per incident and our aggregate claim liability, our maximum liability at December 31,
2007 is $0.4 million in excess of the amounts deemed probable and previously recognized.



RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2007 Compared to Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2006

Revenue

Total Company.

Revenue increased $183.4 million, or 25%, to $922.6 million for the year ended
December 31, 2007 from $739.1 million for the prior year. Incremental sales from businesses and
from customer-related and other intangible assets acquired subsequent to January 1, 2006
contributed 8% to revenue growth. These acquisitions consisted primarily of veterinary reference
laboratories and customer-related assets in Canada, the United States, Europe and South Africa;
intellectual property and distribution rights of a veterinary diagnostics business; a production
animal diagnostic products business in France; and the Critical Care Division of Osmetech plc. The
favorable impact of currency exchange rates contributed 3% to revenue growth. The following table

The following revenue analysis reflects the results of operations net of the impact of
currency exchange rates on sales outside the U.S. and net of incremental sales from businesses and
from customer-related and other intangible assets acquired subsequent to January 1, 2006.

Because our instrument consumables, rapid assay products, and pharmaceutical products are sold
in the U.S. and certain other geographies by distributors, distributor purchasing dynamics have an
impact on our reported sales of these products. Distributors purchase products from us and sell
them to veterinary practices, who are the end users. Distributor purchasing dynamics may be
affected by many factors and may be unrelated to underlying end-user demand for our products. As a
result, fluctuations in distributors’ inventories may cause reported results in a period not to be
representative of underlying end-user demand. Therefore, we believe it is important to track
distributor sales to end users and to distinguish between the impact of end-user demand and the
impact of distributor purchasing dynamics on reported revenue growth.

Where growth rates are affected by changes in end-user demand, we refer to the impact of
practice-level sales on growth. Where growth rates are affected by distributor purchasing dynamics,
we refer to the impact of changes in distributors’ inventories. If during the comparable period of
the prior year, distributors’ inventories grew by more than those inventories grew in the current
year, then changes in distributors’ inventories have a negative impact on our reported sales growth
in the current period. Conversely, if during the comparable period of the prior year, distributors’
inventories grew by less than those inventories grew in the current year, then changes in
distributors’ inventories have a positive impact on our reported sales growth in the current
period.

The increase in sales of instruments and consumables was due mainly to higher unit sales
volume. Higher consumables sales volumes were attributable primarily to higher worldwide
practice-level sales of slides and, to a lesser extent, to increased practice-level sales of tubes
used with our hematology analyzers, with all consumables categories benefiting from the continued
growth of our installed base of instruments. Sales volumes of consumables also benefited from
temporary additional diagnostic testing volume related to the recall of certain pet foods in
mid-March 2007 in the U.S. and Canada. We believe that the recall resulted in a higher than usual
number of pet visits to veterinary clinics in North America in the first and second quarters of
2007. Higher instrument sales revenue resulted mainly from increased sales of our
LaserCyte

®

Hematology Analyzer and, to a lesser extent, our IDEXX VetLab

®

Station, an in-clinic laboratory information management system. The impact from changes in U.S.
distributors’ inventory levels reduced reported instruments and consumables revenue growth by less
than 1%.

The increase in practice-level sales of rapid assay products was due to both higher average
unit sales prices and higher sales volumes. Higher average unit sales prices were due, in part, to
higher relative sales of canine combination test products, such as the SNAP

®

4Dx

®

, which was launched in the U.S. in September 2006, and less promotional
discounting in connection with our SNAP

®

up the Savings™ and other customer programs. We
expect the rate of end users’ conversion from canine heartworm-only tests to combination test
products and, therefore, the rate of increase of average unit sales prices, will lessen in future
periods. Higher sales volumes resulted in part from the July 2007 launch of the SNAP

®

cPL™, our test for pancreatitis in dogs. Effective January 2008, we changed our distribution
methods in Japan from a combination of direct sales and the use of multiple distributors to an
exclusive distribution arrangement for our rapid assay products and instrument consumables. The
impact from the distributor’s initial stocking orders to build inventory levels increased reported
revenue growth by 1%. The impact from changes in U.S. distributors’ inventory levels reduced
reported rapid assay revenue growth by 4%.

The increase in sales of laboratory and consulting services resulted primarily from higher
testing volume and, to a lesser extent, the impact of price increases. Higher testing volume was
attributable to both new customers and to increased testing volume from existing customers, and
benefited from temporary additional diagnostic testing volume resulting from the March 2007 pet
food recall, as discussed above, and from new test offerings.

The increase in sales of practice information management systems and digital radiography
resulted primarily from higher sales volumes of companion animal and equine radiography systems,
higher sales of Cornerstone

®

practice information management systems and services, and
the favorable impact of implementing tiered support service level offerings with differentiated
pricing for our practice information management systems, partly offset by lower average unit prices
for radiography systems due to increased competition.



The increase in sales of pharmaceutical products resulted primarily from higher sales volume
and price increases, in each case related largely to PZI VET

®

, our insulin product for
the treatment of diabetic cats.

Water.

Revenue for Water increased $7.8 million, or 13%, to $66.2 million for the year ended
December 31, 2007 from $58.5 million for the prior year. The increase resulted primarily from
higher worldwide sales volume, partly offset by lower average unit sales prices due to both higher
relative sales in geographies where products are sold at lower average unit sales prices and
greater price competition in certain geographies. Higher sales volumes resulted in part from our
commencement in September 2007 of distribution of certain water testing kits manufactured by
Invitrogen Corporation (“Invitrogen”), which increased reported Water revenue growth by 2%. The
favorable impact of currency exchange rates contributed 4% to the increase in Water revenue.

Production Animal Segment.

Revenue for PAS increased $16.1 million, or 27%, to $75.1 million
for the year ended December 31, 2007 from $58.9 million for the prior year. The increase resulted
primarily from higher livestock diagnostics sales volume, including sales attributable to Institut
Pourquier, a manufacturer of production animal diagnostic products in France that we acquired in
March 2007. Sales of Pourquier products contributed 12% to PAS revenue growth. The favorable impact
of higher sales volume was partly offset by lower average unit sales prices for our HerdChek

®

products that test for transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (“TSEs”) due to both greater
price competition and higher relative sales in geographies where products are sold at lower average
unit sales prices. The favorable impact of currency exchange rates contributed 7% to the increase
in PAS revenue.

Other.

Revenue for Other operating units increased $13.4 million, or 87%, to $28.8 million for
the year ended December 31, 2007 from $15.4 million for the prior year due primarily to incremental
revenue attributable to OPTI Medical, which was acquired in January 2007.

Gross Profit

Total Company.

Gross profit increased $84.0 million, or 22%, to $463.5 million for the year
ended December 31, 2007 from $379.5 million for the prior year. As a percentage of total revenue,
gross profit decreased to 50% from 51%.

During 2007, we recognized a write-down of nitazoxanide raw materials inventory of $9.1
million and a write-off of a prepaid royalty license of $1.0 million associated with
Navigator

®

, which resulted in an unfavorable impact of 1.1% of total company gross
profit for the year ended December 31, 2007. These write-downs are included in cost of product
revenue in the consolidated statement of operations. Our analysis of the realizability of these
assets was triggered upon our receipt of notice from the third-party contract manufacturer of
finished goods that it would discontinue manufacturing the product in 2009. Because of the low
production volume of Navigator

®

, we believed that we would not be able to enter into a
replacement manufacturing arrangement on economically feasible terms, and therefore we would not be
able to obtain the product after termination of the existing manufacturing arrangement.
Accordingly, we evaluated our associated inventory for obsolescence based on our changed estimates
of product availability and estimated future demand and market conditions.

Share-based compensation expense of $0.7 million was included in cost of revenue for the year
ended December 31, 2007, compared to $1.1 million for the prior year. Beginning in 2007, we
allocate share-based compensation expense to the operating segments based on headcount and other
personnel data. This allocation differs from the actual expense and consequently yields a
difference between the total allocated share-based compensation expense and the actual expense for
the total company, which was categorized as “unallocated amounts.” Share-based compensation expense
was not allocated to our operating segments in 2006. Therefore, the total company share-based
compensation expense was categorized as “unallocated amounts” for the year ended December 31, 2006.

Companion Animal Group.

Gross profit for CAG increased $65.2 million, or 22%, to $363.2
million for the year ended December 31, 2007 from $298.0 million for the prior year due primarily
to increased sales volume across the CAG product and service lines, partly offset by a decrease in
gross profit percentage to 48% from 49%. The write-down of pharmaceutical inventory and the related
prepaid royalty impairment charge, discussed above, resulted in an unfavorable impact of 1.4% of
CAG revenue. Greater relative sales of lower margin products and services, such as laboratory and
consulting services and IDEXX VetLab

®

instruments, also contributed to the decrease in
the gross profit percentage. These unfavorable impacts were partly offset by higher relative sales
of our canine combination test product, SNAP

®

4Dx

®

and, to a lesser extent,
all other CAG product and service lines, except in the Digital Radiography business; lower cost of
slides that are sold for use in VetTest

®

Chemistry Analyzers; and the favorable impact
of foreign currency rates on sales denominated in those currencies, net of foreign exchange hedge
contract losses.

Water.

Gross profit for Water increased $3.2 million, or 8%, to $41.7 million for the year
ended December 31, 2007 from $38.4 million for the prior year due to higher sales volume, partly
offset by a decrease in the gross profit percentage to 63% from 66%. The decrease in gross profit
percentage was due primarily to higher manufacturing costs; lower average unit sales prices, and
greater relative sales of lower margin products, which was primarily due to the lower gross margin
earned on certain water testing kits manufactured by Invitrogen Corporation (“Invitrogen”) that we
began distributing in September 2007.

Production Animal Segment.

Gross profit for PAS increased $8.1 million, or 21%, to $46.7
million for the year ended December 31, 2007 from $38.7 million for the prior year due to increased
sales volume, partly offset by a decrease in the gross profit percentage to 62% from 66%. The gross
profit percentage was unfavorably impacted by lower average unit sales prices; net higher
production costs; the effect of purchase accounting for inventory acquired in connection with the
Pourquier business acquisition; and a relatively lower gross profit rate realized on sales by
Pourquier, largely offset by greater relative sales of higher margin products, exclusive of the
impact of the Pourquier business. The gross profit percentage earned on sales by Pourquier,
excluding the impact of purchase accounting, was lower than our historical PAS gross profit rate
due to greater price competition in the primary markets served by Pourquier. Additionally, purchase
accounting for inventory had an unfavorable impact of 0.8% of PAS revenue because finished goods
inventory acquired in connection with a business acquisition are assigned a fair value that exceeds
replacement cost, which results in a low gross margin on the sale of those finished goods by the
acquirer. Additionally, decreases in the gross profit percentage were partly offset by the
favorable impact of foreign currency rates on sales denominated in those currencies, net of foreign
exchange hedge contract losses.

Other.

Gross profit for Other operating units increased $5.3 million, or 86%, to $11.4 million
for the year ended December 31, 2007 from $6.1 million for the prior year due primarily to
incremental revenue attributable to OPTI Medical, which resulted in incremental gross profit for
the Other operating units. Excluding the acquisition of OPTI Medical, the gross profit percentage
was 38% for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 40% for the prior year. The decrease in
the gross profit percentage was due to lower average unit sales prices for certain Dairy products
and higher manufacturing and distribution costs, partly offset by the favorable impact of the
effect of foreign currency rates on sales denominated in those currencies.



Operating Expenses and Operating Income

Total Company.

Total operating expenses increased $75.7 million, or 30%, to $327.3 million for
the year ended December 31, 2007 from $251.6 million for the prior year. As a percentage of
revenue, operating expenses increased to 35% from 34%.

Share-based compensation expense of $7.9 million was included in operating expenses for the
year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $9.0 million for the prior year. Beginning in 2007, we
allocate share-based compensation expense to the operating segments, as discussed above. The total
company share-based compensation expense was categorized as “unallocated amounts” for the year
ended December 31, 2006.

Operating income increased $8.3 million, or 6%, to $136.2 million for the year ended December
31, 2007 from $127.9 million for the prior year. As a percentage of revenue, operating income
decreased to 15% from 17%.

The increase in sales and marketing expense resulted primarily from higher personnel-related
costs due, in part, to expanded worldwide sales, marketing and customer service support resources
and higher sales commissions as a result of revenue performance. Additionally, the unfavorable
impact of exchange rates on foreign currency denominated expenses, the inclusion of share-based
compensation expense, and incremental expenses associated with businesses acquired subsequent to
January 1, 2006 also contributed to the increase in sales and marketing expense.



The increase in general and administrative expense resulted primarily from higher
personnel-related costs due, in part, to expanded resources and spending on information technology,
facilities, and other general support functions. To a lesser extent, the inclusion of share-based
compensation expense; incremental expenses associated with businesses acquired subsequent to
January 1, 2006, comprised mainly of administrative expenses of a recurring nature to support the
acquired businesses and amortization expense for intangible assets acquired; and the unfavorable
impact of exchange rates on foreign currency denominated expenses also contributed to the increase
in general and administrative expense.

The increase in research and development expense resulted primarily from increased product
development spending, including additional professional resources, related primarily to IDEXX
VetLab

®

instrumentation and rapid assay products. To a lesser extent, product
development activities in all other CAG product and service categories and the inclusion of
share-based compensation expense also contributed to the increases in research and development
expense.

Water.

Operating expenses for Water increased $2.1 million, or 17%, to $14.8 million for the
year ended December 31, 2007 from $12.7 million for the prior year and, as a percentage of revenue,
were approximately constant at 22%. Share-based compensation expense of $0.4 million, or 0.6% of
revenue, was included in Water operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2007. The

The increase in sales and marketing expense resulted primarily from higher personnel-related
costs due, in part, to expanded headcount and, to a lesser extent, the unfavorable impact of
exchange rates on foreign currency denominated expenses. The increase in general and administrative
expense resulted primarily from the inclusion of share-based compensation expense and higher
spending on information technology, facilities, and other general support functions, partly offset
by the favorable comparison due to costs incurred during the third quarter of 2006 to consolidate
our office and production facilities based in the United Kingdom into a single facility and other
net cost reductions. The increase in research and development expense resulted primarily from
higher costs associated with coliform and

E. coli

water test product development.

The increase in sales and marketing expense resulted primarily from incremental activities
associated with the Pourquier business, higher personnel-related costs, and, to a lesser extent,
the unfavorable impact of exchange rates on foreign currency denominated expenses. The increase in
general and administrative expense resulted primarily from incremental expenses associated with the
Pourquier business, comprised mainly of administrative expenses of a recurring nature to support
the acquired business and amortization expense for intangible assets, and
higher spending on information technology, facilities, and other general support functions. To
a lesser extent, the unfavorable impact of exchange rates on foreign currency denominated expenses
and the inclusion of share-based compensation expense also contributed to the increase in general
and administrative expense. These increases were partly offset by a favorable comparison due to the
write-off, in the second quarter of 2006, of certain fixed assets located in our facility in China.
The increase in research and development expense resulted primarily from higher development
activities and associated higher personnel-related costs, including incremental development
activities attributable to the Pourquier business acquired in March 2007, and, to a lesser extent,
the inclusion of share-based compensation expense.

Other.

Operating expenses for Other operating units increased $7.2 million to $11.5 million
for the year ended December 31, 2007 from $4.3 million for the prior year due primarily to
incremental expenses attributable to OPTI Medical, which was acquired in January 2007. These costs
are mainly composed of operating expenses of a recurring nature to support the OPTI Medical
business and amortization expense for intangible assets acquired. Share-based compensation expense
of $0.3 million, or 1.0% of revenue, was included in Other operating expenses for the year ended
December 31, 2007.

Unallocated Amounts.

Operating expenses that are not allocated to our operating segments
decreased $7.0 million to $7.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 from $14.9 million for
the prior year. As described above, share-based compensation expense was not allocated to our
operating segments in 2006. Therefore, total company share-based compensation expense included in
operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2006 of $9.0 million was categorized as
“unallocated amounts.” Beginning in 2007, we allocate a portion of share-based compensation expense
to the operating segments. The unallocated share-based compensation expense for the year ended
December 31, 2007 was $0.5 million. Corporate research and development expense was also included in
“unallocated amounts” for both periods and grew mainly due to personnel additions in 2007 to
support increased long-term product development activities.

Interest Income and Interest Expense

Interest income was $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to $3.3 million
for the year ended December 31, 2006. The decrease in interest income was due primarily to lower
invested cash balances, partly offset by higher effective interest rates.

Interest expense was $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to $0.5
million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in interest expense was due primarily to
interest expense incurred on borrowings under a revolving credit facility.

Provision for Income Taxes

Our effective income tax rate was 30.3% for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 28.4% for the
year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in tax rate is primarily attributable to several
non-recurring items that benefited the tax rate in the year ended December 31, 2006. These 2006
items included the resolution of an income tax audit for years ended December 31, 2003 and 2004, a
reduction of previously recorded deferred tax liabilities as a result of obtaining certain
multi-year tax incentives and the release of a valuation allowance on international deferred tax
assets as a result of a foreign subsidiary demonstrating consistent sustained profitability.
Offsetting the impact of the items occurring in 2006 were several favorable impacts to our rate
that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2007. These items included an increase in certain
federal tax incentives due to changes in legislation, tax benefits related to reductions in
international rates, and the recognition of state tax benefits resulting from the completion of an
audit.



We anticipate recognizing approximately $0.5 million of income tax benefits that have not been
recognized at December 31, 2007 in accordance with FASB Interpretation (“FIN”) No. 48, “Accounting
for Uncertainty in Income Taxes” (“FIN 48”). The income tax benefits are primarily due to the lapse
in the statute of limitations for various foreign and state tax jurisdictions.

The following revenue analysis reflects the results of operations net of the impact of
currency exchange rates on sales outside the U.S.

The increase in sales of instruments and consumables was due mainly to higher unit sales
volume of both instruments and of consumables and, to a lesser extent, to higher average unit sales
prices for slides that are sold for use in VetTest

®

Chemistry Analyzers. Higher
consumables sales volumes were attributable primarily to higher worldwide practice-level sales of
slides and, to a lesser extent, to increased U.S. practice-level sales of tubes used with our
hematology analyzers, with all consumables categories benefiting from the continued growth of our
installed base of instruments. Higher instrument sales volume resulted mainly from sales of
VetStat

®

Electrolyte and Blood Gas Analyzers and, to a lesser extent,
LaserCyte

®

Hematology Analyzers and SNAP

®

Readers. The impact from changes in
distributors’ inventory levels had no significant impact on reported revenue growth of instruments
and consumables.

The increase in sales of rapid assay products was due primarily to increased sales volume of
canine products, including sales of SNAP

®

4Dx

®

, which was launched in the U.S.
in September 2006. The impact from changes in distributors’ inventory levels increased reported
rapid assay revenue growth by 3%. To a lesser extent, higher average unit sales prices of canine
products, in part due to less promotional discounting and higher relative sales of combination test
products, also contributed to rapid assay revenue growth. These increases were partly offset by
lower average unit sales prices of feline products, partly due to greater promotional discounting.
Incremental sales of rapid assay products for which we acquired distribution rights in the second
quarter of 2006 contributed 2% to rapid assay revenue growth.

The increase in sales of laboratory and consulting services resulted primarily from higher
testing volume and, to a lesser extent, the impact of price increases and incremental sales
attributable to acquisitions between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2006. Businesses acquired
since January 1, 2005 contributed 4% to laboratory and consulting services revenue growth.

The increase in sales of practice information management systems and digital radiography
resulted primarily from an increase in the number of digital radiography systems sold. Digital
radiography sales volume growth was due primarily to sales attributable to a business acquired in
the third quarter of 2005, which contributed 12% to practice information management systems and
digital radiography revenue growth; higher sales volumes of existing products; and sales of the
IDEXX-DR™ 1417 Digital Radiography System, which became commercially available during the third
quarter of 2006. To a lesser extent, revenue growth was also due to the impact of price increases
for support services for our practice information management systems, higher sales of computer
hardware to practice information management systems customers, and a shift in sales mix to larger
practice information management systems.

The increase in sales of pharmaceutical products resulted primarily from increased
practice-level demand and, to a lesser extent, from price increases, both impacts related largely
to PZI VET

®

, our insulin product for the treatment of diabetic cats.

Water.

Revenue for Water increased $1.7 million, or 3%, to $58.5 million for the year ended
December 31, 2006 from $56.8 million for the prior year. The increase resulted primarily from
higher sales volume in the Americas and Europe and, to a lesser extent, to higher average unit
sales prices. The favorable impact of currency exchange rates contributed an aggregate of $0.5
million, or 1%, to the increase in Water revenue.

Production Animal Segment.

Revenue for PAS increased $14.0 million, or 31%, to $58.9 million
for the year ended December 31, 2006 from $44.9 million for the prior year. The increase resulted
primarily from higher worldwide livestock diagnostics sales volume, including, notably, sales in
Europe of our HerdChek

®

products that test for transmissible spongiform
encephalopathies. To a lesser extent, increased average unit sales prices in certain geographies,
higher relative sales in geographies where products are sold at higher unit prices, and higher
poultry diagnostics sales volume in the Americas also contributed to production animal products
revenue growth. The favorable impact of currency exchange rates contributed an aggregate of $0.4
million, or 1%, to the increase in PAS revenue.



Gross Profit

Total Company.

Gross profit increased $56.6 million, or 18%, to $379.5 million for the year
ended December 31, 2006 from $322.9 million for the prior year. As a percentage of total revenue,
gross profit was approximately constant at 51%.

We adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R) and began expensing share-based compensation
beginning on January 1, 2006, which had a negative impact on our gross profit percentages and on
operating margins

.

For the year ended December 31, 2006, share-based compensation expense was not
allocated to our operating segments and therefore has been categorized as “unallocated amounts.”

Companion Animal Group.

Gross profit for CAG increased $47.6 million, or 19%, to $298.0
million for the year ended December 31, 2006 from $250.4 million for the prior year due primarily
to increased sales volume across the CAG product lines and, to a lesser extent, to an increase in
the gross profit percentage to 49% from 48% for the prior year. The increase in the gross profit
percentage was largely due to lower cost of slides that are sold for use in VetTest

®

Chemistry Analyzers under the agreement with our supplier and higher average selling prices. The
increase in the gross profit percentage was partly offset by greater relative sales of lower margin
products and services such as laboratory and consulting services.

Water.

Gross profit for Water increased $0.2 million to $38.4 million for the year ended
December 31, 2006 from $38.3 million for the prior year due to higher sales volume, partly offset
by a decrease in the gross profit percentage to 66% from 67%. The gross profit percentage was
unfavorably impacted by increased freight and distribution costs and higher relative sales of lower
margin products.

Production Animal Segment.

Gross profit for PAS increased $10.9 million, or 39%, to $38.7
million for the year ended December 31, 2006 from $27.8 million for the prior year due primarily to
increased sales volume and, to a lesser extent, to an increase in the gross profit percentage to
66% from 62%. The gross profit percentage was favorably impacted by higher relative sales of higher
margin livestock products, the absence in 2006 of certain discrete costs that occurred in 2005, and
higher average unit sales prices. Discrete costs in 2005 comprised integration costs and the
impacts of purchase accounting that were associated with an acquisition in December 2004.

Operating Expenses and Operating Income

Total Company.

Total operating expenses increased $44.0 million to $251.6 million for the year
ended December 31, 2006 from $207.6 million for the prior year. As a percentage of revenue,
operating expenses increased to 34% from 33% for the prior year. The change in accounting for
share-based compensation beginning January 1, 2006 resulted in an increase of $9.0 million, or 4%,
in total company operating expenses for 2006. For the year ended December 31, 2006, share-based
compensation expense was not allocated to our operating segments and therefore has been categorized
as “unallocated amounts.”

Operating income increased $12.6 million to $127.9 million for the year ended December 31,
2006 from $115.3 million for the prior year. As a percentage of revenue, operating income decreased
to 17% from 18%. The change in accounting for share-based compensation beginning January 1, 2006
had a negative impact of 1% on reported operating income as a percentage of total company revenue.

The increase in sales and marketing expense resulted primarily from higher personnel-related
costs due, in part, to expanded worldwide sales, marketing and customer service headcount and to
higher sales commissions as a result of revenue performance. To a lesser extent, incremental
activities associated with businesses acquired since January 1, 2005 also contributed to the
increase in sales and marketing expense.

The increase in general and administrative expense resulted primarily from higher spending on
facilities, information technology and other general support functions. To a lesser extent,
incremental expenses associated with businesses acquired since January 1, 2005, comprised mainly of
amortization expense for intangible assets acquired and general and administrative expenses of a
recurring nature to support the acquired businesses, also contributed to the increase in general
and administrative expense. Increases in general and administrative expenses were partly offset by
the favorable impact of net transaction gains on foreign currency denominated expenses in 2006
compared to transaction losses in 2005.

The increase in research and development expense resulted primarily from increased product
development spending related primarily to IDEXX VetLab

®

instrumentation and, to a lesser
extent, rapid assay and digital radiography products.



Water.

Operating expenses for Water increased $0.4 million, or 3%, to $12.7 million for the
year ended December 31, 2006 from $12.3 million for the prior year and, as a percentage of revenue,

The increase in general and administrative expense resulted primarily from higher spending on
facilities, information technology and other general support functions; higher bad debt expense;
higher compensation; and costs incurred to consolidate our office and production facilities based
in the United Kingdom into a single facility. The increase in sales and marketing expense resulted
primarily from higher personnel-related costs. The decrease in research and development expense
resulted primarily from lower spending following the launch of the IDEXX Filta-Max

xpress

a

Cryptosporidium

and

Giardia

testing product, in the second quarter of 2006.

Production Animal Segment.

Operating expenses for PAS increased $2.0 million, or 10%, to $22.5

The increase in general and administrative expense resulted primarily from higher spending on
facilities, information technology and other general support functions and, to a lesser extent,
from a write-down of an equity investment in a technology licensor. Increases in general and
administrative expenses were partly offset by the absence in 2006 of certain discrete costs that
occurred in 2005 and the favorable impact of net transaction gains on foreign currency denominated
expenses in 2006 compared to transaction losses in 2005. Discrete costs in 2005 were associated
with the cessation of production in our Sweden-based facility in connection with the centralization
of our European production animal diagnostics operations in Bern, Switzerland. The increase in
sales and marketing expense resulted primarily from higher personnel-related costs. Increases in
research and development expense from higher personnel-related costs due, in part, to expanded
headcount and from higher patent-related costs were substantially offset by lower facilities and
overhead costs in Europe as a result of the consolidation of our European production animal
business, including research and development activities, during the second half of 2005.

Unallocated Amounts.

Operating expenses that are not allocated to our operating segments,
consisting primarily of the company-wide share-based compensation expense and corporate research
and development, increased $11.4 million to $14.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 from
$3.5 million for the prior year. This increase is primarily due to the inclusion of share-based
compensation expense of $9.0 million in 2006 due to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) on January 1,
2006. Corporate research and development expense grew mainly due to personnel additions in 2005 and
2006 to support increased long-term product development activities.



Interest Income and Interest Expense

Interest income was $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $3.2 million
for the year ended December 31, 2005. An increase in interest income from higher interest rates was
largely offset by lower average invested cash balances.

Interest expense was $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $0.1
million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to
interest expense incurred on the mortgage assumed in connection with the Westbrook, Maine facility
purchase in May 2006.

Provision for Income Taxes

Our effective income tax rate was 28.4% for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared with
34.2% for the year ended December 31, 2005. The majority of this rate differential resulted from
the favorable impact of the resolution in 2006 of an IRS income tax audit for the years ended
December 31, 2003 and 2004. As a result of completing this audit, we reduced previously accrued
taxes and recognized a tax benefit of 3.7% of income before tax. Other items that decreased our
effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2006 included a reduction of previously recorded
international deferred tax liabilities as a result of obtaining certain multi-year tax incentives
and the release of a valuation allowance on international deferred tax assets as a result of a
subsidiary demonstrating consistent sustained profitability. In addition, the effective rate for
the year ended December 31, 2006 was less than the effective rate for the year ended December 31,
2005 due to the incremental tax expense in 2005 on the repatriation of $30.0 million pursuant to
the

American Jobs Creation Act of 2004

. These rate reductions were partly offset by the
nonrecognition, in 2006, of tax benefits on compensation expense for incentive stock options and
employee stock purchase rights that were recorded in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R) effective
January 1, 2006.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

A discussion of recent accounting pronouncements is included in Note 2(r) to the consolidated
financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2007 included in this Annual Report on Form
10-K.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Liquidity

We fund the capital needs of our business through cash on hand, funds generated from
operations, and amounts available under our credit facilities. At December 31, 2007 and December
31, 2006, we had $60.4 million and $96.7 million, respectively, of cash and cash equivalents and
short-term investments, and working capital of $82.3 million and $177.5 million, respectively.
Additionally, at December 31, 2007, we had borrowing availability under our revolving credit
facility of $52.8 million. We believe that current cash and cash equivalents, funds generated from
operations, and amounts available under our credit facilities will be sufficient to fund our
operations, capital purchase requirements, and strategic growth needs. We further believe that we
could obtain additional borrowings at customary interest rates to fund our growth objectives. In
February 2008, we increased the aggregate principal amount available under our unsecured revolving
credit facility to $200.0 million. The extent and timing of acquisitions-related spending and
repurchases of our common stock could cause variations in our liquidity and leverage levels.

We consider certain operating earnings of non-United States subsidiaries to be indefinitely
invested outside the U.S. Changes to this policy could have adverse tax consequences. Subject to
this policy, we manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among all of our
subsidiaries. Foreign cash balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund
ordinary business operations outside the U.S.

Sources and Uses of Cash

Cash
generated by operating activities was $135.1 million for the year ended December 31,
2007, compared to $109.8 million for the same period in 2006. The total of net income and net
non-cash charges was $136.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $120.0
million for the same period in 2006.

We have historically experienced proportionally lower or net negative cash flows from
operating activities during the first quarter and net positive cash flows from operating activities
for the remainder of the year and for the annual period. Several factors contribute to the seasonal
fluctuations in cash flows generated by operating activities, including the following:

•

We have agreements with certain suppliers that require us to make minimum annual
inventory purchases, in some cases in order to retain exclusive distribution rights,
and we have other agreements with suppliers that provide for lower pricing based on
annual purchase volumes. We may place a higher volume of purchase orders for inventory
during the fourth quarter in order to meet our minimum commitments or realize volume
pricing discounts and we receive that inventory in the fourth or first quarters and pay
in the first quarter. The specific facts and circumstances that we consider in
determining the timing and level of inventory purchases throughout the year related to
these agreements may yield inconsistent cash flows from operations, most typically in
the first and fourth quarters.

•

We have management and non-management employee incentive programs that provide for
the payment of annual bonuses in the first quarter following the year for which the
bonuses were earned.

•

In the U.S., we pay our final income tax payments for each fiscal year on March

th

of the following year, in addition to paying our first quarter payment
for the current fiscal year. Our method of depositing estimated taxes delays a portion
of the payment relating to the preceding year until this final payment date and, as a
result, tax payments are higher in the first quarter of each year.

Net income for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $0.3 million to $94.0 million from
$93.7 million for the prior year. Income adjusted for noncash items and the tax benefit from
exercises of stock options was $145.4 million, compared to $129.4 million, resulting in a
year-to-year increase of $16.0 million. The changes in noncash adjustments are primarily due to the
inclusion in net income for the year ended December 31, 2007 of the write-down of
Navigator

®

inventory and the associated royalty license impairment of $10.1 million and
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2007,
compared to the prior year, of $11.2 million. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense
is due, in part, to the increase in amortization expense recognized for acquired intangibles assets
of $3.7 million. See Notes 3, 6 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in this
Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information about our acquisitions of businesses and
intangible assets, the Navigator

®

inventory write-down, and intangible assets,
respectively.

During
the year ended December 31, 2007, cash decreased by $1.0 million due to changes in
operating assets and liabilities, compared to a decrease in the same period of 2006 of $10.2
million, resulting in a year-to-year change of $9.2 million. The decrease in cash used by changes
in operating assets and liabilities, compared to 2006, was primarily attributable to $20.4 million
less cash used by changes in inventory and an increase of $15.5 million of cash provided by
increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses, partly offset by an increase of $19.0 million
of cash used to fund increases in accounts receivable and $8.7 million used for other assets. The
decrease in cash used by inventory compared to the same period of 2006 was due, in part, to the
receipt in the first quarter of 2006 of VetTest

®

slide inventory receipts from our
supplier that were deferred from the fourth quarter of 2005, which resulted in an unusually large
increase in VetTest

®

slide inventory during the year ended December 31, 2006.



Additionally, during 2007, certain inventory levels that grew during the later part of 2006
subsequently decreased due to consumption and sales. These inventory levels had increased during
the second half of 2006 in preparation for
a supplier’s production facility transition and to ensure adequate supply of certain
instrument components and accessories that were being discontinued by the manufacturers. The
increase in cash provided by accounts payable and accrued expenses was due, in part, to higher
development costs associated with new products that were launched during the first quarter of 2008;
incremental receipts of VetTest

®

slide inventory near the end of 2007; incremental
royalties payable due to higher revenue, including revenue from businesses acquired during 2007;
and higher deferred rent liabilities, including real estate rental obligations associated with
business acquisitions. The increase in cash used to fund accounts receivable was due largely to
higher sales during the three months and the year ended December 31, 2007.

Cash used by investing activities was $121.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007,
compared to cash used of $40.7 million for the same period of 2006. The increase in cash used by
investing activities for 2007, compared to 2006, was largely due to $64.7 million of incremental
cash used for business acquisitions and intangible assets, which are described below, and
incremental purchases of property and equipment of $32.8 million. These decreases in cash were
partly offset by higher net proceeds from investments in 2007 of $4.3 million and the absence of
expenditures on land and buildings in 2007 compared to $12.1 million during 2006, primarily for the
purchase of our Westbrook, Maine facility.

We paid $86.6 million and assumed liabilities, including contingent liabilities and deferred
tax liabilities associated with purchase accounting, of $17.9 million to acquire businesses and
certain intangible assets that did not comprise businesses during the year ended December 31, 2007.
We also paid $3.2 million in relation to businesses acquired in prior years. In January 2007, we
acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of the Critical Care
Division of Osmetech plc. The acquired business is based in the United States and develops,
designs, manufactures, and distributes point-of-care electrolyte and blood gas analyzers and
related consumable products for the human medical and veterinary diagnostics markets. In March
2007, we acquired all of the equity of Vita-Tech Canada Inc. (“Vita-Tech”) and Institut Pourquier
SAS (“Pourquier”) in separate transactions. Vita-Tech is the largest provider of reference
laboratory testing services to veterinarians in Canada and has operations in Toronto and Montreal,
Canada. Pourquier is based in Montpellier, France and develops, designs, manufactures, and
distributes production animal diagnostic products. In March and October 2007, we acquired
veterinary reference laboratories located in the United States. We also acquired certain assets of
other veterinary reference laboratories during the year ended December 31, 2007 that did not
comprise businesses. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual
Report on Form 10-K for additional information about our acquisitions of businesses.

We paid $65.1 million to purchase fixed assets and $1.1 million to acquire rental instruments
sold under recourse during the year ended December 31, 2007. Our total capital expenditures for
2007 included approximately $13 million towards the renovation and expansion of our primary
facility in Westbrook, Maine. We preliminarily project additional capital spending of approximately
$140 million during 2008 through 2011 to complete this project, with $75 million of the projected
spending during 2008. The first phase of this project will provide more efficient manufacturing and
research and development facilities.

In January 2007, we entered into an unsecured short-term revolving credit facility with a bank
in the principal amount of $125.0 million that would have matured on June 30, 2007. On March 30,
2007, we refinanced this short-term facility by entering into an unsecured revolving credit
facility with four multinational banks that matures on March 30, 2012 (the “Credit Facility”). In
February 2008, we increased the aggregate principal amount available under our unsecured revolving
credit facility to $200.0 million. The Credit Facility may be used for general corporate purposes,
including repurchases of our common stock and business acquisitions. The applicable interest rates
generally range from 0.375% to 0.875% above the London interbank rate or the Canadian
Dollar-denominated bankers’ acceptance rate, dependent on our leverage ratio. Under the Credit
Facility, we pay quarterly commitment fees of 0.08% to 0.20%, dependent on our leverage ratio, on
any unused commitment. The Credit Facility contains financial and other affirmative and negative
covenants, as well as customary events of default, that would allow any amounts outstanding under
the Credit Facility to be accelerated, or restrict our ability to borrow thereunder, in the event
of noncompliance. The financial covenant requires our ratio of debt to earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization, as defined by the agreement, not to exceed 3-to-1. At
December 31, 2007, we had $72.2 million outstanding under the Credit Facility.



The board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to 40,000,000 shares of our common
stock in the open market or in negotiated transactions. From the inception of the program in August
1999 to December 31, 2007, we repurchased 33,148,000 shares. We believe that the repurchase of our
common stock is a favorable investment and we also repurchase to offset the dilutive effect of our
employee share-based compensation programs. Repurchases of our common stock may vary depending upon the level of other investing
activities and the share price. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements included in
this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information about our share repurchases.

Other Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees

Under our workers’ compensation insurance policies for U.S. employees since January 1, 2003,
we have retained the first $250,000 in claim liability per incident and aggregate claim liability
based on payroll for each year. The insurance company provides insurance for claims above the
individual occurrence and aggregate limits. We estimate claim liability based on claims incurred
and the estimated ultimate cost to settle the claims. Based on this analysis, we have recognized
cumulative expenses of $0.3 million, $1.2 million, $0.5 million, $0.8 million and $0.9 million for
claims incurred during the years ended December 31, 2007 through 2003, respectively. Claims
incurred during the year ended December 31, 2007 and year ended December 31, 2006 are relatively
new and significant additional healthcare and wage indemnification costs could arise from those
claims. Our liability for claims incurred during the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 could
exceed our estimates and we could be liable for up to $2.5 million and $1.0 million, respectively,
in excess of the expense we have recognized. For the three years ended on or prior to December 31,
2005, based on our retained claim liability per incident and our aggregate claim liability, our
maximum liability at December 31, 2007 is $0.4 million in excess of the amounts deemed probable and
previously recognized. In connection with these policies, we have
outstanding letters of credit totaling $2.1 million to the
insurance companies as security for these claims.

We have commitments outstanding at December 31, 2007 for additional purchase price payments of
up to $1.7 million in connection with acquisitions of businesses and intangible assets during the
current and prior periods, of which $0.8 million is contingent on the achievement by certain
acquired businesses of specified milestones. We also have agreed to make additional payments of up
to $0.8 million to sellers of certain acquired businesses that are conditional upon those sellers
providing future services to IDEXX for specified periods of time.

In January 2008,
we paid $4.4 million to acquire certain technology licensing rights and
agreed to future royalty and milestone payments based on the issuance of a certain patent to the licensor and
revenue from products and services incorporating that technology.

In October 2005, our former supplier of VetAutoread™ Hematology Analyzers and consumables sold
this business (including the human hematology testing products division) and we simultaneously
entered into a new supply agreement for these products with the acquirer of the business. Under
this new supply agreement, we received fixed pricing on certain products through December 31, 2020,
among other benefits. In partial consideration for this new supply agreement, we paid cash of $2.5
million to the acquirer and guaranteed the acquirer’s note (the “Note”) in the principal amount of
$3.5 million given to our former supplier in partial consideration for the business. The acquirer
is obligated to pay the Note through quarterly principal and interest payments through 2008 and to
pay the remaining balance in 2008. The principal balance of the note that we have guaranteed is
$1.7 million at December 31, 2007. We recorded the fair value of the guaranty of $0.5 million and
recognized the associated assets as of the effective date of the agreement. At December 31, 2007,
we have written off the guaranty liability because our recognized contractual liabilities to the
supplier exceed the principal balance of the Note and a legal right of offset exists whereby we may
elect to pay to the holder of the Note the amounts otherwise due to the supplier. We are obligated
to make a second payment of $1.25 million upon the achievement of certain milestones by the
acquirer, which occurred in January 2008, and a third payment of $1.25 million in
January 2009. The proceeds of the second payment
were used to reduce the Note balance. In February 2008, the acquirer paid the remaining payment
under the Note, which released our guaranty.

Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion on unrecognized tax benefits.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK

Our financial market risk consists primarily of foreign currency exchange rate risk. We
operate subsidiaries in 17 foreign countries and transact business in local currencies. We attempt
to hedge the majority of our cash flow on intercompany sales to minimize foreign currency exposure.

The primary purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to protect against the
volatility associated with foreign currency transactions. We also utilize some natural hedges to
mitigate our transaction and commitment exposures. Corporate policy prescribes the range of
allowable hedging activity. We enter into exchange contracts with large multinational financial
institutions and we do not hold or engage in transactions involving derivative instruments for
purposes other than risk management. Our accounting policies for these contracts are based on our
designation of such instruments as hedging transactions. Market gains and losses are deferred in
prepaid expenses or accruals, as appropriate, until the contract matures, which is the period when
the related obligation is settled. We primarily utilize forward exchange contracts with durations
of less than 18 months.

Our subsidiaries enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to minimize the impact of
foreign currency fluctuations associated with their anticipated intercompany inventory purchases
for the next year. From time to time, we may also enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to
minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations associated with specific, significant
transactions.

Our hedging strategy is consistent with prior periods and there were no material changes in
our market risk exposure during the year ended December 31, 2007. We enter into currency exchange
contracts for amounts that are less than the full value of forecasted intercompany sales and for
amounts that are equivalent to, or less than, other specific, significant transactions, thus no
significant ineffectiveness has resulted or been recorded through the statements of income. Our
hedging strategy related to intercompany inventory purchases provides that we employ the full
amount of our hedges for the succeeding year at the conclusion of our budgeting process for that
year, which is complete by the end of the preceding year. Quarterly, we enter into contracts to
hedge incremental portions of anticipated foreign currency transactions for the following year.
Accordingly, our risk with respect to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may vary
throughout each annual cycle. At December 31, 2007, we had $1.3 million in net unrealized losses on
foreign exchange contracts designated as hedges recorded in other comprehensive income, which is
net of $0.6 million in taxes.

Our currency rate exposure at December 31, 2007 consisted of local currency revenues and
expenses, the impact of hedge contracts and balances denominated in a currency other than the
Company’s or our subsidiaries’ functional currencies. Based on our overall currency rate exposure,
excluding unrealized losses of $1.9 million at December 31, 2007 and unrealized losses of $2.0
million at December 31, 2006 on foreign exchange contracts designated as hedges, a 10% weakening or
strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies at December 31, 2007 would increase
or decrease operating income, respectively, by approximately $3.4 million in 2008 and a 10%
weakening or strengthening of the U.S. dollar from December 31, 2006 would have increased or
decreased operating income, respectively, by approximately $3.1 million in 2007. At December 31,
2007, a 10%
weakening or strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies, excluding the
impact of hedge contracts currently in place, would increase or reduce operating income,
respectively, by approximately $15.7 million in 2008, compared to $13.9 million in 2007.

ITEM 9.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

Not applicable.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and
procedures, as defined by the SEC in its Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 as amended (the “Exchange Act”). The term “disclosure controls and
procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and
other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by the company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms.
Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or
submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management,
including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no
matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their
objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit
relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure
controls and procedures at December 31, 2007, our chief executive officer and chief financial
officer have concluded that, at the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure
controls and procedures are effective to achieve their stated purpose.

Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. The Company’s
internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of
America and includes those policies and procedures that:

•

Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and
fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;

•

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and

•

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.



Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions
and that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.

We conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
based on the framework in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway commission. Based on this evaluation, we conclude that, at December 31, 2007, our
internal control over financial reporting was effective.

The effectiveness of
the Company’s internal control over financial reporting at December 31,
2007 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting
firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules
13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the three months ended December 31, 2007
that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting.

over financial reporting of the Company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer are

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of IDEXX Laboratories, Inc

.:

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item
15(a)(1) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of IDEXX Laboratories,
Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the results of their operations and
their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007 in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our
opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index appearing under Item
15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in
conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s
management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the Report of Management of
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to
express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted
our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our
audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as
we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinions.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in
which it accounts for share based-compensation in 2006 and the manner in which it accounts for
uncertain tax positions and compensated absences in 2007.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

IDEXX LABORATORIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1. NATURE OF BUSINESS

We develop, manufacture and distribute products and provide services for the veterinary and
the food and water testing markets. We also sell a line of portable electrolytes and blood gas
analyzers for the human point-of-care medical diagnostics market. During 2007, we operated
primarily through three business segments: products and services for the veterinary market, which
we refer to as our Companion Animal Group (“CAG”), water quality products (“Water”) and products
for production animal health, which we refer to as the Production Animal Segment (“PAS”). We also
operate two smaller segments that comprise products for dairy quality, which we refer to as Dairy,
and products for the human medical diagnostic market, which we refer to as OPTI Medical. Financial
information about the Dairy and OPTI Medical operating segments are combined and presented in an
“Other” category because they do not meet the quantitative or qualitative thresholds for reportable
segments. Our products and services are sold worldwide. See Note 17 for additional information
regarding our reportable operating segments, products and services, and geographical areas.

NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

(a) Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of IDEXX Laboratories,
Inc. and our wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries, and all other entities in which we have
a variable interest and are determined to be the primary beneficiary. All material intercompany
transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.

On October 25, 2007, our board of directors approved a two-for-one split of the outstanding
shares of our common stock, to be effected in the form of a 100% stock dividend. Each holder of
common stock of record at November 5, 2007 received one additional share of common stock. The
additional shares of common stock were distributed on November 26, 2007. As a result of the stock
split, the number of outstanding common shares doubled to approximately 61 million shares.

All share and per share data (except par value) have been adjusted to reflect the effect of
the stock split for all periods presented. In addition, the exercise of outstanding stock options
and the vesting of other stock awards, as well as the number of shares of common stock reserved for
issuance under our various employee benefit plans, were proportionately increased in accordance
with the terms of those respective agreements and plans.

(b) Estimates

The preparation of these financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make estimates and judgments that
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates, including
those related to bad debts; goodwill and other intangible assets; income taxes; inventory;
investments; revenue recognition, including customer programs and incentives, product returns, and
multiple element arrangements; share-based compensation; warranty reserves; and contingencies. We
accrue contingent liabilities when it is probable that future expenditures will be made and such
expenditures can reasonably be estimated. We base our estimates on historical experience and on
various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of
which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that
are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

(c) Inventories

Inventories include material, labor and overhead, and are stated at the lower of cost
(first-in, first-out) or market. We write down inventory for estimated obsolescence when warranted
by estimates of future demand, market conditions, and remaining shelf life. If actual market
conditions are less favorable than those we estimated, additional inventory write-downs may be
required, which would have a negative effect on results of operations.

F-7


(d) Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization.
When an item is sold or retired, the cost and related accumulated depreciation is relieved, and the
resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognized in the statement of income. We provide for
depreciation and amortization primarily using the straight-line method by charges to income in
amounts that allocate the cost of property and equipment over their estimated useful lives as
follows:

Asset Classification

Estimated

Useful Life

Land improvements

15 years

Buildings and improvements

15–40 years

Leasehold improvements

Shorter of life of
lease or useful life

Machinery and equipment

3–5 years

Office furniture and equipment

3–7 years

We capitalize interest in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”)
No. 34, “Capitalization of Interest Cost” (“SFAS No. 34”). Interest is capitalized on the
acquisition and construction of significant assets that require a substantial period of time to be
made ready for use. The capitalized interest is included in the cost of the completed asset and
depreciated over the asset’s estimated useful life. In 2007, we began the renovation and expansion
of our primary facility in Westbrook, Maine. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we
capitalized $0.3 million of interest expenses related to this project. For periods prior to 2007,
there were no acquisitions or construction of significant assets that required a substantial period
of time to be made ready for use, and therefore no capitalized interest was recorded.

(e) Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

A significant portion of the purchase price for acquired businesses is assigned to intangible
assets. Intangible assets other than goodwill are initially valued at the lesser of fair value or,
if applicable, fair value proportionately reduced by the excess of the fair value of acquired net
assets over the purchase price (collectively, “fair value”) of the acquired business. If a market
value is not readily available, the fair value of the intangible asset is estimated based on
discounted cash flows using market participant assumptions, which are assumptions that are not
specific to IDEXX. The selection of appropriate valuation methodologies and the estimation of
discounted cash flows require significant assumptions about the timing and amounts of future cash
flows, risks, appropriate discount rates, and the useful lives of intangible assets. When deemed
appropriate by management, we utilize independent valuation experts to advise and assist us in
allocating the purchase prices for acquired businesses to the fair values of the identified
intangible assets and in determining appropriate amortization methods and periods for those
intangible assets. Goodwill is initially valued based on the excess of the purchase price of a
business combination over the fair values of acquired net assets.

We provide for amortization using the straight-line and accelerated methods by charges to
income in amounts that allocate the intangible assets over their estimated useful lives as follows:

Estimated

Asset Classification

Useful Life

Patents

8–15 years

Other product rights

2–15 years

Customer-related intangible assets

2–15 years

Other, primarily noncompete agreements

2–10 years

We assess goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances indicate an
impairment may exist, in accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”
(“SFAS No. 142”). For impairment testing, the fair values of the reporting units that include
goodwill are estimated using a discounted cash flow approach. The cash flows used contain our best
estimates, using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time. Changes in
forecast cash flows or the discount rate would affect the estimated fair values of reporting units
and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period. No impairments were identified
as a result of the annual or event-driven reviews during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 or
2005.

F-8


We assess the realizability of intangible assets other than goodwill whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with
SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets” (“SFAS No. 144”). If
an impairment review is triggered, we evaluate the carrying value of intangible assets based on
estimated undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the assets and comparing
that value to the carrying value of the assets. The cash flows that are used contain our best
estimates, using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time. No impairments
were identified during the years ended December 31, 2006 or 2005. No impairments were identified
during the year ended December 31, 2007, except as discussed in Note 8.

(f) Warranty Reserves

We provide for the estimated cost of instrument warranties in cost of product revenue at the
time revenue is recognized based on the estimated cost to repair the instrument over its warranty
period. Cost of revenue reflects not only estimated warranty expense for the systems sold in the
current period, but also any changes in estimated warranty expense for the installed base that
results from our quarterly evaluation of service experience. Our actual warranty obligation is
affected by instrument performance in the customer’s environment and associated costs incurred in
servicing instruments. Should actual service rates or costs differ from our estimates, which are
based on historical data, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required.
Following is a summary of changes in accrued warranty reserve for products sold to customers for
the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively

(g) Income Taxes

We account for income taxes under SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.” This statement
requires that we recognize a current tax liability or asset for current taxes payable or
refundable, respectively, and a deferred tax liability or asset, as the case may be, for the
estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between book and tax treatment of assets and
liabilities and carryforwards to the extent they are realizable. We record a valuation allowance to
reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. While we
consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in
assessing the need for a valuation allowance, in the event we were to determine that we would be
able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, a
reduction of the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was
made. Likewise, should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net
deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to
income in the period such determination was made.

We adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (“FIN”) No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty
in Income Taxes” (“FIN 48”) as of January 1, 2007. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty
in income taxes recognized in financial statements under SFAS No. 109 and prescribes a
comprehensive model for the recognition, measurement, and financial statement disclosure of
uncertain tax positions. Unrecognized tax benefits are the differences between tax positions taken,
or expected to be taken, in tax returns, and the benefits recognized for accounting purposes
pursuant to FIN 48.

Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and
our income tax filings are regularly under audit by tax authorities. Any audit result differing
from amounts recorded in accordance with FIN 48 would increase or decrease income in the period
that we determine such adjustment is
likely. Interest expense and penalties associated with the underpayment of income taxes are
included in income tax expense. See Note 11 for additional information regarding income taxes.

F-9


(h) Sales and Value Added Taxes

We calculate, collect from our customers, and remit to governmental authorities sales, value
added and excise taxes assessed by governmental authorities in connection with revenue-producing
transactions with our customers. We report these taxes on a net basis and do not include these tax
amounts in revenue or cost of revenue.

(i) Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenue when four criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence that an arrangement
exists, (ii) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, (iii) the sales price is fixed
or determinable, and (iv) collectibility is reasonably assured. Revenue-generating transactions
generally fall into one of the following categories of revenue recognition:

•

We recognize revenue at the time of shipment to U.S. distributors for substantially
all products sold through distributors as title and risk of loss pass to these
customers on delivery to the common carrier. Our distributors do not have the right to
return products. We recognize revenue for the remainder of our customers when the
product is delivered to the customer except as noted below.

•

We recognize revenue from the sales of instruments, noncancelable software licenses
and hardware systems upon installation (and completion of training if applicable) and
the customer’s acceptance of the instrument or system because at this time we have no
significant further obligations.

•

We recognize service revenue at the time the service is performed.

•

We recognize revenue associated with extended maintenance agreements over the life
of the contracts using the straight-line method, which approximates the expected timing
in which applicable services are performed. Amounts collected in advance of revenue
recognition are recorded as a current or long-term liability based on the time from the
balance sheet date to the future date of revenue recognition.

•

We recognize revenue on certain instrument systems under rental programs over the
life of the rental agreement using the straight-line method. Amounts collected in
advance of revenue recognition are recorded as a current or long-term liability based
on the time from the balance sheet date to the future date of revenue recognition.

•

We recognize revenue on certain instruments and practice information management
systems sales, where the product includes software that is considered more than
incidental to the utility and value of the product, by allocating the revenue to each
element of the sale based on relative fair values of the elements including
post-contract support. We recognize revenue for the instrument or system on
installation and customer acceptance and recognize revenue equal to the fair value of
the software update rights and post-contract support over the support period.

•

Shipping costs reimbursed by the customer are included in revenue.

Multiple element arrangements

. When multiple products and/or services are sold
together, we generally allocate the total consideration received amongst the elements based on
their relative fair values, which is determined by amounts charged separately for the delivered and
undelivered elements to other customers. When there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair
value of the undelivered elements but no such evidence for the delivered elements, the fair value
of the undelivered elements is deferred and the residual revenue is allocated to the delivered
elements. The delivered elements are recognized as revenue when appropriate under the policies
described above. If there is not sufficient evidence of the fair value of the undelivered elements,
no revenue is allocated to the delivered elements and the total consideration received is deferred
until delivery of those elements for which objective and reliable evidence of the fair value is not
available.

F-10


Customer programs

. We record estimated reductions to revenue in connection with
customer marketing programs and incentive offerings that may give customers credits or award
points. Award points may be applied to trade receivables owed to us and/or toward future purchases
of our products or services. We establish accruals for estimated revenue reductions attributable to
customer programs and incentive offerings for each program. Revenue
reductions are recorded quarterly based on issuance of credits, points earned but not yet
issued, and estimates of credits and points to be earned in the future based on current revenue.
Our two most significant customer programs are Practice Developer

®

and SNAP

®

up the Savings

TM

(“SUTS”), both of which are offered only to North American customers.
Our Practice Developer

®

program is a Companion Animal Group awards program that permits
customers to earn points by purchasing quarterly minimums in certain product and service
categories, including IDEXX Reference Laboratories services, VetTest

®

slides,
VetTest

®

Snapreader reagents, LaserCyte

®

tubes, Feline and Canine
SNAP

®

tests, and service and maintenance agreements. Points may then be applied against
the purchase price for IDEXX products and services purchased in the future or applied to trade
receivables due to us. SUTS is our volume incentive program for selected SNAP

®

tests
that provides customers with benefits in the form of (1) discounts off invoice at the time of
purchase and (2) points under the Practice Developer

®

program awarded quarterly
throughout the SUTS program year (which ends on August 31) based on total purchase volume of
qualified SNAP

®

products during the year. For the Practice Developer program, the
accrued revenue reduction is calculated each quarter based on sales to end users during the quarter
by either us or our distributors and on our estimate of future points to be issued upon sale of
applicable product inventories held by distributors at the end of the quarter. As points are
redeemed we recognize the benefit of points expected to expire, or breakage, using historical
forfeiture rates. On November 30 of each year, unused points granted before January 1 of the prior
year expire and any variance from the breakage estimate is accounted for as a change in estimate.

Doubtful accounts receivable

. We recognize revenue only in those situations where
collection from the customer is reasonably assured. We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts
for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. We
base our estimates on detailed analysis of specific customer situations and a percentage of our
accounts receivable by aging category. If the financial condition of our customers were to
deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances
might be required. Account balances are charged off against the allowance when we believe the
receivable will not be recovered.

(j) Research and Development and Software Development Costs

Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. In accordance with SFAS No. 86,
“Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed” (“SFAS No.
86”), we evaluate our software research and development costs for capitalization after the
technological feasibility of software and products containing software has been established. No
software development costs have been capitalized by us because costs eligible for capitalization
under SFAS No. 86 have been insignificant. Research and development expenses consist of salaries,
employee benefits, materials and consulting costs.

(k) Advertising Costs

Advertising costs, which are recognized as sales and marketing expense in the period in which
they are incurred, were $1.9 million, $1.5 million and $1.5 million for the years ended December
31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

(l) Share-Based Compensation

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 123(R),
“Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS No. 123(R)”), which is a revision of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation” and SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation—Transition and
Disclosure—An Amendment of FASB No. 123” (collectively, “SFAS No. 123, as Amended”) and supersedes
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees” (“APB No.
25”). During 2005 and 2006, the FASB also issued Staff Positions No. FAS 123(R)-1, -2, -3, -4, -5
and -6 to provide application guidance related to SFAS No. 123(R).

SFAS No. 123(R) requires all share-based compensation to employees, including grants of stock
options, to be valued at fair value on the date of grant, and to be expensed over the requisite
service period (generally the vesting period). Prior to January 1, 2006, we measured costs related
to employee share-based compensation plans in accordance with APB No. 25. Accordingly, no employee
compensation cost was recognized for these plans prior to January 1, 2006.

F-11


We adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R) on January 1, 2006 and elected the modified
prospective method of transition to the fair-value-based method of accounting for share-based
employee compensation prescribed by SFAS No. 123(R). Effective January 1, 2006, under the modified
prospective method, share-based compensation expense includes expense for unvested awards at
December 31, 2005 and all awards granted subsequent to December 31, 2005. Share-based compensation
expense for the unvested awards outstanding at December 31, 2005 is based on the grant-date fair
value previously calculated in developing the pro forma disclosures in accordance with the
provisions of SFAS No. 123, as Amended.

In connection with the adoption of SFAS 123(R), we adopted the straight-line method to
prospectively expense share-based awards granted subsequent to December 31, 2005. The
graded-vesting, or accelerated, method has been used to record the expense for stock options
granted prior to January 1, 2006.

Beginning in 2006, we modified our share-based employee compensation programs to shift from
the grant of stock options and employee stock purchase rights only to the grant of a mix of
restricted stock units and stock options, along with employee stock purchase rights. There were no
modifications to the terms of outstanding options during 2007, 2006 or 2005.

We issue new shares of common stock to satisfy option and employee stock purchase right
exercises and to settle restricted stock units and deferred stock units. At December 31, 2007, a
remaining total of 3,437,000 shares of common stock was authorized by our shareholders and
available for future grants of share-based compensation.

(m) Foreign Currency Translation

Assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries are translated using the exchange rate in
effect at the balance sheet date. Revenue and expense accounts are translated using a weighted
average of exchange rates in effect during the period. Cumulative translation gains and losses are
shown in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as a separate component of accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss). Exchange gains and losses arising from transactions denominated in
foreign currencies other than our subsidiaries’ respective functional currencies are included in
operating expenses. Included in general and administrative expenses are aggregate foreign exchange
currency transaction gains of $0.2 million and $0.8 million, and losses of $0.8 million for the
years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Additionally, for the year ended
December 31, 2005, a cumulative translation loss of $0.5 million was transferred from accumulated
other comprehensive income and included in general and administrative expenses as a result of the
closure of our Sweden-based operation and the associated centralization of our European production
animal diagnostics operations products manufacturing in Switzerland.

(n) Derivative Instruments and Hedging

We follow SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” as
amended by SFAS No. 137, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities—Deferral of
the Effective Date of SFAS No. 133” and SFAS No. 138, “Accounting for Certain Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities—An Amendment of SFAS No. 133” (“SFAS No. 133, as Amended”). SFAS
No. 133, as Amended requires that all derivatives, including forward currency exchange contracts,
be recognized on the balance sheet at fair value. Derivatives that are not hedges must be recorded
at fair value through earnings. If a derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge,
changes in the fair value of the derivative are either offset against the change in fair value of
the hedged item through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item
is recognized in earnings. We immediately record in earnings the extent to which a hedge is not
effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value.

The primary purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to protect against the
volatility associated with foreign currency transactions. We also utilize some natural hedges to
mitigate our transaction and commitment exposures. Corporate policy prescribes the range of
allowable hedging activity. We enter into exchange contracts with large multinational financial
institutions and we do not hold or engage in transactions involving derivative instruments for
purposes other than risk management. Our accounting policies for these contracts are based on our
designation of such instruments as hedging transactions. Market gains and losses are deferred in
prepaid expenses or accruals, as appropriate, until the contract matures, which is the period when
the related obligation is settled. We primarily utilize forward exchange contracts with durations
of less than 18 months.

F-12


Our subsidiaries enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to minimize the impact of
foreign currency fluctuations associated with their anticipated intercompany inventory purchases
for the next year. From time to time, we may also enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to
minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations associated with specific, significant
transactions.

We enter into currency exchange contracts for amounts that are less than the full value of
forecasted intercompany sales and for amounts that are equivalent to, or less than, other specific,
significant transactions, thus no significant ineffectiveness has resulted or been recorded through
the statements of income. Our hedging strategy related to intercompany inventory purchases provides
that we employ the full amount of our hedges for the succeeding year at the conclusion of our
budgeting process for that year, which is complete by the end of the preceding year. Quarterly, we
enter into contracts to hedge incremental portions of anticipated foreign currency transactions for
the following year. Accordingly, our risk with respect to foreign currency exchange rate
fluctuations may vary throughout each annual cycle.

In addition to hedges for anticipated 2007 intercompany inventory purchases, we had a foreign
currency exchange contract outstanding at December 31, 2006 to hedge the repayment by our Canadian
subsidiary of an intercompany loan denominated in U.S. Dollars that the subsidiary used to fund the
acquisition of a veterinary reference laboratory business, which had a U.S dollar equivalent of
$11.2 million at December 31, 2006. This contract expired on February 28, 2007, at which time the
intercompany loan was repaid using funds borrowed under our credit facility.

In addition to hedges for anticipated 2008 intercompany inventory purchases, we had a foreign
currency exchange contract outstanding at December 31, 2007 to hedge the repayment by our Canadian
subsidiary of an intercompany loan denominated in Canadian dollars that the subsidiary used to fund
the acquisitions of a veterinary reference laboratory businesses, which had a U.S dollar equivalent
of $32.1 million at December 31, 2007.

At December 31, 2007, we recorded $1.3 million in unrealized losses through accumulated other
comprehensive income, which is net of $0.6 million in taxes, from foreign exchange contracts with
2008 expiration dates. At December 31, 2006, we recorded $1.3 million in unrealized losses through
accumulated other comprehensive income, which is net of $0.7 million in taxes, from foreign
exchange contracts with 2007 expiration dates. The foreign currency contracts to hedge forecasted
intercompany sales outstanding at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, consisted of the
following

goods are recorded in cost of product revenue. Included in cost of product revenue are foreign
exchange losses of $5.7 million, $2.8 million, and $0.1 million for the years ended December 31,
2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

(o) Disclosure of Fair Value of Financial Instruments and Concentration of Risk

Financial instruments consist mainly of cash and cash equivalents, investments, accounts
receivable, accounts payable and notes payable. Financial instruments that potentially subject us
to concentrations of credit risk are principally cash, cash equivalents, investments and accounts
receivable. We place our investments in highly rated financial institutions and investment grade
money market funds and municipal bonds. Concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts
receivable is limited to certain customers to whom we make substantial sales. To reduce risk, we
routinely assess the financial strength of our customers and closely monitor their amounts due to
us and, as a consequence, believe that our accounts receivable credit risk exposure is limited. We
maintain an allowance for potential credit losses, but historically have not experienced any
significant credit losses related to an individual customer or group of customers in any particular
industry or geographic area. The carrying amounts of our financial instruments approximate fair
market value. See Note 17 for further discussion of concentration of credit risk of accounts
receivable and Note 9 for discussion of interest rate risk regarding our revolving credit facility.

We currently purchase many products and materials from single sources or a limited number of
sources. Some of the products that we purchase from these sources are proprietary, and, therefore,
cannot be readily or easily replaced by alternative sources. If we are unable to obtain adequate
quantities of these products in the future, we could face cost increases or reductions, or delays
or discontinuations in product shipments, which could have a material adverse effect on our results
of operations.

(p) Comprehensive Income

SFAS No. 130, “Reporting Comprehensive Income,” requires us to report all changes in equity
during a period resulting from net income and transactions or other events and circumstances from
non-owner sources in a financial statement for the period in which they are recognized. We have
chosen to disclose comprehensive income, which encompasses net income, foreign currency translation
adjustments and the difference between the cost and the fair market value of investments in debt
and equity securities and foreign exchange contracts, in the Consolidated Statement of
Stockholders’ Equity. We consider the foreign currency cumulative translation adjustment to be
permanently invested and, therefore, have not provided income taxes on those amounts.

Accumulated other comprehensive income consisted of the following at December 31, 2007 and
2006, respectively,

(q) Change in Accounting Principle

We adopted the provisions of Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) consensus on Issue 06-2,
“Accounting for Sabbatical Leave and Other Similar Benefits Pursuant to FASB Statement No. 43,
Accounting for Compensated Absences” (“EITF 06-2”) and FIN 48, as of January 1, 2007. EITF 06-2
requires that the costs associated with unrestricted sabbaticals and other similar benefit
arrangements be recognized over the service period during which the employee earns the benefit. We
provide an additional four weeks of compensated leave to all U.S. salaried employees in their tenth
anniversary year of employment and again at each fifth year thereafter. As a result of adopting the
provisions of EITF 06-2, we recognized an increase in assets of $1.2 million, an increase in
liabilities of $3.0 million, and a decrease in retained earnings of $1.8 million at January 1,
2007. Beginning in 2007, we recognize estimated costs for estimated future compensated leave
benefits as they are earned. See Note 11 for a discussion of our adoption of FIN 48.

F-14


(r) Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (“SFAS No. 157”).
SFAS No. 157 establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands financial statement
disclosures about fair value measurements. The provisions of SFAS No. 157 are required as of the
beginning of the first fiscal year beginning after November 15, 2007 and shall generally be applied
prospectively. The FASB recently concluded to defer the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for one year
for certain nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at
fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis. We are studying SFAS No. 157 and
have not yet determined the expected impact of the implementation of this pronouncement on our
financial position and results of operations, if any. The adoption of SFAS No. 157 will not have an
effect on our cash flows.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets
and Financial Liabilities, including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115” (“SFAS No. 159”). SFAS
No. 159 permits entities to choose, at specified election dates, to measure eligible items at fair
value (the “fair value option”). A business entity shall report unrealized gains and losses on
items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting
period. The provisions of SFAS No. 159 are required as of the beginning of the first fiscal year
beginning after November 15, 2007. We are studying SFAS No. 159 and have not yet determined the
expected impact of the implementation of this pronouncement.

In April 2007, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (“FSP”) No. FIN 39-1 (“FSP FIN 39-1”). FSP
FIN 39-1 amends FIN 39, “Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain Contracts.” FSP FIN 39-1 requires
reporting entities to make an accounting policy decision whether or not to offset fair value
amounts recognized for derivative instruments and fair value amounts recognized for the right to
reclaim, or the obligation to return, cash collateral arising from derivative instruments executed
with the same counterparty under a master netting arrangement. FSP FIN 39-1 also requires related
disclosures. If a reporting entity changes its accounting policy upon adoption of FSP FIN 39-1, the
effects of applying FSP FIN 39-1 shall be retrospectively applied for all financial statements
presented. The provisions of FSP FIN 39-1 are required as of the beginning of the first fiscal year
beginning after November 15, 2007. We do not expect the adoption of FSP FIN 39-1 to have a material
impact on our financial position. The adoption of FSP FIN 39-1 will not have an effect on our
results of operations or cash flows.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), “Business Combinations” (“SFAS No. 141(R)”)
which revised SFAS No. 141, “Business Combinations”. SFAS No. 141(R) establishes principles and
requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the
identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree
and the goodwill acquired. SFAS No. 141(R) also establishes disclosure requirements which will
enable users to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. This
standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. As the provisions of SFAS
No. 141(R) are applied prospectively, the impact of this standard cannot be determined until the
transactions occur.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated
Financial Statements” (“SFAS No. 160”). SFAS No. 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards
for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent, the amount of
consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest, changes in a
parent’s ownership interest and the valuation of retained noncontrolling equity investments when a
subsidiary is deconsolidated. SFAS No. 160 also establishes reporting requirements that provide
sufficient disclosures that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent
and the interests of the noncontrolling owners. This standard is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2008. The adoption of SFAS No. 160 will not have an effect on our
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

NOTE 3. ACQUISITION OF BUSINESSES AND OTHER ASSETS

We paid $86.6 million, $23.9 million and $7.5 million to acquire businesses and certain
intangible assets that did not comprise businesses during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006
and 2005, respectively, and recognized liabilities, including contingent liabilities and deferred
tax liabilities associated with purchase accounting of $17.9 million, $4.6 million and $2.0
million, respectively.

F-15


In January 2007, we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities
of the Critical Care Division of Osmetech plc. The acquired business is based in the United States
and develops, designs, manufactures, and distributes point-of-care electrolyte and blood gas
analyzers and related consumable products for the human medical and veterinary diagnostics markets.
In March 2007, we acquired all of the equity of Vita-Tech Canada Inc. (“Vita-Tech”) and Institut
Pourquier SAS (“Pourquier”) in separate transactions. Vita-Tech is the largest provider of
reference laboratory testing services to veterinarians in Canada and has operations in Toronto and
Montreal, Canada. Pourquier is based in Montpellier, France and develops, designs, manufactures,
and distributes production animal diagnostic products. In March and October, we acquired veterinary
reference laboratories located in the United States. We also acquired certain assets of other
veterinary reference laboratories during the year ended December 31, 2007 that did not comprise
businesses.

The 2006 acquisitions included veterinary reference laboratories in the United States, Canada
and South Africa; a veterinary practice information management software business based in the
United States; and certain intellectual property and distribution rights from a diagnostics company
based in Australia. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we recognized incremental amortizable
intangible assets of $0.3 million in connection with the finalization of purchase price allocations
for certain 2006 acquisitions. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we revised the purchase
price allocations related to certain businesses acquired during the year ended December 31, 2006.
The revisions to the purchase price allocations resulted in a decrease in goodwill assigned to the
Companion Animal Group (“CAG”) segment of $0.8 million and a corresponding increase in property,
equipment and other intangible assets. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we also made
purchase price payments of $3.2 million related to the achievement of milestones by certain
businesses acquired in prior years.

The 2005 acquisitions included veterinary reference laboratories in the United States and
Europe and a digital radiography business based in the United States. During the year ended
December 31, 2006, we recognized incremental amortizable intangible assets of $1.9 million in
connection with the finalization of purchase price allocations for certain 2005 acquisitions.

We believe that the acquired businesses enhance our existing businesses by either expanding
the geographic range of our existing businesses or expanding our existing product lines. We
determined the purchase price of each acquired business based on our assessment of estimated future
cash flows attributable to the business enterprise taken as a whole, the strength of the business
in the marketplace, the strategic importance of the acquisition to IDEXX, and the seller’s desire
to be acquired by IDEXX versus perceived alternatives. We recognized goodwill based on the excess
of the purchase price for each business over the fair values of the individual tangible and
separately identified intangible assets acquired, which were valued in accordance with SFAS No.
141, “Business Combinations.”

During
the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, we recognized goodwill of $45.2 million, $11.0 million
and $2.1 million, respectively, for acquired businesses and recognized amortizable intangible
assets of $38.9 million, $13.3 million and $5.3 million, respectively.

We have commitments outstanding at December 31, 2007 for additional purchase price payments of
up to $1.7 million in connection with acquisitions of businesses and intangible assets during the
current and prior periods, of which $0.8 million is contingent on the achievement by certain
acquired businesses of specified milestones.

The results of operations of the acquired businesses have been included since their respective
acquisition dates. Pro forma information has not been presented because such information is not
material to the financial statements taken as a whole.

For the year ended December 31, 2007, share-based compensation expense included $8.1 million
for options, restricted stock units and deferred stock units with vesting conditions and $0.5
million for employee stock purchase rights. Share-based compensation expense was not affected by
the two-for-one split of the outstanding shares of our common stock as discussed in Note 2.

Share-based compensation costs are classified in cost of revenue and operating expenses
consistently with the classification of cash compensation paid to the employees receiving such
share-based compensation. Capitalized share-based employee compensation cost at December 31, 2007
and 2006 was $0.4 million and $0.2 million, respectively, which was included in inventory on the
consolidated balance sheet.

Our financial statements for periods ending prior to January 1, 2006 have not been restated or
revised. Had compensation cost for the Company’s share-based compensation for the year ended
December 31, 2005 been determined consistent with the provisions of SFAS No. 123, as Amended, the
Company’s net income and net income per common share would have been reduced to the following pro

Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123(R), we reported all income tax benefits resulting from the
exercise of stock options as operating cash inflows in our consolidated statements of cash flows.
SFAS 123(R) requires the benefits of tax deductions from the exercise of options in excess of the
compensation cost for those options to be reported as financing cash inflows. FSP No. FAS 123(R)-3,
“Transition Election Related to Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment Awards”
provides an alternative transitional method of calculating the excess tax benefits available to
absorb tax deficiencies recognized subsequent to the adoption of SFAS 123(R). In accordance with
FSP No. FAS 123(R)-3, which we elected, the full amount of tax benefits related to exercises after
December 31, 2005 of employee share-based compensation awards that were fully vested at December
31, 2005 are reported as financing cash inflows. For the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006,
$9.3 million and $9.4 million of tax benefits were reported as financing cash inflows rather than
operating cash inflows, respectively.

The fair value of options, restricted stock units, deferred stock units with vesting
conditions, and employee stock purchase rights awarded during the years ended December 31, 2007,
2006 and 2005 totaled $18.2 million, $11.9 million and $15.7 million, respectively. The total
unrecognized compensation cost for unvested share-based compensation awards outstanding at December 31, 2007 before consideration of estimated forfeitures, was $24.2 million. The weighted average
remaining expense recognition period is approximately 2.0 years.

Stock Incentive Plan

During 2003, our board of directors approved the 2003 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended (the
“2003 Stock Plan”) pursuant to which our employees and directors may receive various types of
share-based incentives, including stock options, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights
and deferred stock units. Any shares that are subject to awards of options or stock appreciation
rights will be counted against the share limit as one share for every share granted. Any shares
that are subject to other awards, such as restricted stock, will be counted against the share limit
as 2.1 shares for every share granted. A total of 6,300,000 shares of common stock are authorized
for issuance under the 2003 Stock Plan, provided that no more than 6,300,000 shares will be
available for the grant of incentive stock options, and no more than 1,200,000 shares will be
available for awards other than stock options and stock appreciation rights (such as restricted
stock). In addition, if any options granted under our prior plans, including the 1991 Stock Option
Plan, the 1998 Stock Incentive Plan or the 2000 Director Option Plan, terminate, expire or are
forfeited without having been exercised in full, the shares subject to such unexercised options are
available for issuance under the 2003 Stock Plan. Options granted under the 2003 Stock Plan and
prior plans may not be granted at an exercise price less than the fair market value of the common
stock on the date granted (or less than 110% of the fair market value in the case of incentive
stock options granted to holders of more than 10% of our Common Stock). Options may not be granted
for a term of more than ten years. The vesting schedule of all options granted under the 2003 Stock
Plan is determined by the compensation committee of our board of directors at the time of grant.

Options

Option awards are granted to employees with an exercise price equal to not less than the
closing market price of our common stock at the date of grant and generally vest ratably over five
years on each anniversary of the date of grant, conditional on continuous service. Options granted
to non-employee directors vest fully on the first anniversary of the date of grant. Upon any change
in control of the company, 25% of the unvested stock options then outstanding will vest and become
exercisable. However, if the acquiring entity does not assume outstanding options, then all options
will vest immediately prior to the change in control.

F-18


We use the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model to determine the fair value of options
granted. Option-pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, particularly for
the expected stock price volatility. Changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially
affect the fair value estimate. Our expected stock price volatility assumptions are based on the
historical volatility of our stock for the expected term and other relevant factors. The risk-free
interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yields for the expected term in effect at the
approximate date of grant. We have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we have no
present intention to pay a dividend; therefore, we assumed that no dividends will be paid over the
expected terms of option awards.

The use of the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model, the general methods employed to
develop the above described option valuation assumptions, and the vesting conditions of option
awards are consistent with prior periods. Beginning in 2006, the contractual terms of employee
option grants were reduced from ten years to seven years and we elected to use the simplified
method described in the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, which
is based on vesting and contractual terms, to develop the expected term assumption for 2006 and
2007 option awards. Additionally, beginning in 2006, share-based compensation expense is reduced
for an estimate of the number of awards that are expected to be forfeited. We use historical data
and other factors to estimate employee termination behavior and to evaluate whether particular
groups of employees have significantly different forfeiture behaviors. Share-based compensation
expense is reduced for an estimate of the number of awards that are expected to be forfeited. The
estimate is based on historical data and other factors, and compensation expense is adjusted for
actual results.

The weighted average valuation assumptions used to determine the fair value of each option
grant on the date of grant and the weighted average estimated fair values were as follows:

Intrinsic value represents the amount by which the market price of the common stock exceeded
the exercise price of the options, before applicable income taxes. The closing sale price of the
common stock was $58.63 on the last business day of the year ended December 31, 2007. During the
years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, the total intrinsic value of stock options exercised
was $38.9 million, $34.4 million and $25.4 million, respectively.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

During 1997, our board of directors approved the 1997 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, under
which we reserved and may issue up to an aggregate of 1,240,000 shares of Common Stock in periodic
offerings. Also during 1997, our board of directors approved the 1997 International Employee Stock
Purchase Plan, under which we reserved and could issue up to an aggregate of 60,000 shares of
Common Stock in semiannual offerings. The 1997 International Employee Stock Purchase Plan was
terminated in February 2005, and there were no shares remaining thereunder at the time of
termination.

Prior to July 1, 2005, stock was sold under each of these plans at 85% of its fair market
value, as defined in the plans as the lower of the closing price of our common stock at the
beginning of the period and the closing price of our common stock at the end of the period. For
periods ended prior to July 1, 2005, in order to determine the pro forma impact under SFAS No. 123,
as Amended, the fair value of the purchase rights issued under the employee stock purchase plan was
estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. The following
weighted average assumptions were used to determine the fair value of employee purchase rights for
the six months ended June 30, 2005:

Effective July 1, 2005, we amended our employee stock purchase plan to provide that stock is
sold at 85% of the closing price of the stock on the last day of the period and to change the
subscription period from six months to three months. The fair value of purchase rights under the
revised program equals the 15% discount from the market price at the exercise date, which is the
last day of the subscription period.

Restricted and Other Deferred Stock Units With Vesting Conditions

Restricted stock unit awards to employees either vest ratably over five years on each
anniversary of the date of grant, or vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant. Vesting is
conditional on continuous service. Restricted stock units are converted to an equivalent number of
shares of common stock upon vesting. Upon any change in control of the company, 25% of the unvested
restricted stock units then outstanding under the 2003 Stock Incentive Plan will vest, provided,
however, that if the acquiring entity does not assume the restricted stock units, then all such
units will vest immediately prior to the change in control. Deferred stock units with vesting
conditions awarded to non-employee directors under the Director Deferred Compensation Plan vest
fully on the first anniversary of the date of grant. Except upon a change in control, as defined in
the Director Deferred Compensation Plan, or certain limited circumstances, all deferred stock units
will be exchanged for an equivalent number of shares of common stock one year following a
director’s resignation or retirement. Upon a change in control, unvested deferred stock units vest
immediately.

F-20


The weighted average fair value per unit of restricted stock units granted during the year
ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 was $42.65 and $39.00, respectively. The weighted average fair
value per unit of deferred stock units with vesting conditions granted during the years ended
December 31, 2007 and 2006 was $41.94 and $38.73, respectively. There were no restricted stock
units or deferred stock units with vesting conditions granted in 2005.

The fair values of restricted and deferred stock units with vesting conditions are based on
the closing sale price of the common stock on the date of grant. We use historical data and other
factors to estimate employee termination behavior and to evaluate whether particular groups of
employees have significantly different forfeiture behaviors. Share-based compensation expense is
reduced for an estimate of the number of awards that are expected to be forfeited. The estimate is
based on historical data and other factors, and compensation expense is adjusted for actual
results.

Deferred Stock Units With No Vesting Conditions

Under our Director Deferred Compensation Plan, non-employee directors also may defer a portion
of their cash fees in the form of vested deferred stock units, each of which represents the right
to receive one unissued share of our common stock. Directors receive a number of deferred stock
units equal to the amount of cash fees deferred divided by the closing sale price of the common
stock on the date of deferral. Under our Executive Deferred Compensation Plan (the “Executive
Plan”), certain members of our management may elect to defer a portion of their cash compensation
in deferred stock units. These deferred stock units will be exchanged for a fixed number of shares
of common stock on dates determined by the employee, subject to the limitations of the Executive
Plan and applicable law. Except upon a change in control, as defined in the Director Deferred
Compensation Plan and the Executive Plan, or certain other limited circumstances, directors and
officers may not receive shares of common stock in settlement of deferred stock units earlier than
one year following their resignation from the board or termination of their employment,
respectively.

During the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, approximately 8,000, 16,000 and
22,000 deferred stock units valued at $0.7 million, $0.7 million, and $0.7 million were issued,
respectively.

During the year ended December 31, 2007, 1,200 shares of common stock were issued to settle
deferred stock units.

NOTE 5. CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS

Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of less than
three months.

F-21


We account for investments under SFAS No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and
Equity Securities” as available-for-sale. Investments are recorded at amortized cost and adjusted
to fair market value through other comprehensive income. Short-term investments, which had a cost
basis of $35.0 million at December 31, 2006, are investment securities with original maturities of
greater than three months, but less than one year, from
the balance sheet date. At December 31, 2006, we held $35.0 million of short-term investments
in auction rate municipal securities classified as available-for-sale securities. Our investments
in these securities are recorded at cost, which approximates fair market value due to their
variable interest rates, which typically reset every 28 to 35 days, and, despite the long-term
nature of their stated contractual maturities, we have the ability to quickly liquidate these
securities. As a result, we had no cumulative gross unrealized holding gains (losses) or gross
realized gains (losses) from these short-term investments. All income generated from these
short-term investments was recorded as interest income in the consolidated statements of income. At
December 31, 2007, we held no short-term investments.

NOTE 6. INVENTORY

Inventories include material, labor and overhead, and are stated at the lower of cost

During the year ended December 31, 2007, we recognized a write-down of nitazoxanide raw
materials inventory of $9.1 million and a write-off of a prepaid royalty license of $1.0 million
associated with Navigator

®

. These write-downs are included in cost of product revenue in
the consolidated statement of income. Our analysis of the realizability of these assets was
triggered upon our receipt of notice from the third-party contract manufacturer of finished goods
that it would discontinue manufacturing the product in 2009. Because of the low production volume
of Navigator

®

, we believed that we would not be able to enter into a replacement
manufacturing arrangement on economically feasible terms, and therefore we would not be able to
obtain the product after termination of the existing manufacturing arrangement. Accordingly, we
evaluated our associated inventory for obsolescence based on our changed estimates of product
availability and estimated future demand and market conditions. This inventory comprised $9.1
million of active ingredient and other raw materials, for which we recognized a full write-down
during 2007. At December 31, 2007, this inventory, net of reserves, comprised less than $0.1
million of finished goods. Sales of Navigator

®

were $0.4 million for the year ended
December 31, 2007. Additionally, because of lower sales volume estimates and the reduced product
life, we determined that we would not realize our related investment in prepaid royalties and,
therefore, fully expensed this asset during 2007.

F-22


In 2007, we began the renovation and expansion of our primary facility in Westbrook, Maine.
Related to this project, for the year end December 31, 2007, we capitalized $0.3 million of
interest expense. Capitalized interest is included in the cost of the completed asset and
depreciated over the asset’s estimated useful life. For periods prior to 2007, there were no
acquisitions or construction of significant assets that required a substantial period of time to be
made ready for use, and therefore no capitalized interest was previously recorded.

Instruments placed with customers under certain minimum volume commitment programs are
capitalized and depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the instrument or the minimum
volume commitment period.

the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

During the year ended December 31, 2007, we recognized $38.9 million of amortizable intangible
assets related to business acquisitions. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we also
recognized incremental amortizable intangible assets of $0.3 million in connection with the
finalization of purchase price allocations for certain 2006 business acquisitions. The weighted
average amortization periods for other product rights, customer-related intangible assets, and
other intangible assets acquired during 2007 in connection with business acquisitions were 13
years, 12 years and 6 years, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we recognized
$13.3 million of amortizable intangible assets related to business acquisitions and $0.7 million
related to the acquisition of the additional ownership interest in a joint venture in China. During
the year ended December 31, 2006, we also recognized incremental amortizable intangible assets of
$1.9 million in connection with the finalization of purchase price allocations for certain 2005
business acquisitions and we acquired licenses for $0.4 million. The weighted average amortization
periods for patents, other product rights, customer-related intangible assets, and other intangible
assets acquired during 2006 in connection with business acquisitions were 8 years, 3 years, 12
years and 7 years, respectively. See Notes 3 and 13 for additional information. The remaining
change in the cost of intangible assets other than goodwill during the years ended December 31,
2007 and 2006 resulted primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

During the year ended December 31, 2007, we recognized $45.2 million of goodwill (of which
$27.5 million is expected to be tax deductible) related to business acquisitions. During the year
ended December 31, 2007, we revised the purchase price allocations related to certain businesses
acquired during the year ended December 31, 2006. The revised purchase price allocations resulted
in a decrease in goodwill assigned to the Companion Animal Group (“CAG”) segment of $0.8 million
and a corresponding increase in property, equipment and other intangible assets. During the year
ended December 31, 2006, we recognized $11.0 million of goodwill (of which $2.0 million is expected
to be tax deductible) related to business acquisitions. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we
also recognized purchase accounting adjustments related to goodwill. See Note 3 for additional
information. The remaining changes in the cost of goodwill during the years ended December 31, 2007
and 2006 resulted primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

During 2007, we recognized an impairment charge to write-off a prepaid royalty license of $1.0
million associated with Navigator

®

paste, our Nitazoxanide product for the treatment of
equine protozoal myeloencephalitis. We also recognized a related inventory write-down as described
in Note 6. Based on our changed estimates of product availability and estimated future demand and
market conditions, we determined that we would not realize our investment in prepaid royalties and,
therefore, fully expensed this asset.

We
assessed goodwill attributable to our pharmaceutical business for
impairment at June 30, 2007 due to the matters discussed above
and the resulting Nitazoxanide inventory write-down and prepaid
royalty license impairment charge. The goodwill attributable to our
pharmaceutical business of $13.7 million was not impaired at
June 30, 2007, or subsequently, when evaluated as part of the
annual assessment.

NOTE 9. DEBT

In May 2006, we acquired our Westbrook, Maine facility. We paid cash of $11.5 million and
assumed a mortgage that had a face value of $6.5 million and a stated interest rate of 9.875%. We
recorded the mortgage at a fair market value of $7.5 million, based on an effective market interest
rate of 6.05%. The mortgage is payable in equal monthly installments of approximately $0.1 million
through May 1, 2015. Annual mortgage principal payments at December 31, 2007, based on the fair
market value of the mortgage at the assumption date, are as follows

In January 2007, we entered into an unsecured short-term revolving credit facility with a bank
in the principal amount of $125.0 million that matured on June 30, 2007. On March 30, 2007, we
refinanced this short-term facility by entering into an unsecured revolving credit facility with
four multinational banks that matures on March 30, 2012 (the “Credit Facility”). In February 2008,
we increased the aggregate principal amount available under our Credit Facility to $200.0 million.
The Credit Facility may be used for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of our common
stock and business acquisitions. The applicable interest rates generally range from 0.375% to
0.875% above the London interbank rate or the Canadian Dollar-denominated bankers’ acceptance rate,
dependent on our leverage ratio. At December 31, 2007, the average interest rate for borrowings
under the Credit Facility was 5.27%. Under the Credit Facility, we pay quarterly commitment fees of
0.08% to 0.20%, dependent on our leverage ratio, on any unused commitment. The Credit Facility
contains financial and other affirmative and negative covenants, as well as customary events of
default, that would allow any amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility to be accelerated, or
restrict our ability to borrow thereunder, in the event of noncompliance. The financial covenant
requires our ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as
defined by the agreement, not to exceed 3-to-1. At December 31, 2007, we had $72.2 million
outstanding under the Credit Facility.

We assumed $0.1 million of unsecured notes payable in connection with a business acquisition
during the year ended December 31, 2007. This note bears interest at 8.0%.

NOTE 10. EXIT ACTIVITY

During the year ended December 31, 2005, we consolidated our European production animal
diagnostics manufacturing operations in Bern, Switzerland, the location of the production animal
diagnostics company we acquired in December 2004. In connection with this consolidation, we ceased
operations in Sweden. We recognized expenses of $1.0 million associated with this exit activity
during the year ended December 31, 2005. The total costs included a cumulative translation
adjustment write-off of $0.5 million, employee termination benefits of $0.2 million, and building
lease termination costs of $0.1 million, which are included in general and administrative expenses
in the consolidated statement of income. The total costs also included employee termination
benefits of $0.2 million that are included in costs of product revenue. At December 31, 2005,
accrued expenses included building lease termination costs of $0.1 million which were subsequently
paid in January 2006. We did not incur significant expenses associated with this activity during
the years ended December 31, 2007 or 2006.

NOTE 11. INCOME TAXES

We adopted the provisions of FIN 48 as of January 1, 2007. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for
uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements under SFAS No. 109 and prescribes a
comprehensive model for the recognition, measurement, and financial statement disclosure of
uncertain tax positions. Unrecognized tax benefits are the differences between tax positions taken,
or expected to be taken, in tax returns, and the benefits recognized for accounting purposes
pursuant to FIN 48. As a result of adopting the provisions of FIN 48, we recognized an increase in
assets of $4.0 million, an increase in liabilities of $1.1 million, a decrease in additional
paid-in capital of $0.2 million, and an increase in retained earnings of $3.1 million at
January 1, 2007. In connection with the adoption of FIN 48, we have classified uncertain tax
positions as long-term liabilities.

F-25


The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits at January 1, 2007 was $9.8 million. The total
amount of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2007 was $5.1 million. Of the total
unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2007, $4.7 million comprised unrecognized tax positions
that would, if recognized, affect our effective tax rate. The ultimate deductibility of the
remaining unrecognized tax positions of $0.4 million is highly certain but there is uncertainty
about the timing of such deductibility. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting, other
than interest and penalties, the disallowance of the shorter deductibility period would not affect
the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the payment of cash to the taxing authority to
an earlier period.

In the ordinary course of our business, our income tax filings are regularly under audit by
tax authorities. While we believe we have appropriately provided for all uncertain tax positions,
amounts asserted by taxing authorities could be greater or less than our accrued position.
Accordingly, additional provisions on income tax matters, or reductions of previously accrued
provisions, could be recorded in the future as we revise our estimates due to changing facts and
circumstances or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved. We are currently
undergoing tax examinations by various international and state tax authorities and we anticipate
that these examinations will be concluded within the next year. We are no longer subject to U.S.
federal examinations for tax years before 2005. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to
income tax examinations in any state and local, or international jurisdictions in which we conduct
significant taxable activities for years before 2002.

We recognize accrued interest expense and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in
income tax expense. During the year we recorded interest expense and penalties of $0.7 million in
our consolidated statement of income and, at December 31, 2007, we had $0.6 million of interest
expense and penalties accrued in our consolidated balance sheet.

In the next year, we could recognize approximately $0.5 million of income tax benefits that

are primarily due to the lapse in the statutes of limitations for various international and state
tax jurisdictions.

Our effective income tax rate was 30.3% for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 28.4% for the
year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in tax rate is primarily attributable to several
non-recurring items that benefited the tax rate in the year ended December 31, 2006. These 2006
items included the resolution of an income tax audit for years ended December 31, 2003 and 2004, a
reduction of previously recorded deferred tax liabilities as a result of obtaining certain
multi-year tax incentives and the release of a valuation allowance on international deferred tax
assets as a result of a foreign subsidiary demonstrating consistent sustained profitability.
Offsetting the impact of the items occurring in 2006 were several favorable impacts to our rate
that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2007. These items included an increase in certain
federal tax incentives due to changes in legislation, tax benefits related to reductions in
international rates, and the recognition of state tax benefits resulting from the completion of an
audit.

Our effective income tax rate was 28.4% for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared with
34.2% for the year ended December 31, 2005. The majority of this rate differential resulted from
the favorable impact in 2006 of the items described above. These rate-reducing adjustments were
partly offset by the nonrecognition, in 2006, of tax benefits on compensation expense for incentive
stock options and employee stock purchase rights that were recognized in accordance with our
adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) effective January 1, 2006. In addition, 2005 tax expense increased due
to incremental taxes on repatriations pursuant to the

American Jobs Creation Act of 2004

.

At December 31, 2007, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards in certain state
jurisdictions of approximately $51.6 million available to offset future taxable income. Most of
these net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates through 2022 and the remainder
have indefinite lives. We have recorded a valuation allowance for all of these assets because
realizability is uncertain.

We consider certain operating earnings of non-United States subsidiaries to be indefinitely
invested outside the United States. The cumulative earnings of these subsidiaries were $129.6
million at December 31, 2007. No provision has been made for United States federal and state, or
international taxes that may result from future remittances of these undistributed earnings of
non-United States subsidiaries. Should we repatriate these earnings in the future, we would have to
adjust the income tax provision in the period in which the decision to repatriate earnings is made.
For the operating earnings not considered to be indefinitely invested outside the United States, we
have accrued taxes on a current basis.

F-28


NOTE 12. EARNINGS PER SHARE

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of
shares of common stock and vested deferred stock units outstanding during the year. The computation
of diluted earnings per share is similar to the computation of basic earnings per share, except
that the denominator is increased for the assumed exercise of dilutive options and other
potentially dilutive securities using the treasury stock method unless the effect is anti-dilutive.

The following is a reconciliation of shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per
share (

cash consideration, the number of shares of our common stock to be issued is fixed and issuance is
not contingent. See Note 4 for additional information regarding deferred compensation plans.

Certain options to acquire shares and restricted stock units have been excluded from the
calculation of shares outstanding for dilutive earnings per share because they were anti-dilutive.

NOTE
13. COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND GUARANTEES

We lease multiple facilities under operating leases that expire through 2021. In addition, we
are responsible for the real estate taxes and operating expenses related to these facilities. We
also have lease commitments for automobiles and office equipment. Rent expense charged to
operations under operating leases was approximately $10.9 million, $8.8 million and $7.7 million
for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

We purchase the slides sold for use in our VetTest

®

Chemistry Analyzers under an
agreement with Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, Inc. (“Ortho”) that, at December 31, 2007, required us
to purchase a minimum of $35.4 million of slides through 2010. We also have commitments under
certain other agreements that commit us to aggregate future payments of $10.2 million. In addition,
we have various minimum royalty payments due through 2024 of $10.9 million.

In connection with the acquisitions of businesses and intangible assets, we have commitments
outstanding at December 31, 2007 for additional purchase price payments of up to $1.7 million, of
which $0.8 million is contingent on the achievement by certain acquired businesses of specified
milestones. Additionally, we have agreed to make payments of up to $0.8 million to sellers of
certain acquired businesses that are conditional upon those sellers providing future services to
IDEXX for specified periods of time.

Prior to April 2006, we had a 40% equity interest in a joint venture to market production
animal diagnostic products in China. In April 2006, we paid $0.6 million to acquire an additional
55% equity interest in the joint venture from our partner and we also committed to pay an
additional $0.2 million over two years in consideration for the additional equity. In addition, the
joint venture entered into a contract with the joint venture partner where the partner provides
promotional and agency services and receives sales commissions at rates escalating from 2.5% to
8.5% annually based on sales volume. In connection with this step acquisition, we recognized $0.7
million of intangible assets in the Production Animal Segment.

Contingencies

We are subject to claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, including with respect
to actual and threatened litigation and other matters. We accrue contingent liabilities when it is
probable that future expenditures will be made and such expenditures can reasonably be estimated.
However, our actual losses with respect to these contingencies could exceed our accruals.

On June 30, 2006, Cyntegra, Inc. filed suit against us in the U.S. District Court for the
Central District of California alleging that we had violated U.S. federal antitrust laws and
California state unfair trade practices laws. The complaint alleged, among other things, that we
were monopolizing the U.S. market for companion animal diagnostic products. On October 26, 2007 the
Court granted summary judgment in our favor on all of Cyntegra’s claims and dismissed the suit.
Cyntegra has appealed this decision. We will continue to defend ourselves vigorously, as we believe
Cyntegra’s claims are without merit.

Under our workers’ compensation insurance policies for U.S. employees since January 1, 2003,
we have retained the first $250,000 in claim liability per incident and $2.8 million, $3.1 million,
$2.8 million, $3.0 million and $1.4 million, for 2007 through 2003, respectively, in aggregate
claim liability. The insurance company provides insurance for claims above the individual
occurrence and aggregate limits. We estimate claim liability based on claims incurred and the
estimated ultimate cost to settle the claims. Based on this analysis, we have recognized cumulative
expenses of $0.3 million, $1.2 million, $0.5 million, $0.8 million and $0.9 million for claims
incurred
during the years ended December 31, 2007 through 2003, respectively. Claims incurred during
the year ended December 31, 2007 and year ended December 31, 2006 are relatively new and
significant additional healthcare and wage indemnification costs could arise from those claims. Our
liability for claims incurred during the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 could exceed our
estimates and we could be liable for up to $2.5 million and $1.0 million, respectively, in excess
of the expense we have recognized. For the three years ended on or prior to December 31, 2005,
based on our retained claim liability per incident and our aggregate claim liability, our maximum
liability at December 31, 2007 is $0.4 million in excess of the amounts deemed probable and
previously recognized.

F-30


Under our current employee health care insurance policy, we retain claims liability risk up to
$250,000 per incident. We estimate our liability for the uninsured portion of employee health care
obligations that have been incurred but not reported based on individual coverage, our claims
experience, and the average time from when a claim is incurred to the time it is paid. We
recognized employee health care claim expense of $14.3 million, $10.8 million and $9.5 million
during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, which includes actual claims
paid and an estimate for our liability for the uninsured portion of employee health care
obligations that have been incurred but not paid. Should employee health insurance claims exceed
our estimated liability, we would have further obligations.

We have entered into employment agreements with two of our officers whereby payments may be
required if we terminate their employment without cause other than following a change in control.
The amounts payable are based upon the executives’ salaries at the time of termination and the cost
to us of continuing to provide certain benefits. Had both of such officers been terminated at
December 31, 2007, we would have had aggregate obligations for salaries and benefits of
approximately $2.1 million under such agreements. We have entered into employment agreements with
each of our officers that require us to make certain payments in the event the officer’s employment
is terminated under certain circumstances within a certain period following a change in control of
our stock. The amounts payable by us under these agreements is based on the officer’s salary and
bonus history at the time of termination and the cost to us of continuing to provide certain
benefits. Had all of our officers been terminated in qualifying terminations following a change in
control at December 31, 2007, we would have had aggregate obligations of approximately $13.1
million under these agreements. These agreements also provide for the acceleration of the vesting
of all stock options and restricted stock units upon any qualifying termination following a change
in control.

From time to time, we have received notices alleging that our products infringe third-party
proprietary rights, although we are not aware of any pending litigation with respect to such
claims. Patent litigation frequently is complex and expensive, and the outcome of patent litigation
can be difficult to predict. There can be no assurance that we will prevail in any infringement
proceedings that may be commenced against us. If we lose any such litigation, we may be stopped
from selling certain products and/or we may be required to pay damages as a result of the
litigation.

Guarantees

The following is a summary of our agreements and obligations that we have determined to be
within the scope of FIN 45, “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees
Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others, an Interpretation of FASB No. 5, 57 and
107 and a Rescission of FASB Interpretation No. 34” (“FIN 45”).

In October 2005, our former supplier of VetAutoread™ Hematology Analyzers and consumables sold
this business (including the human hematology testing products division) and we simultaneously
entered into a new supply agreement for these products with the acquirer of the business. Under
this new supply agreement, we received fixed pricing on certain products through December 31, 2020,
among other benefits. In partial consideration for this new supply agreement, we paid cash of $2.5
million to the acquirer and guaranteed the acquirer’s note (the “Note”) in the principal amount of
$3.5 million given to our former supplier in partial consideration for the business. The acquirer
is obligated to pay the Note through quarterly principal and interest payments through 2008 and to
pay the remaining balance in 2008. The principal balance of the note that we have guaranteed was
$1.7 million at December 31, 2007. We recorded the fair value of the guaranty of $0.5 million and
recognized the associated assets at the effective date of the agreement. At December 31, 2007, we
have written off the guaranty liability because our recognized contractual liabilities to the
supplier exceed the principal balance of the
Note and a legal right of offset exists whereby we may elect to pay to the holder of the Note
the amounts otherwise due to the supplier. We are obligated to make a second payment of $1.25
million upon the achievement of certain milestones by the acquirer, which occurred in January 2008,
and a third payment of $1.25 million in January 2009. The proceeds of the second payment were used
to reduce the Note balance. In February 2008, the acquirer paid the remaining payment under the
Note, which released our guaranty.

F-31


We enter into agreements with third parties in the ordinary course of business under which we
are obligated to indemnify such third parties for and against various risks and losses. The precise
terms of such indemnities vary with the nature of the agreement. In many cases, we limit the
maximum amount of our indemnification obligations, but in some cases those obligations may be
theoretically unlimited. We have not incurred material expenses in discharging any of these
indemnification obligations, and based on our analysis of the nature of the risks involved, we
believe that the fair value of these agreements is minimal. Accordingly, we have recorded no
liabilities for these obligations at December 31, 2007 and 2006.

When acquiring a business, we sometimes assume liability for certain events or occurrences
that took place prior to the date of acquisition. However, we do not believe that we have any
probable pre-acquisition liabilities or guarantees that should be recognized at December 31, 2007
and 2006.

NOTE 14. PREFERRED STOCK

Our board of directors is authorized, subject to any limitations prescribed by law, without
further stockholder approval, to issue from time to time up to 500,000 shares of Preferred Stock,
$1.00 par value per share (“Preferred Stock”), in one or more series. Each such series of Preferred
Stock shall have such number of shares, designations, preferences, voting powers, qualifications
and special or relative rights or privileges as shall be determined by the board of directors,
which may include, among others, dividend rights, voting rights, redemption and sinking fund
provisions, liquidation preferences, conversion rights and preemptive rights.

Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock

On December 17, 1996, we designated 100,000 shares of Preferred Stock as Series A Junior
Participating Preferred Stock (“Series A Stock”) in connection with the adoption of our Shareholder
Rights Plan. In general, each share of Series A Stock will: (i) be entitled to a minimum
preferential quarterly dividend of $10 per share and to an aggregate dividend of 1,000 times the
dividend declared per share of Common Stock, (ii) in the event of liquidation, be entitled to a
minimum preferential liquidation payment of $1,000 per share (plus accrued and unpaid dividends)
and to an aggregate payment of 1,000 times the payment made per share of Common Stock, (iii) have
1,000 votes, voting together with the Common Stock, (iv) in the event of any merger, consolidation
or other transaction in which Common Stock is exchanged, be entitled to receive 1,000 times the
amount received per share of Common Stock and (v) not be redeemable. These rights are protected by
customary anti-dilution provisions. There are no shares of Series A Stock outstanding and the
Shareholder Rights Plan expired on December 31, 2007.

NOTE 15. TREASURY STOCK

The board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to 40,000,000 shares of our common
stock in the open market or in negotiated transactions. We believe that the repurchase of our
common stock is a favorable investment and we also repurchase to offset the dilutive effect of our
employee share-based compensation programs. Repurchases of our common stock may vary depending upon
the level of other investing activities and the share price.

From the inception of the program in August 1999 to December 31, 2007, we repurchased
33,148,000 shares for $690.2 million. From the inception of the program to December 31, 2007, we
also received 352,000 shares of stock with a market value of $6.5 million that were surrendered by
employees in payment for the minimum required withholding taxes due on the exercise of stock
options, vesting of restricted stock units and settlement of deferred stock units, and in payment
for the exercise price of stock options.

NOTE 16. IDEXX RETIREMENT AND INCENTIVE SAVINGS PLAN

We have established the IDEXX Retirement and Incentive Savings Plan (the “401(k) Plan”).
Employees eligible to participate in the 401(k) Plan may contribute specified percentages of their
salaries, a portion of which will be matched by us. We matched $3.4 million, $2.7 million, and $2.4
million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. In addition, we may
make contributions to the 401(k) Plan at the discretion of the board of directors. There were no
discretionary contributions in 2007, 2006, and 2005.

NOTE 17. SEGMENT REPORTING

We disclose information regarding our segments in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No.
131, “Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information” (“SFAS No. 131”). SFAS
No. 131 requires disclosures about operating segments in annual financial statements and requires
selected information about operating segments in interim financial statements. It also requires
related disclosures about products and services and about geographic areas. Operating segments are
defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that
is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision-maker, or decision-making group, in deciding
how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Our chief operating decision-maker is the
Chief Executive Officer.

We are organized into business units by market and customer group. Our reportable segments
include: products and services for the veterinary market, which we refer to as our Companion Animal
Group (“CAG”), water quality products (“Water”), and products for production animal health, which
we refer to as the Production Animal Segment (“PAS”). We also operate two smaller segments that
comprise products for dairy quality, which we refer to as Dairy, and products for the human medical
diagnostic market, which we refer to as OPTI Medical. Financial information about the Dairy and
OPTI Medical operating segments are combined and presented in an “Other” category because they do
not meet the quantitative or qualitative thresholds for reportable segments. CAG develops, designs,
manufactures, and distributes products and performs services for veterinarians. Water develops,
designs, manufactures and distributes products to detect contaminants in water. PAS develops,
designs, manufactures and distributes products to detect disease in production animals. Dairy
develops, designs, manufactures and distributes products to detect contaminants in dairy products.
OPTI Medical develops, designs, manufactures, and distributes point-of-care electrolyte and blood
gas analyzers and related consumable products for the human medical diagnostics market. The segment
information for the year ended December 31, 2005 has been restated to conform to our presentation
of reportable segments for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006. Previously, PAS and Dairy
were aggregated into a single reportable segment, which we referred to as the Food Diagnostics
Group.

Items that are not allocated to our operating segments are comprised primarily of corporate
research and development expenses, interest income and expense, and income taxes. Share-based
compensation expense was also reported in “unallocated amounts” in 2006. Beginning in 2007, we
allocate a portion of share-based compensation expense to the operating segments. This allocation
differs from the actual expense and consequently yields a difference between the total allocated
share-based compensation expense and the actual expense for the total company, which was
categorized as “unallocated amounts.”

F-33


The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in the
summary of significant accounting policies except that most interest income and expenses and income
taxes are not allocated to individual operating segments. Below is our segment information (
