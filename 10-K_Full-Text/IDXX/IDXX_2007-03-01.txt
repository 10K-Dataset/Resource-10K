PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

During
2006, we operated primarily through three reportable segments: products and services for
the veterinary market, which we refer to as our Companion Animal Group (“CAG”),
water quality products (“Water”) and products for production animal health,
which we refer to as the Production Animal Segment (“PAS”). We also operated a
smaller segment that comprises products for dairy quality, which we refer to as Dairy.
Financial information about the Dairy operating segment is presented in an “Other” category. As
of January 2007, we have added an operating segment, which we refer to as OPTI Medical
Systems (“OPTI Medical”), in connection with our acquisition of the Critical
Care Division of Osmetech plc, which is presented in an “Other” category. OPTI Medical develops, manufactures, and sells
point-of-care electrolyte and blood gas analyzers and related consumable products for the
human medical diagnostics market. See Note 16 to the
consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2006 included in this
Form 10-K for financial information about our segments, including geographic information,
and about our product and service categories.

COMPANION ANIMAL GROUP

Instruments and
Consumables

We
currently market an integrated and highly flexible suite of in-house laboratory analyzers
for use in veterinary practices that we refer to as the IDEXX VetLab

®

suite
of analyzers. The IDEXX VetLab

®

suite includes several instrument systems,
as well as associated proprietary consumable products that are described below:

Blood
and Urine Chemistry

. Our VetTest

®

Chemistry Analyzer is used to measure
levels of certain enzymes and other substances in blood or urine in order to assist the
veterinarian in diagnosing physiologic conditions. Twenty-six separate tests can be
performed on the VetTest

®

Chemistry Analyzer and additional parameters can
be calculated. Blood tests commonly run include glucose, alkaline phosphatase, ALT
(alanine aminotransferase), creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (“BUN”) and total
protein. The VetTest

®

Chemistry Analyzer also runs tests for urine
protein/urine creatinine ratio, which assists in the detection of early renal disease.
Tests are sold individually and in prepackaged panels, such as the Preanesthetic Panel,
the General Health Profile, the Equine Panel, the Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug
(“NSAID”) Monitoring Panel, the Quality Control Panel and the Diagnostic Health
Profile.

Our
VetLyte

®

analyzer measures three electrolytes—sodium, potassium and
chloride—to aid in evaluating acid-base and electrolyte balances and assessing plasma
hydration. We purchase our VetLyte

®

Electrolyte Analyzers and consumables
from Roche Diagnostics Corporation.

Our
VetStat

®

analyzer measures electrolytes, blood gases, glucose and ionized
calcium, and calculates other parameters, such as bicarbonate and anion gap. These
measurements aid veterinarians in evaluating fluid therapy choices and measuring
respiratory function. The VetStat

®

Electrolyte and Blood Gas Analyzer runs
single-use disposable cassettes that contain various configurations of analytes. On
January 31, 2007 we acquired the Critical Care Division of Osmetech plc, which had been
our supplier of VetStat

®

analyzers and consumables. See the section titled
“OPTI Medical Systems” below.

We
purchase all of the reagents used in the VetTest

®

Chemistry Analyzer
(“dry chemistry slides” or “VetTest

®

slides”) from
Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, Inc. (“Ortho”), a subsidiary of Johnson &
Johnson. See “Business-Production and Supply.” In October 2003, we entered into
an agreement with Ortho under which we are developing a next-generation chemistry analyzer
for the veterinary market, named Catalyst Dx™, which is based primarily on
Ortho’s dry-slide technology. Ortho will provide slide consumables used in both the
VetTest

®

Chemistry Analyzer and the new analyzer through 2020. Catalyst
Dx™ will provide significantly improved throughput, ease of use and menu, including
the ability to run electrolytes. We expect Catalyst Dx™ to be commercially available
in January 2008. We also expect to be selling and supporting VetTest

®

for
the foreseeable future.

Chemistry
reagent sales from our installed base of chemistry analyzers provide the majority of
consumables volumes and revenues from our installed base of IDEXX VetLab

®

equipment.


Hematology

.
          We sell two hematology analyzers: the LaserCyte

®

Hematology Analyzer, which uses laser-flow cytometry technology to analyze components of
          blood, including red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets; and the
          VetAutoread™ Hematology Analyzer. We manufacture the           LaserCyte

®

internally
and source the consumable through a           contract manufacturing arrangement.

Quantitative
Immunoassay Testing

. The IDEXX SNAP

®

Reader allows the veterinarian to
obtain quantitative measurements of total thyroxine (“T


”), cortisol
and bile acids. T


and cortisol

measurements assist in diagnosing
and monitoring the treatment of certain endocrine diseases, such as hyper- and
hypothyroidism, Cushing’s syndrome and Addison’s disease. Bile acid measurements
assist in the diagnosis of liver disease. Samples and reagents are introduced to the
analyzer using our SNAP

®

platform.

We
have under development and plan to launch a new quantitative immunoassay platform by
January 2008, called SNAPshot Dx

™

, which will replace the IDEXX
SNAP

®

Reader. SNAPshot Dx

™

is designed to significantly
improve ease of use, throughput and menu. We will manufacture this instrument and its
consumables internally.

Urinalysis.

Our
IDEXX VetLab

®

UA™ provides rapid, semi-quantitative
          urinalysis and is validated specifically for veterinary use.

IDEXX
VetLab

®

Station

. We sell IDEXX VetLab

®

Station
(“IVLS”) as an integral component of the LaserCyte system and also as a
standalone hardware platform. In both cases, IVLS physically connects and integrates all
the IDEXX VetLab

®

equipment and provides a laboratory information
management system capability. IVLS includes a user interface to run the individual
equipment; generates one integrated patient report; stores, retrieves and analyzes
historical patient diagnostics data; and connects to practice information management
systems, including IDEXX Cornerstone

®

and Better Choice® systems, as
well as a wide variety of third-party systems.

Rapid Assays

We
provide a broad range of single-use, handheld test kits under the SNAP

®

name that allow quick, accurate and convenient test results for a variety of companion
animal diseases and health conditions. These products enable veterinarians to provide
improved service to animal owners by delivering test results and a diagnosis at the time
of the patient visit, allowing the veterinarian to initiate therapy or prevention, if
required. These kits work without the use of instrumentation. We also plan to provide, in
2008, the capability to have SNAPshot Dx

™

interpret all SNAP results and
add these results automatically to the patient’s electronic medical record.

Our
principal single-use tests include canine combination parasite tests called
SNAP

®

3Dx

®

, which tests simultaneously for Lyme disease,

Ehrlichia canis

and heartworm, and SNAP

®

4Dx

®

, which
additionally tests for

Anaplasma phagocytophilum

; a canine heartworm-only test; a
canine test for parvovirus; a feline combination test, the SNAP

®

Combo FIV
antibody/FeLV antigen test, which enables veterinarians to test simultaneously for feline
immunodeficiency virus (“FIV”) (which is similar to the human AIDS virus) and
feline leukemia virus (“FeLV”); a feline test for FeLV only; and canine and
feline tests for

Giardia

, a parasitic disease. Sales of canine parasite tests,
including the heartworm only test, are greater in the first half of our fiscal year due to
seasonality of disease testing in the veterinary practice.

In
May 2006 we acquired intellectual property and distribution rights related to certain
canine and feline rapid assay products from Agen Biomedical Limited. We sell these tests
primarily in Asia and Australia.

In
addition to our single-use tests, we sell a line of microwell-based test kits, under the
PetChek

®

name, that are used by larger clinics and laboratories to test
multiple samples. PetChek

®

tests offer accuracy, ease of use and cost
advantages to high-volume customers. We currently sell PetChek

®

tests for
canine heartworm disease, FIV, and FeLV.

Veterinary Reference
Laboratory and Consulting Services

We
offer commercial veterinary reference laboratory and consulting services to veterinarians
in the U.S., Canada, Europe, Australia, Japan, and South Africa. Veterinarians use our
services by submitting samples by courier or overnight delivery to one of our facilities.
Our laboratories offer a large selection of tests and diagnostic panels to detect a number
of disease states and other conditions in production and companion animals.


Additionally,
we provide specialized veterinary consultation, telemedicine and advisory services,
including cardiology, radiology, internal medicine and ultrasound consulting. These
services permit veterinarians to obtain readings and interpretations of test results
transmitted by telephone and over the Internet from the veterinarians’ offices.

Practice Information
Management Systems and Digital Radiography

Practice
Information Management Systems and Services

. We develop, market and sell practice
information management systems (“PIMS”) including hardware and software that run
key functions of veterinary clinics, including patient electronic health records
management, scheduling (including boarding and grooming), billing and inventory
management. Our principal system is the Cornerstone

®

system. We believe we
are one of the leading providers of veterinary practice information management systems in
North America, with an installed base of more than 6,600 of the approximately 28,000
veterinary hospitals in North America. We also provide software and hardware support to
our PIMS customers, and related supplies and services to veterinary PIMS users in general,
and we derive a significant portion of our revenues for this product line from ongoing
service contracts.

Digital
Radiography Systems and Services

. Our digital radiography systems capture radiograph
images in digital form, replacing traditional x-ray film. Use of digital radiography
systems eliminates the need for the film and processor, hazardous chemicals and darkroom
required for the production of film images, and provides for image manipulation and
enhancement through contrast management. We market and sell three digital radiography
systems, the IDEXX-DR™ 1417 and the IDEXX-CR™ 1417 systems for use in the small
animal (e.g., dogs and cats) veterinary hospital, and the IDEXX EquiView® DR system
for use as a portable unit in ambulatory veterinary practices, such as equine practices.
Our digital radiography systems use IDEXX-PACS™ picture archiving and communication
system (“PACS”) software for the viewing, manipulation, management, storage and
retrieval of the digital images generated by the digital capture plate. The
IDEXX-PACS™ software also permits images from our digital radiography systems to be
integrated into patients’ medical records in the Cornerstone

®

system,
as well as transferred to other practice information management systems.

Pharmaceutical Products

We
develop, market and sell pharmaceuticals for the veterinary market. We currently market
and sell four pharmaceutical products: PZI VET

®

, an insulin product for the
treatment of diabetic cats; Acarexx

®

(.01% ivermectin) otic suspension for
the treatment of ear mites in cats; SURPASS

®

(1% diclofenac sodium), a
topical, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug for equine use; and Navigator

®

(32% nitazoxanide) Antiprotozoal Oral Paste, a treatment for equine protozoal
myeloencephalitis (“EPM”). See “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors – We May
be Required to Discontinue Sales of One of Our Veterinary Pharmaceutical Products.”

WATER

We
offer a range of products used in the detection of various microbiological analytes in
water.

Our
Colilert

®

, Colilert

®

-18 and Colisure

®

tests
simultaneously detect total coliforms and

E. coli

in water. These organisms are
broadly used as indicators of microbial contamination in water. These products utilize
indicator-nutrients that produce a change in color or fluorescence when metabolized by
target microbes in the sample. Our water tests are used by government laboratories, water
utilities and private certified laboratories to test drinking water in compliance with
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) standards. The tests also are used
in evaluating water used in production processes (for example, in beverage and
pharmaceutical applications) and in evaluating bottled water, recreational water, waste
water and water from private wells.

Our
Enterolert™ product detects enterococci in drinking and recreational waters. Our
Quanti-Tray

®

products, when used in conjunction with our
Colilert

®

, Colilert

®

-18, Colisure

®

or
Enterolert™ products, provide users quantitative measurements of microbial
contamination, rather than a presence/absence indication. The Colilert

®

,
Colilert

®

-18, Colisure® and Quanti-Tray

®

products have
been approved by the EPA and by regulatory agencies in certain other countries.


Our
Filta-Max

®

product is used in the detection of

Cryptosporidia

in
water.

Cryptosporidia

are parasites that can cause potentially fatal
gastrointestinal illness if ingested. Testing of water supplies for

Cryptosporidia

has been mandated by regulation only in the United Kingdom. On December 29, 2006, the
Drinking Water Inspectorate in the U.K. published a proposal to discontinue the regulation
that requires testing water supplies for

Cryptosporidia

effective as of December
22, 2007 or, if approved by the regulator, at an earlier date. If this proposal is
adopted, we believe that we will lose a substantial portion of our sales of Filta-Max
products in England and Wales, which were $2.9 million in the year ended December 31,
2006.

PRODUCTION ANIMAL SEGMENT

We
sell diagnostic tests and related instrumentation that are used to detect a wide range of
diseases and to monitor health status in production animals. Our production animal
products are purchased primarily by government laboratories and poultry and swine
producers. Significant products include diagnostic tests for porcine reproductive and
respiratory syndrome and pseudorabies virus in pigs; Newcastle disease in poultry; and
Johne’s disease, bovine viral diarrhea virus, and brucellosis in cattle.

We
have developed a postmortem test for bovine spongiform encephalopathy (“BSE” or
“mad cow disease”). This test was approved for use in the U.S. by the United
States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) in 2004 and for use in the European
Union (“EU”) by the European Commission in February 2005. We also offer related
tests for the detection of similar diseases, such as scrapie in small ruminants, including
sheep, and Chronic Wasting Disease in deer. Testing for BSE in the U.S. is limited and we
do not know when or if the USDA will expand its testing program, which would increase the
domestic market for these tests.

On
January 26, 2007 we announced that we had entered into an agreement to acquire all of the
shares of Institut Pourquier. Based in Montpellier, France, Institut Pourquier develops,
manufactures and sells production animal diagnostic products. The closing of this
transaction is subject to certain conditions and is expected to occur in March 2007.
Institut Pourquier had sales of approximately $7.5 million in 2006.

OTHER

Dairy

Our
principal product for use in testing for antibiotic residue in milk is the
SNAP

®

beta-lactam test. Dairy producers and processors use our tests for
quality assurance of raw milk, and government and food-quality managers use them for
ongoing surveillance.

In
March 2003, we entered into an agreement with the FDA under which we agreed, among other
things, to perform specified lot release and stability testing of our SNAP

®

beta-lactam products and to provide related data to the FDA. If the FDA were to determine
that one or more lots of product failed to meet applicable criteria for product
performance or stability, the FDA could take various actions, including requiring us to
recall products or restricting our ability to sell these products. Sales of dairy
antibiotic residue testing products were $15.4 million in 2006.

OPTI Medical Systems

We
sell OPTI

®

point-of-care analyzers and related consumables for use in human
medical hospitals and clinics to measure electrolytes, blood gases, acid-base balance,
glucose and ionized calcium, and to calculate other parameters such as bicarbonate and
anion gap. These analyzers are used primarily in emergency rooms, operating rooms, cardiac
monitoring areas and any locations where time-critical diagnostic testing is performed
within the hospital setting. The OPTI

®

CCA Electrolyte and Blood Gas
Analyzer runs single-use disposable cassettes that contain various configurations of
analytes; the OPTI

®

R analyzer runs reusable cassettes in various analyte
configurations; and the OPTI

®

Lion analyzer runs single-use electrolyte
cassettes.


MARKETING AND
DISTRIBUTION

We
market, sell and service our products worldwide through our marketing, sales and technical
service groups, as well as through independent distributors and other resellers. We
maintain sales offices outside the U.S. in Australia, China, France, Germany, Italy,
Japan, the Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland, Taiwan and the United Kingdom. Sales and
marketing expense was $115.9 million, $102.0 million and $85.7 million in 2006, 2005 and
2004, respectively, or 16% of sales in each year.

Generally,
we select the appropriate distribution channel for our products based on the type of
product, technical service requirements, number and concentration of customers, regulatory
requirements and other factors. We market our veterinary diagnostic and pharmaceutical
products to veterinarians both directly and through independent veterinary distributors in
the U.S., with most instruments sold directly by IDEXX sales personnel, and test kits,
pharmaceutical products and instrument consumables supplied primarily by the distribution
channel. Outside the U.S., we sell our veterinary diagnostic products through our direct
sales force and, in certain countries, through distributors and other resellers. We sell
our reference laboratory services worldwide through our direct sales force. We market our
software and digital radiography products through our direct sales force primarily in the
U.S. We market our water and food diagnostics products primarily through our direct sales
force in the U.S. and Canada. Outside the U.S. and Canada, we market these products
through selected independent distributors and, in certain countries, through our direct
sales force. We sell our OPTI

®

electrolyte and blood gas analyzers both
directly and through independent human medical product distributors in the U.S. and sell
most of the related consumables through the distribution channel. Outside the U.S., we
sell our OPTI

®

electrolyte and blood gas analyzers and related consumables
through our direct sales force and through distributors and other resellers.

Our
largest customers are our U.S. distributors of our products in the CAG segment. In 2005,
two of our CAG distributors merged and, as a result, the combined company, Butler Animal
Health Supply, LLC, accounted for 9% and 10% of our 2006 and 2005 revenue, respectively,
and 5% and 4% of our net accounts receivable at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

Our
business includes the development and introduction of new products and services and may
involve entry into new business areas. Our research and development activity is focused
primarily on development of new diagnostic instrument platforms and information systems,
new immunoassay devices, new diagnostic tests, new animal drugs, enhanced practice
information systems, and improvements in the performance, connectivity, usability, and
interoperability of our products and services. Our research and development expenses,
which consist of salaries, employee benefits, materials and consulting costs, were $53.6
million, $40.9 million and $35.4 million, or 7.3%, 6.4% and 6.4% of sales, in 2006, 2005
and 2004, respectively.

PATENTS AND LICENSES

We
actively seek to obtain patent protection in the U.S. and other countries for inventions
covering our products and technologies. We also license patents and technologies from
third parties. These licenses include an exclusive royalty-bearing license of certain
patents relating to diagnostic products for FIV that expire in 2009, from The Regents of
the University of California; and exclusive licenses from Tulane University and the
University of Texas to certain patents and patent applications expiring beginning in 2019
that relate to the detection of Lyme disease. We also have an exclusive royalty-bearing
license of certain patents expiring in 2007 relating to defined substrate technology
(“DST”) that is utilized in the Colilert

®

,
Colilert

®

-18, Colisure

®

and Enterolert™ water testing
products, although we do not believe the expiration of the DST patents in 2007 will have a
material effect on our water business. In addition, we hold a U.S. patent expiring in 2014
that specifically covers the Colilert

®

-18 product and another patent
expiring in 2014 that relates to certain methods and kits for simultaneously detecting
antigens and antibodies, and which covers certain of our SNAP

®

products,
including our SNAP

®

Combo FIV/FeLV and Canine SNAP

®

3Dx

®

and 4Dx

®

combination tests.

To
the extent some of our products may now, or in the future, embody technologies protected
by patents, copyrights or trade secrets of others, we may be required to obtain licenses
to such technologies in order to continue to sell our products. These licenses may not be
available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our failure to obtain any such
licenses may delay or prevent the sale of certain new or existing products. See “Part
I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.”


PRODUCTION AND SUPPLY

VetTest

®

Chemistry Analyzers are manufactured for us by Tokyo Parts Industrial Company, Ltd. under
an agreement that renews annually unless either party notifies the other of its decision
not to renew. VetTest

®

slides are supplied exclusively by Ortho under
supply agreements with Ortho (the “Ortho Agreements”). We are required to
purchase all of our requirements for our current menu of VetTest

®

slides
from Ortho to the extent Ortho is able to supply those requirements. In addition, we have
committed to minimum annual purchase volumes of certain VetTest

®

slides
through 2010. Under these agreements Ortho will also supply the slide consumables used in
the Catalyst Dx™ chemistry analyzer. The Ortho Agreements expire on December 31,
2020.

The
VetAutoread™ Hematology Analyzer is manufactured for us by QBC Diagnostics, Inc.
(“QBCD”) under a supply agreement that expires on December 31, 2020. The
VetLyte

®

Electrolyte Analyzer is manufactured for us by Roche Diagnostics
Corporation under an agreement that requires Roche Diagnostics to supply analyzers through
December 31, 2007, and consumables and spare parts through December 31, 2013. We have
certain minimum purchase obligations under these agreements.

We
purchase certain other products, raw materials and components from a single supplier.
These include active ingredients for our pharmaceutical products, certain digital
radiography systems, certain other instruments, instrument consumables, and certain
components used in our SNAP

®

rapid assay devices, water testing products,
and instruments, including in LaserCyte

®

Hematology Analyzers. We have in
the past been successful in ensuring an uninterrupted supply of products purchased from
single source suppliers. However, there can be no assurance that uninterrupted supply can
be maintained if these agreements terminate for any reason or our suppliers otherwise are
unable to satisfy our requirements for products.

We
do not generally maintain significant backlog and believe that our backlog at any
particular date historically has not been indicative of future sales.

COMPETITION

We
face intense competition within the markets in which we sell our products and services. We
expect that future competition will become even more intense, and that we will have to
compete with changing technologies, which could affect the marketability of our products
and services. Our competitive position also will depend on our ability to develop
proprietary products, attract and retain qualified scientific and other personnel, develop
and implement production and marketing plans, obtain or license patent rights, and obtain
adequate capital resources.

We
compete with many companies ranging from small businesses focused on animal health to
large pharmaceutical and human medical diagnostics companies. Our competitors vary in our
different markets. Academic institutions, governmental agencies and other public and
private research organizations also conduct research activities and may commercialize
products, which could compete with our products, on their own or through joint ventures.
Some of our competitors have substantially greater capital, manufacturing, marketing, and
research and development resources than we do.

Competitive
factors in our different business areas are detailed below:

•

Veterinary
diagnostic products and food and water testing products

. We compete primarily on the
basis of the ease of use, speed, accuracy, completeness and other performance
characteristics of our products and services (including unique tests), the breadth of our
product line and services, the effectiveness of our sales and distribution channels, the
quality of our technical and customer service, and our pricing relative to the value of
our products.

•

Veterinary
laboratory and consulting services

. In this market, we compete primarily on the basis
of quality, consistency of service levels, technology, and our pricing relative to the
value of our services. We compete in most geographic locations in the U.S. with Antech
Diagnostics, a unit of VCA Antech, Inc.

•

Veterinary
pharmaceuticals

. We compete primarily on the basis of the performance characteristics
of our products.


•

Practice
Information Management and Digital Radiography Systems

. We compete primarily on the
basis of ease of use, functionality, connectivity to equipment and other systems,
performance characteristics, effectiveness of our customer service, information handling
capabilities, advances in technologies, and our pricing relative to the value of our
products and services.

•

Electrolyte
and Blood Gas Analyzers for the human medical diagnostics point-of-care market

. In
this market we compete primarily with large human medical diagnostics companies such as
Radiometer A/S, Siemens Medical Solutions Diagnostics, Instrumentation Laboratory, Abbott
Diagnostics, and Roche Diagnostics. We compete primarily on the basis of ease of use,
menu, convenience, international distribution and service, instrument reliability, and
our pricing relative to the value of our products.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION

Many
of our products are subject to regulation by U.S. and foreign regulatory agencies. The
following is a description of the principal regulations affecting our businesses.

Veterinary
diagnostic products

. Most diagnostic tests for animal health applications, including
our production animal products and our rapid assay lines of business, are veterinary
biological products for infectious diseases that are regulated in the U.S. by the Center
for Veterinary Biologics within the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service
(“APHIS”). The APHIS regulatory approval process involves the submission of
product performance data and manufacturing documentation. Following regulatory approval to
market a product, APHIS requires that each lot of product be submitted for review before
release to customers. In addition, APHIS requires special approval to market products
where test results are used in part for government-mandated disease management programs. A
number of foreign governments accept APHIS approval as part of their separate regulatory
approvals. However, compliance with an extensive regulatory process is required in
connection with marketing diagnostic products in Japan, Germany, the Netherlands and many
other countries. We also are required to have a facility license from APHIS to manufacture
USDA-licensed products. We have obtained such a license for our manufacturing facility in
Westbrook, Maine and our distribution center in Memphis, Tennessee.

Our
veterinary diagnostic instrument systems are medical devices regulated by the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration (“FDA”) under the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act (the
“FDC Act”). While the sale of these products does not require premarket approval
by FDA and does not subject us to the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices
regulations (“cGMP”), these products must not be adulterated or misbranded under
the FDC Act.

Veterinary
pharmaceuticals

. The manufacture and sale of veterinary pharmaceuticals are regulated
by the Center for Veterinary Medicine (“CVM”) of the FDA. A new animal drug may
not be commercially marketed in the U.S. unless it has been approved as safe and effective
by CVM. Approval may be requested by filing a new animal drug application
(“NADA”) with CVM containing substantial evidence as to the safety and
effectiveness of the drug. Data regarding manufacturing methods and controls also are
required to be submitted with the NADA. Manufacturers of animal drugs must also comply
with cGMP and Good Laboratory Practices (“GLP”). Sales of animal drugs in
countries outside the U.S. require compliance with the laws of those countries, which may
be extensive.

Water
testing products

. Our water tests are not subject to formal premarket regulatory
approval. However, before a test can be used as part of a water-quality monitoring program
in the U.S. that is required by the EPA, the test must first be approved by the EPA. The
EPA approval process involves submission of extensive product performance data in
accordance with an EPA-approved protocol, evaluation of the data by the EPA and
publication for public comment of any proposed approval in the Federal Register before
final approval. Our Colilert

®

, Colilert

®

-18,
Colisure

®

, Quanti-Tray

®

, Filta-Max

®

and
SimPlate

®

for heterotropic plate counts (“HPC”) products have
been approved by the EPA. The sale of water testing products also is subject to extensive
and lengthy regulatory processes in many other countries around the world.

Dairy
testing products

. The sale of dairy testing products in the U.S. is regulated by the
FDA in conjunction with the AOAC Research Institute (“AOAC RI”). Before a
product can be sold, extensive product performance data must be submitted in accordance
with a protocol that is approved by the FDA and the AOAC RI. Following approval of a
product by the FDA, the product must also be approved by the National Conference on
Interstate Milk Shipments (“NCIMS”), an oversight body that includes state,
federal and industry representatives. Our dairy antibiotic residue testing products have
been approved by the FDA and NCIMS. While some foreign countries accept AOAC RI approval
as part of their regulatory approval process, many countries have separate regulatory
processes.


Human
point-of-care electrolyte and blood gas analyzers

. Our OPTI

®

instrument
systems are classified as Class II medical devices, and their design, manufacture and
marketing is regulated by the FDA. Accordingly, we must comply with cGMP in the
manufacture of our OPTI

®

products. The FDA’s Quality System
regulations further set forth standards for product design and manufacturing processes,
require the maintenance of certain records, and provide for inspections of our facilities
by the FDA. New OPTI

®

products fall into FDA classifications that require
notification of and review by the FDA before marketing, submitted as a 510(k) application.

OPTI

®

products are also subject to regulations governing the manufacture and marketing of
medical devices in each country in which they are sold. The European Medical Device
Directives create a single set of medical device regulations for all EU member countries,
and they require companies that wish to manufacture and distribute medical devices in EU
member countries to obtain European Conformity (“CE”) marking for their
products. We have obtained authorization to apply the CE marking to our
OPTI

®

products.

Any
acquisitions of new products and technologies may subject us to additional areas of
government regulation. These may involve food, drug, medical device and water-quality
regulations of the FDA, the EPA and the USDA, as well as state, local and foreign
governments. See “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.”

EMPLOYEES

At
December 31, 2006, we had approximately 3,900 full-time and part-time employees. We are
not a party to any collective bargaining agreement and we believe that relations with our
employees are good.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Our
future operating results involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual events or
results may differ materially from those discussed in this report. Factors that could
cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, the factors
discussed below, as well as those discussed elsewhere in this report.

We May
Be Unsuccessful in Maintaining Our Growth Rate

Our
ability to maintain our growth rate depends on our successful implementation of various
strategies, including:

•

Developing,
manufacturing and marketing innovative new products with new features, functions and
capabilities, including in-house laboratory analyzers such as Catalyst Dx™ and
SNAPshot Dx

™

, rapid assay and other specialized diagnostic tests and
services, water testing products, production animal diagnostic products, and companion
animal veterinary pharmaceuticals, as well as improving and enhancing existing products;

•

Developing
and implementing new technology and licensing strategies; and identifying, completing and
integrating acquisitions that enhance our existing businesses or create new business
areas for us;

•

Increasing
the value to our customers of our companion animal products and services by enhancing the
integration of these products, including the interoperability among the IDEXX VetLab

®

instrument
suite, Cornerstone

®

practice information management system, the IDEXX-PACS™ software
and IDEXX Reference Laboratories;

•

Expanding
our market by expanding the installed base of our instrumentation through customer
acquisition and retention and increasing use of our products by our customers; and

•

Strengthening
our sales and marketing activities both within the U.S. and in geographies outside of the
U.S.


However,
we may not be able to successfully implement some or all of these strategies and increase
or sustain our rate of growth or profitability.

Various Government
Regulations Could Limit or Delay Our Ability to Market and Sell Our Products

In
the U.S., the manufacture and sale of our products are regulated by agencies such as the
USDA, FDA and the EPA. Most diagnostic tests for animal health applications, including our
canine, feline, poultry and livestock tests, must be approved by the USDA prior to sale.
Our water testing products must be approved by the EPA before they can be used by
customers in the U.S. as a part of a water quality monitoring program required by the EPA.
Our pharmaceutical and dairy testing products require approval by the FDA. The manufacture
and sale of our OPTI

®

line of human point-of-care electrolytes and blood
gas analyzers, which we acquired in January 2007, are regulated by the FDA and require
approval by the FDA before they may be sold commercially. The manufacture and sale of our
products are subject to similar laws in many foreign countries. Any failure to comply with
legal and regulatory requirements relating to the manufacture and sale of our products in
the U.S. or in other countries could result in fines and sanctions against us or removals
of our products from the market, which could have a material adverse effect on our results
of operations.

We
are subject to an agreement with the FDA under which we are required, among other things,
to perform selected specified lot release and stability testing of our
SNAP

®

beta-lactam dairy testing products and to provide related data to the
FDA. If the FDA were to determine that one or more lots of product failed to meet
applicable criteria for product performance or stability, the FDA could take various
actions, including requiring us to recall products or restricting our ability to sell
these products. Sales of dairy antibiotic residue-testing products were $15.4 million for
the year ended December 31, 2006.

Our Dependence
on a Limited Number of Suppliers Could Limit Our Ability to Sell Certain Products or
Reduce Our Profitability

We
currently purchase many products and materials from single sources or a limited number of
sources. Some of the products that we purchase from these sources are proprietary, and,
therefore, cannot be readily or easily replaced by alternative sources. These products
include our VetAutoread™ Hematology, VetLyte

®

Electrolyte and IDEXX
VetLab

®

UA

™

urinalysis analyzers and related consumables
and accessories; the consumables associated with our VetTest chemistry analyzers; certain
digital radiography system components, specifically image capture plates and readers;
active ingredients for pharmaceutical products; and certain components of our
SNAP

®

rapid assay devices, water testing products and
LaserCyte

®

Hematology Analyzers. If we are unable to obtain adequate
quantities of these products in the future, we could face cost increases or reductions,
delays or discontinuations in product shipments, which could have a material adverse
effect on our results of operations.

Our Minimum
Purchase Obligations Under Certain Agreements Could Reduce Our Profitability

We
purchase the slides sold for use in our VetTest

®

Chemistry Analyzers under
an agreement with Ortho that, as of December 31, 2006, required us to purchase a minimum
of $59.0 million of slides through 2010. We purchase our VetAutoread™ Hematology
Analyzers, components and consumables under an agreement under which we are required to
make aggregate minimum purchases of $15.7 million through 2020. We also have minimum
purchase commitments under the terms of certain other supply agreements that commit us to
future payments of $20.4 million. If demand for any of the products purchased under these
agreements is insufficient to support our minimum purchase obligations for those products,
we could incur losses related to those obligations. In addition, because we purchase the
products at predetermined prices, our profits on sales of these products could decline if
we are unable to maintain current pricing levels for such products.

We May
be Required to Discontinue Sales of One of Our Veterinary Pharmaceutical Products

One
of our veterinary pharmaceutical products is sold under the FDA’s regulatory
discretion and we believe that the FDA would require us to discontinue sales of this
product within a short period if and when the FDA approves another product to treat the
same condition, whether such new product was our product or that of another commercial
supplier. In addition, we have a finite inventory of the raw materials used in the
manufacture of the product, and these raw materials are no longer commercially available.
We believe that our remaining inventory of raw materials will be adequate to satisfy
existing market demand until late 2008 or early 2009. We have, in advanced development and
clinical trials, a new product based on different raw materials and we intend to seek FDA
approval of this product. FDA approval of this new product would fully mitigate the
commercial risk that we would be required to stop selling our current product due either
to FDA approval of another manufacturer’s product or to the full depletion of our
inventory of raw materials. While we hope to smoothly transition to our new product, we
cannot predict when or if the FDA will approve our new product or any product that treats
the same condition from another manufacturer. Revenues from sales of this pharmaceutical
product were $11.9 million in 2006.


Our Biologic
Products Are Complex and Difficult to Manufacture, Which Could Negatively Affect Our
Ability to Supply the Market

Many
of our rapid assay and production animal diagnostic products are biologics, which are
products that are comprised of materials from living organisms, such as antibodies, cells
and sera. Manufacturing biologic products is highly complex. Unlike products that rely on
chemicals for efficacy (such as most pharmaceuticals), biologics are difficult to
characterize due to the inherent variability of biological input materials. Difficulty in
characterizing biological materials or their interactions creates greater risk in the
manufacturing process. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain adequate
sources of biological materials or that biological materials that we maintain in inventory
will yield finished products that satisfy applicable product release criteria. Our
inability to obtain necessary biological materials or to successfully manufacture biologic
products that incorporate such materials could have a material adverse effect on our
results of operations.

Our Success
Is Heavily Dependent Upon Our Proprietary Technologies

We
rely on a combination of patent, trade secret, trademark and copyright laws to protect our
proprietary rights. If we do not have adequate protection of our proprietary rights, our
business may be affected by competitors who develop substantially equivalent technologies
that compete with us.

We
cannot ensure that we will obtain issued patents, that any patents issued or licensed to
us will remain valid, or that any patents owned or licensed by us will provide protection
against competitors with similar technologies. Even if our patents cover products sold by
our competitors, the time and expense of litigating to enforce our patent rights could be
substantial, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In
addition, expiration of patent rights could result in substantial new competition in the
markets for products previously covered by those patent rights.

In
the past, we have received notices claiming that our products infringe third-party patents
and we may receive such notices in the future. Patent litigation is complex and expensive,
and the outcome of patent litigation can be difficult to predict. We cannot ensure that we
will win a patent litigation case or negotiate an acceptable resolution of such a case. If
we lose, we may be stopped from selling certain products and/or we may be required to pay
damages and/or ongoing royalties as a result of the lawsuit. Any such adverse result could
have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

Distributor Purchasing
Patterns Could Negatively Affect Our Operating Results

We sell many of our products,
including substantially all of the rapid assays and instrument consumables sold in the
U.S., through distributors. Distributor purchasing patterns can be unpredictable and may
be influenced by factors unrelated to the end-user demand for our products. In addition,
our agreements with distributors may generally be terminated by the distributors for any
reason on 60 days notice. Because significant product sales are made to a limited number
of distributors, the loss of a distributor or unanticipated changes in the frequency,
timing or size of distributor purchases, could have a negative effect on our results of
operations. Our financial performance, therefore, is subject to an unexpected downturn in
product demand and may be unpredictable.

Distributors
of veterinary products have entered into business combinations resulting in fewer
distribution companies. Consolidation within distribution channels would increase our
customer concentration level, which could increase the risks described in the preceding
paragraph.


Increased Competition
and Technological Advances by Our Competitors Could Negatively Affect Our Operating
Results

We
face intense competition within the markets in which we sell our products and services. We
expect that future competition will become even more intense, and that we will have to
compete with changing and improving technologies. Some of our competitors and potential
competitors, including large pharmaceutical and diagnostic companies, have substantially
greater capital, manufacturing, marketing, and research and development resources than we
do.

Changes in
Testing Could Negatively Affect Our Operating Results

The
market for our companion and production animal diagnostic tests and our dairy and water
testing products could be negatively impacted by a number of factors. The introduction or
broad market acceptance of vaccines or preventatives for the diseases and conditions for
which we sell diagnostic tests and services could result in a decline in testing.
Eradication or substantial declines in the prevalence of certain diseases also could lead
to a decline in diagnostic testing for such diseases. Our production animal products
business in particular is subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in disease
prevalence. In addition, changes in government regulations could negatively affect sales
of our products that are driven by compliance testing, such as our dairy and water
products. Declines in testing for any of the reasons described could have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations.

On
December 29, 2006, the Drinking Water Inspectorate in the U.K. published a proposal to
discontinue the regulation that requires testing water supplies for

Cryptosporidia

effective as of December 22, 2007 or, if approved by the regulator, at an earlier date. If
this proposal is adopted, the Company believes that it will lose a substantial portion of
its sales of Filta-Max

®

products in England and Wales, which were $2.9
million in the year ended December 31, 2006.

Consolidation of
Veterinary Hospitals in the U.S. Could Negatively Affect Our Business

An
increasing percentage of veterinary hospitals in the U.S. are owned by corporations that
are in the business of acquiring veterinary hospitals and/or opening new veterinary
hospitals nationally or regionally. Major corporate hospital owners include VCA/Antech,
Inc. and Banfield, The Pet Hospital, both of whom are currently customers of IDEXX.
Corporate owners of veterinary hospitals could attempt to improve profitability by
leveraging the buying power they derive from their scale to obtain favorable pricing from
suppliers, which could have a negative impact on our results. In addition, VCA/Antech is
our primary competitor in the U.S. market for reference laboratory services, and hospitals
acquired by VCA/Antech will use its laboratory services almost exclusively. Therefore,
hospitals acquired by VCA/Antech generally will cease to be customers or potential
customers of our reference laboratories business.

Our Inexperience
in the Human Point-of-Care Market Could Inhibit Our Success in this Market

Upon
acquiring the Critical Care Division of Osmetech plc, we entered the human point-of-care
medical diagnostics market for the first time with the sale of the OPTI

®

line of electrolyte and blood gas analyzers. The human point-of-care medical diagnostics
market differs in many respects from the veterinary medical market. Significant
differences include the impact of third party reimbursement on diagnostic testing, more
extensive regulation, greater product liability risks, larger competitors, and more rapid
technological innovation. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in
achieving growth and profitability in the human point-of-care medical diagnostics market
comparable to the results we have achieved in the veterinary medical market.

Risks Associated
with Doing Business Internationally Could Negatively Affect Our Operating Results

For
the year ended December 31, 2006, 35% of our revenue was attributable to sales of products
and services to customers outside the U.S. Various risks associated with foreign
operations may impact our international sales. Possible risks include fluctuations in the
value of foreign currencies, disruptions in transportation of our products, the differing
product and service needs of foreign customers, difficulties in building and managing
foreign operations, import/export duties and quotas, and unexpected regulatory, economic
or political changes in foreign markets. Prices that we charge to foreign customers may be
different than the prices we charge for the same products in the U.S. due to competitive,
market or other factors. As a result, the mix of domestic and international sales in a
particular period could have a material impact on our results for that period. In
addition, many of the products for which our selling price may be denominated in foreign
currencies are manufactured, sourced, or both, in the U.S. and our costs are incurred in
U.S. dollars. We utilize non-speculative forward currency exchange contracts to mitigate
foreign currency exposure. However, an appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the
foreign currencies in which we sell these products would reduce our operating margins.


The Loss
of Our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman Could Adversely Affect Our
Business

We
rely on the management and leadership of Jonathan W. Ayers, our President, Chief Executive
Officer and Chairman. We do not maintain key man life insurance coverage for Mr. Ayers.
The loss of Mr. Ayers could have a material adverse impact on our business.

We Could
Be Subject to Class Action Litigation Due to Stock Price Volatility, which, if it Occurs,
Could Result in Substantial Costs or Large Judgments Against Us

The
market for our common stock may experience extreme price and volume fluctuations, which
may be unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance or prospects. In the
past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against companies
following periods of volatility in the market prices of their securities. We may be the
target of similar litigation in the future. Securities litigation could result in
substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources, which could
have a negative effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.

If Our
Quarterly Results of Operations Fluctuate, This Fluctuation May Cause Our Stock Price to
Decline, Resulting in Losses to You

Our
prior operating results have fluctuated due to a number of factors, including seasonality
of certain product lines; changes in our accounting estimates; the impact of acquisitions;
timing of distributor purchases, product launches, research and development expenditures,
litigation and claim-related expenditures; changes in competitors’ product offerings;
and other matters. Similarly, our future operating results may vary significantly from
quarter to quarter due to these and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.
If our operating results or projections of future operating results do not meet the
expectations of market analysts or investors in future periods, our stock price may fall.

Future Operating
Results Could Be Negatively Affected By the Resolution of Various Uncertain Tax Positions
and by Potential Changes to Tax Incentives

In
the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where
the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Significant judgment is required in
determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and our income tax filings are
regularly under audit by tax authorities. The final determination of tax audits could be
materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and
accruals. Additionally, we benefit from certain tax incentives offered by various
jurisdictions. If we are unable to meet the requirements of such incentives, our inability
to use these benefits could have a material negative effect on future earnings.

ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED
STAFF COMMENTS

Not
applicable.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

In
May 2006, we acquired the Westbrook, Maine facility in which we previously leased space.
We currently occupy 350,000 square feet of this facility for manufacturing, research and
development, and corporate headquarters functions. We plan to renovate and expand this
facility during 2007 through 2009, which will provide an additional 200,000 square feet of
space. We lease collectively approximately 110,000 square feet of additional office space
in Scarborough and Westbrook, Maine under leases expiring in 2009 and 2013, respectively.
We lease approximately 97,500 square feet of industrial space in Memphis, Tennessee for
use as a distribution facility under a lease expiring in 2013; approximately 40,000 square
feet of office and manufacturing space in Eau Claire, Wisconsin for our practice
information management systems business under leases expiring in 2008 and 2009;
approximately 60,000 square feet of office and manufacturing space in Roswell, Georgia for
our OPTI Medical Systems business under a lease expiring in 2010; approximately 16,000
square feet of office and manufacturing space in Switzerland for our European production
animal products manufacturing activities under a lease expiring in 2013; and approximately
48,000 square feet of warehouse and office space in the Netherlands for use as our
headquarters for European operations under a lease expiring in 2008.


We
also lease a total of approximately 35,000 square feet of smaller office, manufacturing
and warehouse space in the U.S. and elsewhere in the world under leases having expiration
dates up to the year 2021. In addition, we own or lease approximately 300,000 square feet
of space in the U.S., Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Switzerland, South Africa, and
the United Kingdom for use as veterinary reference laboratories and office space for our
veterinary consulting services. Of this space, 73,000 square feet is owned by us and the
remaining amount is leased, under leases having expiration dates up to the year 2019.

We
consider that the properties are generally in good condition, are well-maintained, and are
generally suitable and adequate to carry on our business.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

From
time to time, we are subject to litigation in the ordinary course of business. However, we
do not believe that we are party to any material legal proceedings.

ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF
MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

No
matters were submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth quarter of the
fiscal year covered by this report.

ITEM 6. SELECTED
FINANCIAL DATA

The
following table sets forth selected consolidated financial data of the Company for each of
the five years ending with December 31, 2006. The selected consolidated financial data
presented below have been derived from the Company’s consolidated financial
statements. These financial data should be read in conjunction with the consolidated
financial statements, related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in
this Form 10-K.

ITEM 7.
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSES OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

During
2006, we operated primarily through three business segments: products and services for the
veterinary market, which we refer to as our Companion Animal Group (“CAG”),
water quality products (“Water”) and products for production animal health,
which we refer to as the Production Animal Segment (“PAS”). We also operate a
smaller segment that comprises products for dairy quality, which we refer to as Dairy. Financial information about the Dairy operating
segment is presented in an “Other” category. As
of January 2007, we have added an operating segment, OPTI Medical, in connection with our
acquisition of the Critical Care Division of Osmetech plc, which
is presented in an “Other” category. CAG develops, designs,
manufactures, and distributes products and performs services for veterinarians. Water
develops, designs, manufactures and distributes products to detect contaminants in water.
PAS develops, designs, manufactures and distributes products to detect diseases in
production animals. Dairy develops, designs, manufactures and distributes products to
detect contaminants in dairy products. OPTI Medical develops, manufactures, and sells
point-of-care electrolyte and blood gas analyzers and related consumable products for the
human medical diagnostics market. Unallocated items that are not
allocated to our operating segments are comprised primarily of share-based compensation
costs (effective January 1, 2006), corporate research and development expenses, interest
income and expense, and income taxes. The segment information for the years ended December
31, 2005 and 2004 has been restated to conform to our presentation of reportable segments
for the year ended December 31, 2006. Previously, PAS and Dairy were aggregated into a
single reportable segment, which we referred to as the Food Diagnostics Group. See Note 16
to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2006 included in
this Form 10-K for financial information about our segments, including geographic
information, and about our product and service categories.


The
following is a discussion of the strategic and operating factors that we believe have the
most significant effect on the performance of our business.

Companion Animal Group

In
the CAG segment, we believe we have developed a strategic advantage over companies with
more narrow product or service offerings. The breadth of our products and services gives
us scale in sales and distribution, permits us to offer integrated disease-management
solutions that leverage the advantages of both point-of-care and outside laboratory
testing, and facilitates the flow of medical and business information in the veterinary
practice by connecting practice information software systems, including connecting the
electronic health record with laboratory test data, in-clinic test data from our IDEXX
VetLab

®

suite of analyzers, and radiographic data in the IDEXX-PACS™
software taken by our digital radiography systems.

In
the U.S., we sell instrument consumables, rapid assay products and pharmaceutical products
primarily through distributors, and, therefore, our reported sales of these products are
sales made to distributors, rather than sales to veterinarians, the end users. Because
distributors’ inventory levels and purchasing patterns may fluctuate, sales of a
particular product line in a particular period may not always be representative of the
underlying end-user demand for the product. Therefore, we closely track sales of these
products by our U.S. distributors to the veterinarians (“practice-level sales”),
which we think provide a more accurate picture of the real growth rate for these products.

Instruments
and Consumables

. Our instrument strategy is to provide veterinarians with an
integrated set of instruments that, individually and together, provide superior diagnostic
information in the clinic, enabling veterinarians to practice better medicine and, in
doing so, achieve their practice economic objectives, including growth and profitability.
We derive substantial revenues and margins from the sale of consumables that are used in
these instruments. During the early stage of an instrument’s life cycle, we derive
relatively greater revenues from instrument placements, while consumable sales become
relatively more significant in later stages as the installed base of instruments increases
and instrument placement revenues begin to decline.

We
have a large installed base of VetTest

®

Chemistry Analyzers, and
substantially all of our revenues from that product line are now derived from consumables
sales, although we continue to place instruments through sales, lease, rental and other
programs. Our long-term success in this area of our business is dependent upon new
customer acquisition, customer retention and increased customer utilization of existing
and new assays introduced on these instruments. To increase utilization, we seek to
educate veterinarians about best medical practices that emphasize the importance of blood
and urine chemistry testing for a variety of diagnostic purposes.

We
purchase the consumables used in VetTest

®

Chemistry Analyzers from Ortho
under a supply agreement that continues through 2020. This supply agreement provides us
with a long-term source of slides at costs that improve annually through 2010, and also
improve over the term of the agreement as a result of increasing volume. Under this
agreement, we are developing and expect to introduce a next-generation chemistry analyzer,
named Catalyst Dx™, for the veterinary market based primarily on the Ortho dry-slide
technology and secondarily on OPTI

®

electrolyte technology, and Ortho will
supply us with slide consumables used in both the new instrument and the
VetTest

®

Chemistry Analyzer. We plan to launch Catalyst Dx™ in January
2008.

In
the fourth quarter of 2002, we introduced the LaserCyte

®

Hematology
Analyzer, which provides more extensive hematological diagnostic information than our
original platform, the VetAutoread™ Hematology Analyzer. A substantial portion of
LaserCyte

®

placements have been made at veterinary clinics that already own
our VetAutoread™ Hematology Analyzers. Although we have experienced growth in sales
of hematology consumables, LaserCyte

®

consumable sales have been partially
offset by declines in sales of VetAutoread™ consumables. Because the gross margin
percentage of LaserCyte

®

consumables exceeds the gross margin percentage of
the VetAutoread™ consumables, gross margin from hematology consumables is expected to
increase with continued penetration of the LaserCyte

®

Hematology Analyzer.


With
all of our instrument lines, we seek to differentiate our products based on breadth of
diagnostic menu, flexibility of menu selection, accuracy, reliability, ease of use,
ability to handle compromised samples, time to result, analytical capability of software,
integration with the IDEXX VetLab

®

Station, education and training, and
superior sales and customer service. Our instruments and consumables typically are sold at
a premium price to competitive offerings. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to
differentiate our products in a way that justifies premium pricing.

Rapid
Assay Products

. Our rapid assay business consists primarily of single-use kits for
point-of-care testing and, to a limited degree, microwell-based kits for laboratory
testing for canine and feline diseases and conditions. Our rapid assay strategy is to
develop, manufacture, market and sell proprietary tests that address important medical
needs for particular diseases prevalent in the companion animal population. We seek to
differentiate our tests through superior performance, including by providing our customers
with proprietary combination tests that test a single sample for multiple analytes. Where
alternative point-of-care offerings exist, we seek to differentiate our tests with
superior performance. As in our other lines of business, we also seek to differentiate our
products through superior customer service. These products carry price premiums over
competitive products that we believe do not offer equivalent performance and diagnostic
capabilities, and which we believe do not include a similar level of support. We further
augment our product development and customer service efforts with sales and marketing
programs that enhance medical awareness and understanding regarding our target diseases
and the importance of diagnostic testing. In 2008, we plan to introduce a new IDEXX
VetLab

®

analyzer, SNAPshot Dx

™

, that, later that year, will
include the capability to interpret the test results from all SNAP assays and log the
tests and their results in the IDEXX VetLab

®

Station database and,
therefore, in the medical and financial records of the practice.

Reference
Laboratory and Consulting Services

. We believe that more than half of all diagnostic
testing by U.S. veterinarians is done at outside reference laboratories such as our IDEXX
Reference Laboratories. In markets outside the U.S., in-clinic testing is less prevalent
and an even greater percentage of diagnostic testing is done in reference laboratories. We
attempt to differentiate our laboratory testing services from those of our competitors
primarily on the basis of quality, customer service, technology employed and specialized
test menu. Revenue growth in this business is achieved both through increased sales at
existing laboratories and through the acquisition of new customers, including through
laboratory acquisitions and opening new laboratories. In 2004, we acquired a laboratory in
Columbus, Ohio, opened a laboratory in Seattle, Washington, and acquired Vet Med Lab,
which is based in Germany and is the largest European veterinary reference laboratory. In
2005, we acquired laboratories in Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and France and acquired
veterinary laboratory customer lists in the U.S. and Germany. In 2006, we acquired
laboratories in Clearwater, Florida, South Africa, and Canada and acquired a veterinary
laboratory customer list in the U.S. Profitability of this business is largely the result
of our ability to achieve efficiencies from both volume and operational improvements. New
laboratories that we open typically will operate at a loss until testing volumes reach a
level that permits profitability. Acquired laboratories frequently operate less profitably
than our existing laboratories and those laboratories may not achieve profitability
comparable to our existing laboratories for several years while we implement operating
improvements and efficiencies. Therefore, in the short term, new and acquired reference
laboratories generally will have a negative effect on the operating margin of the
laboratory and consulting services business.

Practice
Information Management Systems and Digital Radiography

. These businesses consist of
veterinary practice information management systems (“PIMS”) including hardware
and software and veterinary-specific digital radiography systems. Our strategy in the PIMS
business is to provide superior total software and hardware integrated information
solutions, backed by superior customer support and education, to allow the veterinarian to
practice better medicine and achieve the practice’s business objectives. We
differentiate our software systems through enhanced functionality and ease of use. Our
veterinary-specific digital radiography systems allow veterinarians to capture digital
radiographs with ease and without the use of hazardous chemicals. The digital radiography
systems also incorporate IDEXX-PACS™ picture archiving and communication software
developed by IDEXX that allows for image enhancement, manipulation, storage and retrieval,
and integration with the practice information software. Our strategy in digital
radiography is to offer a system that provides superior image quality and software
capability at a competitive price, backed by the same customer support provided for our
other products and services in the Companion Animal Group.


Pharmaceutical
Products

. We currently offer pharmaceutical products to regulate feline diabetes,
eradicate internal parasites, and treat lameness in horses. Our pharmaceutical strategy is
to develop, register and sell proprietary pharmaceutical products for the veterinary
market. We seek to differentiate our pharmaceutical products through ease of use, which in
turn enhances customers’ compliance with prescribed treatment programs. Our product
development efforts are focused on applying superior and proprietary delivery technologies
to existing pharmaceutical compounds.

Water

Our
strategy in the water testing business is to develop, manufacture, market and sell
proprietary products with superior performance, supported by exceptional customer service.
Our customers are primarily water utilities to whom strong relationships and customer
support are very important. Over the past several years, the rate of growth of this
product line has slowed as a result of market penetration by competitors and increased
competition. International sales of water testing products represented 42% of total water
product sales in 2006, and we expect that future growth in this business will be
significantly dependent on our ability to increase international sales. Growth also will
be dependent on our ability to enhance and broaden our product line. Most water
microbiological testing is driven by regulation, and, in many countries, a test may not be
used for regulatory testing unless it has been approved by the applicable regulatory body.
As a result, we maintain an active regulatory program under which we are seeking
regulatory approvals in a number of countries, primarily in Europe.

Production Animal Segment

We
develop, manufacture, market and sell a broad range of tests for various poultry, cattle
and swine diseases and conditions, and have an active research and development and
in-licensing program in this area. Our strategy is to offer proprietary tests with
superior performance characteristics. Disease outbreaks are episodic and unpredictable,
and certain diseases that are prevalent at one time may be substantially contained or
eradicated at a later time. In response to outbreaks, testing initiatives may lead to
exceptional demand for certain products in certain periods. Conversely, successful
eradication programs may result in significantly decreased demand for certain products.
The performance of this business, therefore, can be subject to fluctuation. In 2006,
approximately 79% of our sales in this business were international. Because of the
significant dependence of this business on international sales, the performance of the
business is particularly subject to the various risks described below that are associated
with doing business internationally.

In
2004, we received USDA approval of our postmortem test for BSE (mad cow disease) and, in
February 2005, we were informed that this test was approved by the European Commission for
sale in EU member countries. While BSE testing is very limited in the U.S., a larger
market for BSE testing exists in Europe.

Other

Dairy

.  Our
strategy in the dairy testing business is to develop, manufacture and sell
          antibiotic residue testing products that satisfy applicable regulatory
          requirements for testing of bulk milk by producers and provide reliable field
          performance. The manufacture of these testing products leverage, almost
          exclusively, the SNAP

®

platform as well as the production
          equipment and lines of our rapid assay business, incorporating customized
          reagents for antibiotic detection. Sales of dairy testing products have
declined           slightly over the last several years largely as a result of increased
          competition in the domestic market. To increase sales of dairy testing
products,           we look to increase penetration in geographies outside the U.S. and
in the farm           segment of the dairy market, and to develop product line
enhancements and           extensions.

OPTI
Medical Systems

. Our strategy in the OPTI Medical Systems business is to develop,
manufacture, and sell electrolyte and blood gas analyzers and related consumable products
for the medical point-of-care diagnostics market worldwide, with a focus on small- to
mid-sized hospitals. We seek to differentiate our products based on ease of use, menu,
convenience, international distribution and service, and instrument reliability. Similar
to our veterinary instruments and consumables strategy, a substantial portion of the
revenues from this product line are derived from the sale of consumables for use on the
installed base of electrolyte and blood gas analyzers. During the early stage of an
instrument’s life cycle, relatively greater revenues are derived from instrument
placements, while consumable sales become relatively more significant in later stages as
the installed base of instruments increases and instrument placement revenues begin to
decline. Our long-term success in this area of our business is dependent upon new customer
acquisition, customer retention and increased customer utilization of existing and new
assays introduced on these instruments.


CRITICAL ACCOUNTING
POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

The
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon
our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial
statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of
assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related
to revenue recognition, inventory, goodwill and other intangible assets, share-based
compensation, income taxes, and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical
experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the
circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying
values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual
results may differ from these estimates. Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements
for the year ended December 31, 2006 included in this Form 10-K describes the significant
accounting policies used in preparation of these financial statements.

We
believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments
and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.

Revenue Recognition

We
recognize revenue when four criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence that an arrangement
exists, (ii) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, (iii) the sales price
is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectibility is reasonably assured.

•

We
recognize revenue at the time of shipment to distributors for substantially all products
sold through distributors, as title and risk of loss pass to these customers on delivery
to the common carrier. Our distributors do not have the right to return products. We
recognize revenue for the remainder of our customers when the product is delivered,
except as noted below.

•

We
recognize revenue from the sales of instruments, noncancelable software licenses and
hardware systems upon installation (and completion of training if applicable) and the
customer’s acceptance of the instrument or system because at this time we have no
significant further obligations.

•

We
recognize service revenue at the time the service is performed.

•

We
recognize revenue associated with extended maintenance agreements over the life of the
contracts. Amounts collected in advance of revenue recognition are recorded as a current
or long-term liability based on the time from the balance sheet date to the future date
of revenue recognition.

•

We
recognize revenue on certain instrument systems under rental programs over the life of
the rental agreement. Amounts collected in advance of revenue recognition are recorded as
a current or long-term liability based on the time from the balance sheet date to the
future date of revenue recognition.

Certain
diagnostic instruments and practice information management systems offered for sale may
include software that is considered more than incidental to the utility and value of the
product. Sales arrangements may provide for software update rights or postcontract
customer support. Judgment is required to determine whether sales arrangements include
multiple elements.

When
multiple products and/or services are sold together, we generally allocate the total
consideration received amongst the elements based on their relative fair values, which is
determined by amounts charged separately for the delivered and undelivered elements to
other customers. When there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the
undelivered elements but no such evidence for the delivered elements, the fair value of
the undelivered elements is deferred and the residual revenue is allocated to the
delivered elements. The delivered elements are recognized as revenue when appropriate
under the policies described above. If there is not sufficient evidence of the fair value
of the undelivered elements, no revenue is allocated to the delivered elements and the
total consideration received is deferred until delivery of those elements for which
objective and reliable evidence of the fair value is not available. Shipping costs
reimbursed by the customer are included in revenue.


We
record estimated reductions to revenue in connection with customer programs and incentive
offerings, which may give customers credits, award points, or trade-in rights. Awards
points may be applied to trade receivables owed to us and/or toward future purchase of our
products and services. We estimate these reductions based on our experience with similar
customer programs in prior years. Revenue reductions are recorded on a quarterly basis
based on issuance of credits, points actually awarded, and estimates of points to be
awarded in the future based on current revenue. For the SNAP Up the
Savings

™

program, estimates of future points are revised quarterly and
finalized annually in the third quarter of each year upon the issuance of points to
customers. For our Practice Developer™ volume discount program, we have reduced
revenue assuming all points granted will result in future credits because the historical
forfeitures have been de minimus. On November 30 of each year, unused points awarded
before January 1 of the prior year expire.

We
may offer customers the right to trade in instruments for credit against the purchase
price of other instruments acquired in the future. For trade-in rights, we have reduced
revenue using estimates regarding the percentage of qualifying instruments that will be
traded in and the average trade-in value.

We
recognize revenue only in those situations where collection from the customer is
reasonably assured. We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses
resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. We base our
estimates on detailed analysis of specific customer situations and a percentage of our
accounts receivable by aging category. If the financial condition of our customers were to
deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional
allowances might be required.

Inventory Valuation

We
write down inventory for estimated obsolescence when warranted by estimates of future
demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those we
estimated, additional inventory write-downs may be required, which would have a negative
effect on results of operations. Certain major components of inventory for which we have
made critical valuation judgments are discussed in more detail below.

LaserCyte

®

Hematology Analyzer

. At December 31, 2006, our net inventories included $11.5 million
of component parts and finished goods associated with our LaserCyte

®

hematology instrument. In addition, we had firm purchase commitments for an additional
$4.2 million of component parts as of December 31, 2006. At December 31, 2006, $1.7
million of the net LaserCyte

®

inventory required rework before it could be
used to manufacture finished goods, which was net of $0.9 million write-downs for
inventory estimated to be obsolete. We expect to fully realize our net investment in
inventory and purchase commitments. However, if we alter the design of this product, we
may be required to write off some or all of the remaining associated inventory.

Nitazoxanide

. Our
nitazoxanide product, Navigator

®

, for the treatment of equine
          protozoal myeloencephalitis (“EPM”) was approved by the FDA in
          November 2003. At December 31, 2006, our inventories included $9.3 million of
          inventory associated with Navigator

®

, consisting of $0.2 million
          of finished goods and $9.1 million of active ingredient and other raw
materials.           We have an agreement with our supplier of nitazoxanide under which
the supplier           agreed until 2017 to replace any expiring inventory of
nitazoxanide with           longer-dated material. We paid $0.9 million in January 2005
for consideration           for this agreement and capitalized this payment as inventory
cost. We believe           that this agreement has substantially mitigated the risk that
we would be           required to write down nitazoxanide inventory due to its
anticipated expiration           prior to sale. However, if actual market conditions or
our market share through           2022 are less than we estimate, we may be required to
write off some of the           associated inventory. For example, if we sell
approximately 50% fewer units           through 2025 than we estimate, we would have
approximately $5 million of excess           inventory.

Valuation of Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets

A
significant portion of the purchase prices of our business acquisitions is assigned to
intangible assets. Intangible assets other than goodwill are initially valued at the
lesser of fair value or, if applicable, fair value proportionately reduced by the excess
of the fair value of acquired net assets over cost, (collectively, “fair value”)
when acquired. If a market value is not readily available, the fair value of the
intangible asset is estimated based on discounted cash flows using market participant
assumptions. The estimation of discounted cash flows requires significant assumptions
about the timing and amounts of future cash flows, risks, the cost of capital, and the
useful lives of intangible assets. When the fair values of acquired intangible assets are
significant, we utilize independent valuation experts to advise and assist us in
allocating the purchase prices of acquisitions to the fair values of the identified
intangible assets and in determining appropriate amortization methods and periods for
those intangible assets. Goodwill is initially valued based on the excess of the purchase
price of a business combination over the fair values of acquired net assets.


We
assess the impairment of identifiable intangible assets and other long-lived assets
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be
recoverable. Factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review
include, but are not limited to, the following:

•

Significant
under-performance relative to historical or projected future operating results;

•

Failure
to obtain regulatory approval of certain products;

•

Significant
changes in regulations;

•

Significant
changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall
business;

•

Significant
increase in the discount rate assumed to calculate the present value of future cash flow;

•

Significant
negative industry or economic trends;

•

Significant
advancements or changes in technology; and

•

Cancellation
or significant changes in contractual relationships.

We
continually assess the realizability of intangible assets other than goodwill in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 144,
“Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets” (“SFAS No.
144”). If an impairment review is triggered, we evaluate the carrying value of
long-lived assets by determining if impairment exists based on estimated undiscounted
future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the assets and comparing that value to
the carrying value of the assets. If the carrying value of the asset is greater than the
estimated future cash flows, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value. In
determining expected future cash flows, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which
cash flows are identifiable and independent of cash flows from other asset groups. The
cash flow estimates that are used contain our best estimates, using appropriate and
customary assumptions and projections at the time.

We
assess goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances indicate an
impairment may exist, in accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets” (“SFAS No. 142”). For impairment testing, we identify our reporting
units, allocate assets and liabilities (including goodwill) to the reporting units and
compare the reporting units’ net book value to their estimated fair value. The fair
value of the reporting units is estimated using a discounted cash flow approach. The cash
flow estimates used contain our best estimates, using appropriate and customary
assumptions and projections at the time. If a reporting unit’s net book value exceeds
its fair value, then the implied fair value of goodwill is determined. If the net book
value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill, a goodwill impairment loss
is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. No impairments have been identified as a
result of the annual or event-driven reviews during the years ended December 31, 2006,
2005 or 2004.

The
determination of the fair value of our pharmaceutical products business unit requires
significant assumptions about the timing and amounts of the unit’s future cash flows,
including assumptions about the markets for our products and proprietary technologies, the
future success of research and development activities, the attainment and timing of
regulatory approvals to manufacture and sell new products, the introduction and success of
competitive products by other market participants, and other business risks. We believe
that the goodwill attributable to our pharmaceutical business of $13.7 million is not
impaired at December 31, 2006. However, changes in our assumptions and estimates due to
new information, or actual results that are below expectations, could result in an
impairment in the future of some or all of the goodwill attributable to our pharmaceutical
products business.


Share-based Compensation

We
adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS No.
123(R)”) on January 1, 2006. SFAS No. 123(R) requires all share-based compensation to
employees, including grants of stock options, to be valued at fair value on the date of
grant, and to be expensed over the requisite service period (generally the vesting
period). Prior to January 1, 2006, we measured costs related to employee share-based
compensation plans in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
“Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees” (“APB No. 25”).
Accordingly, no employee compensation cost was recognized for these plans prior to January
1, 2006.

Effective
January 1, 2006, under the modified prospective method of transition, share-based
compensation expense includes expense for unvested awards at December 31, 2005 and all
awards granted subsequent to December 31, 2005. Share-based compensation expense for the
unvested awards outstanding at December 31, 2005 is based on the grant-date fair value
previously calculated in developing the pro forma disclosures in accordance with the
provisions of SFAS No. 123.

Beginning
in 2006, we modified our share-based employee compensation programs to shift from the
grant of stock options and employee stock purchase rights only to the grant of a mix of
restricted stock units and stock options, along with employee stock purchase rights. There
were no modifications to the terms of outstanding options during 2006 or 2005.

In
connection with the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), we adopted the straight-line method to
prospectively expense share-based awards granted subsequent to December 31, 2005. The
graded-vesting, or accelerated, method has been used to calculate the expense for stock
options granted prior to January 1, 2006. If the total fair value of share-based
compensation awards, as well as other features that impact expense, including forfeitures
and capitalization of costs, was consistent from year-to-year in each of the last five
years and through 2010, this change in expense method from graded-vesting to straight-line
expensing would yield decreasing annual expense through 2010 until awards granted prior to
January 1, 2006 were fully expensed. However, the total fair value of future awards may
vary significantly from past awards based on a number of factors, including our
share-based award practices. Therefore, share-based compensation expense is likely to
fluctuate, possibly significantly, from year to year.

Selected
financial impacts of share-based compensation, excluding the impact of deferred stock
units issued under our Director Deferred Compensation Plan or our Executive Deferred
Compensation Plan that do not have vesting conditions (which are described below), are
presented in the table below (

in thousands, except per share amounts

):

Share-based
compensation costs are classified in costs of sales and operating expenses consistently
with the classification of cash compensation paid to the employees receiving such
share-based compensation. Capitalized share-based employee compensation cost at December
31, 2006 was $0.2 million, which was included in inventory on the consolidated balance
sheet.


The
fair value of options, restricted stock units, deferred stock units with vesting
conditions, and employee stock purchase rights awarded during the years ended December 31,
2006, 2005 and 2004 totaled $11.9 million, $15.7 million and $13.4 million, respectively.
The total unrecognized compensation cost for unvested share-based compensation awards
outstanding at December 31, 2006, net of estimated forfeitures, was $14.6 million.
Approximately $6.3 million is expected to be recognized in the year ending December 31,
2007 for outstanding awards and decreasing amounts of the total expense are expected to be
recognized over the subsequent five years, resulting in a weighted average remaining
expense recognition period of approximately 1.5 years.

We
use the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model to determine the fair value of options
granted. Option-pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions,
particularly for the expected stock price volatility and the expected term of options.
Changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate.
Our expected stock price volatility assumptions are based on the historical volatility of
our stock over periods that are similar to the expected terms of grants, and other
relevant factors. Lower estimated volatility reduces the fair value of an option. To
develop the expected term assumption for 2006 option awards, we elected to use the
simplified method described in the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting
Bulletin No. 107, which is based on vesting and contractual terms. The application of the
simplified method is allowable for options granted through December 31, 2007. We will
transition to developing expected term assumptions for future awards based on historical
experience and other relevant factors concerning expected employee behavior with regards
to option exercise. Longer expected term assumptions increase the fair value of option
awards, and therefore increase the expense recognized per award.

The
weighted average valuation assumptions used to determine the fair value of each option
grant on the date of grant and the weighted average estimated fair values were as follows:

Share-based
compensation expense is based on the number of awards ultimately expected to vest and is,
therefore, reduced for an estimate of the number of awards that are expected to be
forfeited. The forfeiture estimate is based on historical data and other factors, and
compensation expense is adjusted for actual results. Changes in estimated forfeiture rates
and differences between estimated forfeiture rates and actual experience may result in
significant, unanticipated increases or decreases in share-based compensation expense from
period to period. The termination of employment by certain employees who hold large
numbers of share-based compensation instruments may also have a significant, unanticipated
impact on forfeiture experience and, therefore, on share-based compensation expense.

The
tax benefit related to the option fair value is recognized when disqualifying dispositions
of incentive stock options occur as either a reduction of the current period tax provision
or an increase in additional paid-in capital, as required by SFAS No. 123(R) transitional
accounting rules, depending on the vesting status of awards at the SFAS No. 123(R)
adoption date, and the amounts previously expensed under SFAS No. 123(R). Employees’
exercise of vested options and disposition of shares acquired is influenced by the market
price of the common stock and other factors outside of our control. The timing and volume
of disqualifying dispositions; the vesting status of such exercised options at the date of
our adoption of SFAS No. 123(R); and the relationship between the sale price of the common
stock, the option exercise price and the option fair value may have a significant,
unpredictable impact on our effective tax rate. As the aggregate fair value of outstanding
options that has been expensed under SFAS No. 123(R) grows, we expect to recognize
increasing tax benefits in net income related to disqualifying dispositions. However, the
growth of the aggregate fair value of outstanding options that has been expensed under
SFAS No. 123(R) will be limited in future years as a result of changes implemented in 2006
in our share-based compensation programs, under which we have shifted from the grant of
stock options only to the grant of a mix of stock options and restricted stock unit awards
that have a lower aggregate fair value than was awarded in prior years. Reductions in the
fair value of options outstanding are expected to reduce the variability in our effective
tax rate.


Income Taxes

We
account for income taxes under SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.” This
statement requires that we recognize a current tax liability or asset for current taxes
payable or refundable, respectively; and a deferred tax liability or asset, as the case
may be, for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between book and tax
treatment of assets and liabilities and carryforwards to the extent they are realizable.
We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is
more likely than not to be realized. While we consider future taxable income and ongoing
prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation
allowance, in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred
tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, an adjustment to the
deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made.
Likewise, should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net
deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged
to income in the period such determination was made. Significant judgment is required in
determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and our income tax filings are
regularly under audit by tax authorities. We periodically assess our exposures related to
our worldwide provision for income taxes and believe that we have appropriately accrued
taxes for contingencies. Any reduction of these contingent liabilities or additional
assessment would increase or decrease income, respectively, in the period such
determination was made.

We
consider the operating earnings of non-United States subsidiaries to be indefinitely
invested outside the United States, the cumulative amount of which was $111.4 million at
December 31, 2006. No provision has been made for United States federal and state, or
international taxes that may result from future remittances of undistributed earnings of
non-United States subsidiaries. Should we repatriate non-United States earnings in the
future, we would have to adjust the income tax provision in the period in which the
decision to repatriate earnings is made.

Estimates for Certain
Contingencies

Under
our workers’ compensation insurance policies for U.S. employees for the years ended
December 31, 2006, 2005, 2004 and 2003, we retain the first $250,000 in claim liability
per incident and $3.1 million, $2.8 million, $3.0 million and $1.4 million, respectively,
in aggregate claim liability. We entered into a similar workers’ compensation
insurance policy effective January 1, 2007. The insurance company provides insurance for
claims above the individual occurrence and aggregate limits. We estimate claim liability
based on claims incurred and the estimated ultimate cost to settle the claims. Based on
this analysis, we have recognized cumulative expenses of $1.3 million, $0.6 million, $0.7
million and $0.8 million for claims incurred during the years ended December 31, 2006,
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Under
our employee health care insurance policy, we retain claims liability risk up to $125,000
per incident and an aggregate claim limit based on the number of employees enrolled in the
plan per month. We estimate our liability for the uninsured portion of employee health
care obligations based on individual and aggregate coverage, our claims experience, the
number of employees enrolled in the program, and the average time from when a claim is
incurred to the time it is reported. Should actual employee health care claims liability
exceed estimates, we are liable for up to an additional $1.5 million for potential
uninsured obligations at December 31, 2006. We have insurance coverage of $1.0 million for
claims above the aggregate limit. Should employee health insurance claims exceed this
coverage, we would have further obligations for the amount in excess of such coverage.

We
are subject to claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, including with
respect to actual and threatened litigation and other matters. We accrue contingent
liabilities when it is probable that future expenditures will be made and such
expenditures can reasonably be estimated. However, our actual losses with respect to these
contingencies could exceed our accruals.

The
following revenue analysis reflects the results of operations net of the impact of
currency exchange rates on sales outside the U.S.


Because
our instrument consumables, rapid assay products, and pharmaceutical products are sold in
the U.S. and certain other geographies by distributors, distributor purchasing dynamics
have an impact on our reported sales of these products. Distributors purchase products
from us and sell them to veterinary practices, who are the end users. Distributor
purchasing dynamics may be affected by many factors and may be unrelated to underlying
end-user demand for our products. As a result, fluctuations in distributors’
inventories may cause reported results in a period not to be representative of underlying
end-user demand. Therefore, we believe it is important to track distributor sales to end
users and to distinguish between the impact of end-user demand and the impact of
distributor purchasing dynamics on reported revenue growth.

Where
growth rates are affected by changes in end-user demand, we refer to the impact of
practice-level sales on growth. Where growth rates are affected by distributor purchasing
dynamics, we refer to the impact of changes in distributors’ inventories. If during
the comparable period of the prior year, distributors’ inventories grew by more than
those inventories grew in the current year, then changes in distributors’ inventories
have a negative impact on our reported sales growth in the current period. Conversely, if
during the comparable period of the prior year, distributors’ inventories grew by
less than those inventories grew in the current year, then distributors’ inventories
have a positive impact on our reported sales growth in the current period.

The
increase in sales of instruments and consumables from 2005 to 2006 was due mainly to
higher unit sales volume of both instruments and of consumables and, to a lesser extent,
to higher average unit sales prices for slides that are sold for use in
VetTest

®

Chemistry Analyzers. Higher consumables sales volumes were
attributable primarily to higher worldwide practice-level sales of slides and, to a lesser
extent, to increased U.S. practice-level sales of tubes used with our hematology
analyzers, with all consumables categories benefiting from the continued growth of our
installed base of instruments. Higher instrument sales volume resulted mainly from sales
of VetStat

®

Electrolyte and Blood Gas Analyzers and, to a lesser extent,
LaserCyte

®

Hematology Analyzers and SNAP

®

Readers. The
impact from changes in distributors’ inventory levels had no significant impact on
reported revenue growth of instruments and consumables.

The
increase in sales of rapid assay products from 2005 to 2006 was due primarily to increased
sales volume of canine products, including sales of
SNAP

®

4Dx

®

, which was launched in the U.S. in September 2006.
The impact from changes in distributors’ inventory levels increased reported rapid
assay revenue growth by 3%. To a lesser extent, higher average unit sales prices of canine
products, in part due to less promotional discounting and higher relative sales of
combination test products, also contributed to rapid assay revenue growth. These increases
were partly offset by lower average unit sales prices of feline products, partly due to
greater promotional discounting. Incremental sales of rapid assay products for which we
acquired distribution rights in the second quarter of 2006 contributed 2% to rapid assay
revenue growth.

The
increase in sales of laboratory and consulting services from 2005 to 2006 resulted
primarily from higher testing volume and, to a lesser extent, the impact of price
increases and incremental sales attributable to acquisitions since January 2005.
Businesses acquired since January 2005 contributed 4% to laboratory and consulting
services revenue growth.

The
increase in sales of practice information management systems and digital radiography from
2005 to 2006 resulted primarily from an increase in the number of digital radiography
systems sold. Digital radiography sales volume growth was due primarily to sales
attributable to a business acquired in the third quarter of 2005, which contributed 12% to
practice information management systems and digital radiography revenue growth; higher
sales volumes of existing products; and sales of the IDEXX-DR™ 1417 Digital
Radiography System, which became commercially available during the third quarter of 2006.
To a lesser extent, revenue growth was also due to the impact of price increases for
support services for our practice information management systems, higher sales of computer
hardware to practice information management systems customers, and a shift in sales mix to
larger practice information management systems.

The
increase in sales of pharmaceutical products from 2005 to 2006 resulted primarily from
increased practice-level demand and, to a lesser extent, from price increases, both
impacts related largely to PZI VET

®

, our insulin product for the treatment
of diabetic cats.

Water.

Revenue
for Water increased $1.7 million, or 3%, to $58.5 million from $56.8           million
for the prior year. The increase resulted primarily from higher sales           volume in
the Americas and Europe and, to a lesser extent, to higher average           unit sales
prices. The favorable impact of currency exchange rates contributed           an
aggregate of $0.5 million, or 1%, to the increase in Water revenue.


Production
Animal Segment.

Revenue for PAS increased $14.0 million, or 31%, to $58.9 million from
$44.9 million for the prior year. The increase resulted primarily from higher worldwide
livestock diagnostics sales volume, including, notably, sales in Europe of our
HerdChek

®

products that test for transmissible spongiform encephalopathies.
To a lesser extent, increased average unit sales prices in certain geographies, higher
relative sales in geographies where products are sold at higher unit prices, and higher
poultry diagnostics sales volume in the Americas also contributed to production animal
products revenue growth. The favorable impact of currency exchange rates contributed an
aggregate of $0.4 million, or 1%, to the increase in PAS revenue.

Gross Profit

Total
Company.

Gross profit increased $56.6 million, or 18%, to $379.5 million from $322.9
million for the prior year. As a percentage of total revenue, gross profit was
approximately constant at 51%.

We
adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R) and began expensing share-based
compensation beginning on January 1, 2006, which had a negative impact on our gross profit
percentages and on operating margins

.

Share-based compensation expense is not

Gross profit for CAG increased $47.6 million, or 19%, to $298.0 million
from $250.4 million for the prior year due primarily to increased sales volume across the
CAG product lines and, to a lesser extent, to an increase in the gross profit percentage
to 49% from 48% for the prior year. The increase in the gross profit percentage was
largely due to lower cost of slides that are sold for use in VetTest

®

Chemistry Analyzers under the agreement with our supplier and higher average selling
prices. The increase in the gross profit percentage was partly offset by greater relative
sales of lower margin products and services such as laboratory and consulting services.

Water.

Gross
profit for Water increased $0.2 million to $38.4 million from $38.3           million for
the prior year due to higher sales volume, partly offset by a           decrease in the
gross profit percentage to 66% from 67%. The gross profit           percentage was
unfavorably impacted by increased freight and distribution costs           and higher
relative sales of lower margin products.

Production
Animal Segment.

Gross profit for PAS increased $10.9 million, or 39%, to $38.7 million
from $27.8 million for the prior year due primarily to increased sales volume and, to a
lesser extent, to an increase in the gross profit percentage to 66% from 62%. The gross
profit percentage was favorably impacted by higher relative sales of higher margin
livestock products, the absence in 2006 of certain discrete costs that occurred in 2005,
and higher average unit sales prices. Discrete costs in 2005 comprised integration costs
and the impacts of purchase accounting that were associated with an acquisition in
December 2004.

Operating Expenses and
Operating Income

Total
Company.

Total operating expenses increased $44.0 million to $251.6 million from
$207.6 million for the prior year. As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses
increased to 34% from 33% for the prior year. The change in accounting for share-based
compensation beginning January 1, 2006 resulted in an increase of $9.0 million, or 4%, in
total company operating expenses for 2006. Share-based compensation expense is not
allocated to our operating segments and therefore has been categorized as
“unallocated amounts.”


Operating
income increased $12.6 million to $127.9 million from $115.3 million for the prior year.
As a percentage of revenue, operating income decreased to 17% from 18%. The change in
accounting for share-based compensation beginning January 1, 2006 had a negative impact of
1% on reported operating income as a percentage of total company revenue.

Operating expenses for CAG increased $29.8 million, or 18%, to $197.2
million from $167.4 million for the prior year and, as a percentage of revenue, increased
to 33% from 32%. The increase was attributable to a 13% ($11.3 million) increase in sales
and marketing expense, a 20% ($10.1 million) increase in general and administrative
expense, and a 28% ($8.4 million) increase in research and development expense. The
increase in sales and marketing expense resulted primarily from higher personnel-related
costs due, in part, to expanded worldwide sales, marketing and customer service headcount
and to higher sales commissions as a result of revenue performance. To a lesser extent,
incremental activities associated with businesses acquired since January 2005 also
contributed to the increase in sales and marketing expense. The increase in general and
administrative expense resulted primarily from higher spending on facilities, information
technology and other general support functions. To a lesser extent, incremental expenses
associated with businesses acquired since January 2005, comprised mainly of amortization
expense for intangible assets acquired and general and administrative expenses of a
recurring nature to support the acquired businesses, also contributed to the increase in
general and administrative expense. Increases in general and administrative expenses were
partly offset by the favorable impact of net transaction gains on foreign currency
denominated expenses in 2006 compared to transaction losses in 2005. The increase in
research and development expense resulted primarily from increased product development
spending related primarily to IDEXX VetLab

®

instrumentation and, to a
lesser extent, rapid assay and digital radiography products.

Water.

Operating
expenses for Water increased $0.4 million, or 3%, to $12.7 million           from $12.3
million for the prior year and, as a percentage of revenue, were           constant at
22%. The increase was attributable to a 7% ($0.3 million) increase           in general
and administrative expense and a 3% ($0.1 million) increase in sales           and
marketing expense, partly offset by 5% ($0.1 million) decrease in research           and
development expense. The increase in general and administrative expense
          resulted primarily from higher spending on facilities, information technology
          and other general support functions; higher bad debt expense; higher
          compensation; and costs incurred to consolidate our office and production
          facilities based in the United Kingdom into a single facility. The increase in
          sales and marketing expense resulted primarily from higher personnel-related
          costs. The decrease in research and development expense resulted primarily from
          lower spending following the launch of the IDEXX Filta-Max

xpress

™          system,
a

Cryptosporidium

and

Giardia

testing product, in the           second
quarter of 2006.


Production
Animal Segment.

Operating expenses for PAS increased $2.0 million, or 10%, to $22.5
million from $20.5 million for the prior year. As a percentage of revenue, PAS operating
expenses decreased to 38% from 46%. The increase in operating expenses resulted primarily
from a 14% ($1.1 million) increase in general and administrative expense and a 12% ($0.9
million) increase in sales and marketing expense. The increase in general and
administrative expense resulted primarily from higher spending on facilities, information
technology and other general support functions and, to a lesser extent, from a write-down
of an equity investment in a technology licensor. Increases in general and administrative
expenses were partly offset by the absence in 2006 of certain discrete costs that occurred
in 2005 and the favorable impact of net transaction gains on foreign currency denominated
expenses in 2006 compared to transaction losses in 2005. Discrete costs in 2005 were
associated with the cessation of production in our Sweden-based facility in connection
with the centralization of our European production animal diagnostics operations in Bern,
Switzerland. The increase in sales and marketing expense resulted primarily from higher
personnel-related costs. Increases in research and development expense from higher
personnel-related costs due, in part, to expanded headcount and from higher patent-related
costs were substantially offset by lower facilities and overhead costs in Europe as a
result of the consolidation of our European production animal business, including research
and development activities, during the second half of 2005.

Unallocated
Amounts.

Operating expenses that are not allocated to our operating segments,
consisting primarily of the company-wide share-based compensation expense and corporate
research and development, increased $11.4 million to $14.9 million from $3.5 million for
the prior year. This increase is primarily due to the inclusion of share-based
compensation expense of $9.0 million in 2006 due to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) on
January 1, 2006. Corporate research and development expense grew mainly due to personnel
additions in 2005 and 2006 to support increased long-term product development activities.

Interest Income and
Interest Expense

Interest
income was $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $3.2 million for
the year ended December 31, 2005. An increase in interest income from higher interest
rates was largely offset by lower average invested cash balances.

Interest
expense was $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to $0.1 million for
the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to
interest expense incurred on the mortgage assumed in connection with the Westbrook, Maine
facility purchase in May 2006.

Provision for Income
Taxes

Our
effective income tax rate was 28.4% for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared with
34.2% for the year ended December 31, 2005. The majority of this rate differential
resulted from the favorable impact of the resolution in 2006 of an IRS income tax audit
for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2004. As a result of completing this audit, we
reduced previously accrued taxes and recognized a tax benefit of 3.7% of income before
tax. Other items that decreased our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31,
2006 included a reduction of previously recorded international deferred tax liabilities as
a result of obtaining certain multi-year tax incentives and the release of a valuation
allowance on international deferred tax assets as a result of a subsidiary demonstrating
consistent sustained profitability. In addition, the effective rate for the year ended
December 31, 2006 was less than the effective rate for the year ended December 31, 2005
due to the incremental tax expense in 2005 on the repatriation of $30.0 million pursuant
to the

American Jobs Creation Act of 2004

. These rate reductions were partly offset
by the nonrecognition, in 2006, of tax benefits on compensation expense for incentive
stock options and employee stock purchase rights that were recorded in accordance with
SFAS No. 123(R) effective January 1, 2006.

The
following revenue analysis reflects the results of operations net of the impact of
currency exchange rates on sales outside the U.S.


The
increase in sales of instruments and consumables from 2004 to 2005 was due mainly to
increased sales volume. The increased sales volume of consumables was due primarily to
higher worldwide practice-level sales of VetTest

®

slides. To a lesser
extent, increased domestic sales of consumables used with our VetLyte

®

Electrolyte Analyzers and higher practice-level sales of tubes used with our hematology
instruments also resulted in increased sales volume of consumables. Increased
VetTest

®

chemistry and hematology consumables sales volume was due
primarily to an increase in our installed base of instruments throughout 2004 and 2005.
The increase in sales of VetLyte

®

consumables was due, in part, to lower
sales in the fourth quarter of 2004 due to product unavailability, which had a favorable
impact of 1% on the growth rate for instruments and consumables during 2005. Increased
instrument sales volume resulted mainly from higher sales of LaserCyte

®

Hematology Analyzers and, to a lesser extent, the launch of our VetStat

®

Electrolyte and Blood Gas Analyzer.

The
increase in sales of rapid assay products from 2004 to 2005 was due primarily to increased
domestic practice-level sales volume of our canine combination test, the
SNAP

®

3Dx

®

Canine Test, and to higher average unit sales
prices for canine and feline products.

The
increase in sales of laboratory and consulting services from 2004 to 2005 resulted
primarily from the inclusion of sales from laboratories acquired in the fourth quarter of
2004 and in 2005 and, to a lesser extent, the impact of price increases and higher testing
volume. Incremental sales from laboratories acquired in the fourth quarter of 2004 and in
2005 contributed approximately 23% to laboratory and consulting services revenue growth
during 2005.

The
increase in sales of practice information management and digital radiography systems from
2004 to 2005 resulted from increased sales volume of digital radiography instruments. The
increase in digital radiography revenue was primarily due to an increase in the number of
systems sold, including sales attributable to a business acquired in the third quarter of
2005. Incremental sales from this acquired business contributed approximately 7% to
practice information management and digital radiography systems revenue growth during
2005.

The
increase in sales of pharmaceutical products in 2005 resulted primarily from increased
practice-level demand and, to a lesser extent, from price increases on certain products.

Water.

Revenue
for Water increased $3.7 million, or 7%, to $56.8 million from $53.1           million
for the prior year. The increase resulted primarily from higher           worldwide sales
volume, partly offset by lower average unit sales prices           attributable to both
greater price competition in certain geographies and higher           relative sales in
geographies where products are sold at lower unit prices. The           favorable impact
of currency exchange rates contributed an aggregate of $0.2           million, or less
than 1%, to the increase in Water revenue.

Production
Animal Segment.

Revenue for PAS increased $13.3 million, or 42%, to $44.9 million from
$31.7 million for the prior year. The increase resulted primarily from higher worldwide
sales volume of livestock and, to a lesser extent, poultry diagnostics, including sales
attributable to acquisitions in 2004. Incremental sales from businesses acquired during
2004 contributed approximately 17% to production animal products revenue growth during the
period. Changes in foreign currency rates did not have a significant impact on the PAS
revenue growth rate.

Gross Profit

Total
Company.

Gross profit increased $43.9 million, or 16%, to $322.9 million from $279.0
million for the prior year and, as a percentage of total revenue, was approximately

Companion
Animal Group.

Gross profit for CAG increased $35.5 million, or 17%, to $250.4 million
from $214.9 million for the prior year due primarily to increased sales volume across the
CAG product lines. As a percentage of revenue, CAG gross profit was approximately constant
at 48%. The gross profit percentage was positively impacted by relatively higher selling
prices, particularly for laboratory and consulting services and rapid assay products;
lower product and service costs associated with the LaserCyte

®

Hematology
Analyzer and lower product cost of slides sold for use in our VetTest

®

Chemistry Analyzers under the agreement with our supplier; and the favorable impact of
foreign currency rates on sales denominated in those currencies, net of foreign exchange
hedge contract losses. The increases in the gross profit percentage were largely offset by
higher overall net product and service costs, apart from the favorable
LaserCyte

®

and slide costs mentioned above; greater relative sales of lower
margin products and services, mainly from higher sales growth of laboratory services; and
write-downs of excess pharmaceutical product inventory.

Water.

Gross
profit for Water increased $2.4 million, or 7%, to $38.3 million from           $35.9
million for the prior year due primarily to increased sales volume, partly
          offset by a slight decrease in the gross profit percentage to 67% from 68%. The
          gross profit percentage was unfavorably impacted by costs related to a
          manufacturing issue during the third quarter of 2005 and by lower average unit
          sales prices. These decreases in the gross profit percentage were partly offset
          by the favorable impact of foreign currency rates on sales denominated in those
          currencies, net of foreign exchange hedge contract losses.

Production
Animal Segment.

Gross profit for PAS increased $6.6 million, or 31%, to $27.8 million
from $21.2 million for the prior year due to increased sales volume, partly offset by a
decrease in the gross profit percentage to 62% from 67%. During the same period of the
prior year, a reduction of approximately $1.8 million in an estimated liability for a
third party claim was accounted for as a reduction in cost of revenue and increased the
2004 gross profit percentage by four percentage points. For 2005, an unfavorable impact on
the gross margin percentage of two percentage points was attributable to incremental
acquisition integration costs. The gross profit percentage was favorably impacted by
higher relative sales of higher margin livestock products and by the favorable impact of
foreign currency rates on sales denominated in those currencies, net of foreign exchange
hedge contract losses, partially offset by higher net product costs.

Operating Expenses and
Operating Income

Total
Company.

Total operating expenses increased $36.6 million to $207.6 million from
$171.0 million for the prior year. As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses
increased to 33% from 31% for the prior year.

Operating
income increased $7.3 million to $115.3 million from $108.0 million for the prior year. As
a percentage of revenue, operating income decreased to 18% from 20%. During 2005,
operating income was reduced by acquisition integration costs associated with businesses
acquired in the fourth quarter of 2004 and in 2005, including costs incurred in connection
with the centralization of our European production animal diagnostics operations in Bern,
Switzerland. During 2004, operating income benefited from the settlement of a third party
claim, described in the above discussion of Production Animal Segment gross profit, and a
payment received in settlement of litigation, partly offset by acquisition integration
costs. These discrete items in both years resulted in a reported decrease in operating
income as a percentage of total company revenue of one percentage point. The remaining
difference in the operating income percentage for 2005, compared to the prior year, was
attributable, in part, to the expansion of the CAG sales, customer service and marketing
organization during 2004 and the first half of 2005; amortization expense for intangible
assets purchased in connection with businesses acquired in the fourth quarter of 2004 and
in 2005; and other changes in gross profit and operating expenses described in this
discussion.

Companion
Animal Group.

Operating expenses for CAG increased $29.6 million, or 22%, to $167.4
million from $137.8 million for the prior year and, as a percentage of revenue, increased
to 32% from 31%. The increase was attributable to a 21% ($15.1 million) increase in sales
and marketing expense, a 25% ($10.1 million) increase in general and administrative
expense, and a 17% ($4.4 million) increase in research and development expense. The
increase in sales and marketing expense resulted primarily from the expansion of the
worldwide sales, customer service and marketing organization; ongoing expenses
attributable to the Vet Med Lab business acquired in the fourth quarter of 2004 and, to a
lesser extent, the digital radiography business acquired in the third quarter of 2005 and
higher sales commissions as a result of revenue performance. The increase in general and
administrative expense resulted primarily from expenses attributable to businesses
acquired in the fourth quarter of 2004 and in 2005, comprised of general and
administrative expenses of a recurring nature, amortization expense for intangible assets
acquired, and integration costs. To a lesser extent, the increase in general and
administrative expense was also attributable to higher spending on information technology
and other general support functions; the unfavorable impact of exchange rates on foreign
currency denominated expenses; and the positive impact in 2004 of a payment received in
the second quarter of 2004 to settle certain litigation. The increase in research and
development expense resulted primarily from increased spending related to instrument
development and, to a lesser extent, rapid assay and pharmaceutical product development.

Water.

Operating
expenses for Water increased $0.7 million, or 6%, to $12.3 million           from $11.6
million for the prior year and, as a percentage of revenue, were           approximately
constant at 22%. The dollar increase was attributable to a 13%           ($0.6 million)
increase in general and administrative expense and a 12% ($0.2           million)
increase in research and development expense, partly offset by a 2%           ($0.1
million) decrease in sales and marketing expense. The increase in general           and
administrative expense resulted primarily from higher spending on           information
technology and other corporate functions, and, to a lesser extent,           from the
unfavorable impact of exchange rates on foreign currency denominated           expenses.
The increase in research and development expense resulted primarily           from
increased spending on

Cryptosporidium

testing product development.           There
were no significant individual events or fluctuations in the nature and           amounts
of sales and marketing expense.

Production
Animal Segment.

Operating expenses for PAS increased $6.3 million, or 44%, to $20.5
million from $14.2 million for the prior year and, as a percentage of revenue, increased
to 46% from 45%. The increase resulted from a 103% ($4.1 million) increase in general and
administrative expense, a 26% ($1.5 million) increase in sales and marketing expense, and
a 15% ($0.7 million) increase in research and development expense. The increase in general
and administrative expense resulted primarily from expenses associated with the
acquisition of Bommeli in the fourth quarter of 2004 and the subsequent centralization of
our European production animal diagnostics operations in Bern, Switzerland. These costs
are composed mainly of general and administrative expenses of a recurring nature to
support the Bommeli business, costs related to the cessation of production in our
Sweden-based facility, and amortization expense for intangible assets acquired. To a
lesser extent, higher spending on information technology and other corporate functions and
the unfavorable impact of exchange rates on foreign currency denominated expenses also
contributed to the increase in general and administrative expense. The increase in sales
and marketing expense resulted primarily from the addition of Bommeli sales and marketing
activities and from sales and marketing costs to support the launch of our
HerdChek

®

BSE Antigen Test Kit. The increase in research and development
expense was due primarily to the addition of Bommeli research and development activities
and to higher compensation costs, partly offset by reduced development activity following
the launch of our HerdChek

®

BSE Antigen Test Kit.

Unallocated
Amounts.

Operating expenses that are not allocated to our operating segments,
consisting primarily of corporate research and development, increased $0.3 million, or
10%, to $3.5 million from $3.2 million for the prior year due mainly to increased
long-term development activities.


Interest Income and
Interest Expense

Interest
income was $3.2 million for 2005 and 2004. The impact of higher interest rates was
substantially offset by the impact of lower average invested cash balances.

Interest
expense was $0.1 million for 2005 compared to $0.2 million in 2004. The decrease was
primarily due to interest incurred on a tax payment in December 2004 and the final payment
of a note payable in February 2005.

Provision for Income
Taxes

Our
effective income tax rate was 34.2% for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared with
29.7% for the year ended December 31, 2004. The majority of this rate differential
resulted from the favorable impact of the resolution in 2004 of an IRS income tax audit
through the year ended December 31, 2001. As a result of completing this audit, we reduced
previously accrued taxes. Other rate reductions resulted from the release in 2004 of a
valuation allowance on international deferred tax assets as a result of a foreign
subsidiary demonstrating consistent sustained profitability and changes in certain state
and international tax estimates. In addition, 2005 tax expense increased by $1.0 million
and the 2005 effective income tax rate increased by 0.8 percentage points due to
incremental taxes on the repatriation of $30.0 million pursuant to the

American Jobs
Creation Act of 2004

.

RECENT ACCOUNTING
PRONOUNCEMENTS

A
discussion of recent accounting pronouncements is included in Note 2(q) to the
consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2006 included in this
Form 10-K.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL
RESOURCES

Liquidity

We
fund the capital needs of our business through cash generated from operations. At December
31, 2006 and 2005, we had $96.7 million and $132.7 million of cash and cash equivalents
and short-term investments, respectively, and working capital of $177.5 million and $192.7
million, respectively.

We
consider the operating earnings of non-United States subsidiaries to be indefinitely
invested outside the U.S. Changes to this policy could have adverse tax consequences.
Subject to this policy, we manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available
funds among all of our subsidiaries. Foreign cash balances are generally available without
legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations outside the U.S.

In
January 2007, we entered into an unsecured short-term revolving credit facility with a
bank in the principal amount of $125.0 million that matures on June 30, 2007. The credit
facility may be used for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of our common
stock and business acquisitions. The applicable interest rates generally range from 0.375%
to 0.875% above the London interbank rate or the Canadian Dollar-denominated bankers’
acceptance rate, dependent on our leverage ratio. Under the credit facility, we pay
quarterly commitment fees of 0.08% to 0.20%, dependent on our leverage ratio, on any
unused commitment. The credit facility contains financial and other affirmative and
negative covenants, as well as customary events of default, that would allow any amounts
outstanding under the credit facility to be accelerated, or restrict our ability to borrow
thereunder, in the event of noncompliance. The financial covenant requires our ratio of
debt to earnings before interest and taxes, as defined by the agreement, not to exceed
3-to-1. We expect to enter into a long-term credit facility with similar terms prior to
June 30, 2007.

We
believe that current cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, funds generated
from operations, and amounts available under credit facilities will be sufficient to fund
our operations, capital purchase requirements, and strategic growth needs. We further
believe that we could obtain additional borrowings at comparable interest rates to fund
our growth objectives. The extent and timing of acquisitions-related spending and
repurchases of our common stock could cause variations on our liquidity and leverage
levels.


Sources and Uses of Cash

Cash
provided by operating activities was $109.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006,
compared to $116.6 million for 2005. The total of net income and net non-cash charges was
$120.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared to $105.8 million for 2005.
Reported cash flows from operations were negatively impacted by a change in accounting for
the tax benefits from exercises of stock options and disqualifying dispositions of shares
acquired in connection with our adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) on January 1, 2006, which
reduced reported cash flows from operations by $9.4 million for the year ended December
31, 2006. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the tax benefit on exercises of stock
options and disqualifying dispositions of shares was classified as a cash flow from
financing activities, whereas the benefit was classified as a cash flow from operating
activities in prior years.

In
2006, cash decreased $10.2 million due to changes in operating assets and liabilities,
whereas in 2005 cash increased by $10.7 million due to changes in operating assets and
liabilities, resulting in a year-to-year change of $21.0 million. The increase in cash
used by changes in operating assets and liabilities, compared to 2005, was primarily
attributable to $33.1 million of incremental cash used to purchase inventory, partly
offset by $7.7 million of additional cash provided by an increase in accrued liabilities
during the year ended December 31, 2006. The greater incremental increase in inventories
was due, in part, to increased inventories in support of higher sales volumes, to our
preparation for a supplier’s production facility transition, and to ensure adequate
supply of certain instrument components and accessories that are being discontinued by the
manufacturers. The reported increase in cash provided by changes in accrued liabilities,
compared to 2005, was primarily attributable to the change in the presentation of tax
benefits, noted above, of $9.4 million from exercises of stock options and disqualifying
dispositions of shares acquired.

Cash
used by investing activities was $40.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2006,
compared to cash provided by investing activities of $12.6 million for 2005. The increase
in cash used by investing activities for 2006, compared to 2005, was primarily due to the
increase in cash used for acquisitions. An incremental increase of $17.6 million in 2006
compared to 2005 was largely due to the $15.2 million paid to acquire a veterinary
reference laboratory in Canada. Additionally, in 2006 we had lower incremental net
proceeds from net sales and maturities of short- and long-term investments of $13.6
million, we paid $12.1 million for the purchase of land and buildings, and we had
incremental purchases of property and equipment of $8.1 million.

We
paid cash of $12.1 million for land and buildings, primarily for the purchase of our
Westbrook, Maine facility; $32.3 million to purchase other fixed assets; and $1.7 million
to acquire rental instruments sold under recourse during the year ended December 31, 2006,
principally related to the CAG segment. Our total capital plan for 2007 is approximately
$65 million, which includes approximately $23 million towards the renovation and expansion
of our headquarters facility in Westbrook, Maine. We preliminarily project additional
capital spending of approximately $50 million during 2008 through 2009 to complete this
expansion and renovation.

In
connection with the purchase of our Westbrook, Maine facility, we assumed a mortgage that
is payable in equal monthly installments of approximately $0.1 million through May 1,
2015. The assumed mortgage had a face value of $6.5 million and a stated interest rate of
9.875%. We recorded the mortgage at a fair market value of $7.5 million, based on an
effective market interest rate of 6.05%.

The
board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to 18,000,000 shares of our common
stock in the open market or in negotiated transactions. From the inception of the program
in August 1999 to December 31, 2006, we repurchased 15,285,000 shares. We believe that the
repurchase of our common stock is a favorable investment and we also repurchase to offset
the dilutive effect of our employee share-based compensation programs. Repurchases of our
common stock may vary depending upon the level of other investing activities and the share
price. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for
additional information about our share repurchases.


Other Commitments,
Contingencies and Guarantees

Under
our workers’ compensation insurance policies for U.S. employees for the years ended
December 31, 2006, 2005, 2004 and 2003, we retain the first $250,000 in claim liability
per incident and $3.1 million, $2.8 million, $3.0 million and $1.4 million, respectively,
in aggregate claim liability. We entered into a similar workers’ compensation
insurance policy effective January 1, 2007. The insurance company provides insurance for
claims above the individual occurrence and aggregate limits. We estimate claim liability
based on claims incurred and the estimated ultimate cost to settle the claims. Based on
this analysis, we have recognized cumulative expenses of $1.3 million, $0.6 million, $0.7
million and $0.8 million for claims incurred during the years ended December 31, 2006,
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In connection with these policies, we have outstanding
letters of credit totaling $2.1 million to the insurance companies as security for these
claims.

Under
our employee health care insurance policy, we retain claims liability risk up to $125,000
per incident and an aggregate claim limit based on the number of employees enrolled in the
plan per month. We estimate our liability for the uninsured portion of employee health
care obligations based on individual and aggregate coverage, our claims experience, the
number of employees enrolled in the program, and the average time from when a claim is
incurred to the time it is reported. Should actual employee health care claims liability
exceed estimates, we are liable for up to an additional $1.5 million for potential
uninsured obligations at December 31, 2006. We have insurance coverage of $1.0 million for
claims above the aggregate limit. Should employee health insurance claims exceed this
coverage, we would have further obligations for the amount in excess of such coverage.

In
connection with acquisitions of businesses and intangible assets, we have commitments
outstanding at December 31, 2006 for additional purchase price payments of up to $3.9
million, of which $1.8 million is contingent on the achievement by certain acquired
businesses of specified milestones.

We
previously had a 40% equity interest in a joint venture to market production animal
diagnostic products in China. In April 2006, we paid $0.6 million to acquire an additional
55% equity interest in the joint venture from our partner. We also committed to pay an
additional $0.2 million in two years in consideration for the additional equity. In
addition, the joint venture entered into a contract with the joint venture partner where
the partner will provide promotional and agency services and will receive sales
commissions at rates escalating from 2.5% to 8.5% annually based on sales volume.

In
January 2007, we acquired the Critical Care Division of Osmetech plc. The acquired
business is based in the United States and develops, manufactures, and sells point-of-care
electrolyte and blood gas analyzers and related consumable products for the human and
veterinary diagnostics markets. We paid cash of approximately $45 million.

On
January 26, 2007 we announced that we had entered into an agreement to acquire all of the
shares of Institut Pourquier. Based in Montpellier, France, Institut Pourquier develops,
manufactures and sells production animal diagnostic products. The closing of this
transaction is subject to certain conditions and is expected to occur in March 2007.
Institut Pourquier had sales of approximately $7.5 million in 2006.

In
October 2005, our former supplier of VetAutoread™ Hematology Analyzers and
consumables sold this business (including the human hematology testing products division)
and we simultaneously entered into a new supply agreement for these products with the
acquirer of the business. Under this new supply agreement, we received fixed pricing on
certain products through December 31, 2020, among other benefits. In partial consideration
for this new supply agreement, we paid cash of $2.5 million to the acquirer and guaranteed
the acquirer’s note (the “Note”) in the principal amount of $3.5 million
given to our former supplier in partial consideration for the business. The acquirer is
obligated to pay the Note through quarterly principal and interest payments through 2008
and to pay the remaining balance in 2008. The principal balance of the note that we have
guaranteed is $2.6 million at December 31, 2006. We are obligated to make a second payment
of $1.25 million upon the achievement of certain milestones by the acquirer, which we
expect to occur in approximately 2007, and a third payment of $1.25 million twelve months
later. Our obligations to make the second and third payments are subject to the
acquirer’s payment of all amounts under the Note and the release of our guaranty.

We
purchase the slides sold for use in our VetTest

®

Chemistry Analyzers under
an agreement with Ortho that, as of December 31, 2006, required us to purchase a minimum
of $59.0 million of slides through 2010. We purchase our VetAutoread™ Hematology
Analyzers, components and consumables under an agreement under which we are required to
make aggregate minimum purchases of $15.7 million through 2020, in addition to the payment
obligations described above. We also have commitments under certain other agreements that
commit us to aggregate future payments of $19.7 million. In addition, we have various
minimum royalty payments due through 2024 of $15.1 million.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE
AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK

Our
financial market risk consists primarily of foreign currency exchange rate risk. We
operate subsidiaries in 16 foreign countries and transact business in local currencies.

The
primary purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to protect against the
volatility associated with foreign currency transactions. We also utilize some natural
hedges to mitigate our transaction and commitment exposures. Corporate policy prescribes
the range of allowable hedging activity. We enter into exchange contracts with large
multinational financial institutions and we do not hold or engage in transactions
involving derivative instruments for purposes other than risk management. Our accounting
policies for these contracts are based on our designation of such instruments as hedging
transactions. Market gains and losses are deferred in prepaid expenses or accruals, as
appropriate, until the contract matures, which is the period when the related obligation
is settled. We primarily utilize forward exchange contracts with durations of less than 18
months.

Our
subsidiaries enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to minimize the impact of
foreign currency fluctuations associated with their anticipated intercompany inventory
purchases for the next twelve months. From time to time, we may also enter into foreign
currency exchange contracts to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations
associated with specific, significant transactions. Our hedging strategy is consistent
with prior periods. We enter into currency exchange contracts for amounts that are less
than the full value of forecasted intercompany sales and for amounts that are equivalent
to, or less than, other specific, significant transactions, thus no significant
ineffectiveness has resulted or been recorded through the statements of income.

Our
hedging strategy related to intercompany inventory purchases provides that we employ the
full amount of our hedges for the succeeding year at the conclusion of our budgeting
process for that year, which is complete by the end of the preceding year. Quarterly, we
enter into contracts to hedge incremental portions of anticipated foreign currency
transactions for the following year. Accordingly, our risk with respect to foreign
currency exchange rate fluctuations may vary throughout each annual cycle. At December 31,
2006, we had $1.3 million in net unrealized losses on foreign exchange contracts
designated as hedges recorded in other comprehensive income, which is net of $0.7 million
in taxes.

Our
currency rate exposure at December 31, 2006 consisted of local currency revenues and
expenses, the impact of hedge contracts and balances denominated in a currency other than
the Company’s or its subsidiaries’ functional currency. Based on our overall
currency rate exposure, excluding unrealized losses of $2.0 million at December 31, 2006
and unrealized gains of $0.8 million at December 31, 2005 on foreign exchange contracts
designated as hedges, a 10% weakening or strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to
foreign currencies at December 31, 2006 would increase or decrease operating income,
respectively, by approximately $3.1 million in 2007 and a 10% weakening or strengthening
of the U.S. dollar from December 31, 2005 would have increased or decreased operating
income, respectively, by approximately $2.6 million in 2006. As of December 31, 2006, a
10% weakening or strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies,
excluding the impact of hedge contracts currently in place, would increase or reduce
operating income, respectively, by approximately $13.9 million in 2007, compared to $9.7
million in 2006.

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND
DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

Not

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND
PROCEDURES

Disclosure Controls and
Procedures

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and
procedures, as defined by the SEC in its Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended (the “Exchange Act”). The term
“disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that
are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the company in the
reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms.
Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports
that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the
company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial
officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and
operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and
management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of
possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and
procedures as of December 31, 2006, our chief executive officer and chief financial
officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our
disclosure controls and procedures are effective to achieve their stated purpose.

Report of Management on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We
are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. The
Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States of America and includes those policies and
procedures that:

•

Pertain
to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;

•

Provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and
that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and

•

Provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material
effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to
future periods are subject to risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes
in conditions and that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may
deteriorate.


We
conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
based on the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway commission. Based on this
evaluation, we conclude that, as of December 31, 2006, our internal control over financial
reporting was effective.

Our
assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2006 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent
registered public accounting firm, as indicated in their report that is included herein.

Changes in Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules
13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the three months ended December 31,
2006 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

certifications with respect to disclosure controls and procedures and internal control
over financial reporting of the Company’s chief executive officer and chief financial
officer are attached as Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT
REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and
Stockholders of IDEXX Laboratories, Inc

.:

We have completed integrated audits
of IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.‘s consolidated financial statements and of its internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, in accordance with the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Our opinions, based on
our audits, are presented below.

Consolidated financial
statements and financial statement schedule

In our opinion, the consolidated
financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. and its
subsidiaries at December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the results of their operations and their
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006 in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In
addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the
index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the
information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated
financial statements. These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the
responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our
audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit of financial statements
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

As discussed in Note 2(l) to the
consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for
share-based compensation in 2006.

Internal control over
financial reporting

Also, in our opinion,
management’s assessment, included in the Report of Management on Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A, that the Company maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006 based on criteria
established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal Control —
Integrated Framework issued by the COSO. The Company’s management is responsible for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of
the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to
express opinions on management’s assessment and on the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted
our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An
audit of internal control over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment,
testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and
performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control
over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and
(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have
a material effect on the financial statements.

F-2

Because of its inherent limitations,
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 NATURE OF BUSINESS

We
develop, manufacture and distribute products and provide services for the veterinary and
the food and water testing markets. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we operated
primarily through three reportable segments: products and services for the veterinary
market, which is referred to as the Companion Animal Group (“CAG”), water
quality products (“Water”) and products for production animal health, which is
referred to as the Production Animal Segment (“PAS”). Our products and services
are sold worldwide. See Note 16 for additional information regarding our reportable
operating segments, products and services, and geographical areas.

NOTE 2 SUMMARY OF
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

(a)     Consolidation

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of IDEXX Laboratories,
Inc. and our wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries, and all other entities in which
we have a variable interest and are determined to be the primary beneficiary. All material
intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.

(b)     Estimates

The
preparation of these financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make estimates and
judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses,
and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we
evaluate these estimates, including those related to bad debts; goodwill and other
intangible assets; income taxes; inventory; investments; revenue recognition, including
customer programs and incentives, product returns, and multiple element arrangements;
share-based compensation; warranty reserves; and contingencies. We accrue contingent
liabilities when it is probable that future expenditures will be made and such
expenditures can reasonably be estimated. We base our estimates on historical experience
and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances,
the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of
assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results
may differ from these estimates.

(c)     Inventories

Inventories
include material, labor and overhead, and are stated at the lower of cost (first-in,
first-out) or market. We write down inventory for estimated obsolescence when warranted by
estimates of future demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less
favorable than those we estimated, additional inventory write-downs may be required, which
would have a negative effect on results of operations.

The
components of inventories are as follows

(d)     Property
and Equipment

Property
and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. When
an item is sold or retired, the cost and related accumulated depreciation is relieved, and
the resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognized in the statement of income. We provide
for depreciation and amortization primarily using the straight-line method by charges to
income in amounts that allocate the cost of property and equipment over their estimated
useful lives as follows:

F-8

Asset Classification

Estimated Useful Life

Land improvements

15 years

Buildings and improvements

32-40 years

Leasehold improvements

Shorter of life of lease or

useful life

Machinery and equipment

3-5 years

Office furniture and equipment

3-7 years

We
recorded depreciation expense of $21.6 million, $17.8 million and $14.7 million for the
years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

(e)     Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets

A
significant portion of the purchase prices of our business acquisitions is assigned to
intangible assets. Intangible assets other than goodwill are initially valued at the
lesser of fair value or, if applicable, fair value proportionately reduced by the excess
of the fair value of acquired net assets over cost, (collectively, “fair value”)
when acquired. If a market value is not readily available, the fair value of the
intangible asset is estimated based on discounted cash flows using market participant
assumptions. Goodwill is initially valued based on the excess of the purchase price of a
business combination over the fair values of acquired net assets.

We
provide for amortization using the straight-line and accelerated methods by charges to
income in amounts that allocate the intangible assets over their estimated useful lives as
follows:

Asset Classification

Estimated

Useful Life

Patents

15 years

Other product rights

5-15 years

Customer-related intangible assets

5-15 years

Other, primarily noncompete agreements

2-10 years

We
assess the impairment of identifiable intangible assets and other long-lived assets
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be
recoverable. Factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review
include, but are not limited to, the following:

•

Significant
under-performance relative to historical or projected future operating results;

•

Failures
to obtain regulatory approval of certain products;

•

Significant
changes in regulations;

•

Significant
changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall
business;

•

Significant
increase in the discount rate assumed to calculate the present value of future cash flow;

•

Significant
negative industry or economic trends;

•

Significant advancements or changes in technology; and

•

Cancellation
or significant changes in contractual relationships.

We
continually assess the realizability of intangible assets other than goodwill in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 144,
“Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets” (“SFAS No.
144”). If an impairment review is triggered, we evaluate the carrying value of
long-lived assets by determining if impairment exists based on estimated undiscounted
future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the assets and comparing that value to
the carrying value of the assets. If the carrying value of the asset is greater than the
estimated future cash flows, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value. In
determining expected future cash flows, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which
cash flows are identifiable and independent of cash flows from other asset groups. The
cash flow estimates that are used contain our best estimates, using appropriate and
customary assumptions and projections at the time.

F-9

We
assess goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances indicate an
impairment may exist, in accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets” (“SFAS No. 142”). For impairment testing, we identify our reporting
units, allocate assets and liabilities (including goodwill) to the reporting units and
compare the reporting units’ net book value to their estimated fair value. The fair
value of the reporting units is estimated using a discounted cash flow approach. The cash
flow estimates used contain our best estimates, using appropriate and customary
assumptions and projections at the time. If a reporting unit’s net book value exceeds
its fair value, then the implied fair value of goodwill is determined. If the net book
value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill, a goodwill impairment loss
is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. No impairment has been identified as a
result of the annual or event-driven reviews during the years ended December 31, 2006,
2005 or 2004.

(f)     Warranty
Reserves

We
provide for the estimated cost of product warranties in cost of product revenue at the
time revenue is recognized based on the estimated cost to repair the instrument over its
warranty period. Cost of revenue reflects not only estimated warranty expense for the
systems sold in the current period, but also any changes in estimated warranty expense for
the installed base that results from our quarterly evaluation of service experience. Our
actual warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and service costs incurred
in correcting product failures. Should actual product failure rates or service costs
differ from our estimates, which are based on historical data, revisions to the estimated
warranty liability would be required. Following is a summary of changes in accrued
warranty reserve for products sold to customers for the years ended December 31, 2006 and
2005, respectively

(g)     Income
Taxes

We
account for income taxes under SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.” This
statement requires that we recognize a current tax liability or asset for current taxes
payable or refundable, respectively, and a deferred tax liability or asset, as the case
may be, for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between book and tax
treatment of assets and liabilities and carryforwards to the extent they are realizable.
We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is
more likely than not to be realized. While we consider future taxable income and ongoing
prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation
allowance, in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred
tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, an adjustment to the
deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made.
Likewise, should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net
deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged
to income in the period such determination was made. Significant judgment is required in
determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and our income tax filings are
regularly under audit by tax authorities. We periodically assess our exposures related to
our worldwide provision for income taxes and believe that we have appropriately accrued
taxes for contingencies. Any reduction of these contingent liabilities or additional
assessment would increase or decrease income, respectively, in the period such
determination was made. Interest expense and penalties associated with the underpayment of
income taxes are included in income tax expense. See Note 9 for additional information
regarding income taxes.

F-10

(h)     Sales
and Value Added Taxes

We
calculate, collect from our customers, and remit to governmental authorities sales, value
added and excise taxes assessed by governmental authorities in connection with
revenue-producing transactions with our customers. We report these taxes on a net basis
and do not include these tax amounts in revenue or costs of sales.

(i)     Revenue
Recognition

We
recognize revenue when four criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence that an arrangement
exists, (ii) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, (iii) the sales price
is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectibility is reasonably assured.

•

We
recognize revenue at the time of shipment to distributors for substantially all products
sold through distributors as title and risk of loss pass to these customers on delivery
to the common carrier. Our distributors do not have the right to return products. We
recognize revenue for the remainder of our customers when the product is delivered to the
customer except as noted below.

•

We
recognize revenue from the sales of instruments, noncancelable software licenses and
hardware systems upon installation (and completion of training if applicable) and the
customer’s acceptance of the instrument or system because at this time we have no
significant further obligations.

•

We
recognize service revenue at the time the service is performed.

•

We
recognize revenue associated with extended maintenance agreements over the life of the
contracts. Amounts collected in advance of revenue recognition are recorded as a current
or long-term liability based on the time from the balance sheet date to the future date
of revenue recognition.

•

We
recognize revenue on certain instrument systems under rental programs over the life of
the rental agreement. Amounts collected in advance of revenue recognition are recorded as
a current or long-term liability based on the time from the balance sheet date to the
future date of revenue recognition.

Certain
diagnostic instruments and practice information management systems offered for sale may
include software that is considered more than incidental to the utility and value of the
product. Sales arrangements may provide for software update rights or postcontract
customer support. Judgment is required to determine whether sales arrangements include
multiple elements.

When
multiple products and/or services are sold together, we generally allocate the total
consideration received amongst the elements based on their relative fair values, which is
determined by amounts charged separately for the delivered and undelivered elements to
other customers. When there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the
undelivered elements but no such evidence for the delivered elements, the fair value of
the undelivered elements is deferred and the residual revenue is allocated to the
delivered elements. The delivered elements are recognized as revenue when appropriate
under the policies described above. If there is not sufficient evidence of the fair value
of the undelivered elements, no revenue is allocated to the delivered elements and the
total consideration received is deferred until delivery of those elements for which
objective and reliable evidence of the fair value is not available. Shipping costs
reimbursed by the customer are included in revenue.

We
record estimated reductions to revenue in connection with customer programs and incentive
offerings, which may give customers credits, award points, or trade-in rights. Awards
points may be applied to trade receivables owed to us and/or toward future purchase of our
products and services. We estimate these reductions based on our experience with similar
customer programs in prior years. Revenue reductions are recorded on a quarterly basis
based on issuance of credits, points actually awarded, and estimates of points to be
awarded in the future based on current revenue. For the SNAP Up the
Savings

™

program, estimates of future points are revised quarterly and
finalized annually in the third quarter of each year upon the issuance of points to
customers. For our Practice Developer

™

volume discount program, we have
reduced revenue assuming all points granted will result in future credits because the
historical forfeitures have been de minimus. On November 30 of each year, unused points
awarded before January 1 of the prior year expire.

F-11

We
may offer customers the right to trade in instruments for credit against the purchase
price of other instruments acquired in the future. For trade-in rights, we have reduced
revenue using estimates regarding the percentage of qualifying instruments that will be
traded in and the average trade-in value.

We
recognize revenue only in those situations where collection from the customer is
reasonably assured. We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses
resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. We base our
estimates on detailed analysis of specific customer situations and a percentage of our
accounts receivable by aging category. If the financial condition of our customers were to
deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payment, additional
allowances might be required.

(j)     Research
and Development and Software Development Costs

Research
and Development costs are expensed as incurred. In accordance with SFAS No. 86,
“Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise
Marketed” (“SFAS No. 86”), we evaluate our software research and
development costs for capitalization after the technological feasibility of software and
products containing software has been established. No software development costs have been
capitalized by us because costs eligible for capitalization under SFAS No. 86 have been
insignificant. Research and development expenses consist of salaries, employee benefits,
materials and consulting costs.

(k)     Advertising
Costs

Advertising
costs, which are recognized as sales and marketing expense in the period in which they are
incurred, were $1.5 million, $1.5 million and $1.0 million for the years ended December
31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

(l)     Share-Based
Compensation

In
December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS No.
123(R), “Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS No. 123(R)”), which is a revision
of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” and SFAS No. 148,
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation—Transition and Disclosure—An
Amendment of FASB No. 123” (collectively, “SFAS No. 123, as Amended”) and
supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued
to Employees” (“APB No. 25”). During 2005 and 2006, the FASB also issued
Staff Positions No. FAS 123(R)-1, -2, -3, -4, -5 and -6 to provide application guidance
related to SFAS No. 123(R).

SFAS
No. 123(R) requires all share-based compensation to employees, including grants of stock
options, to be valued at fair value on the date of grant, and to be expensed over the
requisite service period (generally the vesting period). Prior to January 1, 2006, we
measured costs related to employee share-based compensation plans in accordance with APB
No. 25. Accordingly, no employee compensation cost was recognized for these plans prior to
January 1, 2006.

We
adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R) on January 1, 2006 and elected the modified
prospective method of transition to the fair-value-based method of accounting for
stock-based employee compensation prescribed by SFAS No. 123(R). Effective January 1,
2006, under the modified prospective method, share-based compensation expense includes
expense for unvested awards at December 31, 2005 and all awards granted subsequent to
December 31, 2005. Share-based compensation expense for the unvested awards outstanding at
December 31, 2005 is based on the grant-date fair value previously calculated in
developing the pro forma disclosures in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123, as
Amended.

In
connection with the adoption of SFAS 123(R), we adopted the straight-line method to
prospectively expense share-based awards granted subsequent to December 31, 2005. The
graded-vesting, or accelerated, method has been used to record the expense for stock
options granted prior to January 1, 2006.

Beginning
in 2006, we modified our share-based employee compensation programs to shift from the
grant of stock options and employee stock purchase rights only to the grant of a mix of
restricted stock units and stock options, along with employee stock purchase rights. There
were no modifications to the terms of outstanding options during 2006 or 2005.

F-12

We
issue new shares of common stock to satisfy option and employee stock purchase right
exercises and to settle restricted stock units and deferred stock units. At December 31,
2006, a remaining total of 797,000 shares of common stock was authorized by our
shareholders and was available for future grants of share-based compensation.

(m)     Foreign
Currency Translation

Assets
and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries are translated using the exchange rate in
effect at the balance sheet date. Revenue and expense accounts are translated using a
weighted average of exchange rates in effect during the period. Cumulative translation
gains and losses are shown in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as a separate
component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Exchange gains and losses
arising from transactions denominated in foreign currencies other than our
subsidiaries’ respective functional currencies are included in operating expenses.
Included in general and administrative expenses are aggregate foreign exchange currency
transaction gains of $0.8 million, losses of $0.8 million, and gains of $0.4 million for
the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Additionally, for the year
ended December 31, 2005, a cumulative translation loss of $0.5 million was transferred
from accumulated other comprehensive income and included in general and administrative
expenses as a result of the closure of our Sweden-based operation and the associated
centralization of our European production animal diagnostics operations products
manufacturing in Switzerland.

(n)     Derivative
Instruments and Hedging

We
follow SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities” as amended by SFAS No. 137, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities—Deferral of the Effective Date of SFAS No. 133” and SFAS
No. 138, “Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities—An Amendment of SFAS No. 133” (“SFAS No. 133, as Amended”).
SFAS No. 133, as Amended requires that all derivatives, including forward currency
exchange contracts, be recognized on the balance sheet at fair value. Derivatives that are
not hedges must be recorded at fair value through earnings. If a derivative is a hedge,
depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative are
either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged item through earnings or
recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings.
We immediately record in earnings the extent to which a hedge is not effective in
achieving offsetting changes in fair value.

The
primary purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to protect against the
volatility associated with foreign currency transactions. We also utilize some natural
hedges to mitigate our transaction and commitment exposures. We enter into exchange
contracts with large multinational financial institutions and we do not hold or engage in
transactions involving derivative instruments for purposes other than risk management. Our
accounting policies for these contracts are based on our designation of such instruments
as hedging transactions. Market gains and losses are deferred in prepaid expenses or
accruals, as appropriate, until the contract matures, which is the period when the related
obligation is settled. Our subsidiaries enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to
minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations associated with their anticipated
intercompany inventory purchases for the next twelve months. From time to time, we may
also enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to minimize the impact of foreign
currency fluctuations associated with specific, significant transactions. We enter into
currency exchange contracts for amounts that are less than the full value of forecasted
intercompany sales and for amounts that are equivalent to, or less than, other specific,
significant transactions, thus no significant ineffectiveness has resulted or been
recorded through the statements of income.

In
addition to hedges for anticipated 2007 intercompany inventory purchases, we had a foreign
currency exchange contract outstanding at December 31, 2006 to hedge the repayment by our
Canadian subsidiary of an intercompany loan denominated in U.S. Dollars that the
subsidiary used to fund the acquisition of a veterinary reference laboratory business,
which had a U.S dollar equivalent of $11.2 million at December 31, 2006. This contract
expires on February 28, 2007, at which time the intercompany loan will be repaid using
funds borrowed under our credit facility. At December 31, 2006, we recorded $2.0 million
in unrealized losses through accumulated other comprehensive loss from foreign exchange
contracts with 2007 expiration dates. At December 31, 2005, we recorded $0.8 million in
unrealized gains through accumulated other comprehensive income from foreign exchange
contracts with 2006 expiration dates. The foreign currency contracts, which extend through
December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, consisted of the following

December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

(o)

Disclosure
of Fair Value of Financial Instruments and Concentration of Risk

Financial
instruments consist mainly of cash and cash equivalents, investments, accounts receivable,
accounts payable and notes payable. Financial instruments that potentially subject us to
concentrations of credit risk are principally cash, cash equivalents, investments and
accounts receivable. We place our investments in highly rated financial institutions and
investment grade money market funds and municipal bonds. Concentration of credit risk with
respect to accounts receivable is limited to certain customers to whom we make substantial
sales. To reduce risk, we routinely assess the financial strength of our customers and, as
a consequence, believe that our accounts receivable credit risk exposure is limited. We
maintain an allowance for potential credit losses, but historically have not experienced
any significant credit losses related to an individual customer or group of customers in
any particular industry or geographic area. The carrying amounts of our financial
instruments approximate fair market value. See Note 16 for further discussion of
concentration of credit risk of accounts receivable.

We
currently purchase many products and materials from single sources or a limited number of
sources. Some of the products that we purchase from these sources are proprietary, and,
therefore, cannot be readily or easily replaced by alternative sources. If we are unable
to obtain adequate quantities of these products in the future, we could face cost
increases or reductions, delays or discontinuations in product shipments, which could have
a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

(p)     Comprehensive
Income

SFAS
No. 130, “Reporting Comprehensive Income,” requires us to report all changes in
equity during a period, resulting from net income and transactions or other events and
circumstances from non-owner sources, in a financial statement for the period in which
they are recognized. We have chosen to disclose comprehensive income, which encompasses
net income, foreign currency translation adjustments and the difference between the cost
and the fair market value of investments in debt securities and foreign exchange
contracts, in the Consolidated Statement of Stockholders’ Equity. We consider the
foreign currency cumulative translation adjustment to be permanently invested and,
therefore, have not provided income taxes on those amounts.

Accumulated
other comprehensive income consists of the following at December 31, 2006 and 2005,
respectively,

(q)     Recent
Accounting Pronouncements

In
June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation (“FIN”) No. 48, “Accounting
for Uncertainty in Income Taxes” (“FIN 48”). FIN 48 clarifies the
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements and
prescribes a comprehensive model for the recognition, measurement, and financial statement
disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns. The
provisions of FIN 48 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. We
are adopting the provisions of FIN 48 for the quarter ending March 31, 2007. We are
studying this pronouncement and awaiting further interpretive guidance and, as such, we
have not yet determined the expected impact of the implementation of FIN 48. We will
record the change in net assets that results from the adoption of FIN 48 as of January 1,
2007 as an adjustment to retained earnings. While the ultimate realization of income tax
benefits and expenses is not impacted by the provisions of FIN 48, the timing of
recognition of the effects of uncertain tax positions in the results of operations for
specific periods, and the financial position at specific points in time, prior to the
ultimate settlement of such uncertain tax positions could be materially different under
the provisions of FIN 48 compared to the timing of recognition under historical methods
used prior to the adoption of FIN 48. The adoption of FIN 48 will not have an effect on
our cash flows.

In
June 2006, the FASB ratified the Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) consensus
on Issue 06-2, “Accounting for Sabbatical Leave and Other Similar Benefits Pursuant
to FASB Statement No. 43, Accounting for Compensated Absences” (“EITF
06-2”). EITF 06-2 requires that the costs associated with unrestricted sabbaticals
and other similar benefit arrangements be recognized over the service period during which
the employee earns the benefit. We provide an additional four weeks of compensated
personal growth leave to all U.S. salaried employees in their tenth anniversary year of
employment and again at each fifth year thereafter. The provisions of EITF 06-2 are
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. Accordingly, we will record
a cumulative effect adjustment of approximately $1.8 million to recognize an estimated
liability, net of a tax benefit of $1.2 million, as of January 1, 2007 for eligible
employees’ rights to receive future paid leave. Beginning in 2007, we will recognize
estimated costs for such future compensated leave benefits earned. We estimate that
approximately $0.3 million of compensation expense, before tax, will be recognized during
the year ending December 31, 2007 in accordance with EITF 06-2. The adoption of EITF 06-2
will not have an effect on our cash flows.

In
September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements”
(“SFAS No. 157”). SFAS No. 157 establishes a framework for measuring fair value
and expands financial statement disclosures about fair value measurements. The provisions
of SFAS No. 157 are required as of the beginning of the first fiscal year beginning after
November 15, 2007 and shall generally be applied prospectively. We are studying SFAS No.
157 and have not yet determined the expected impact of the implementation of this
pronouncement on our financial position and results of operations, if any. The adoption of
SFAS No. 157 will not have an effect on our cash flows.

In
September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin
(“SAB”) No. 108 (“SAB No. 108”) which provides guidance on the
consideration of the effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying current year
misstatements for the purpose of a materiality assessment. The provisions of SAB No. 108
are effective for the first annual financial statements for years ending after November
15, 2006. We adopted the provisions of SAB No. 108 as of December 31, 2006. The adoption of
SAB No. 108 did not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or
cash flows.

In
September 2006, the FASB ratified the Emerging Issues Task Force consensus on Issue 06-1,
“Accounting for Consideration Given by a Service Provider to Manufacturers or
Resellers of Equipment Necessary for an End-Customer to Receive Service from the Service
Provider” (“EITF 06-1”). EITF 06-1 requires that if the consideration given
by a service provider to a manufacturer or reseller (that is not a customer of the service
provider) can be linked contractually to the benefit received by the service
provider’s customer, a service provider should account for the characterization of
the consideration in accordance with EITF Issue 01-9. The provisions of EITF 06-1 are
effective for the first annual reporting period beginning after June 15, 2007. We do not
expect the adoption of EITF 06-1 to have a material effect on our financial position and
results of operations. The adoption of EITF 06-1 will not have an effect on our cash
flows.

F-15

NOTE 3 BUSINESS
ACQUISITIONS

We
paid cash of $23.9 million, $7.5 million and $53.6 million to acquire businesses during
the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and recognized
liabilities, including contingent liabilities and deferred tax liabilities associated with
purchase accounting, of $4.6 million, $2.0 million and $14.3 million, respectively. We
also agreed to make subsequent purchase price payments to sellers for various acquisitions
and issued a note payable of $1.0 million associated with a 2004 acquisition.

In
connection with acquisitions of businesses and intangible assets, we have commitments
outstanding at December 31, 2006 for additional purchase price payments of up to $3.9
million, of which $1.8 million is contingent on the achievement by certain acquired
businesses of specified milestones. In addition to these purchase price payments of $3.9
million, we also have agreed to make payments of up to $0.8 million to sellers of certain
acquired businesses that are conditional upon those sellers providing future services to
IDEXX for specified periods of time. These contingent payments will be recognized as
compensation and consulting expense over the remaining service periods when management
deems payment to be probable.

The
2004 acquisitions included veterinary reference laboratories in the United States and
Europe and production animal diagnostics businesses in the United States and Europe.
Goodwill of $28.0 million and $7.4 million were assigned to the Companion Animal Group
segment and the Production Animal Segment, respectively. Amortizable intangible assets of
$15.1 million and $11.0 million were assigned to the Companion Animal Group segment and
the Production Animal Segment, respectively.

The
2005 acquisitions included veterinary reference laboratories in the United States and
Europe and a digital radiography business based in the United States. As of December 31,
2005, goodwill and amortizable intangible assets of $2.1 million and $5.3 million,
respectively, were assigned to the Companion Animal Group segment. During the year ended
December 31, 2006, we recognized incremental amortizable intangible assets of $1.9 million
in connection with the finalization of purchase price allocations for certain 2005
acquisitions.

The
2006 acquisitions included veterinary reference laboratories in the United States, Canada
and South Africa; a veterinary practice information management software business based in
the United States; and certain intellectual property and distribution rights from a
diagnostics company based in Australia. Goodwill and amortizable intangible assets of
$11.0 million and $13.3 million, respectively, were assigned to the Companion Animal Group
segment.

The
results of operations of the acquired businesses have been included since their respective
acquisition dates. Pro forma information has not been presented because such information
is not material to the financial statements taken as a whole. The final purchase price
allocations for certain 2006 acquisitions are subject to finalization of the valuation of
certain assets and liabilities and, as a result, preliminary amounts assigned to assets
and liabilities are subject to revision in future periods.

In
January 2007, we acquired the Critical Care Division of Osmetech plc. The acquired
business is based in the United States and develops, manufactures, and sells point-of-care
electrolyte and blood gas analyzers and related consumable products for the human and
veterinary diagnostics markets. We paid cash of approximately $45 million.

NOTE 4 SHARE-BASED
COMPENSATION

Selected
financial impacts of share-based compensation, excluding the impact of deferred stock
units issued under our Director Deferred Compensation Plan or our Executive Deferred
Compensation Plan that do not have vesting conditions (which are described below), are
presented in the table below (

in thousands, except per share amounts

):

Share-based
compensation costs are classified in costs of sales and operating expenses consistently
with the classification of cash compensation paid to the employees receiving such
share-based compensation. Capitalized share-based employee compensation cost at December
31, 2006 was $0.2 million, which was included in inventory on the consolidated balance
sheet.

Our
financial statements for periods ending prior to January 1, 2006 have not been restated or
revised. Had compensation cost for the Company’s share-based compensation for the
years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 been determined consistent with the provisions of
SFAS No. 123, as Amended, the Company’s net income and net income per common share
would have been reduced to the following pro forma amounts (

F-17

Prior
to the adoption of SFAS 123(R), we reported all income tax benefits resulting from the
exercise of stock options as operating cash inflows in our consolidated statements of cash
flows. SFAS 123(R) requires the benefits of tax deductions from the exercise of options in
excess of the compensation cost for those options to be reported as financing cash
inflows. FASB Staff Position (“FSP”) No. FAS 123(R)-3, “Transition Election
Related to Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment Awards” provides an
alternative transitional method of calculating the excess tax benefits available to absorb
tax deficiencies recognized subsequent to the adoption of SFAS 123(R). In accordance with
FSP No. FAS 123(R)-3, which we elected, the full amount of tax benefits related to
exercises after December 31, 2005 of employee share-based compensation awards that were
fully vested as of December 31, 2005 are reported as financing cash inflows. For the year
ended December 31, 2006, $9.4 million of tax benefits were reported as financing cash
inflows rather than operating cash inflows.

The
fair value of options, restricted stock units, deferred stock units with vesting
conditions, and employee stock purchase rights awarded during the years ended December 31,
2006, 2005 and 2004 totaled $11.9 million, $15.7 million and $13.4 million, respectively.
The total unrecognized compensation cost for unvested share-based compensation awards
outstanding at December 31, 2006, net of estimated forfeitures, was $14.6 million.
Approximately $6.3 million is expected to be recognized in the year ending December 31,
2007 for outstanding awards and decreasing amounts of the total expense are expected to be
recognized over the subsequent five years, resulting in a weighted average remaining
expense recognition period of approximately 1.5 years.

Stock Incentive Plan

During
2003, our Board of Directors approved the 2003 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended (the
“2003 Stock Plan”) pursuant to which our employees and Directors may receive
various types of share-based incentives, including stock options, restricted stock units,
stock appreciation rights and deferred stock units. A total of 1,850,000 shares of common
stock are authorized for issuance under the 2003 Stock Plan, provided that no more than
1,500,000 shares will be available for the grant of incentive stock options, and no more
than 600,000 shares will be available for awards other than stock options and stock
appreciation rights (such as restricted stock). In addition, if any options granted under
our prior plans, including the 1991 Stock Option Plan, the 1998 Stock Incentive Plan or the
2000 Director Option Plan, terminate, expire or are forfeited without having been
exercised in full, the shares subject to such unexercised options are available for
issuance under the 2003 Stock Plan. Options granted under the 2003 Stock Plan and prior
plans may not be granted at an exercise price less than the fair market value of the
common stock on the date granted (or less than 110% of the fair market value in the case
of incentive stock options granted to holders of more than 10% of our Common Stock).
Options may not be granted for a term of more than ten years. The vesting schedule of all
options granted under the 2003 Stock Plan is determined by the Compensation Committee of
the Board of Directors at the time of grant.

Options

Option
awards are granted to employees with an exercise price equal to the closing market price
of our common stock at the date of grant and generally vest ratably over five years on
each anniversary of the date of grant, conditional on continuous service. Options granted
to non-employee directors in 2005 vested fully on the first anniversary of the date of
grant. Upon any change in control of the company, 25% of the unvested stock options then
outstanding will vest and become exercisable. However, if the acquiring entity does not
assume outstanding options, then all options will vest immediately prior to the change in
control.

We
use the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model to determine the fair value of options
granted. Option-pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions,
particularly for the expected stock price volatility. Changes in the subjective input
assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate. Our expected stock price
volatility assumptions are based on the historical volatility of our stock for the
expected term and other relevant factors. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S.
Treasury yields for the expected term in effect at the approximate date of grant. We have
never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we have no present intention to pay
a dividend; therefore, we assumed that no dividends will be paid over the expected terms
of option awards.

F-18

The
use of the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model, the general methods employed to
develop the above-described option valuation assumptions, and the vesting conditions of
option awards are consistent with prior periods. Beginning in 2006, the contractual terms
of employee option grants were reduced from ten years to seven years and we elected to use
the simplified method described in the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting
Bulletin No. 107, which is based on vesting and contractual terms, to develop the expected
term assumption for 2006 option awards. Additionally, beginning in 2006, share-based
compensation expense is reduced for an estimate of the number of awards that are expected
to be forfeited. The estimate is based on historical data and other factors, and
compensation expense is adjusted for actual results.

The
weighted average valuation assumptions used to determine the fair value of each option
grant on the date of grant and the weighted average estimated fair values were as follows:

Employee Stock Purchase
Plan

During
1997, the Board of Directors approved the 1997 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, under which
we reserved and may issue up to an aggregate of 620,000 shares of Common Stock in
periodic offerings. Also during 1997, the Board of Directors approved the 1997
International Employee Stock Purchase Plan, under which we reserved and could issue up to
an aggregate of 30,000 shares of Common Stock in semiannual offerings. The 1997
International Employee Stock Purchase Plan was terminated in February 2005, and there
were no shares remaining thereunder at the time of termination.

F-19

Prior
to July 1, 2005, stock was sold under each of these plans at 85% of its fair market
value, as defined in the plans as the lower of the closing price of our common stock at
the beginning of the period and the closing price of our common stock at the end of the
period. For periods ended prior to July 1, 2005, in order to determine the pro forma
impact under SFAS No. 123, as Amended, the fair value of the purchase rights issued under
the employee stock purchase plan was estimated on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. The following weighted average assumptions
were used to determine the fair value of employee purchase rights for the six months
ended June 30, 2005 and the year ended December 31, 2004:

Effective
July 1, 2005, we amended our employee stock purchase plan to provide that stock is sold at
85% of the closing price of the stock on the last day of the period and to change the
subscription period from six months to three months. The fair value of purchase rights
under the revised program equals the 15% discount from the market price at the exercise
date, which is the last day of the subscription period.

Restricted and Other
Deferred Stock Units With Vesting Conditions

Restricted
stock unit awards to employees either vest ratably over five years on each anniversary of
the date of grant, or vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant. Vesting is
conditional on continuous service. Restricted stock units are converted to an equivalent
number of shares of common stock upon vesting. Upon any change in control of the company,
25% of the unvested restricted stock units then outstanding under the 2003 Stock Incentive
Plan will vest, provided, however, that if the acquiring entity does not assume the
restricted stock units, then all such units will vest immediately prior to the change in
control. Deferred stock units with vesting conditions awarded to non-employee directors
under the Director Deferred Compensation Plan vest fully on the first anniversary of the
date of grant. Except upon a change in control, as defined in the Director Deferred
Compensation Plan, or certain limited circumstances, all deferred stock units will be
exchanged for an equivalent number of shares of common stock one year following a
director’s resignation or retirement. Upon a change in control, unvested deferred
stock units vest immediately.

The
fair values of restricted and deferred stock units with vesting conditions are based on
the closing sale price of the common stock on the date of grant. We use historical data
and other factors to estimate employee termination behavior and to evaluate whether
particular groups of employees have significantly different forfeiture behaviors.
Share-based compensation expense is reduced for an estimate of the number of awards that
are expected to be forfeited. The estimate is based on historical data and other factors,
and compensation expense is adjusted for actual results.

The
weighted average fair value per unit of restricted stock units granted during the year
ended December 31, 2006 was $78.01. The weighted average fair value per unit of deferred
stock units with vesting conditions granted during the year ended December 31, 2006 was
$77.47. There were no restricted stock units or deferred stock units with vesting
conditions granted in 2005 or 2004.

Deferred Stock Units
With No Vesting Conditions

Under
our Director Deferred Compensation Plan, non-employee directors also may defer a portion
of their cash fees in the form of vested deferred stock units, each of which represents
the right to receive one unissued share of our common stock. Directors receive a number of
deferred stock units equal to the amount of cash fees deferred divided by the closing sale
price of the common stock on the date of deferral. Under our Executive Deferred
Compensation Plan (the “Executive Plan”), certain members of our management may
elect to defer a portion of their cash compensation in deferred stock units. These
deferred stock units will be exchanged for a fixed number of shares of common stock on
dates determined by the employee, subject to the limitations of the Executive Plan and
applicable law. Except upon a change in control, as defined in the Director Deferred
Compensation Plan and the Executive Plan, or certain other limited circumstances,
directors and officers may not receive shares of common stock in settlement of deferred
stock units earlier than one year following their resignation from the board or
termination of their employment, respectively.

During
the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, approximately 8,000, 11,000 and 10,000
deferred stock units valued at $0.7 million, $0.7 million and $0.5 million were issued,
respectively.

During
the year ended December 31, 2006, approximately 2,000 shares of common stock were issued
to settle deferred stock units.

NOTE 5 CASH EQUIVALENTS
AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS

Cash
equivalents are highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of less than
three months.

We
account for investments under SFAS No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in
Debt and Equity Securities” as available-for-sale. Investments are recorded at
amortized cost and adjusted to fair market value through other comprehensive income.
Short-term investments, which had cost bases of $35.0 million and $65.7 million at
December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, are investment securities with original
maturities of greater than three months, but less than one year, from the balance sheet
date and consist of the following

short-term investments, which included $35.0 million and $44.6 million, respectively, of
auction rate municipal securities classified as available-for-sale securities. Our
investments in these securities are recorded at cost, which approximates fair market value
due to their variable interest rates, which typically reset every 28 to 35 days, and,
despite the long-term nature of their stated contractual maturities, we have the ability
to quickly liquidate these securities. As a result, we had no cumulative gross unrealized
holding gains (losses) or gross realized gains (losses) from these short-term investments.
All income generated from these short-term investments was recorded as interest income in
the consolidated statements of income.

During
the year ended December 31, 2006, we acquired $13.3 million of amortizable intangible
assets related to business acquisitions and $0.7 million related to the acquisition of the
additional ownership interest in a joint venture in China. During the year ended December
31, 2006, we also recognized incremental amortizable intangible assets of $1.9 million in
connection with the finalization of purchase price allocations for certain 2005 business
acquisitions and we acquired licenses for $0.4 million. The weighted average amortization
periods for patents, other product rights, customer-related intangible assets, and other
intangible assets acquired during 2006 in connection with business acquisitions were 8
years, 3 years, 12 years and 7 years, respectively. During the year ended December 31,
2005, we acquired $5.3 million of amortizable intangible assets related to business
acquisitions. The weighted average amortization periods for product rights other than
patents, customer-related intangible assets, and other intangible assets acquired during
2005 in connection with business acquisitions were 5 years, 15 years and 4 years,
respectively. See Notes 3 and 11 for additional information. The remaining change in the
cost of intangible assets other than goodwill during the years ended December 31, 2006 and
2005 resulted primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

December 31, 2006, we also recognized purchase accounting adjustments related to goodwill.
See Note 3 for additional information. The remaining changes in the cost of goodwill
during the year ended December 31, 2006 resulted primarily from changes in foreign

NOTE 7 NOTES PAYABLE

In
connection with the February 2004 acquisition of a veterinary reference laboratory, we
issued a note payable to the sellers for $1.0 million. The note bears interest at the
prime rate. The balance outstanding at December 31, 2005 was $0.6 million. We paid $0.4
million in February 2005 and the remaining $0.5 million, plus accrued interest, in March
2006.

In
May 2006, we acquired our Westbrook, Maine facility. We paid cash of $11.5 million and
assumed a mortgage that had a face value of $6.5 million and a stated interest rate of
9.875%. We recorded the mortgage at a fair market value of $7.5 million, based on an
effective market interest rate of 6.05%. The mortgage is payable in equal monthly
installments of approximately $0.1 million through May 1, 2015. Annual mortgage principal
payments as of December 31, 2006, based on the fair market value of the mortgage at the
assumption date, are as follows

In

bank in the principal amount of $125.0 million that matures on June 30, 2007. The credit
facility may be used for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of our common
stock and business acquisitions. The applicable interest rates generally range from 0.375%
to 0.875% above the London interbank rate or the Canadian Dollar-denominated bankers’
acceptance rate, dependent on our leverage ratio. Under the credit facility, we pay
quarterly commitment fees of 0.08% to 0.20%, dependent on our leverage ratio, on any
unused commitment. The credit facility contains financial and other affirmative and
negative covenants, as well as customary events of default, that would allow any amounts
outstanding under the credit facility to be accelerated, or restrict our ability to borrow
thereunder, in the event of noncompliance. The financial covenant requires our ratio of
debt to earnings before interest and taxes, as defined by the agreement, not to exceed
3-to-1.

NOTE 8 EXIT ACTIVITY

During
the year ended December 31, 2005, we centralized our European production animal
diagnostics manufacturing operations in Bern, Switzerland, the location of the production
animal diagnostics company acquired in December 2004. In connection with this
centralization, we ceased operations in Sweden. We recognized expenses of $1.0 million
associated with this exit activity during the year ended December 31, 2005. The total
costs included a cumulative translation adjustment write-off of $0.5 million, one-time
employee termination benefits of $0.2 million, and building lease termination costs of
$0.1 million, which are included in general and administrative expenses in the
consolidated statement of income. The total costs also included one-time employee
termination benefits of $0.2 million that are included in costs of product revenue. At
December 31, 2005, accrued expenses included building lease termination costs of $0.1
million which were subsequently paid in January 2006. We did not incur significant
expenses associated with this activity during the year ended December 31, 2006.

Our
effective income tax rate was 28.4% for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared with
34.2% for the year ended December 31, 2005. The majority of this rate differential
resulted from the favorable impact of the resolution in 2006 of an IRS income tax audit
for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2004. As a result of completing this audit, we
reduced previously accrued taxes and recognized a tax benefit of 3.7% of income before
tax. Other items that decreased our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31,
2006 included a reduction of previously recorded international deferred tax liabilities as
a result of obtaining certain multi-year tax incentives and the release of a valuation
allowance on international deferred tax assets as a result of a subsidiary demonstrating
consistent sustained profitability. In addition, the effective rate for the year ended
December 31, 2006 was less than the effective rate for the year ended December 31, 2005
due to the incremental tax expense in 2005 on the repatriation of $30.0 million pursuant
to the

American Jobs Creation Act of 2004

. These rate reductions were partly offset
by the nonrecognition, in 2006, of tax benefits on compensation expense for incentive
stock options and employee stock purchase rights that were recorded in accordance with
SFAS No. 123(R) effective January 1, 2006.

Our
effective tax rate was 34.2% for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared with 29.7% for
the year ended December 31, 2004. The majority of this rate differential resulted from the
favorable impact of several rate reducing items occurring in 2004. The 2004 rate was
favorably impacted by the resolution in 2004 of an IRS income tax audit through the year
ended December 31, 2001. As a result of completing this audit, we reduced previously
accrued taxes. Other rate reductions resulted from the release in 2004 of a valuation
allowance on international deferred tax assets as a result of a foreign subsidiary
demonstrating consistent sustained profitability and changes in certain state and
international tax estimates. In addition, 2005 tax expense increased by $1.0 million and
the 2005 effective income tax rate increased by 0.8 percentage points due to incremental
taxes on repatriations of $30.0 million pursuant to the

American Jobs Creation Act of

.

The
components of the net deferred tax asset (liability) included in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets are as follows (

in thousands

):

At
December 31, 2006, we had United States federal domestic net operating loss carryforwards
of approximately $0.1 million available to offset future taxable income. Net operating
loss carryforwards expire at various dates through 2014. The Tax Reform Act of 1986
contains provisions that limit annual availability of the net operating loss carryforwards
due to a more than 50% change in ownership that occurred upon the acquisition of some
companies.

At
December 31, 2006, we had net operating loss carryforwards in foreign and state
jurisdictions of approximately $56.8 million available to offset future taxable income.
Most of these net operating loss carryforwards expire at various dates through 2022 and
the remainder have indefinite lives. We have recorded a valuation allowance for these
assets because realizability is uncertain.

We
consider the operating earnings of non-United States subsidiaries to be indefinitely
invested outside the United States. No provision has been made for United States federal
and state, or international taxes that may result from future remittances of undistributed
earnings of non-United States subsidiaries, the cumulative amount of which is $111.4
million at December 31, 2006.

NOTE 10 EARNINGS PER
SHARE

Basic
earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of
shares of common stock and deferred stock units outstanding during the year. The
computation of diluted earnings per share is similar to the computation of basic earnings
per share, except that the denominator is increased for the assumed exercise of dilutive
options and other potentially dilutive securities using the treasury stock method unless
the effect is anti-dilutive.

The
following is a reconciliation of shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per
share (

in thousands

):

Certain
deferred stock units outstanding are included in shares outstanding for basic and diluted
earnings per share because the associated shares of our common stock are issuable for no
cash consideration, the number of shares of our common stock to be issued is fixed and
issuance is not contingent. See Note 4 for additional information regarding deferred
compensation plans.

Certain
options to acquire shares and restricted stock units have been excluded from the
calculation of shares outstanding for dilutive earnings per share because they were
anti-dilutive. The following table presents information concerning those anti-dilutive
options

Chemistry Analyzers under
an agreement with Ortho that, as of December 31, 2006, required us to purchase a minimum
of $59.0 million of slides through 2010. We purchase our VetAutoread™ Hematology
Analyzers, components and consumables under an agreement under which we are required to
make aggregate minimum purchases of $15.7 million through 2020, in addition to the payment
obligations described in the section below titled “Guarantees.” We also have
commitments under certain other agreements that commit us to aggregate future payments of
$19.7 million. In addition, we have various minimum royalty payments due through 2024 of
$15.1 million.

In
connection with the acquisitions of businesses and intangible assets, we have commitments
outstanding at December 31, 2006 for additional purchase price payments of up to $3.9
million, of which $1.8 million is contingent on the achievement by certain acquired
businesses of specified milestones.

We
previously had a 40% equity interest in a joint venture to market production animal
diagnostic products in China. In April 2006, we paid $0.6 million to acquire an additional
55% equity interest in the joint venture from our partner and we also committed to pay an
additional $0.2 million over two years in consideration for the additional equity. In
addition, the joint venture entered into a contract with the joint venture partner where
the partner will provide promotional and agency services and will receive sales
commissions at rates escalating from 2.5% to 8.5% annually based on sales volume. In
connection with this step acquisition, we recognized $0.7 million of intangible assets in
the Production Animal Segment.

Contingencies

We
are subject to claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, including with
respect to actual and threatened litigation and other matters. We accrue contingent
liabilities when it is probable that future expenditures will be made and such
expenditures can reasonably be estimated. However, our actual losses with respect to these
contingencies could exceed our accruals.

In
October 2004, we resolved a contingent liability for a third-party claim related to
alleged patent infringement. As a result, we recognized reductions of previously accrued
expenses during 2004 of $1.8 million in cost of product revenue.

Under
our workers’ compensation insurance policy for U.S. employees for the years ended
December 31, 2006, 2005, 2004 and 2003, we retain the first $250,000 in claim liability
per incident and $3.1 million, $2.8 million, $3.0 million and $1.4 million, respectively,
in aggregate claim liability. We entered into a similar workers’ compensation
insurance policy effective January 1, 2007. The insurance company administers and pays
these claims, and we reimburse the insurance company for our portion of these claims. The
insurance company provides insurance for claims above the individual occurrence and
aggregate limits. We estimate claim liability based on claims incurred and the estimated
ultimate cost to settle the claims. Based on this analysis, we have recognized cumulative
expenses of $1.3 million, $0.6 million, $0.7 million and $0.8 million for claims incurred
during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In connection
with these policies, we have outstanding letters of credit totaling $2.1 million to the
insurance companies as security for these claims.

F-27

Under
our employee health care insurance policy, we retain claims liability risk up to $125,000
per incident and an aggregate claim limit based on the number of employees enrolled in the
plan per month. We estimate our liability for the uninsured portion of employee health
care obligations based on individual and aggregate coverage, our claims experience, the
number of employees enrolled in the program, and the average time from when a claim is
incurred to the time it is reported. Should actual employee health care claims liability
exceed estimates, we are liable for up to an additional $1.5 million for potential
uninsured obligations at December 31, 2006. We have insurance coverage of $1.0 million for
claims above the aggregate limit. Should employee health insurance claims exceed this
coverage, we would have further obligations for the amount in excess of such coverage.

We
have entered into employment agreements with two of our officers whereby payments may be
required if we terminate their employment without cause other than following a change in
control. The amounts payable are based upon the executives’ salaries at the time of
termination and the cost to us of continuing to provide certain benefits. Had both of such
officers been terminated as of December 31, 2006, we would have had aggregate obligations
for salaries and benefits of approximately $2.0 million under such agreements. We have
entered into employment agreements with each of our officers that require us to make
certain payments in the event the officer’s employment is terminated under certain
circumstances within a certain period following a change in control of our stock. The
amounts payable by us under these agreements is based on the officer’s salary and
bonus history at the time of termination and the cost to us of continuing to provide certain
benefits. Had all of our officers been terminated following a change in control as of
December 31, 2006, we would have had aggregate obligations of approximately $11.5 million
under these agreements. These agreements also provide for the acceleration of the vesting
of all stock options and restricted stock units upon any qualifying termination following
a change in control.

From
time to time, we have received notices alleging that our products infringe third-party
proprietary rights, although we are not aware of any pending litigation with respect to
such claims. Patent litigation frequently is complex and expensive, and the outcome of
patent litigation can be difficult to predict. There can be no assurance that we will
prevail in any infringement proceedings that may be commenced against us. If we lose any
such litigation, we may be stopped from selling certain products and/or we may be required
to pay damages as a result of the litigation.

Guarantees

The
following is a summary of our agreements and obligations that we have determined to be
within the scope of FIN 45, “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements
for Guarantees Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others, an Interpretation
of FASB No. 5, 57 and 107 and a Rescission of FASB Interpretation No. 34” (“FIN
45”).

In
October 2005, our former supplier of VetAutoread™ Hematology Analyzers and
consumables sold this business (including the human hematology testing products division)
and we simultaneously entered into a new supply agreement for these products with the
acquirer of the business. Under this new supply agreement, we received fixed pricing on
certain products through December 31, 2020, among other benefits. In partial consideration
for this new supply agreement, we paid cash of $2.5 million to the acquirer and guaranteed
the acquirer’s note (the “Note”) in the principal amount of $3.5 million
given to our former supplier in partial consideration for the business. The acquirer is
obligated to pay the Note through quarterly principal and interest payments through 2008
and to pay the remaining balance in 2008. The principal balance of the note that we have
guaranteed is $2.6 million at December 31, 2006.We are obligated to make a second payment
of $1.25 million upon the achievement of certain milestones by the acquirer, which we
expect to occur in 2007, and a third payment of $1.25 million twelve months later. Our
obligations to make the second and third payments are subject to the acquirer’s
payment of all amounts under the Note and the release of our guaranty. We recorded the
fair value of the guaranty of $0.5 million and recognized the associated assets as of the
effective date of the agreements.

We
enter into agreements with third parties in the ordinary course of business under which we
are obligated to indemnify such third parties for and against various risks and losses.
The precise terms of such indemnities vary with the nature of the agreement. In many
cases, we limit the maximum amount of our indemnification obligations, but in some cases,
those obligations may be theoretically unlimited. We have not incurred material expenses
in discharging any of these indemnification obligations, and based on our analysis of the
nature of the risks involved, we believe that the fair value of these agreements is
minimal. Accordingly, we have recorded no liabilities for these obligations as of December
31, 2006 and 2005.

F-28

When
acquiring a business, we sometimes assume liability for certain events or occurrences that
took place prior to the date of acquisition. However, we do not believe that we have any
probable pre-acquisition liabilities or guarantees that should be recognized as of
December 31, 2006 and 2005.

NOTE 12 PREFERRED STOCK

Our
Board of Directors is authorized, subject to any limitations prescribed by law, without
further stockholder approval, to issue from time to time up to 500,000 shares of Preferred
Stock, $1.00 par value per share (“Preferred Stock”), in one or more series.
Each such series of Preferred Stock shall have such number of shares, designations,
preferences, voting powers, qualifications and special or relative rights or privileges as
shall be determined by the Board of Directors, which may include, among others, dividend
rights, voting rights, redemption and sinking fund provisions, liquidation preferences,
conversion rights and preemptive rights.

Series A Junior
Participating Preferred Stock

On
December 17, 1996, we designated 100,000 shares of Preferred Stock as Series A Junior
Participating Preferred Stock (“Series A Stock”) in connection with the adoption
of our Shareholder Rights Plan. In general, each share of Series A Stock will: (i) be
entitled to a minimum preferential quarterly dividend of $10 per share and to an aggregate
dividend of 1,000 times the dividend declared per share of Common Stock, (ii) in the event
of liquidation, be entitled to a minimum preferential liquidation payment of $1,000 per
share (plus accrued and unpaid dividends) and to an aggregate payment of 1,000 times the
payment made per share of Common Stock, (iii) have 1,000 votes, voting together with the
Common Stock, (iv) in the event of any merger, consolidation or other transaction in which
Common Stock is exchanged, be entitled to receive 1,000 times the amount received per
share of Common Stock and (v) not be redeemable. These rights are protected by customary
anti-dilution provisions. There are no shares of Series A Stock outstanding.

NOTE 13 PREFERRED STOCK
PURCHASE RIGHTS

On
December 17, 1996, we adopted a Shareholder Rights Plan and declared a dividend of one
preferred stock purchase right for each outstanding share of Common Stock to stockholders
of record at the close of business on December 30, 1996. Those rights expired December 31,
2006. There are no preferred stock purchase rights outstanding.

NOTE 14 TREASURY STOCK

The
board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to 18,000,000 shares of our common
stock in the open market or in negotiated transactions. We believe that the repurchase of
our common stock is a favorable investment and we also repurchase to offset the dilutive
effect of our employee share-based compensation programs. Repurchases of our common stock
may vary depending upon the level of other investing activities and the share price.

From
the inception of the program in August 1999 to December 31, 2006, we repurchased
15,285,000 shares for $571.8 million. From the inception of the program to December 31,
2006, we also received approximately 171,000 shares of stock with a market value of $6.0
million that were surrendered by employees in payment for the minimum required withholding
taxes due on the exercise of stock options, vesting of restricted stock units and
settlement of deferred stock units, and in payment for the exercise price of stock
options.

NOTE 15 IDEXX RETIREMENT
AND INCENTIVE SAVINGS PLAN

We
have established the IDEXX Retirement and Incentive Savings Plan (the “401(k)
Plan”). Employees eligible to participate in the 401(k) Plan may contribute specified
percentages of their salaries, a portion of which will be matched by us. We matched $2.7
million, $2.4 million, and $2.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and
2004, respectively. In addition, we may make contributions to the 401(k) Plan at the
discretion of the Board of Directors. There were no discretionary contributions in 2006,
2005 and 2004.

NOTE 16 SEGMENT REPORTING

We
disclose information regarding our segments in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No.
131, “Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information”
(“SFAS No. 131”). SFAS No. 131 requires disclosures about operating segments in
annual financial statements and requires selected information about operating segments in
interim financial statements. It also requires related disclosures about products and
services and geographic areas. Operating segments are defined as components of an
enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated
regularly by the chief operating decision-maker, or decision-making group, in deciding how
to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Our chief operating decision-maker is
the Chief Executive Officer.

We
are organized into business units by market and customer group. Our reportable segments
include: products and services for the veterinary market, which we refer to as our
Companion Animal Group (“CAG”), water quality products (“Water”), and
products for production animal health, which we refer to as the Production Animal Segment
(“PAS”). CAG develops, designs, manufactures, and distributes products and
performs services for veterinarians. Water develops, designs, manufactures and distributes
products to detect contaminants in water. PAS develops, designs, manufactures and
distributes products to detect disease in production animals. Our operating segment that
comprises products for dairy quality does not meet the quantitative thresholds described
in SFAS 131 and is presented in an “Other” category. Unallocated items that are
not allocated to our operating segments are comprised primarily of share-based
compensation costs (effective January 1, 2006), corporate research and development
expenses, interest income and expense, and income taxes. The segment information for the
years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 has been restated to conform to our presentation of
reportable segments for the year ended December 31, 2006. Previously, PAS and Dairy were
aggregated into a single reportable segment, which we referred to as the Food Diagnostics
Group.

F-30

The
accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in the
summary of significant accounting policies except that most interest income and expenses
and income taxes are not allocated to individual operating segments. Below is our segment
information (

Expenditures
for long-lived assets exclude expenditures for intangible assets.                See Note
3 for information regarding acquisitions of goodwill and other                intangible
assets in connection with business acquisitions. Expenditures for
               long-lived assets for the year ended December 31, 2006 include $2.5
million for                property acquired in connection with CAG business acquisitions
and $19.0 million                related to the purchase of our Westbrook, Maine
headquarters facility, of which                $7.5 million was financed through the
assumption of a mortgage. Expenditures for                long-lived assets for the year
ended December 31, 2005 include $0.6 million for                property acquired in
connection with CAG business acquisitions. Expenditures for                long-lived
assets for the year ended December 31, 2004 include $2.1 million and                $0.7
million for property acquired in connection with CAG and PAS business
               acquisitions, respectively.

Revenue
by principal geographic area, based on customers’ domiciles, was as follows (

in
thousands

):

Our
largest customers are our U.S. distributors of our products in the CAG segment. In 2005,
two of our CAG distributors merged and, as a result, the combined company, Butler Animal
Health Supply, LLC, accounted for 9% and 10% of our 2006 and 2005 revenue, respectively,
and 5% and 4% of our net accounts receivable at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

F-32

Net
long-lived assets by principal geographic areas include net property and equipment,
goodwill and other intangible assets. These long-lived assets are subject to geographic
risks because they are generally difficult to move and effectively utilize in another
geographic area in a reasonable time period and because they are relatively illiquid. Net
long-lived assets by principal geographic areas were as follows (
