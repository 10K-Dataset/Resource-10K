In the fourth quarter of 2008, we sold our Acarexx

®

and SURPASS

®

veterinary pharmaceutical products and a product under development. Upon completion of this
transaction we restructured the remaining pharmaceutical business and realigned the remaining
pharmaceutical product lines to other business units. We have also
retained certain drug delivery
technologies that we will look to utilize in development agreements with pharmaceutical companies.
See note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2008 included
in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

We are a Delaware corporation and were incorporated in 1983. Our principal executive offices
are located at One IDEXX Drive, Westbrook, Maine 04092, our telephone number is 207-556-0300, and
our Internet address is www.idexx.com. References herein to “we,” “us,” the “Company,” or “IDEXX”
include our wholly-owned subsidiaries unless the context otherwise requires. References to our Web
site are inactive textual references only and the content of our Web site should not be deemed
incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K for any purpose.



We make available free of charge on our Web site our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly
Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports as soon as
reasonably practicable after we file such information with, or furnish it to, the Securities and
Exchange Commission (“SEC”). In addition, copies of our reports filed electronically with the SEC

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS BY SEGMENT

During 2008, we operated primarily through three business segments: products and services for
the veterinary market, which we refer to as the Companion Animal Group (“CAG”), water quality
products (“Water”) and products for production animal health, which we refer to as the Production
Animal Segment (“PAS”). We also operate two smaller segments that comprise products for dairy
quality, which we refer to as Dairy, and products for the human medical diagnostic market, which we
refer to as OPTI Medical. Financial information about the Dairy and OPTI Medical operating segments
and other activities are combined and presented in an “Other” category because they do not meet the
quantitative or qualitative thresholds for reportable segments. In addition, we maintain active
research and development programs, some of which may materialize into the development and
introduction of new technology, products or services that do not align with one of our existing
business or service categories. In such situations, the related financial impacts are shown in the
“Other” category. In connection with the restructuring of our pharmaceutical business at the end of
2008, we realigned two of our remaining product lines to the Rapid Assay business, which is part of
our CAG segment, and realigned the remainder of the business, which comprised one product line and
two out-licensing arrangements, to the Other category. Segment information presented for the years
ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 has been restated to conform to our presentation of reportable
segments for the year ended December 31, 2008. See Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements
for the year ended December 31, 2008 included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for financial
information about our segments, including geographic information, and about our product and service
categories.

COMPANION ANIMAL GROUP

Instruments and Consumables

We currently market an integrated suite of in-house laboratory analyzers for use in veterinary
practices that we refer to as the IDEXX VetLab

®

suite of analyzers. The IDEXX
VetLab

®

suite includes several instrument systems, as well as associated proprietary
consumable products that are described below:

Blood and Urine Chemistry

.

We sell two analyzers, the Catalyst Dx™ Chemistry Analyzer and the VetTest

®

Chemistry Analyzer, that are used by veterinarians to measure levels of certain enzymes and other
substances in blood or urine for assistance in diagnosing physiologic conditions. Both instruments
use consumables manufactured for IDEXX by Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, Inc. (“Ortho”), a subsidiary
of Johnson & Johnson, based on Ortho’s dry slide technology (“dry chemistry slides,”
“VetTest

®

slides,” “Catalyst Dx™ slides” or “slides”). In addition to dry chemistry
slides, the Catalyst Dx™ Analyzer also uses electrolyte consumables manufactured by IDEXX at OPTI
Medical. Blood tests commonly run on these analyzers include glucose, alkaline phosphatase, ALT
(alanine aminotransferase), creatinine, BUN (blood urea nitrogen), and total protein. Tests are
sold individually and in prepackaged panels. Both analyzers also run a urine test called urine
protein: creatinine ratio, which assists in the detection of early renal disease.

The Catalyst Dx™ Analyzer is our latest generation analyzer, which was launched in the first
quarter of 2008. The Catalyst Dx™ analyzer provides significantly improved throughput, ease of use
and menu, including the ability to run electrolytes, relative to the VetTest

®

analyzer.
Key ease-of-use features include the ability to run whole blood by way of an on-board centrifuge,
the ability to run pre-packaged clips in addition to single chemistry slides and an automated
metering system. The Catalyst Dx™ analyzer also has the ability to run automated dilutions, which
is an ease-of-use feature both for certain blood chemistries and the test for urine protein:
creatinine ratio. The Catalyst Dx™ analyzer allows a veterinarian to run multiple sample types
simultaneously; to run different sample types including whole blood, plasma, serum and urine;
includes the ability to perform 26 different chemistry and
electrolyte parameter tests; and to automatically calculate other parameters and ratios
important to blood chemistry analysis.



Our VetLyte

®

Electrolyte Analyzer measures three electrolytes—sodium, potassium and
chloride—to aid in evaluating acid-base and electrolyte balances and assessing plasma hydration.

Our VetStat

®

Electrolyte and Blood Gas Analyzer measures electrolytes, blood gases,
glucose and ionized calcium, and calculates other parameters, such as base excess and anion gap.
These measurements aid veterinarians in diagnosing various disease states and evaluating fluid
therapy choices and measuring respiratory function. The VetStat

®

analyzer runs
single-use disposable cassettes that contain various configurations of analytes.

Sales of chemistry reagents for use in our installed base of chemistry analyzers provide the
majority of consumables volumes and revenues generated from our installed base of IDEXX
VetLab

®

equipment.

Hematology

. We sell three hematology analyzers: the LaserCyte

®

Hematology
Analyzer, which uses laser-flow cytometry technology to analyze cellular components of blood,
including red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets (also called a complete blood count
(“CBC”)); the Coag Dx™ Analyzer, which permits the detection and diagnosis of blood clotting
disorders; and the IDEXX VetAutoread™ Hematology Analyzer, which also provides a CBC.

Quantitative Immunoassay Testing

. In the first quarter of 2008, we launched the
SNAPshot Dx

®

Analyzer, which allows the veterinarian to obtain quantitative measurements
of total thyroxine (“T


”), cortisol and bile acids, which assist in the evaluation of
thyroid, adrenal and liver function. The SNAPshot Dx

®

Analyzer is designed to
significantly improve ease of use, throughput and menu relative to the previous generation IDEXX
SNAP

®

Reader. In 2009, the SNAPshot Dx

®

Analyzer will also read, interpret
and record the results of certain IDEXX rapid assay SNAP

®

tests, including our feline
SNAP

®

FIV/FeLV Combo Test and canine
SNAP

®

cPL™.

Urinalysis

. The IDEXX VetLab

®

UA™ Analyzer provides rapid,
semi-quantitative urinalysis and is validated specifically for veterinary use.

IDEXX VetLab

®

Station

. The IDEXX VetLab

®

Station (“IVLS”)
connects and integrates the information from all the IDEXX VetLab

®

equipment and thus
provides laboratory information management system capability. We sell the IVLS as an integral
component of the Catalyst Dx™ and LaserCyte

®

systems and also as a standalone hardware
platform. The IVLS includes a user interface to input patient information, connect with a practice
management information system, and to send information to run the individual analyzers. IVLS also
generates one integrated patient report; stores, retrieves and analyzes historical patient
diagnostics data, including SNAP

®

test results; and sends and receives information from
practice information management systems, including IDEXX Cornerstone

®

and Better
Choice

®

systems, as well as a wide variety of third-party systems.

Rapid Assays

We provide a broad range of single-use, handheld test kits under the SNAP

®

name
that allow quick, accurate and convenient test results for a variety of companion animal diseases
and health conditions. These products enable veterinarians to provide improved service to animal
owners by delivering test results and a diagnosis at the time of the patient visit, allowing the
veterinarian to initiate therapy or prevention, if required. These kits work without the use of
instrumentation.

Our principal single-use tests include canine combination parasite tests called
SNAP

®

3Dx

®

, which tests simultaneously for Lyme disease,

Ehrlichia canis

and
heartworm, and SNAP

®

4Dx

®

, which additionally tests for

Anaplasma
phagocytophilum

; a canine heartworm-only test; canine tests for parvovirus and pancreatitis; feline
combination tests called the
SNAP

®

FIV Antibody/FeLV Antigen Combo Test, which enables
veterinarians to test simultaneously for feline immunodeficiency virus (“FIV”) (which is similar to
the human AIDS virus) and feline leukemia virus (“FeLV”), and SNAP

®

Feline Triple, which
additionally tests for heartworm; a feline test for FeLV only; and canine and feline tests for

Giardia

, a parasitic disease. Sales of canine parasite tests, including the heartworm only test,
are greater in the first half of our fiscal year due to seasonality of disease testing in the
veterinary practice. We maintain certain patents concerning diagnostic products for FIV that expire
beginning in June 2009. See “Part I, Patents and Licenses.”



In addition to our single-use tests, we sell a line of microwell-based test kits, under the
PetChek

®

name, that are used by larger clinics and laboratories to test multiple
samples. PetChek

®

tests offer accuracy, ease of use and provides cost advantages to
high-volume customers. We currently sell PetChek

®

tests for canine heartworm disease,
FIV, and FeLV.

Veterinary Reference Laboratory and Consulting Services

We offer commercial veterinary reference laboratory and consulting services to veterinarians
in the U.S., Canada, Europe, Australia, Japan, and South Africa. Veterinarians use our services by
submitting samples by courier or overnight delivery to one of our facilities. Our laboratories
offer a large selection of tests and diagnostic panels to detect a number of disease states and
other conditions in companion and production animals. This menu of tests includes a number of
specialized and proprietary tests that we have developed that allow practitioners to diagnose
increasingly relevant diseases in dogs and cats, including heart disease, pancreatitis and certain
infectious diseases.

Additionally, we provide specialized veterinary consultation, telemedicine and advisory
services, including cardiology, radiology, internal medicine and ultrasound consulting. These
services permit veterinarians to obtain readings and interpretations of test results transmitted by
telephone and over the Internet from the veterinarians’ offices.

Practice Information Systems and Digital Radiography

Practice Information Systems and Services

. We develop, market and sell practice
information systems, including hardware and software, that run key functions of veterinary clinics,
including patient electronic health records management, scheduling (including boarding and
grooming), billing, and inventory management. Our principal system is the Cornerstone

®

system. We also support several legacy systems installed with our customers, including IDEXX Better
Choice

®

, IDEXX VPM™ and IDEXX VetLINK

®

. Additionally, we provide software and
hardware support to our practice information system customers, and related supplies and services to
veterinary practice information system users in general, and we derive a significant portion of our
revenues for this product line from ongoing service contracts.

Digital Radiography Systems and Services

. Our digital radiography systems capture
radiograph images in digital form, replacing traditional x-ray film. Use of digital radiography
systems eliminates the need for the film and processor, hazardous chemicals and darkroom required
for the production of film images, and provides for image manipulation and enhancement through
contrast management. We market and sell three digital radiography systems, the IDEXX-DR™ 1417 and
the IDEXX-CR™ 1417 systems for use in the small animal (e.g., dog and cat) veterinary hospital, and
the IDEXX EquiView

®

DR system for use as a portable unit in ambulatory veterinary
practices, such as equine practices. Our digital radiography systems use IDEXX-PACS™ and IDEXX
EquiView PACS™ picture archiving and communication system (“PACS”) software for the viewing,
manipulation, management, storage and retrieval of the digital images generated by the digital
capture plate. The PACS software also permits images from our digital radiography systems to be
integrated into patients’ medical records in the Cornerstone

®

system, as well as
transferred to other practice information management systems.

WATER

We offer a range of products used in the detection of various microbiological analytes in
water.

Our Colilert

®

, Colilert

®

-18 and Colisure

®

tests
simultaneously detect total coliforms and

E. coli

in water. These organisms are broadly used as
indicators of microbial contamination in water. These products utilize indicator-nutrients that
produce a change in color or fluorescence when metabolized by target microbes in the sample. Our
water tests are used by government laboratories, water utilities and private certified laboratories
to test drinking water in compliance with regulatory standards, including U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (“EPA”) standards. The tests also are used in evaluating water used in production
processes (for example, in beverage and pharmaceutical applications) and in evaluating bottled
water, recreational water, waste water and water from private wells.



Our Enterolert™ product detects enterococci in drinking and recreational waters. Our
Quanti-Tray

®

products, when used in conjunction with our Colilert

®

,
Colilert

®

-18, Colisure

®

or Enterolert™ products, provide
users quantitative measurements of microbial contamination, rather than a presence/absence
indication. The Colilert

®

, Colilert

®

-18, Colisure

®

and
Quanti-Tray

®

products have been approved by the EPA and by regulatory agencies in
certain other countries.

Our Filta-Max

®

and Filta-Max

xpress

®

products are used in the
detection of

Cryptosporidium

in water.

Cryptosporidium

is a parasite that can cause potentially
fatal gastrointestinal illness if ingested. Previously, testing of water supplies for

Cryptosporidium

was mandated by regulation only in England and Wales. Effective January 1, 2009,
testing of water supplies for

Cryptosporidium

is no longer required by regulation in England or
Wales. While our customers in these countries may voluntarily continue to test for

Cryptosporidium

after that date, we expect that beginning in 2009 we will lose sales of Filta-Max

®

products in England and Wales to customers who have tested solely based on regulatory requirements.
Our sales of Filta-Max

®

products in England and Wales were $2.8 million for the year
ended December 31, 2008.

In September 2007, we commenced distribution of certain water testing kits manufactured by
Invitrogen Corporation (“Invitrogen”). The Invitrogen kits complement our

Cryptosporidium

and

Giardia

testing products.

PRODUCTION ANIMAL SEGMENT

We sell diagnostic tests and related instrumentation that are used to detect a wide range of
diseases and to monitor health status in production animals. Our production animal products are
purchased primarily by government laboratories and cattle, swine and poultry producers. Our largest
product is a post-mortem test for bovine spongiform encephalopathy (“BSE” or “mad cow disease”).
The European Commission recently approved a proposal to revise the monitoring regime for BSE in
cattle, which increased the age at which healthy cattle to be slaughtered are required to be tested
for BSE from 30 months to 48 months. It has been estimated that revisions will reduce the
population of cattle tested by approximately 30%. The revision became effective January 1, 2009 and
as a result we believe that we will lose a portion of our sales of our post-mortem test for BSE.

OTHER

Dairy

Our principal product for use in testing for antibiotic residue in milk is the
SNAP

®

Beta-Lactam test. Our primary customers are dairy producers and processors
worldwide who use our tests for quality assurance of raw milk.

OPTI Medical Systems

We sell OPTI

®

point-of-care analyzers and related consumables for use in human
medical hospitals and clinics to measure electrolytes, blood gases, acid-base balance, glucose and
ionized calcium, and to calculate other parameters such as base excess and anion gap. These
analyzers are used primarily in emergency rooms, operating rooms, cardiac monitoring areas and any
locations where time-critical diagnostic testing is performed within the hospital setting. The
OPTI

®

CCA and OPTI

®

Touch Electrolyte and Blood Gas Analyzers run single-use
disposable cassettes that contain various configurations of analytes; the OPTI

®

R
Analyzer runs reusable cassettes in various analyte configurations; and the OPTI

®

LION
Stat Electrolyte Analyzer runs single-use electrolyte cassettes.

Other

We maintain active research and development programs, some of which may materialize into the
development and introduction of new technology, products or services that do not align with one of
our existing business or service categories. In such situations, the related financial impacts are
shown in the Other category. In connection with the restructuring of our pharmaceutical business at
the end of 2008, we realigned one product line and two out-licensing arrangements from the
pharmaceutical business to the Other category. The financial impacts of the product line and
out-licensing arrangements have been shown in the Other segment for 2008. The segment information
for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2007 has been restated to conform to our presentation of
reportable segments for the year ended December 31, 2008.



MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION

We market, sell and service our products worldwide through our marketing, sales and technical
service groups, as well as through independent distributors and other resellers. We maintain sales
offices outside the U.S. in Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the
Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland, Taiwan and the United Kingdom. Sales and marketing expense was
$170.0 million, $151.9 million and $115.9 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, or 16.6% of
sales in 2008, 16.5% of sales in 2007, and 15.7% of sales in 2006.

Generally, we select the appropriate distribution channel for our products based on the type
of product, technical service requirements, number and concentration of customers, regulatory
requirements and other factors. We market our companion animal diagnostic products to veterinarians
both directly and through independent veterinary distributors in the U.S., with most instruments
sold directly by IDEXX sales personnel, and rapid assay test kits and instrument consumables
supplied primarily by the distribution channel. Outside the U.S., we sell our companion animal
diagnostic products through our direct sales force and, in certain countries, through distributors
and other resellers. We sell our reference laboratory services worldwide through our direct sales
force. We market our software and digital radiography products through our direct sales force
primarily in the U.S. We market our water and food diagnostics products primarily through our
direct sales force in the U.S. and Canada. Outside the U.S. and Canada, we market these products
through selected independent distributors and, in certain countries, through our direct sales
force. We sell our OPTI

®

electrolyte and blood gas analyzers both directly and through
independent human medical product distributors in the U.S. and sell most of the related consumables
through the distribution channel. Outside the U.S., we sell our OPTI

®

products primarily
through distributors and other resellers.

Our largest customers are our U.S. distributors of our products in the CAG segment. One of our
CAG distributors, Butler Animal Health Supply, LLC, accounted for 8% of our 2008 and 2007 revenue,
9% of our 2006 revenue, and 5% of our net accounts receivable at December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

Our business includes the development and introduction of new products and services and may
involve entry into new business areas. We maintain active research and development programs in each
of our business areas. Our research and development expenses, which consist of salaries, employee
benefits, materials and consulting costs, were $70.7 million, $67.3 million and $53.6 million, or
6.9% of sales in 2008 and 7.3% of sales in 2007 and 2006.

PATENTS AND LICENSES

We actively seek to obtain patent protection in the U.S. and other countries for inventions
covering our products and technologies. We also license patents and technologies from third
parties.

Important patents and licenses include:

•

An exclusive license from the Regents of the University of California to patents
concerning diagnostic products for FIV that expire in June 2009; and other patents
covering various reagents, kits and/or immunoassays for detecting FIV antibodies that
expire beginning in 2014;

•

Exclusive licenses from Tulane University and the University of Texas to patents and
patent applications relating to the detection of Lyme disease that expire beginning in
2019;

•

A patent concerning the Colilert

®

-18 product that expires in 2014;

•

A patent concerning the Quanti-Tray

®

product that expires in 2014;

•

A patent that relates to certain methods and kits for simultaneously detecting
antigens and antibodies, which covers certain of our SNAP

®

products,
including our canine and feline combination tests, that expires in 2014;

•

An exclusive license from Boehringer Ingelheim to certain patents covering reagents
and methods for detecting the PRRS virus that expire beginning in 2012; and

•

An exclusive license from Cornell University to patents covering methods for
detecting BVDV that expire beginning in 2017.



To the extent some of our products may now, or in the future, embody technologies protected by
patents, copyrights or trade secrets of others, we may be required to obtain licenses to such
technologies in order to continue to sell our products. These licenses may not be available on
commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our failure to obtain any such licenses may delay or
prevent the sale of certain new or existing products. See “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.”

PRODUCTION AND SUPPLY

Many of the instruments that we sell are manufactured by third parties and we rely on third
parties, who are in some cases sole source suppliers, to supply us with certain important
components, raw materials and consumables used in or with our products.

Significant products supplied by third parties include VetTest

®

Chemistry Analyzers
and consumables, VetAutoread™ Hematology Analyzers and consumables, VetLyte

®

Electrolyte
Analyzers and consumables, Coag Dx™ Analyzers and consumables,
and Catalyst Dx™ consumables (other than electrolyte consumables).

VetTest

®

slides and Catalyst Dx™ chemistry slides are supplied by Ortho
under supply agreements that expire in 2025 (the “Ortho Agreements”). We are required to purchase
all of our requirements for our current menu of VetTest

®

slides and Catalyst
Dx

™

chemistry slides from Ortho to the extent Ortho is able to supply those
requirements. In addition, we have committed to minimum annual purchase volumes of certain
VetTest

®

slides and Catalyst Dx™ chemistry slides through 2010.

Other analyzers and consumables are purchased under supply agreements with terms ranging from
1 year to 14 years, which in some cases may be extended at our option. We have minimum purchase
obligations under some of these agreements, and our failure to satisfy these obligations may result
in loss of some or all of our rights under these agreements.

We purchase certain other products, raw materials and components from a single supplier. These
products include certain digital radiography systems and certain components used in our
SNAP

®

rapid assay devices, production animal testing kits, water testing products, and
blood analyzers, including our LaserCyte

®

Hematology Analyzers.

We have in the past been successful in ensuring an uninterrupted supply of products purchased
from single source suppliers. However, there can be no assurance that uninterrupted supply can be
maintained if these agreements terminate for any reason or our suppliers otherwise are unable to
satisfy our requirements for products. See “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.”

We do not generally maintain significant backlog and believe that our backlog at any
particular date historically has not been indicative of future sales.

COMPETITION

We face intense competition within the markets in which we sell our products and services. We
expect that future competition will become even more intense, and that we will have to compete with
changing technologies, which could affect the marketability of our products and services. Our
competitive position also will depend on our ability to develop proprietary products, integrate our
products, develop and maintain effective sales channels, attract and retain qualified scientific
and other personnel, develop and implement production and marketing plans, obtain or license patent
rights, and obtain adequate capital resources.

We compete with many companies ranging from small businesses focused on animal health to large
human medical diagnostics companies. Our competitors vary in our different markets. Academic
institutions, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations also
conduct research activities and may commercialize products, which could compete with our products,
on their own or through joint ventures. Some of our competitors have substantially greater capital,
manufacturing, marketing, and research and development resources than we do.



Competitive factors in our different business areas are detailed below:

•

Veterinary diagnostic products and food and water testing products

. We
compete primarily on the basis of the ease of use, speed, accuracy, quality of the
information provided, and other performance characteristics of our products and
services (including unique tests), the breadth of our product line and services, the
effectiveness of our sales and distribution channels, the quality of our technical and
customer service, and our pricing relative to the value of our products.

•

Veterinary laboratory and consulting services

. In this market, we compete
primarily on the basis of quality, consistency of service levels, technology, and our
pricing relative to the value of our services. We compete in most geographic locations
in North America with Antech Diagnostics, a unit of VCA Antech, Inc.

•

Practice Information Management and Digital Radiography Systems

. We compete
primarily on the basis of functionality, connectivity to equipment and other systems,
performance characteristics, effectiveness of our customer service, information
handling capabilities, advances in technologies, and our pricing relative to the value
of our products and services.

•

Electrolyte and Blood Gas Analyzers for the human medical diagnostics
point-of-care market

. In this market we compete primarily with large human medical
diagnostics companies such as Radiometer A/S, Siemens Medical Solutions Diagnostics,
Instrumentation Laboratory, Abbott Diagnostics, and Roche Diagnostics. We compete
primarily on the basis of ease of use, menu, convenience, international distribution
and service, instrument reliability, and our pricing relative to the value of our
products.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION

Many of our products are subject to comprehensive regulation by U.S. and foreign regulatory
agencies that relate to, among other things, product approvals, manufacturing, marketing and
promotion, recordkeeping, testing, quality, storage, and product disposal. The following is a
description of the principal regulations affecting our businesses.

Veterinary diagnostic products

. Diagnostic tests for animal health infectious
diseases, including most of our production animal products and our rapid assay products, are
regulated in the U.S. by the Center for Veterinary Biologics within the United States Department of
Agriculture (“USDA”) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (“APHIS”). These products must be
approved by APHIS before they may be sold in the U.S. The APHIS regulatory approval process
involves the submission of product performance data and manufacturing documentation. Following
regulatory approval to market a product, APHIS requires that each lot of product be submitted for
review before release to customers. In addition, APHIS requires special approval to market products
where test results are used in part for government-mandated disease management programs. A number
of foreign governments accept APHIS approval as part of their separate regulatory approvals.
However, compliance with an extensive regulatory process is required in connection with marketing
diagnostic products in Japan, Germany, the Netherlands and many other countries. We also are
required to have a facility license from APHIS to manufacture USDA-licensed products. We have
obtained such a license for our manufacturing facility in Westbrook, Maine and our distribution
center in Memphis, Tennessee.

Our veterinary diagnostic instrument systems are medical devices regulated by the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration (“FDA”) under the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act (the “FDC Act”). While the
sale of these products does not require premarket approval by the FDA and does not subject us to
the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices regulations (“cGMP”), these products must not be
adulterated or misbranded under the FDC Act.

These instrument systems also are subject to the European Medical Device Directives, which
create a single set of medical device regulations for all European Union (“EU”) member countries
and require companies that wish to manufacture and distribute medical devices in EU member
countries to obtain European Conformity (“CE”) marking for their products.



Water testing products

. Our water tests are not subject to formal premarket regulatory
approval. However, before a test can be used as part of a water quality monitoring program in the
U.S. that is required by the EPA, the
test must first be approved by the EPA. The EPA approval process involves submission of
extensive product performance data in accordance with an EPA-approved protocol, evaluation of the
data by the EPA and publication for public comment of any proposed approval in the Federal Register
before final approval. Our Colilert

®

, Colilert

®

-18, Colisure

®

,
Quanti-Tray

®

, Filta-Max

®

and SimPlate

®

for heterotropic plate
counts (“HPC”) products have been approved by the EPA. The sale of water testing products also is
subject to extensive and lengthy regulatory processes in many other countries around the world.

Dairy testing products

. Dairy products used in National Conference on Interstate Milk
Shipments (“NCIMS”) milk-monitoring programs, are regulated by the FDA. Before products requiring
FDA approval can be sold in the U.S., extensive product performance data must be submitted in
accordance with an FDA approved protocol administered by AOAC Research Institute (“AOAC RI”).
Following approval of a product by the FDA, the product must also be approved by NCIMS, an
oversight body that includes state, federal and industry representatives. Our SNAP

®

Beta-Lactam dairy antibiotic residue testing product has been approved by the FDA and NCIMS. While
some foreign countries accept AOAC RI approval as part of their regulatory approval process, many
countries have separate regulatory processes.

Human point-of-care electrolyte and blood gas analyzers

. Our OPTI

®

instrument systems are classified as Class II medical devices, and their design, manufacture and
marketing are regulated by the FDA. Accordingly, we must comply with cGMP in the manufacture of our
OPTI

®

products. The FDA’s Quality System regulations further set forth standards for
product design and manufacturing processes, require the maintenance of certain records, and provide
for inspections of our facilities by the FDA. New OPTI

®

products fall into FDA
classifications that require notification of and review by the FDA before marketing, submitted as a
510(k) application.

OPTI

®

products are also subject to the European Medical Device Directives and
regulations governing the manufacture and marketing of medical devices in other countries in which
they are sold.

Any acquisitions of new products and technologies may subject us to additional areas of
government regulation. These may involve food, drug, medical device and water-quality regulations
of the FDA, the EPA and the USDA, as well as state, local and foreign governments. See “Part I,
Item 1A. Risk Factors.”

EMPLOYEES

At December 31, 2008, we had approximately 4,700 full-time and part-time employees.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Our future operating results involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual events or
results may differ materially from those discussed in this report. Factors that could cause or
contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, the factors discussed below, as
well as those discussed elsewhere in this report.

Our Failure to Successfully Execute Certain Strategies Could Have a Negative Impact on Our
Growth and Profitability

The companion animal health care industry is very competitive and we anticipate increased
competition from both existing competitors and new market entrants. Our ability to maintain or
enhance our historical growth rates and our profitability depends on our successful execution of
many elements of our strategy, which include:

•

Developing, manufacturing and marketing innovative new in-house laboratory analyzers
such as Catalyst Dx™ and SNAPshot Dx

®

that drive sales of IDEXX
VetLab

®

instruments, grow our installed base of instruments, and create a
recurring revenue stream from consumable products;

•

Developing and introducing new proprietary rapid assay and other diagnostic tests
and services that effectively differentiate our products and services from those of our
competitors;

•

Achieving the benefits of economies of scale in our worldwide reference laboratory
business;

•

Increasing the value to our customers of our companion animal products and services
by enhancing the integration of these products;

•

Growing our market share by strengthening our sales and marketing activities both
within the U.S. and in geographies outside of the U.S.; and

•

Developing and implementing new technology and licensing strategies; and
identifying, completing and integrating acquisitions that enhance our existing
businesses or create new business or geographic areas for us.



If we are unsuccessful in implementing some or all of these strategies, our rate of growth or
profitability may be negatively impacted.

A Weak Economy Could Result in Reduced Demand for Our Products and Services

A substantial percentage of our sales are made worldwide to the companion animal veterinary
market. Demand for our companion animal diagnostic products and services is driven in part by the
number of pet visits to veterinary hospitals and practices of veterinarians with respect to
diagnostic testing. Economic weakness in our significant markets could cause pet owners to skip or
defer visits to veterinary hospitals or could affect their willingness to treat certain pet health
conditions, approve certain diagnostic tests, or continue to own a pet. In addition, concerns about
the financial resources of pet owners could cause veterinarians to be less likely to recommend
certain diagnostic tests. A decline in pet visits to the hospital, in the willingness of pet owners
to treat certain health conditions or approve certain tests, in pet ownership, or in the
inclination of veterinarians to recommend certain tests could result in a decrease in diagnostic
testing, and therefore in our sales of diagnostic products and services.

Disruption in Financial and Currency Markets Could Have a Negative Effect on Our Business

As widely reported, financial markets in the U.S., Europe and Asia have been experiencing
extreme disruption in recent months, including, among other things, extreme volatility in security
prices, severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, rating downgrades of certain
investments and declining valuations of others. These economic developments affect businesses such
as ours in a number of ways. The current tightening of credit in financial markets adversely
affects the ability of customers to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations and
could result in a decrease in orders for our products and services. The inability of pet owners to
obtain consumer credit could lead to a decline in pet visits to the veterinarian, which could
result in a decrease in diagnostic testing. Likewise, a decrease in diagnostic testing could
negatively impact the financial condition of the veterinary practices that are our customers, which
may inhibit their ability to pay us amounts owed for products delivered or services provided. In
addition, although current economic conditions have not impacted our ability to access credit
markets and finance our operations, further deterioration in financial markets could adversely
affect our access to capital. We are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of the
current disruption in financial markets and adverse economic conditions in the U.S. and other
countries.

Strengthening of the Rate of Exchange for the U.S. Dollar Has a Negative Effect on Our
Business

Strengthening of the rate of exchange for the U.S. Dollar against the Euro, the British Pound,
the Canadian Dollar, the Japanese Yen and the Australian Dollar adversely affects our results, as
it reduces the dollar value of sales that are made in those currencies and reduces the margins on
products manufactured in the U.S. and exported to international markets. In 2008, approximately 24%
of IDEXX sales were a result of exports from the U.S.

Our Dependence on a Limited Number of Suppliers Could Limit Our Ability to Sell Certain
Products or Reduce Our Profitability

We currently purchase many products and materials from single sources or a limited number of
sources. Some of the products that we purchase from these sources are proprietary, and, therefore,
cannot be readily or easily replaced by alternative sources. These products include our
VetAutoread™ hematology, VetLyte

®

electrolyte, IDEXX VetLab

®

UA™ urinalysis,
VetTest

®

chemistry, and Coag Dx™ blood coagulation analyzers and related consumables and
accessories; image capture plates used in our digital radiography systems; and certain components
and raw materials used in our SNAP

®

rapid assay devices, water testing products and
LaserCyte

®

hematology analyzers. If we are unable to obtain adequate quantities of these
products in the future, we could face cost increases
or reductions, delays or discontinuations in product shipments, which could result in our
inability to supply the market, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations.



Our Biologic Products Are Complex and Difficult to Manufacture, Which Could Negatively
Affect Our Ability to Supply the Market

Many of our rapid assay and production animal diagnostic products are biologics, which are
products that are comprised of materials from living organisms, such as antibodies, cells and sera.
Manufacturing biologic products is highly complex. Unlike products that rely on chemicals for
efficacy (such as most pharmaceuticals), biologics are difficult to characterize due to the
inherent variability of biological input materials. Difficulty in characterizing biological
materials or their interactions creates greater risk in the manufacturing process. There can be no
assurance that we will be able to maintain adequate sources of biological materials or that
biological materials that we maintain in inventory will yield finished products that satisfy
applicable product release criteria. Our inability to produce or obtain necessary biological
materials or to successfully manufacture biologic products that incorporate such materials could
result in our inability to supply the market with these products, which could have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations.

Various Government Regulations Could Limit or Delay Our Ability to Market and Sell Our
Products

In the U.S., the manufacture and sale of our products are regulated by agencies such as the
USDA, the FDA and the EPA. Most diagnostic tests for animal health applications, including our
canine, feline, poultry and livestock tests, must be approved by the USDA prior to sale in the U.S.
Our water testing products must be approved by the EPA before they can be used by customers in the
U.S. as a part of a water quality monitoring program required by the EPA. Our dairy testing
products require approval by the FDA. The manufacture and sale of our OPTI

®

line of
human point-of-care electrolytes and blood gas analyzers are regulated by the FDA and require
approval by the FDA before they may be sold commercially in the U.S. The manufacture and sale of
our products are subject to similar laws in many foreign countries. Any failure to comply with
legal and regulatory requirements relating to the manufacture and sale of our products in the U.S.
or in other countries could result in fines and sanctions against us or removals of our products
from the market, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In
addition, delays in obtaining regulatory approvals for new products or product upgrades could have
a negative impact on our growth and profitability.

Our Success Is Heavily Dependent Upon Our Proprietary Technologies

We rely on a combination of patent, trade secret, trademark and copyright laws to protect our
proprietary rights. If we do not have adequate protection of our proprietary rights, our business
may be affected by competitors who utilize substantially equivalent technologies that compete with
us.

We cannot ensure that we will obtain issued patents, that any patents issued or licensed to us
will remain valid, or that any patents owned or licensed by us will provide protection against
competitors with similar technologies. Even if our patents cover products sold by our competitors,
the time and expense of litigating to enforce our patent rights could be substantial, and could
have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, expiration of patent
rights could result in substantial new competition in the markets for products previously covered
by those patent rights. In this regard, we expect that revenues and profit margins associated with
sales of our SNAP

®

FIV/FeLV tests are likely to decline following the expiration in June
2009 of a U.S. patent that we exclusively license that broadly covers products that diagnose feline
immunodeficiency virus.

In the past, we have received notices claiming that our products infringe third-party patents
and we may receive such notices in the future. Patent litigation is complex and expensive, and the
outcome of patent litigation can be difficult to predict. We cannot ensure that we will win a
patent litigation case or negotiate an acceptable resolution of such a case. If we lose, we may be
stopped from selling certain products and/or we may be required to pay damages and/or ongoing
royalties as a result of the lawsuit. Any such adverse result could have a material adverse effect
on our results of operations.



Distributor Purchasing Patterns Could Negatively Affect Our Operating Results

We sell many of our products, including substantially all of the rapid assays and instrument
consumables sold in the U.S., through distributors. Distributor purchasing patterns can be
unpredictable and may be influenced by factors unrelated to the end-user demand for our products.
In addition, our agreements with distributors may generally be terminated by the distributors for
any reason on 60 days notice. Because significant product sales are made to a limited number of
distributors, the loss of a distributor or unanticipated changes in the frequency, timing or size
of distributor purchases, could have a negative effect on our results of operations. Our financial
performance, therefore, is subject to an unexpected downturn in product demand and may be
unpredictable.

Distributors of veterinary products have entered into business combinations resulting in fewer
distribution companies. Consolidation within distribution channels would increase our customer
concentration level, which could increase the risks described in the preceding paragraph.

Increased Competition and Technological Advances by Our Competitors Could Negatively Affect
Our Operating Results

We face intense competition within the markets in which we sell our products and services. We
expect that future competition will become even more intense, and that we will have to compete with
changing and improving technologies. Competitors may develop products that are superior to our
products, and as a result, we may lose existing customers and market share. Some of our competitors
and potential competitors, including large diagnostic companies, have substantially greater
financial resources than us, and greater experience in manufacturing, marketing, research and
development and obtaining regulatory approvals than we do.

Changes in Testing Patterns Could Negatively Affect Our Operating Results

The market for our companion and production animal diagnostic tests and our dairy and water
testing products could be negatively impacted by a number of factors. The introduction or broad
market acceptance of vaccines or preventatives for the diseases and conditions for which we sell
diagnostic tests and services could result in a decline in testing. Changes in accepted medical
protocols regarding the diagnosis of certain diseases and conditions could have a similar effect.
Eradication or substantial declines in the prevalence of certain diseases also could lead to a
decline in diagnostic testing for such diseases. Our production animal products business in
particular is subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in disease prevalence. In addition,
changes in government regulations could negatively affect sales of our products that are driven by
compliance testing, such as our production animal, dairy and water products. Declines in testing
for any of the reasons described could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

Effective January 1, 2009, testing of water supplies for

Cryptosporidium

is no longer required
by regulation in England or Wales. While our customers in these countries may voluntarily continue
to test for

Cryptosporidium

after that date, we expect that beginning in 2009 we will lose sales of
Filta-Max

®

products in England and Wales to customers who have tested solely based on
regulatory requirements. Our sales of Filta-Max

®

products in England and Wales were $2.8
million for the year ended December 31, 2008.

Effective January 1, 2009, the age at which healthy cattle to be slaughtered are required to
be tested for BSE in the European Union was increased from 30 months to 48 months, which has been
estimated to reduce the population of cattle tested by approximately 30%. As a result we believe
that we are likely to lose a portion of our sales of our post-mortem test for BSE.

Consolidation of Veterinary Hospitals Could Negatively Affect Our Business

An increasing percentage of veterinary hospitals in the U.S. is owned by corporations that are
in the business of acquiring veterinary hospitals and/or opening new veterinary hospitals
nationally or regionally. Major corporate hospital owners in the U.S. include VCA Antech, Inc.,
National Veterinary Associates, and Banfield, The Pet Hospital, each of which is currently a
customer of IDEXX. A similar trend exists in the U.K. and may in the future also develop in other
countries. Corporate owners of veterinary hospitals could attempt to improve profitability by
leveraging the buying power they derive from their scale to obtain favorable pricing from
suppliers, which could have a negative impact on our results. In addition, certain corporate
owners, most notably VCA Antech,
our primary competitor in the U.S. market for reference laboratory services, also operate
reference laboratories that serve both their hospitals and unaffiliated hospitals. Any hospitals
acquired by these companies are likely to use their laboratory services almost exclusively. In
addition, because these companies compete with us in the laboratory services business, hospitals
acquired by these companies may cease to be customers or potential customers of our other companion
animal products and services, which would cause our sales of these products and services to
decline.



Our Inexperience in the Human Point-of-Care Market Could Inhibit Our Success in this Market

Upon acquiring the Critical Care Division of Osmetech plc in January 2007, we entered the
human point-of-care medical diagnostics market for the first time with the sale of the
OPTI

®

line of electrolyte and blood gas analyzers. The human point-of-care medical
diagnostics market differs in many respects from the veterinary medical market. Significant
differences include the impact of third party reimbursement on diagnostic testing, more extensive
regulation, greater product liability risks, larger competitors, a more segmented customer base,
and more rapid technological innovation. Our inexperience in the human point-of-care medical
diagnostics market could negatively affect our ability to successfully manage the risks and
features of this market that differ from the veterinary medical market. There can be no assurance
that we will be successful in achieving growth and profitability in the human point-of-care medical
diagnostics market comparable to the results we have achieved in the veterinary medical market.

Risks Associated with Doing Business Internationally Could Negatively Affect Our Operating
Results

For the year ended December 31, 2008, 40% of our revenue was attributable to sales of products
and services to customers outside the U.S. Various risks associated with foreign operations may
impact our international sales. Possible risks include fluctuations in the value of foreign
currencies, disruptions in transportation of our products, the differing product and service needs
of foreign customers, difficulties in building and managing foreign operations, import/export
duties and quotas, and unexpected regulatory, economic or political changes in foreign markets.
Prices that we charge to foreign customers may be different than the prices we charge for the same
products in the U.S. due to competitive, market or other factors. As a result, the mix of domestic
and international sales in a particular period could have a material impact on our results for that
period. In addition, many of the products for which our selling price may be denominated in foreign
currencies are manufactured, sourced, or both, in the U.S. and our costs are incurred in U.S.
dollars. We utilize non-speculative forward currency exchange contracts and natural hedges to
mitigate foreign currency exposure. However, an appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the
foreign currencies in which we sell these products would reduce our operating margins.
Additionally, a strengthening U.S. dollar could negatively impact the ability of customers outside
the U.S. to pay for purchases denominated in U.S. dollars.

The Loss of Our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman Could Adversely Affect Our
Business

We rely on the management and leadership of Jonathan W. Ayers, our President, Chief Executive
Officer and Chairman. We do not maintain key man life insurance coverage for Mr. Ayers. The loss of
Mr. Ayers could have a material adverse impact on our business.

We Could Be Subject to Class Action Litigation Due to Stock Price Volatility, which, if it
Occurs, Could Result in Substantial Costs or Large Judgments Against Us

The market for our common stock may experience extreme price and volume fluctuations, which
may be unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance or prospects. In the past,
securities class action litigation has often been brought against companies following periods of
volatility in the market prices of their securities. We may be the target of similar litigation in
the future. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s
attention and resources, which could have a negative effect on our business, operating results and
financial condition.



If Our Quarterly or Annual Results of Operations Fluctuate, This Fluctuation May Cause Our
Stock Price to Decline, Resulting in Losses to You

Our prior operating results have fluctuated due to a number of factors, including seasonality
of certain product lines; changes in our accounting estimates; the impact of acquisitions; timing
of distributor purchases, product launches, operating expenditures, litigation and claim-related
expenditures; changes in competitors’ product offerings; changes in the economy affecting consumer
spending; and other matters. Similarly, our future operating results may vary significantly from
quarter to quarter or year to year due to these and other factors, many of which are beyond our
control. If our operating results or projections of future operating results do not meet the
expectations of market analysts or investors in future periods, our stock price may fall.

Future Operating Results Could Be Negatively Affected By the Resolution of Various Uncertain
Tax Positions and by Potential Changes to Tax Incentives

In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the
ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Significant judgment is required in determining our
worldwide provision for income taxes. We periodically assess our exposures related to our worldwide
provision for income taxes and believe that we have appropriately accrued taxes for contingencies.
Any reduction of these contingent liabilities or additional assessment would increase or decrease
income, respectively, in the period such determination was made. Our income tax filings are
regularly under audit by tax authorities and the final determination of tax audits could be
materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals.
Additionally, we benefit from certain tax incentives offered by various jurisdictions. If we are
unable to meet the requirements of such incentives, our inability to use these benefits could have
a material negative effect on future earnings.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

On June 30, 2006, Cyntegra, Inc. filed suit against us in the U.S. District Court for the
Central District of California alleging that we had violated U.S. federal antitrust laws and
California state unfair trade practices laws. The complaint alleged, among other things, that we
were monopolizing the U.S. market for companion animal diagnostic products. The plaintiff
sought injunctive relief and damages for purported lost sales. On October 26, 2007, the trial court
granted summary judgment in our favor on all of Cyntegra’s claims and dismissed the suit. Cyntegra
appealed this decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Cyntegra filed its
opening brief on appeal on May 30, 2008; we filed our opposition brief on July 2, 2008; and
Cyntegra filed its reply brief on July 16, 2008. We expect the Court of Appeals to schedule a
hearing in mid-2009. Until then, the trial court judgment in our favor remains in place. We will
continue to defend ourselves vigorously, as we believe Cyntegra’s claims are without merit.

From time to time, we are subject to other legal proceedings and claims, which arise in the
ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of these
matters will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition
or cash flows.

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSES OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Description of Segments

. During 2008, we operated primarily through three business
segments: products and services for the veterinary market, which we refer to as the Companion
Animal Group (“CAG”), water quality products (“Water”) and products for production animal health,
which we refer to as the Production Animal Segment (“PAS”). We also operate two smaller segments
that comprise products for dairy quality, which we refer to as Dairy, and products for the human
medical diagnostic market, which we refer to as OPTI Medical. Financial information about the Dairy
and OPTI Medical operating segments and other activities are combined and presented in an “Other”
category because they do not meet the quantitative or qualitative thresholds for reportable
segments. We added the OPTI Medical operating segment in connection with our acquisition of
substantially all of the assets and assumption of certain liabilities of the Critical Care Division
of Osmetech plc in January 2007.



In the fourth quarter of 2008, we sold our Acarexx

®

and SURPASS

®

veterinary pharmaceutical products and a product under development and subsequently restructured
the remaining pharmaceutical business. In connection with this restructuring, we realigned two of
our remaining product lines to the Rapid Assay business, which is part of our CAG segment, and
realigned the remainder of the business, which comprised one product line and two out-licensing
arrangements, to the Other category. In addition, we maintain active research and development
programs, some of which may materialize into the development and introduction of new technology,
products or services that do not align with one of our existing business or service categories. In
such situations, the related financial impacts are shown in the Other category.

The segment information for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 has been restated to
conform to our presentation of reportable segments for the year ended December 31, 2008.
Previously, financial information related to the product lines realigned to Rapid Assay and the
product line and out-licensing arrangement realigned to Other were included in the pharmaceutical
business and reported in the CAG segment. See Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for
the year ended December 31, 2008 included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for financial
information about our segments, including geographic information, and about our product and service
categories.

Items that are not allocated to our operating segments are comprised primarily of corporate
research and development expenses, a portion of share-based compensation expense, interest income
and expense, and income taxes. We allocate most of our share-based compensation expense to the
operating segments. This allocation differs from the actual expense and consequently yields a
difference between the total allocated share-based compensation expense and the actual expense for
the total company. In our segment disclosure of gross profit, operating expenses and operating
income, these amounts are shown under the caption “unallocated amounts.”

Impact of Distribution Channel on Results of Operations

. Because our instrument
consumables and rapid assay products are sold in the U.S. and certain other geographies by
distributors, distributor purchasing dynamics have an impact on our reported sales of these
products. Distributors purchase products from us and sell them to veterinary practices, who are the
end users. Distributor purchasing dynamics may be affected by many factors and may be unrelated to
underlying end-user demand for our products. As a result, fluctuations in distributors’ inventories
may cause reported results in a period not to be representative of underlying end-user demand.
Therefore, we believe it is important to track distributor sales to end users and to distinguish
between the impact of end-user demand and the impact of distributor purchasing dynamics on reported
revenue growth.

Where growth rates are affected by changes in end-user demand, we refer to the impact of
practice-level sales on growth. Where growth rates are affected by distributor purchasing dynamics,
we refer to the impact of changes in distributors’ inventories. If during the comparable period of
the prior year, distributors’ inventories grew by more than those inventories grew in the current
year, then changes in distributors’ inventories have a negative impact on our reported sales growth
in the current period. Conversely, if during the comparable period of the prior year, distributors’
inventories grew by less than those inventories grew in the current year, then changes in
distributors’ inventories have a positive impact on our reported sales growth in the current
period.

The following is a discussion of the strategic and operating factors that we believe have the
most significant effect on the performance of our business.

Companion Animal Group

In the CAG segment, we believe we have developed a strategic advantage over companies with
more narrow product or service offerings. The breadth and complementary nature of our products and
services give us scale in sales and distribution, permit us to offer integrated disease-management
solutions that leverage the advantages of both point-of-care and outside laboratory testing, and
facilitate the flow of medical and business information in the veterinary practice by connecting
practice information software systems with reference laboratory test data, in-clinic test data from
our IDEXX VetLab

®

suite of analyzers, and radiographic data in the IDEXX-PACS™ and IDEXX
EquiView PACS™ software taken by our digital radiography systems.



Instruments and Consumables

. Our strategy in our IDEXX VetLab

®

instrument
business is to provide veterinarians with an integrated set of instruments that, individually and
together, provide superior diagnostic information in the clinic, enabling veterinarians to practice
better medicine and, in doing so, achieve their practice economic objectives, including growth and
profitability. We derive substantial revenues and margins from the sale of consumables that are
used in these instruments. The principal instruments used by veterinarians for in-clinic diagnostic
testing are chemistry and hematology analyzers. In addition we sell instruments used for
endocrinology, blood gas, electrolytes, urinalysis, and blood coagulation testing. Our IDEXX
VetLab

®

Station is an in-clinic laboratory information management system that records
and integrates patient diagnostic information from our analyzers for better practice management.
Additionally, we offer extended maintenance agreements in connection with the sale of our
instruments.

During the early stage of an instrument’s life cycle, we derive relatively greater revenues
from instrument placements, while consumable sales become relatively more significant in later
stages as the installed base of instruments increases and instrument placement revenues begin to
decline. Instrument sales have significantly lower gross margins than sales of consumables, and
therefore the mix of instrument and consumable sales in a particular period will impact our gross
margins in this line of business.

Our Catalyst Dx™ analyzer is our latest generation chemistry analyzer, which was launched in
the first quarter of 2008. In addition, we sell and have an active installed base of approximately
30,000 VetTest

®

Chemistry Analyzers, with substantially all of our revenues from that
product line currently derived from consumables sales. We continue to
place VetTest

®

instruments through sales,
lease, rental and other programs. A substantial portion of 2008
Catalyst Dx™ analyzer placements have been made at veterinary clinics that already own our
VetTest

®

Chemistry Analyzer. As we continue to experience growth in sales of Catalyst
Dx™ analyzers and the related consumables, we expect to see a decline in the sales of
VetTest

®

consumables. Based on projections of future sales volume and the average unit price of
consumables used in the Catalyst Dx™ and VetTest

®

analyzers, we do not expect a future
shift to Catalyst Dx™ consumables to significantly impact gross margin. We do however expect
near-term downward pressure on gross margin percentage due to higher relative instrument placement
revenues as compared to consumable sales with continued penetration of the Catalyst Dx™ analyzer.
Our long-term success in this area of our business is dependent upon new customer acquisition,
customer retention and customer utilization of existing and new assays introduced on these
instruments. To increase utilization, we seek to educate veterinarians about best medical practices
that emphasize the importance of blood and urine chemistry testing for a variety of diagnostic
purposes.

We purchase the chemistry consumables, other than electrolyte slides, used in our Catalyst Dx™
and VetTest

®

chemistry analyzers from Ortho under a supply agreement that continues
through 2025. This supply agreement provides us with a long-term source of slides at costs that
improve annually through 2010, and also improve over the term of the agreement as a result of
increasing volume.

Our principal hematology analyzer is the LaserCyte

®

Hematology Analyzer, and in
addition we sell the VetAutoread™ Hematology Analyzer. A substantial portion of
LaserCyte

®

placements have been made at veterinary clinics that already own our
VetAutoread™. Although we have experienced growth in sales of hematology consumables,
LaserCyte

®

consumable sales have been partly offset by declines in sales of VetAutoread™
consumables. Because the gross margin percentage of LaserCyte

®

consumables exceeds the
gross margin percentage of the VetAutoread™ consumables, gross margin from hematology consumables
is expected to increase with continued penetration of the LaserCyte

®

Hematology
Analyzer.

With all of our instrument lines, we seek to differentiate our products based on breadth of
diagnostic menu, flexibility of menu selection, accuracy, reliability, ease of use, ability to
handle compromised samples, time to result, analytical capability of software, integration with the
IDEXX VetLab

®

Station, education and training, and superior sales and customer service.
Our instruments and consumables typically are sold at a premium price to competitive offerings. Our
success depends, in part, on our ability to differentiate our products in a way that justifies
premium pricing.



Rapid Assay Products

. Our rapid assay business consists primarily of single-use kits
for point-of-care testing and, to a limited degree, microwell-based kits for laboratory testing for
canine and feline diseases and conditions. Our rapid assay strategy is to develop, manufacture,
market and sell proprietary tests that address important medical needs for particular diseases
prevalent in the companion animal population. We seek to differentiate our tests through superior
performance, including by providing our customers with proprietary combination tests that test a
single sample for multiple analytes. Where alternative point-of-care offerings exist, we seek to
differentiate our tests with superior performance. As in our other lines of business, we also seek
to differentiate our products through superior customer service. These products carry price
premiums over competitive products that we believe do not offer equivalent performance and
diagnostic capabilities, and which we believe do not include a similar level of support. We further
augment our product development and customer service efforts with sales and marketing programs that
enhance medical awareness and understanding regarding our target diseases and the importance of
diagnostic testing. We also seek to enhance efficiency and test result capture by providing our
customers the ability to have rapid assay tests read and results recorded into the patient record
by our SNAPshot Dx

®

Analyzer. This functionality is currently available for quantitative
measurements of total thyroxine (“T


”), cortisol and bile acids, which assist in the
evaluation of thyroid, adrenal and liver function, respectively. We are currently developing this functionality
across our canine and feline family of rapid assay products.

Veterinary Reference Laboratory and Consulting Services

. We believe that more than
half of all diagnostic testing by U.S. veterinarians is done at outside reference laboratories such
as our IDEXX Reference Laboratories. In markets outside the U.S., in-clinic testing is less
prevalent and an even greater percentage of diagnostic testing is done in reference laboratories.
We attempt to differentiate our laboratory testing services from those of our competitors primarily
on the basis of quality, customer service, technology employed and specialized test menu. Revenue
growth in this business is achieved both through increased sales at existing laboratories and
through the acquisition of new customers, including through laboratory acquisitions, customer list
acquisitions and opening new laboratories. In 2006, we acquired laboratories in the U.S., South
Africa, and Canada and acquired a veterinary laboratory customer list in the U.S. In 2007, we
acquired laboratories in the U.S. and Canada and acquired veterinary laboratory customer lists in
the U.S., Switzerland, and United Kingdom. In 2008, we acquired a laboratory in Spain and acquired
certain intellectual property and distribution rights associated with a diagnostic test product.
Profitability of this business is largely the result of our ability to achieve efficiencies from
both volume and operational improvements. New laboratories that we open typically will operate at a
loss until testing volumes reach a level that permits profitability. Acquired laboratories
frequently operate less profitably than our existing laboratories and those laboratories may not
achieve profitability comparable to our existing laboratories for several years while we implement
operating improvements and efficiencies. Therefore, in the short term, new and acquired reference
laboratories generally will have a negative effect on the operating margin of the laboratory and
consulting services business.

Practice Information Systems and Digital Radiography

. These businesses consist of
veterinary practice information systems including hardware and software and veterinary-specific
digital radiography systems. Our strategy in the practice information systems business is to
provide superior total software and hardware integrated information solutions, backed by superior
customer support and education, to allow the veterinarian to practice better medicine and achieve
the practice’s business objectives. We differentiate our software systems through enhanced
functionality and ease of use. Our veterinary-specific digital radiography systems allow
veterinarians to capture digital radiographs with ease and without the use of hazardous chemicals.
The digital radiography systems also incorporate IDEXX-PACS™ and IDEXX EquiView PACS™ picture
archiving and communication software developed by IDEXX that allows for image enhancement,
manipulation, storage and retrieval, and integration with the practice information software. Our
strategy in digital radiography is to offer a system that provides superior image quality and
software capability at a competitive price, backed by the same customer support provided for our
other products and services in the Companion Animal Group.

Water

Our strategy in the water testing business is to develop, manufacture, market and sell
proprietary products with superior performance, supported by exceptional customer service. Our
customers are primarily water utilities, government laboratories and private certified laboratories
to whom strong relationships and customer support are very important. International sales of water
testing products represented 48% of total water product sales in 2008, and we expect that future
growth in this business will be significantly dependent on our ability to increase international
sales. Growth also will be dependent on our ability to enhance and broaden our product line. Most
water microbiological testing is driven by regulation, and, in many countries, a test may not
be used for regulatory testing unless it has been approved by the applicable regulatory body. As a
result, we maintain an active regulatory program under which we are seeking regulatory approvals in
a number of countries, primarily in Europe.



Production Animal Segment

We develop, manufacture, market and sell a broad range of tests for various cattle, swine and
poultry diseases and conditions, and have an active research and development and in-licensing
program in this area. Our strategy is to offer proprietary tests with superior performance
characteristics. Disease outbreaks are episodic and unpredictable, and certain diseases that are
prevalent at one time may be substantially contained or eradicated at a later time. In response to
outbreaks, testing initiatives may lead to exceptional demand for certain products in certain
periods. Conversely, successful eradication programs may result in significantly decreased demand
for certain products. The performance of this business, therefore, can fluctuate. In 2008,
approximately 85% of our sales in this business were international. Because of the significant
dependence of this business on international sales, the performance of the business is particularly
subject to the various risks described above that are associated with doing business
internationally. See “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.”

Other

Dairy

. Our strategy in the dairy testing business is to develop, manufacture and sell
antibiotic residue testing products that satisfy applicable regulatory requirements for testing of
milk by processors and producers and provide reliable field performance. The manufacture of these
testing products leverage, almost exclusively, the SNAP

®

platform as well as the
production equipment of our rapid assay business, incorporating customized reagents for antibiotic
detection. In 2008, approximately 77% of our sales in this business were international. To
successfully increase sales of dairy testing products, we believe that we need to increase
penetration in geographies outside the U.S. and in the processor segment of the dairy market,
defend our share of the farm segment of the dairy market, and to develop product line enhancements
and extensions.

OPTI Medical Systems

. Our strategy in the OPTI Medical Systems business for the human
market is to develop, manufacture, and sell electrolyte and blood gas analyzers and related
consumable products for the medical point-of-care diagnostics market worldwide, with a focus on
small- to mid-sized hospitals. We seek to differentiate our products based on ease of use, menu,
convenience, international distribution and service, and instrument reliability. Similar to our
veterinary instruments and consumables strategy, a substantial portion of the revenues from this
product line is derived from the sale of consumables for use on the installed base of electrolyte
and blood gas analyzers. During the early stage of an instrument’s life cycle, relatively greater
revenues are derived from instrument placements, while consumable sales become relatively more
significant in later stages as the installed base of instruments increases and instrument placement
revenues begin to decline. Our long-term success in this area of our business is dependent upon new
customer acquisition, customer retention and increased customer utilization of existing and new
assays introduced on these instruments.

OPTI Medical Systems also supplies our VetStat

®

Electrolyte and Blood Gas Analyzer,
an instrument and consumable system that is a member of the IDEXX VetLab

®

suite for the
veterinary market. In addition, OPTI Medical Systems provides the electrolyte module and dry slide
reagents that make up the electrolyte testing functionality of the Catalyst Dx™ analyzer. Our
strategy in the OPTI Medical Systems business for the veterinary market is to utilize this unit’s
know-how, intellectual property and manufacturing capability to continue to expand the menu and
instrument capability of the VetStat

®

and Catalyst Dx™ platforms for veterinary
applications.

Other

. We have developed certain proprietary technology that we believe may have
application in areas that do not align with one of our existing business or service categories. Our
strategy is to out-license these technologies to partners that are best positioned to complete the
development and commercialization of products utilizing these technologies. To the extent we are
successful in doing so, we may receive one-time or recurring payments based on the achievement of
development or sales milestones. Our ability to succeed in this area of our business depends on our
ability to attract and retain qualified scientific personnel to develop proprietary products or
technology and our ability to identify suitable third parties to complete the commercialization of
these technologies.



CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon
our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires us
to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues
and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we
evaluate our estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other
assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the
basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily
apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Note 3 to the
consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2008 describes the significant accounting policies used in preparation of these
consolidated financial statements.

We believe the following critical accounting estimates and assumptions may have a material
impact on reported financial condition and operating performance and involve significant levels of
judgment to account for highly uncertain matters or are susceptible to significant change.

Revenue Recognition

Customer programs

. We record estimated reductions to revenue in connection with
customer marketing programs and incentive offerings that may give customers credits or award
points. Award points may be applied to trade receivables owed to us and/or toward future purchases
of our products or services. We establish accruals for estimated revenue reductions attributable to
customer programs and incentive offerings for each program based on numerous factors, including:

•

program design and award levels;

•

forecasted purchasing patterns of those enrolled in the program based on historical
experience with similar programs, current sales trends and market analyses;

•

inventory levels of eligible products in the distribution channel; and

•

estimated number of participants that will ultimately reach volume purchase
thresholds.

Revenue reductions are recorded quarterly based on issuance of credits, points earned but not
yet issued, and estimates of credits and points to be earned in the future based on current
revenue. In our analysis, we utilize data supplied from distributors and collected in-house that
details the volume of qualifying products purchased as well as price paid per clinic
(“practice-level sales data”).



IDEXX Points

. Customers can earn points based on their participation in certain
customer programs and making qualifying purchases related to those programs. Points may then be
applied against the purchase price for IDEXX products and services purchased in the future or
applied to trade receivables due to us. As points are redeemed we recognize the benefit of points
expected to expire, or breakage, using historical forfeiture rates. On November 30 of each year,
unused points earned before January 1 of the prior year expire and any variance from the breakage
estimate is accounted for as a change in estimate.

Within our overall IDEXX Points program, our two most significant customer programs are
Practice Developer

®

and SNAP

®

up the Savings

TM

(“SUTS”), both of
which are offered only to North American customers. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and
2006, we recorded revenue reductions of $7.7 million, $6.8 million and $5.1 million, respectively,
related to our Practice Developer

®

program and $4.0 million, $4.3 million and $4.9
million, respectively, related to our SUTS program. At December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the total
accrued revenue reductions were $15.2 million, $15.1 million and $14.0 million, respectively.
Following is a summary of changes in the accrual for estimated revenue reductions attributable to
IDEXX Points customer programs and incentive offerings in total and individually for our Practice

Practice Developer

®

. Our Practice Developer

®

program is a
Companion Animal Group awards program that permits customers to earn points by purchasing quarterly
minimums in certain product and service categories, including IDEXX Reference Laboratories
services, Catalyst Dx™ and VetTest

®

slides, VetTest

®

SNAP

®

Reader
reagents, LaserCyte

®

and VetAutoread™ tubes, Feline and Canine SNAP

®

tests,
and service and maintenance agreements. The accrued revenue reduction is calculated each quarter
based on sales to end users during the quarter by either us or our distributors and on our estimate
of future points to be issued upon sale of applicable product inventories held by distributors at
the end of the quarter.

SUTS

. SUTS is our volume incentive program for selected SNAP

®

tests that
provides customers with benefits in the form of (1) discounts off invoice at the time of purchase
and (2) points under the IDEXX Points program awarded quarterly throughout the SUTS program year
(which ends on August 31) based on total purchase volume of qualified SNAP

®

products
during the year. Under the SUTS program, commencing September 1, 2008, customers receive a 5%
rebate of their purchase price if they purchase a minimum volume of products, either from us or our
distributors. We cannot be certain what percentage of customers will purchase the minimum volume of
products until that program year has ended. At the beginning of the program year, we develop an
estimate of the percentage of customers that we expect to meet the minimum purchase threshold over
the program period based on program enrollee purchasing patterns, historical experience with
similar programs, current sales trends, and marketing analysis. The percentage of customers
expected to meet the minimum purchase threshold is adjusted quarterly during the program year based
on our experience with the program and finalized when the program year ends in August. The 5%
revenue reduction is calculated quarterly based on the applicable gross sales during the period, at
end-user prices, and the estimated percentage of end users that are expected to meet the minimum
purchase threshold by the end of the program year. The accrued revenue reduction also includes our
estimate of future points to be issued upon sale of applicable product inventories held by
distributors at the end of the quarter.

If the estimated percentage of customers expected to meet the minimum purchase threshold
required to receive the 5% rebate under the SUTS program were to increase or decrease by 5%, we
would be required to further reduce revenue or increase revenue, respectively, by $0.1 million.

Doubtful accounts receivable

. We recognize revenue only in those situations where
collection from the customer is reasonably assured. We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts
for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. We
base our estimates on detailed analysis of specific customer situations and a percentage of our
accounts receivable by aging category. If the financial condition of our customers were to
deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances
might be required. Account balances are charged off against the allowance when we believe the
receivable will not be recovered. Write-offs of customer accounts during the years ended December
31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, were $0.7 million, $1.0 million and $0.6 million, respectively.

Inventory Valuation

We write down inventory for estimated obsolescence when warranted by estimates of future
demand, market conditions, and remaining shelf life. If actual market conditions are less favorable
than those we estimated, additional inventory write-downs may be required, which would have a
negative effect on results of operations. Certain major components of inventory for which we have
made critical valuation judgments are discussed in more detail below.

LaserCyte

®

Hematology Analyzer

. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, $2.9 million
and $2.7 million, respectively, of inventory associated with our LaserCyte

®

hematology
instrument required rework before it could be used to manufacture finished goods, which was net of
$2.2 million and $1.7 million, respectively, of write-downs for inventory estimated to be obsolete.
We determined write-downs based on our estimate of the costs to rework inventory compared to
replacement cost and the probability of success, primarily based on historical experience. We
expect to fully realize our net investment in this inventory. However, if we are unsuccessful
reworking this inventory, if we revise our judgment of our ability to successfully rework inventory
due to new experience in reworking this inventory, or if we alter the design of this product, we
may be required to write off some or all of the remaining associated inventory.



Valuation of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

A significant portion of the purchase price for acquired businesses is assigned to intangible
assets. Intangible assets other than goodwill are initially valued at the lesser of fair value or,
if applicable, fair value proportionately reduced by the excess of the fair value of acquired net
assets over the purchase price (collectively, “fair value”) of the acquired business. If a market
value is not readily available, the fair value of the intangible asset is estimated based on
discounted cash flows using market participant assumptions, which are assumptions that are not
specific to IDEXX. The selection of appropriate valuation methodologies and the estimation of
discounted cash flows require significant assumptions about the timing and amounts of future cash
flows, risks, appropriate discount rates, and the useful lives of intangible assets. When deemed
appropriate by management, we utilize independent valuation experts to advise and assist us in
allocating the purchase prices for acquired businesses to the fair values of the identified
intangible assets and in determining appropriate amortization methods and periods for those
intangible assets. Goodwill is initially valued based on the excess of the purchase price of a
business combination over the fair values of acquired net assets.

We assess goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or
circumstances indicate an impairment may exist, in accordance with
Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.” For impairment
testing, the fair values of the reporting units that include goodwill are estimated using a
discounted cash flow approach. The cash flows used contain our best estimates, using appropriate
and customary assumptions and projections at the time. Changes in forecast cash flows or the
discount rate would affect the estimated fair values of reporting units and could result in a
goodwill impairment charge in a future period. However, at December 31, 2008 a 25% decrease in the
current estimated fair value of any of our reporting units would not result in a goodwill
impairment charge for any of our reporting units that include goodwill. No impairments were
identified as a result of the annual or event-driven reviews during the years ended December 31,
2008, 2007 or 2006.

During 2008, we sold certain pharmaceutical product lines and pharmaceutical assets that
qualified as a business. The pharmaceutical business had $13.7 million of related goodwill, of
which we wrote off approximately $7.2 million that was allocated to the product lines sold based on
their respective fair values. Fair values were estimated using a discounted cash flow approach. A
substantial portion of the remaining goodwill is associated with products that have been licensed
to third parties and is included in our “Other” segment. Realization of this goodwill is dependant
upon the success of those third parties in developing and commercializing products, which will
result in our receipt of royalties and other payments.

We assess the realizability of intangible assets other than goodwill whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with
SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” If an impairment
review is triggered, we evaluate the carrying value of intangible assets based on estimated
undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the assets and comparing that
value to the carrying value of the assets. The cash flows that are used contain our best estimates,
using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time. No impairments were
identified during the years ended December 31, 2008 or 2006.

During 2007, we recognized an impairment charge to write off a prepaid royalty license of $1.0
million associated with Navigator

®

paste. We also recognized a related inventory
write-down and the circumstances are described in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements
included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on our changed estimates of product availability
and estimated future demand and market conditions, we determined that we would not realize our
investment in prepaid royalties and, therefore, fully expensed this asset. No other impairments
were identified during the year ended December 31, 2007.

Share-Based Compensation

We adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS No. 123(R)”) on
January 1, 2006. Beginning in 2006, we modified our share-based employee compensation programs to
shift from the grant of stock options and employee stock purchase rights only to the grant of a mix
of restricted stock units and stock options, along with employee stock purchase rights. There were
no modifications to the terms of outstanding options, restricted stock units or deferred stock
units during 2008, 2007 or 2006.



In connection with the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), we adopted the straight-line method to
prospectively expense share-based awards granted subsequent to December 31, 2005. The
graded-vesting, or accelerated, method has been used to calculate the expense for stock options
granted prior to January 1, 2006. If the total fair value of share-based compensation awards, as
well as other features that impact expense, including forfeitures and capitalization of costs, was
consistent from year-to-year in each of the last five years and through 2010, this change in
expense method from graded-vesting to straight-line expensing would yield decreasing annual expense
through 2010 until awards granted prior to January 1, 2006 were fully expensed. However, the total
fair value of future awards may vary significantly from past awards based on a number of factors,
including our share-based award practices. Therefore, share-based compensation expense is likely to
fluctuate, possibly significantly, from year to year.

We use the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model to determine the fair value of options
granted. Option-pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, particularly for
the expected stock price volatility and the expected term of options. Changes in the subjective
input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate. Our expected stock price
volatility assumptions are based on the historical volatility of our stock over periods that are
similar to the expected terms of grants and other relevant factors. Lower estimated volatility
reduces the fair value of an option. The total fair value of options awarded during the year ended
December 31, 2008 ($6.7 million) would have increased or decreased by approximately 7% if the stock
price volatility assumption were increased or decreased by 10% to 27.5% or 22.5%, respectively. The
total cost recognized for options awarded during the year ended December 31, 2008 would have
increased or decreased by $0.1 million if the stock price volatility assumption were increased or
decreased by 10% to 27.5% or 22.5%, respectively.

To develop the expected term assumption for option awards, we previously elected to use the
simplified method described in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Staff Accounting Bulletin
No. 107, which is based on vesting and contractual terms. Beginning in January 2008, we derive the
expected term assumption for options based on historical experience and other relevant factors
concerning expected employee behavior with regard to option exercise. The expected term for future
awards will be determined using a consistent method. Longer expected term assumptions increase the
fair value of option awards, and therefore increase the expense recognized per award. The total
fair value of options awarded during the year ended December 31, 2008 ($6.7 million) would have
increased or decreased by approximately 12% if the expected term assumption were increased or
decreased by one year, respectively. The total cost recognized for options awarded during the year
ended December 31, 2008 would have increased or decreased by $0.2 million if the expected term
assumption were increased or decreased by one year, respectively.

We determine the assumptions to be used in the valuation of option grants as of the date of
grant. As such, we may use different assumptions during the year if we grant options at different
dates. The weighted average of the valuation assumptions used to determine the fair value of each
option grant is as follows:

Share-based compensation expense is based on the number of awards ultimately expected to vest
and is, therefore, reduced for an estimate of the number of awards that are expected to be
forfeited. The forfeiture estimates are based on historical data and other factors, and
compensation expense is adjusted for actual results. Share-based compensation costs for the year
ended December 31, 2008 were $10.2 million, which is net of a reduction of $1.8 million for actual
and estimated forfeitures. Changes in estimated forfeiture rates and differences between estimated
forfeiture rates and actual experience may result in significant, unanticipated increases or
decreases in share-based compensation expense from period to period. The termination of employment
by certain employees who hold large numbers of share-based compensation instruments may also have a
significant, unanticipated impact on forfeiture experience and, therefore, on share-based
compensation expense.

The fair value of options, restricted stock units, deferred stock units with vesting
conditions, and employee stock purchase rights awarded during the years ended December 31, 2008,
2007 and 2006 totaled $18.7 million, $18.2 million and $11.9 million, respectively. The total
unrecognized compensation cost for unvested share-based
compensation awards outstanding at December 31, 2008, before consideration of estimated
forfeitures, was $30.9 million. We estimate that this cost will be reduced by approximately $3.1
million related to forfeitures. The weighted average remaining expense recognition period is
approximately 2 years.



Income Taxes

We recognize a current tax liability or asset for current taxes payable or refundable,
respectively, and a deferred tax liability or asset, as the case may be, for the estimated future
tax effects of temporary differences between book and tax treatment of assets and liabilities and
carryforwards to the extent they are realizable.

The future tax benefit arising from net deductible temporary differences and tax
carryforwards, net of valuation allowances, was $7.5 million and $15.4 million at December 31, 2008
and 2007, respectively. We believe that our earnings during the periods when the temporary
differences become deductible will be sufficient to realize the related future tax benefits. Should
we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the
future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such
determination was made. A reduction of net income before taxes in each subsidiary equal to 5% of
revenue, compared to the corresponding reported amounts for the year ended December 31, 2008, would
not result in the recognition of incremental valuation allowances except in two subsidiaries where
a 5% reduction could result in our recording a valuation allowance of $1.1 million for those
subsidiaries.

For those jurisdictions where the expiration date of tax carryforwards or the projected
operating results indicate that realization is not likely, a valuation allowance is recorded to
offset the deferred tax asset within that jurisdiction. In assessing the need for a valuation
allowance, we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning
strategies. In the event that we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred
tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax
asset would increase income in the period such determination was made. Similarly, a determination
that a higher valuation allowance is required would decrease income in the period such
determination was made.

Our net deductible temporary differences and tax carryforwards are recorded using the enacted
tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax liability or
asset is expected to be settled or realized. Should the expected applicable tax rates change in the
future, an adjustment to the net deferred tax asset would be credited or charged, as appropriate,
to income in the period such determination was made. For example, an increase of one percentage
point in our anticipated U.S. state income tax rate would cause us to increase our net deferred tax
asset balance by $0.4 million. This increase in the net deferred asset would increase net income in
the period that our rate was adjusted. Likewise, a decrease of one percentage point to our
anticipated U.S. state income tax rate would have the opposite effect.

We periodically assess our exposures related to our worldwide provision for income taxes and
believe that we have appropriately accrued taxes for contingencies. Any reduction of these
contingent liabilities or additional assessment would increase or decrease income, respectively, in
the period such determination was made.

We consider certain operating earnings of non-United States subsidiaries to be indefinitely
invested outside the U.S. The cumulative earnings of these subsidiaries were $155.6 million at
December 31, 2008. No provision has been made for U.S. federal and state, or international taxes
that may result from future remittances of these undistributed earnings of non-United States
subsidiaries. Should we repatriate these earnings in the future, we would have to adjust the income
tax provision in the period in which the decision to repatriate earnings is made. For the operating
earnings not considered to be indefinitely invested outside the United States we have accrued taxes
on a current basis.

We record a liability for uncertain tax provisions in accordance with FASB Interpretation (“FIN”) No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
Taxes” (“FIN 48”). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in
financial statements under SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for
Income Taxes” and prescribes a comprehensive model for the recognition,
measurement, and financial statement disclosure of uncertain tax positions. This comprehensive
model requires us to assess all tax positions against a more likely than not standard. We record
tax benefits for only those positions that we believe will more likely than not be sustained. For
positions that we believe that it is more likely than not that we will prevail, we record a benefit
considering the amounts and probabilities that could be realized upon ultimate settlement. If our
judgment as to the likely resolution
of the uncertainty changes, if the uncertainty is ultimately settled or if the statute of
limitation related to the uncertainty expires, the effects of the change would be recognized in the
period in which the change, resolution or expiration occurs. As of December 31, 2008 our net
liability for uncertain tax positions was $6.9 million, which includes interest expense and
penalties.



RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Revenue

Total Company.

Revenue increased $101.5 million, or 11%, to $1.024 billion for the year ended
December 31, 2008. Incremental sales from businesses acquired subsequent to January 1, 2007
contributed 1% to revenue growth. These acquisitions consisted primarily of veterinary reference
laboratories and customer lists in Canada, the United States and Europe; a production animal
diagnostic products business in France; and the Critical Care Division of Osmetech plc, which we
refer to as OPTI Medical. The favorable impact of currency exchange rates contributed 1% to revenue
growth. The following table presents revenue by operating segment:

Represents the percentage change in revenue attributed to incremental revenues during the

The following revenue analysis reflects the results of operations net of the impact of
currency exchange rates on sales outside the U.S. and net of incremental sales from veterinary
reference laboratory businesses acquired subsequent to January 1, 2007.

Instruments and consumables revenue increased due to higher consumables sales volumes for most
of our analyzers and higher average unit sales prices, primarily on slides that are sold for use in
our chemistry analyzers. Additionally, increased revenue was also due to higher instrument sales
volumes, due primarily to sales of recently launched instruments, including Catalyst Dx™ chemistry
analyzers and SNAPshot Dx

®

analyzers, which we began shipping to customers in the first
quarter of 2008, and sales of Coag Dx™ blood coagulation analyzers, which we began shipping to
customers in the fourth quarter of 2007. The increase in volumes due to the placement of recently
launched instruments was partly offset by a decrease in sales of most of our other IDEXX
VetLab

®

instruments, due primarily to increased market penetration and a shift in focus
of our sales team to our newer instruments. We anticipate that in future periods as we continue to
penetrate the market with our next-generation chemistry analyzer, Catalyst Dx™, sales of our
VetTest

®

chemistry analyzers will decline. The lower sales of our other IDEXX
VetLab

®

instruments was also due to lower average unit sales prices, due largely to
increased promotional discounting. Higher instrument service revenue was due to the increase in
number of instruments covered under service contracts as we continue to increase our active
installed base of instruments.

Sales volumes of consumables in the U.S. and Canada in the first half of 2007 benefited from
temporary additional diagnostic testing volume related to the recall of certain pet foods in March
2007. We believe that the recall resulted in a higher than usual number of pet visits to veterinary
clinics in North America in the first and second quarters of 2007. We estimate that this event
negatively impacted year-over-year growth in sales of instruments and consumables for the year
ended December 31, 2008 by approximately 1%. The impact from changes in distributors’ inventory
levels reduced reported instruments and consumables revenue growth by 1%.

The increase in practice-level sales of rapid assay products was due to both higher average
unit sales prices and higher sales volumes. Higher average unit sales prices were due primarily to
the impact of price increases of certain canine and feline combination tests and, to a lesser
extent, less promotional discounting in connection with our SNAP

®

up the Savings™ and
other customer programs and higher relative sales of canine combination test products versus single
assay test products. We expect that the rate of end users’ conversion from canine heartworm-only
tests to combination test products will slow in future periods, which will decelerate the rate of
increase in average unit sales prices. Increased volume was due primarily to increased U.S.
practice-level sales of our canine combination test products, such as the
SNAP

®

4Dx

®

,
and the July 2007 launch of
SNAP

®

cPL™, our test for pancreatitis
in dogs. The favorable impacts on rapid assay sales noted above were partly offset by a decrease in
the volume of sales of products under our distribution agreement with Agen Biomedical Limited. The
impact from changes in distributors’ inventory levels reduced reported rapid assay revenue growth
by 2%.

The increase in sales of laboratory and consulting services resulted from higher testing
volume and the impact of price increases. As discussed above, the first half of 2007 benefited from
temporary additional diagnostic testing volume resulting from the March 2007 pet food recall. We
estimate that this event negatively impacted year-over-year growth in laboratory and consulting
services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2008 by approximately 1%.

The increase in sales of practice information management systems and digital radiography
resulted primarily from higher sales volumes of companion animal radiography systems, partly offset
by lower sales of equine radiography systems, lower average unit prices for companion animal
radiography systems, and lower sales of
Cornerstone

®

practice information management systems.

Revenue from the sales of pharmaceutical products was unchanged as the higher average unit
sales price of PZI VET

®

,
our insulin product for the treatment of diabetic cats, was
offset by lower sales volumes of
Acarexx

®

and
SURPASS

®

pharmaceutical
products. As discussed above, in a series of transactions in the fourth quarter of 2008, we sold a
substantial portion of our pharmaceutical assets and product lines and therefore will not have
meaningful pharmaceutical product revenue in 2009 or future years. We have retained certain
intellectual property and licenses for developed products as well as certain less significant
product lines, which have been reassigned to other business units. See note 16 to the consolidated
financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2008 included in this Annual Report on Form
10-K.



Water.

Revenue for Water increased $8.2 million, or 12%, to $74.5 million for the year ended
December 31, 2008 from $66.2 million for the same period of the prior year. The increase resulted
primarily from higher sales volume, partly offset by lower average unit sales prices due to higher
relative sales in geographies where products are sold at lower average unit sales prices. Higher
sales volumes were attributable to the increased sales of our Colilert

®

products, used
to detect total coliforms and

E. coli

in water, and the commencement in September 2007 of
distribution of certain water testing kits manufactured by Invitrogen, which increased reported
Water revenue growth by 5%.

Production Animal Segment.

Revenue for PAS increased $5.7 million, or 8%, to $80.8 million for
the year ended December 31, 2008 from $75.1 million for the same period of the prior year. The
increase in revenue resulted from increased sales volume and the favorable impact from currency
exchange rates, which contributed 5% to PAS revenue growth, partly offset by lower average unit
sales prices. The increase in volume resulted primarily from higher livestock diagnostics sales,
including sales attributable to Institut Pourquier, a France-based manufacturer of production
animal diagnostic products that we acquired in March 2007. The year-over-year growth in sales of
Pourquier products contributed 3% to PAS revenue growth. The decrease in average unit sales prices
was due primarily to a reduction in average price for our post-mortem test for BSE.

Other.

Revenue for Other operating units increased $4.0 million, or 13%, to $34.7 million for
the year ended December 31, 2008 from $30.8 million for the same period of the prior year due
primarily to higher sales volume of our OPTI Medical consumable products and, to a lesser extent,
higher sales volume of Dairy SNAP

®

antibiotic residue tests. The favorable impact of
currency exchange rates contributed 3% to the increase in revenue from Other operating units.

Companion Animal Group.

Gross profit for CAG increased $50.0 million, or 14%, to $412.2
million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $362.2 million for the same period of the prior
year due to increased sales volume in all CAG product and service lines, except the pharmaceutical
business, and to an increase in the gross profit percentage to 49% from 48%. The gross profit
percentage in 2007 was unfavorably impacted by the write-off of pharmaceutical inventory and of a
prepaid royalty related to our Navigator

®

product, as discussed below, which favorably
impacted the comparison of current year gross profit percentage to prior year gross profit
percentage by 1%. The increase in the 2008 gross profit percentage was also due to the favorable
impact of foreign currency rates on sales denominated in those currencies, inclusive of foreign
exchange hedge contract gains and foreign currency denominated expenses; lower cost of slides that
are sold for use in our chemistry analyzers; and higher average unit sales prices on canine
combination test products. These favorable items were partly offset by higher relative sales of
lower margin laboratory and consulting services and IDEXX VetLab

®

instruments, and also
by higher manufacturing costs of our instruments, including our Catalyst Dx™ Chemistry Analyzer,
for which we have not yet achieved economies of scale.



During 2007 we recognized a write-down of NTZ raw materials inventory of $9.1 million and a
write-off of a prepaid royalty license of $1.0 million associated with Navigator

®

paste.
We wrote down these assets because the third-party contract manufacturer of finished goods notified
us that it would discontinue manufacturing the product in 2009. Additionally, product sales were
lower than projected. We believed that we would not be able to enter into a replacement
manufacturing arrangement on economically feasible terms and that we would not be able to obtain
the product after termination of the existing manufacturing arrangement because the estimated
production volume was low. Accordingly, we evaluated our associated inventory for obsolescence
based on our changed estimates of product availability and estimated future demand and market
conditions. Additionally, because of lower sales volume estimates and the reduced product life, we
determined that we would not realize our related investment in prepaid royalties and, therefore,
fully expensed this asset. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we cancelled our supply agreement for NTZ
and sold our remaining raw material inventory back to the supplier for $2.0 million, payable in
monthly installments of $25,000 through December, 2010 with the remaining balance then due. We will
recognize these payments in our results of operations when they are received due to uncertain
collectibility.

Water.

Gross profit for Water increased $5.4 million, or 13%, to $47.1 million for the year
ended December 31, 2008 from $41.7 million for the same period of the prior year due primarily to
increased sales volume. Gross profit percentage remained approximately constant at 63% as lower
overall costs of manufacturing and the favorable impact of foreign currency rates on sales
denominated in those currencies, inclusive of foreign exchange hedge contract gains and foreign
currency denominated expense, were offset by the impact of greater relative sales of lower margin
products, consisting primarily of water testing kits manufactured by Invitrogen that we began
distributing in September 2007; discrete costs incurred as a result of discontinuing a project to
qualify a second source supplier for certain products; and higher relative sales in geographies
where products are sold at lower unit prices.

Production Animal Segment.

Gross profit for PAS increased $8.3 million, or 18%, to $55.0
million for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $46.7 million for the same period of the prior
year due to increased sales volume and to an increase in the gross profit percentage to 68% from
62%. The increase in the gross profit percentage was due primarily to the impact of foreign
currency exchange rates on sales denominated in those currencies, inclusive of foreign exchange
hedge contract gains and foreign currency denominated expenses and, to a lesser extent, higher
relative sales of higher margin livestock diagnostic tests; the impact of revenue recognized in
2008 on shipments prior to January 1, 2008 to a customer for which we recognize revenue on the cash
basis of accounting due to uncertain collectibility; and the favorable settlement of a royalty
liability. The gross profit percentage in 2007 was negatively affected by 1% as a result of
purchase accounting for inventory acquired with the Pourquier business. These favorable impacts
were partly offset by the impact of lower average unit sales prices.

Other.

Gross profit for Other operating units increased $2.7 million, or 21%, to $15.1 million
for the year ended December 31, 2008 from $12.5 million for the same period of the prior year due
primarily to increased sales volume and to an increase in the gross profit percentage to 44% from
41%. The increase in the gross profit percentage was due primarily to the impact of foreign
currency exchange rates on sales denominated in those currencies, inclusive of foreign exchange
hedge contract gains and foreign currency denominated expenses. The gross profit percentage in 2008
also improved due to an initial payment under a royalty-bearing license agreement related to
certain intellectual property. Under this agreement we received an initial payment and are entitled
to receive a total of $3.3 million in future milestone payments in addition to royalties based on
future product sales. Milestone payments will be included in our results of operations upon
achievement of each of the milestones. These favorable impacts were partly offset by higher
relative sales of lower margin products.

The increase in sales and marketing expense resulted primarily from higher personnel and
personnel-related costs due, in part, to expanded worldwide sales and marketing and the addition of
customer service headcount. To a lesser extent, the impact of exchange rates on foreign currency
denominated expenses and increased spending on customer support systems also contributed to the
increase in sales and marketing expense. These increases were partly offset by lower overall
spending on commissions and distributor incentives and marketing programs.

The increase in general and administrative expense resulted primarily from higher spending on
corporate support functions; incremental expenses associated with businesses acquired subsequent to
January 1, 2007, comprised mainly of administrative expenses of a recurring nature to support the
acquired businesses and amortization expense for intangible assets acquired; the unfavorable impact
of exchange rates on foreign currency denominated expenses; and, to a lesser extent, increased bad
debt expense and higher personnel costs due, in part, to increased headcount. These increases were
partly offset by the absence of non-recurring costs incurred in 2007 related to acquisitions.

The decrease in research and development expense resulted primarily from a decrease in product
development spending due to the completion of the development of our next-generation chemistry
analyzer, Catalyst Dx™, and our new quantitative immunoassay platform, SNAPshot Dx

®

,
both of which we began shipping to customers in the first quarter of 2008, and to lower external
consulting costs related to our pharmaceuticals product line. These decreases were largely offset
by higher personnel costs to support development initiatives related primarily to IDEXX
VetLab

®

instrumentation, rapid assay and digital radiography products.

The increase in sales and marketing expense resulted primarily from the impact of exchange
rates on foreign currency denominated expenses and, to a lesser extent, increased personnel and
personnel-related costs and incremental activities associated with the Pourquier business, which
was acquired in March 2007. These unfavorable impacts were partly offset by costs incurred in 2007
associated with terminating a distribution agreement, which favorably impacted the comparison of
current year sales and marketing expense to prior year, and by increased recruiting costs
associated with the increase in headcount. The increase in general and administrative expense
resulted primarily from increased personnel costs, the impact of exchange rates on foreign currency
denominated expenses and incremental costs associated with the acquisition of the Pourquier
business, which are comprised mainly of administrative expenses of a recurring nature to support
the acquired business and amortization expense for intangible assets. These increases were partly
offset by lower overall spending on corporate support function expenses. The increase in research
and development expense resulted primarily from increased headcount and the impact of exchange
rates on foreign currency denominated expenses, partly offset by a decrease in spending on research
and development supplies and on third-party consulting firms used to conduct research.

Other.

Operating expenses for Other operating units increased $2.1 million to $13.6 million
for the year ended December 31, 2008 due primarily to higher spending on corporate support function
expenses, increased personnel costs, partly due to increased headcount, and to incremental expenses
related to OPTI Medical, which was acquired in January 2007. These increases were partly offset by
a reduction in deferred compensation liability related to a deferred compensation
plan assumed in the Opti Medical acquisition. The deferred compensation liability is determined
based on the value of the investments in an underlying consolidated trust. The unrealized loss on
the marketable securities in the trust is recorded through other comprehensive income.



Unallocated Amounts.

Operating expenses that are not allocated to our operating segments
increased $4.3 million to $12.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 due primarily to
increased corporate research and development spending on software and systems research and
development related to integration of our veterinary product and service offerings. To a lesser
extent, the increase in operating expenses was also attributable to the sale of our
Acarexx

®

and SURPASS

®

pharmaceutical products and a product that was under
development, and the subsequent restructuring of the remaining pharmaceutical business. We
recognized a loss on the transaction and restructuring of approximately $1.5 million, of which $1.1
million was recorded in general and administrative expense, $0.3 million was recorded in sales and
marketing expense and $0.1 million was recorded in research and development expense in 2008.

Interest Income and Interest Expense

Interest income was $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to $2.8 million
for the same period of the prior year. The decrease in interest income was due to lower effective
interest rates, partly offset by higher average invested cash balances.

Interest expense was $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to $4.2
million for the same period of the prior year. The increase in interest expense was due primarily
to higher borrowings under our revolving credit facility, partly offset by lower effective interest
rates on outstanding debt balances and incremental capitalized interest.

Provision for Income Taxes

Our effective income tax rate was 31.7% for the year ended December 31, 2008 and 30.3% for the
year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in tax rate is primarily attributable to several
non-recurring items. First, we wrote off non-deductible goodwill related to the pharmaceutical
product lines sold in the fourth quarter of 2008. Additionally, the increase in tax rate was
impacted by certain non-recurring items that favorably impacted the tax rate for the year ended
December 31, 2007, including the reduction of deferred tax liabilities due to a change in
international tax rate and the recognition of state tax benefits resulting from the completion of
an audit in 2007. These items were partly offset by tax benefits related to a reduction in
international deferred tax liabilities in 2008 and the 2007 reduction of deferred tax assets due to
changes in statutory income tax rates for jurisdictions in which we operate.

We anticipate recognizing approximately $1.4 million of income tax benefits in 2009 that have
not been recognized at December 31, 2008 in accordance with FIN 48. The income tax benefits are
primarily due to the lapse in the statute of limitations for various foreign and state tax
jurisdictions.



Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2007 Compared to Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2006

Revenue

Total Company.

Revenue increased $183.4 million, or 25%, to $922.6 million for the year ended
December 31, 2007 from $739.1 million for the prior year. Incremental sales from businesses and
from customer-related and other intangible assets acquired subsequent to January 1, 2006
contributed 8% to revenue growth. These acquisitions consisted primarily of veterinary reference
laboratories and customer-related assets in Canada, the United States, Europe and South Africa;
intellectual property and distribution rights of a veterinary diagnostics business; a production
animal diagnostic products business in France; and the Critical Care Division of Osmetech plc. The
favorable impact of currency exchange rates contributed 3% to revenue growth. The following table

veterinary reference laboratory businesses and customer-related assets and from intellectual
property and distribution rights of a veterinary diagnostics business acquired subsequent to

The following revenue analysis reflects the results of operations net of the impact of
currency exchange rates on sales outside the U.S. and net of incremental sales from businesses and
from customer-related and other intangible assets acquired subsequent to January 1, 2006.

The increase in sales of instruments and consumables was due mainly to higher unit sales
volume. Higher consumables sales volumes were attributable primarily to higher worldwide
practice-level sales of slides and, to a lesser extent, to increased practice-level sales of tubes
used with our hematology analyzers, with all consumables categories benefiting from the continued
growth of our installed base of instruments. Sales volumes of consumables also benefited from
temporary additional diagnostic testing volume related to the recall of certain pet foods in
mid-March 2007 in the U.S. and Canada. We believe that the recall resulted in a higher than usual
number of pet visits to veterinary clinics in North America in the first and second quarters of
2007. Higher instrument sales revenue resulted mainly from increased sales of our
LaserCyte

®

Hematology Analyzer and, to a lesser extent, our IDEXX
VetLab

®

Station, an in-clinic laboratory information management system. The impact from changes in U.S.
distributors’ inventory levels reduced reported instruments and consumables revenue growth by less
than 1%.

The increase in practice-level sales of rapid assay products was due to both higher average
unit sales prices and higher sales volumes. Higher average unit sales prices were due, in part, to
higher relative sales of canine combination test products, such as the SNAP

®

4Dx

®

, which was launched in the U.S. in September 2006, and less promotional
discounting in connection with our SNAP

®

up the Savings™ and other customer programs. We
expect the rate of end users’ conversion from canine heartworm-only tests to combination test
products and, therefore, the rate of increase of average unit sales prices, will lessen in future
periods. Higher sales volumes resulted in part from the July 2007 launch of the SNAP

®

cPL™, our test for pancreatitis in dogs. Effective January 2008, we changed our distribution
methods in Japan from a combination of direct sales and the use of multiple distributors to an
exclusive distribution arrangement for our rapid assay products and instrument consumables. The
impact from the distributor’s initial stocking orders to build inventory levels increased reported
revenue growth by 1%. The impact from changes in U.S. distributors’ inventory levels reduced
reported rapid assay revenue growth by 4%.

The increase in sales of laboratory and consulting services resulted primarily from higher
testing volume and, to a lesser extent, the impact of price increases. Higher testing volume was
attributable to both new customers and to increased testing volume from existing customers, and
benefited from temporary additional diagnostic testing volume resulting from the March 2007 pet
food recall, as discussed above, and from new test offerings.

The increase in sales of practice information management systems and digital radiography
resulted primarily from higher sales volumes of companion animal and equine radiography systems,
higher sales of Cornerstone

®

practice information management systems and services, and
the favorable impact of implementing tiered support service level offerings with differentiated
pricing for our practice information management systems, partly offset by lower average unit prices
for radiography systems due to increased competition.

The increase in sales of pharmaceutical products resulted primarily from higher sales volume
and price increases, in each case related largely to PZI VET

®

, our insulin product for
the treatment of diabetic cats.

Water.

Revenue for Water increased $7.8 million, or 13%, to $66.2 million for the year ended
December 31, 2007 from $58.5 million for the prior year. The increase resulted primarily from
higher worldwide sales volume, partly offset by lower average unit sales prices due to both higher
relative sales in geographies where products are sold at lower average unit sales prices and
greater price competition in certain geographies. Higher sales volumes resulted in part from our
commencement in September 2007 of distribution of certain water testing kits manufactured by
Invitrogen Corporation (“Invitrogen”), which increased reported Water revenue growth by 2%. The
favorable impact of currency exchange rates contributed 4% to the increase in Water revenue.

Production Animal Segment.

Revenue for PAS increased $16.1 million, or 27%, to $75.1 million
for the year ended December 31, 2007 from $58.9 million for the prior year. The increase resulted
primarily from higher livestock diagnostics sales volume, including sales attributable to Institut
Pourquier, a manufacturer of production animal diagnostic products in France that we acquired in
March 2007. Sales of Pourquier products contributed 12% to PAS revenue growth. The favorable impact
of higher sales volume was partly offset by lower average unit sales prices for our HerdChek

®

products that test for transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (“TSEs”) due to both greater
price competition and higher relative sales in geographies where products are sold at lower average
unit sales prices. The favorable impact of currency exchange rates contributed 7% to the increase
in PAS revenue.



Other.

Revenue for Other operating units increased $13.4 million, or 77%, to $30.8 million for
the year ended December 31, 2007 from $17.4 million for the prior year due primarily to incremental
revenue attributable to OPTI Medical, which was acquired in January 2007.

Gross Profit

Total Company.

Gross profit
increased $84.0 million, or 22%, to $463.5 million for the year
ended December 31, 2007 from $379.5 million for the prior year. As a percentage of total revenue,
gross profit decreased to 50% from 51%.

During 2007, we recognized a write-down of NTZ raw materials inventory of $9.1 million and a
write-off of a prepaid royalty license of $1.0 million associated with Navigator

®

, which
resulted in an unfavorable impact of 1.1% of total company gross profit for the year ended December
31, 2007. These write-downs are included in cost of product revenue in the consolidated statement
of operations.

Share-based compensation expense of $0.7 million was included in cost of revenue for the year
ended December 31, 2007, compared to $1.1 million for the prior year. Beginning in 2007, we have
allocated share-based compensation expense to the operating segments based on headcount and other
personnel data. This allocation differs from the actual expense and consequently yields a
difference between the total allocated share-based compensation expense and the actual expense for
the total company, which was categorized as “unallocated amounts.” Share-based compensation expense
was not allocated to our operating segments in 2006. Therefore, the total company share-based
compensation expense was categorized as “unallocated amounts” for the year ended December 31, 2006.

Companion Animal Group.

Gross profit for CAG increased $65.1 million, or 22%, to $362.2
million for the year ended December 31, 2007 from $297.1 million for the prior year due primarily
to increased sales volume across the CAG product and service lines, partly offset by a decrease in
gross profit percentage to 48% from 49%. The write-down of pharmaceutical inventory and the related
prepaid royalty impairment charge, discussed above, resulted in an unfavorable impact of 1.4% of
CAG revenue. Greater relative sales of lower margin products and services, such as laboratory and
consulting services and IDEXX VetLab

®

instruments, also contributed to the decrease in
the gross profit percentage. These unfavorable impacts were partly offset by higher relative sales
of our canine combination test product, SNAP

®

4Dx

®

and, to a lesser extent,
all other CAG product and service lines, except in the Digital Radiography business; lower cost of
slides that are sold for use
in VetTest

®

Chemistry Analyzers; and the favorable impact
of foreign currency rates on sales denominated in those currencies, net of foreign exchange hedge
contract losses.

Water.

Gross profit for Water increased $3.2 million, or 8%, to $41.7 million for the year
ended December 31, 2007 from $38.4 million for the prior year due to higher sales volume, partly
offset by a decrease in the gross profit percentage to 63% from 66%. The decrease in gross profit
percentage was due primarily to higher manufacturing costs; lower average unit sales prices, and
greater relative sales of lower margin products, which was primarily due to the lower gross margin
earned on certain water testing kits manufactured by Invitrogen that we began distributing in
September 2007.



Production Animal Segment.

Gross profit for PAS increased $8.1 million, or 21%, to $46.7
million for the year ended December 31, 2007 from $38.7 million for the prior year due to increased
sales volume, partly offset by a decrease in the gross profit percentage to 62% from 66%. The gross
profit percentage was unfavorably impacted by lower average unit sales prices; net higher
production costs; the effect of purchase accounting for inventory acquired in connection with the
Pourquier business acquisition; and a relatively lower gross profit rate realized on sales by
Pourquier, largely offset by greater relative sales of higher margin products, exclusive of the
impact of the Pourquier business. The gross profit percentage earned on sales by Pourquier,
excluding the impact of purchase accounting, was lower than our historical PAS gross profit rate
due to greater price competition in the primary markets served by Pourquier. Additionally, purchase
accounting for inventory had an unfavorable impact of 0.8% of PAS revenue because finished goods
inventory acquired in connection with a business acquisition are assigned a fair value that exceeds
replacement cost, which results in a low gross margin on the sale of those finished goods by the
acquirer. Additionally, decreases in the gross profit percentage were partly offset by the
favorable impact of foreign currency rates on sales denominated in those currencies, net of foreign
exchange hedge contract losses.

Other.

Gross profit for Other operating units increased $5.4 million, or 77%, to $12.5 million
for the year ended December 31, 2007 from $7.0 million for the prior year due primarily to
incremental revenue attributable to OPTI Medical, which resulted in incremental gross profit for
the Other operating units. Excluding the acquisition of OPTI Medical, the gross profit percentage
was 39% for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to 41% for the prior year. The decrease in
the gross profit percentage was due to lower average unit sales prices for certain Dairy products
and higher manufacturing and distribution costs, partly offset by the favorable impact of the
effect of foreign currency rates on sales denominated in those currencies.

Operating Expenses and Operating Income

Total Company.

Total operating expenses increased $75.7 million, or 30%, to $327.3 million for
the year ended December 31, 2007 from $251.6 million for the prior year. As a percentage of
revenue, operating expenses increased to 35% from 34%.

Share-based compensation expense of $7.9 million was included in operating expenses for the
year ended December 31, 2007, compared to $9.0 million for the prior year. Beginning in 2007, we
allocate share-based compensation expense to the operating segments, as discussed above. The total
company share-based compensation expense was categorized as “unallocated amounts” for the year
ended December 31, 2006.

Operating income increased $8.3 million, or 6%, to $136.2 million for the year ended December
31, 2007 from $127.9 million for the prior year. As a percentage of revenue, operating income
decreased to 15% from 17%.

The increase in sales and marketing expense resulted primarily from higher personnel-related
costs due, in part, to expanded worldwide sales, marketing and customer service support resources
and higher sales commissions as a result of revenue performance. Additionally, the unfavorable
impact of exchange rates on foreign currency denominated expenses, the inclusion of share-based
compensation expense, and incremental expenses associated with businesses acquired subsequent to
January 1, 2006 also contributed to the increase in sales and marketing expense.

The increase in general and administrative expense resulted primarily from higher
personnel-related costs due, in part, to expanded resources and spending on information technology,
facilities, and other general support functions. To a lesser extent, the inclusion of share-based
compensation expense; incremental expenses associated with businesses acquired subsequent to
January 1, 2006, comprised mainly of administrative expenses of a recurring nature to support the
acquired businesses and amortization expense for intangible assets acquired; and the unfavorable
impact of exchange rates on foreign currency denominated expenses also contributed to the increase
in general and administrative expense.

The increase in research and development expense resulted primarily from increased product
development spending, including additional professional resources, related primarily to IDEXX
VetLab

®

instrumentation and rapid assay products. To a lesser extent, product
development activities in all other CAG product and service
categories and the inclusion of share-based compensation expense also contributed to the increases
in research and development expense.



Water.

Operating expenses for Water increased $2.1 million, or 17%, to $14.8 million for the
year ended December 31, 2007 from $12.7 million for the prior year and, as a percentage of revenue,
were approximately constant at 22%. Share-based compensation expense of $0.4 million, or 0.6% of
revenue, was included in Water operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2007. The

The increase in sales and marketing expense resulted primarily from higher personnel-related

exchange rates on foreign currency denominated expenses. The increase in general and administrative
expense resulted primarily from the inclusion of share-based compensation expense and higher
spending on information technology, facilities, and other general support functions, partly offset
by the favorable comparison due to costs incurred during the third quarter of 2006 to consolidate
our office and production facilities based in the United Kingdom into a single facility and other
net cost reductions. The increase in research and development expense resulted primarily from
higher costs associated with coliform and

E. coli

water test product development.

Production Animal Segment.

Operating expenses for PAS increased $8.8 million, or 39%, to $31.3
million for the year ended December 31, 2007 from $22.5 million for the prior year and, as a
percentage of revenue, increased to 42% from 38%. Share-based compensation expense of $0.8 million,

The increase in sales and marketing expense resulted primarily from incremental activities
associated with the Pourquier business, higher personnel-related costs, and, to a lesser extent,
the unfavorable impact of exchange rates on foreign currency denominated expenses. The increase in
general and administrative expense resulted primarily from incremental expenses associated with the
Pourquier business, comprised mainly of administrative expenses of a recurring nature to support
the acquired business and amortization expense for intangible assets, and higher spending on
information technology, facilities, and other general support functions. To a lesser extent, the
unfavorable impact of exchange rates on foreign currency denominated expenses and the inclusion of
share-based compensation expense also contributed to the increase in general and administrative
expense. These increases were partly offset by a favorable comparison due to the write-off, in the
second quarter of 2006, of certain fixed assets located in our facility in China. The increase in
research and development expense resulted primarily from higher development activities and
associated higher personnel-related costs, including incremental development activities
attributable to the Pourquier business acquired in March 2007, and, to a lesser extent, the
inclusion of share-based compensation expense.



Other.

Operating expenses for Other operating units increased $7.2 million to $11.5 million
for the year ended December 31, 2007 from $4.3 million for the prior year due primarily to
incremental expenses attributable to OPTI Medical, which was acquired in January 2007. These costs
are mainly composed of operating expenses of a recurring nature to support the OPTI Medical
business and amortization expense for intangible assets acquired. Share-based compensation expense
of $0.3 million, or 1.0% of revenue, was included in Other operating expenses for the year ended
December 31, 2007.

Unallocated Amounts.

Operating expenses that are not allocated to our operating segments
decreased $7.0 million to $7.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 from $14.9 million for
the prior year. As described above, share-based compensation expense was not allocated to our
operating segments in 2006. Therefore, total company share-based compensation expense included in
operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2006 of $9.0 million was categorized as
“unallocated amounts.” Beginning in 2007, we allocate a portion of share-based compensation expense
to the operating segments. The unallocated share-based compensation expense for the year ended
December 31, 2007 was $0.5 million. Corporate research and development expense was also included in
“unallocated amounts” for both periods and grew mainly due to personnel additions in 2007 to
support increased long-term product development activities.

Interest Income and Interest Expense

Interest income was $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to $3.3 million
for the year ended December 31, 2006. The decrease in interest income was due primarily to lower
invested cash balances, partly offset by higher effective interest rates.

Interest expense was $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to $0.5
million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in interest expense was due primarily to
interest expense incurred on borrowings under a revolving credit facility.

Provision for Income Taxes

Our effective income tax rate was 30.3% for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 28.4% for the
year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in tax rate is primarily attributable to several
non-recurring items that benefited the tax rate in the year ended December 31, 2006. These 2006
items included the resolution of an income tax audit for years ended December 31, 2003 and 2004, a
reduction of previously recorded deferred tax liabilities as a result of obtaining certain
multi-year tax incentives and the release of a valuation allowance on international deferred tax
assets as a result of a foreign subsidiary demonstrating consistent sustained profitability.
Offsetting the impact of the items occurring in 2006 were several favorable impacts to our rate
that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2007. These items included an increase in certain
federal tax incentives due to changes in legislation, tax benefits related to reductions in
international rates, and the recognition of state tax benefits resulting from the completion of an
audit.

We anticipate recognizing approximately $0.5 million of income tax benefits that have not been
recognized at December 31, 2007 in accordance with FIN 48. The income tax benefits are primarily due to
the lapse in the statute of limitations for various foreign and state tax jurisdictions.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

A discussion of recent accounting pronouncements is included in Note 3(q) to the consolidated
financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2008 included in this Annual Report on Form
10-K.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Liquidity

We fund the capital needs of our business through cash on hand, funds generated from
operations, and amounts available under our credit facilities. At December 31, 2008 and December
31, 2007, we had $78.9 million and $60.4 million, respectively, of cash and cash equivalents and
working capital of $60.6 million and $82.3 million, respectively. Additionally, at December 31,
2008, we had borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility
of $48.8 million. We believe that current cash and cash equivalents, funds generated from
operations, and amounts available under our credit facility will be sufficient to fund our
operations, capital purchase requirements, and strategic growth needs for the foreseeable future.
We further believe that we could obtain additional borrowings at prevailing market interest rates
to fund our growth objectives. However, based on the current credit market, the interest rates and
financial covenants obtained may be less favorable than historical interest rates and the interest
rates and financial covenants available to us under our current credit facilities.



We consider certain operating earnings of non-United States subsidiaries to be indefinitely
invested outside the U.S. Changes to this policy could have adverse tax consequences. Subject to
this policy, we manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among all of our
subsidiaries. Foreign cash balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund
ordinary business operations outside the U.S.

Sources and Uses of Cash

Cash generated by operating activities was $143.3 million for the year ended December 31,
2008, compared to $135.1 million for the same period in 2007. We historically have experienced
proportionally lower or net negative cash flows from operating activities during the first quarter
and proportionally higher or net positive cash flows from operating activities for the remainder of
the year and for the annual period. Several factors contribute to the seasonal fluctuations in cash
flows generated by operating activities, including the following:

of the following year. Additionally, we would deposit our
first quarter estimated tax payment for the current fiscal year at the same time. In
the current year we paid our final income tax payment for 2007 in the first quarter of
2008. However, we did not make our first quarter estimated payment related to 2008
until the second quarter of 2008. Additionally, due to changes in federal tax law in
2008, we paid substantially all of our final payment related to 2008 in the fourth
quarter of 2008. As a result, prior to 2008, tax payments were higher in the first
quarter of each year. We believe the timing of cash payments for taxes will be more
evenly distributed in future periods.

•

We have management and non-management employee incentive programs that provide for
the payment of annual bonuses in the first quarter following the year for which the
bonuses were earned.

•

We have agreements with certain suppliers that require us to make minimum annual
inventory purchases, in some cases in order to retain exclusive distribution rights,
and we have other agreements with suppliers that provide for lower pricing based on
annual purchase volumes. We may place a higher volume of purchase orders for inventory
during the fourth quarter in order to meet our minimum commitments or realize volume
pricing discounts and we receive that inventory in the fourth or first quarters and pay
in the first quarter. The specific facts and circumstances that we consider in
determining the timing and level of inventory purchases throughout the year related to
these agreements may yield inconsistent cash flows from operations, most typically in
the first and fourth quarters.

Net income for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased $22.2 million to $116.2 million from
$94.0 million for the prior year. The total of net income and net non-cash charges was $176.8
million for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared to $136.1 million for the same period in
2007, resulting in a year-to-year increase of $40.7 million. The increase is due to an additional
$12.0 million in net income as adjusted for the write down of Navigator

®

inventory and
the associated royalty license impairment and noncash items of $28.7 million. The changes in
noncash adjustments are primarily due to an increase in our provision for deferred income taxes of
$14.7 million and an increase in depreciation and amortization expense of $7.7 million for the year
ended December 31,
2008 as compared to 2007. The increase in the provision for deferred income taxes is primarily
due to the 2007 deferral of a tax deduction for the write-down of Navigator

®

inventory
until 2008 and bonus depreciation taken for tax purposes in the current year. The increase in
depreciation and amortization expense is primarily due to incremental spending on computer hardware
at the end of 2007. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual
Report on Form 10-K for additional information about the Navigator

®

inventory
write-down.



During the twelve months ended December 31, 2008, cash decreased by $33.5 million due to
changes in operating assets and liabilities, compared to a decrease in the same period of 2007 of
$1.0 million, resulting in incremental cash used of $32.5 million. The increase in cash used by
changes in operating assets and liabilities, compared to 2007, was primarily attributable to $36.2
million incremental cash used to pay down accounts payable and accrued expenses and $13.2 million
incremental cash used by changes in inventory, partly offset by $15.3 million less cash used by
changes in accounts receivable. The incremental cash used to reduce accrued expenses was due to
greater relative reductions in employee-related liabilities including management incentive bonuses
and the timing of estimated tax payments caused by changes in federal estimated payment rules that
became effective in the current year. The incremental cash used by changes in inventory was due
primarily to increases in certain instrument inventory, including the Catalyst Dx™ Chemistry
Analyzer and the SNAPshot Dx

®

Analyzer, resulting from the launch of the instruments in
the first quarter of 2008. The incremental cash provided by decreases in accounts receivable was
due to slower sales growth during the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the same period of
the prior year.

Cash used by investing activities was $91.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2008,
compared to cash used of $121.1 million for the same period of 2007. The decrease in cash used by
investing activities for 2008, compared to 2007, was largely due to $81.2 million less cash used
for business acquisitions and intangible assets, which are described below, partly offset by
incremental purchases of property and equipment of $24.1 million and $35.0 million less cash
provided by the sale of investments.

We paid $6.8 million in cash to acquire a business and, under separate transactions, to
acquire certain intangible assets that did not comprise businesses during the year ended December
31, 2008 and recognized liabilities of $0.3 million, of which $0.1 million was paid in 2008. See
Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for
additional information about our acquisitions of businesses.

We paid $89.2 million to purchase fixed assets during the year ended December 31, 2008. Our
total capital expenditures for 2008 included $38.9 million towards the renovation and expansion of
our primary facility in Westbrook, Maine, which included $1.0 million in capitalized interest. We
preliminarily project additional capital spending of approximately $35 million during 2009 through
2011 to complete this project, with approximately $16 million of the projected spending expected in
2009.

In January 2007, we entered into an unsecured short-term revolving credit facility with a bank
in the principal amount of $125.0 million that matured on June 30, 2007. On March 30, 2007, we
refinanced this short-term facility by entering into an unsecured revolving credit facility with
four multinational banks that matures on March 30, 2012 (the “Credit Facility”). In February 2008,
we increased the aggregate principal amount available under our Credit Facility to $200.0 million
and added a fifth bank to the syndication. The Credit Facility may be used for general corporate
purposes, including repurchases of our common stock and business acquisitions. The applicable
interest rates generally range from 0.375% to 0.875% above the London interbank offered rate (the
“LIBOR”) or the Canadian Dollar-denominated bankers’ acceptance rate (the “CDOR”), dependent on our
leverage ratio. Under the Credit Facility, we pay quarterly commitment fees of 0.08% to 0.20%,
dependent on our leverage ratio, on any unused commitment. The Credit Facility contains financial
and other affirmative and negative covenants, as well as customary events of default, that would
allow any amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility to be accelerated, or restrict our ability
to borrow thereunder, in the event of noncompliance. The financial covenant requires our ratio of
debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as defined by the
agreement, not to exceed 3-to-1. At December 31, 2008, our ratio of debt to earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization was less than 1-to-1. At December 31, 2008, we had
$150.6 million outstanding under the Credit Facility at a weighted-average interest rate of 2.3%.
At December 31, 2007, we had $72.2 million outstanding under the Credit Facility at a
weighted-average interest rate of 5.4%. Our availability under the Credit Facility was further
reduced at December 31, 2008 by $0.6 million for a letter of credit issued related to our
workers’ compensation policy which commenced January 1, 2009. Of the total amount outstanding
at December 31, 2008 and 2007, $6.6 million and $5.1 million, respectively, was borrowed by our
Canadian subsidiary and denominated in Canadian dollars.



The board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to 40,000,000 shares of our common
stock in the open market or in negotiated transactions. From the inception of the program in August
1999 to December 31, 2008, we repurchased 35,787,000 shares. Cash used to repurchase shares during
the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $132.3 million and $118.4 million, respectively. We
believe that the repurchase of our common stock is a favorable investment and we also repurchase to
offset the dilutive effect of our employee share-based compensation programs. Repurchases of our
common stock may vary depending upon the level of other investing activities and the share price.
See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K
for additional information about our share repurchases.

Other Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees

Under our workers’ compensation insurance policies for U.S. employees since January 1, 2003,
we have retained the first $250,000 in claim liability per incident and aggregate claim liability
based on payroll for each year. The insurance company provides insurance for claims above the
individual occurrence and aggregate limits. We estimate claim liability based on claims incurred
and the estimated ultimate cost to settle the claims. Based on this analysis, we have recognized
expenses of $0.7 million, $0.3 million, $0.9 million, $0.5 million, $0.9 million, and $0.8 million
for claims incurred during the years ended December 31, 2008 through 2003, respectively. Claims
incurred during the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 are relatively new and significant
additional healthcare and wage indemnification costs could arise from those claims. Our liability
for claims incurred during the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 could exceed our estimates
and we could be liable for up to $2.5 million and $0.9 million, respectively, in excess of the
expense we have recognized. For the four years ended on or prior to December 31, 2006, based on our
retained claim liability per incident and our aggregate claim liability, our maximum liability at
December 31, 2008 is $1.6 million in excess of the amounts deemed probable and previously
recognized. In connection with these policies, we have outstanding letters of credit totaling $2.0
million to the insurance companies as security for these claims. We also have $0.6 million of
outstanding letters of credit at December 31, 2008 related to our workers’ compensation policy,
which commenced on January 1, 2009.

We have commitments outstanding at December 31, 2008 for additional purchase price payments of
up to $7.7 million, of which $0.2 million has been accrued, in connection with acquisitions of
businesses and intangible assets during the current and prior periods, all of which are contingent
on the achievement by certain acquired businesses of specified milestones.

We are contractually obligated to make the following payments in the years below:

Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion on unrecognized tax benefits.



ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK

Our financial market risk consists primarily of foreign currency exchange rate risk and
interest rate risk. Our functional currency is the U.S. dollar and our primary manufacturing
operations are in the U.S., but we distribute our products worldwide both through direct export and
through our subsidiaries. Our primary foreign currency transaction risk consists of intercompany
sales of product and we attempt to mitigate this risk through our hedging program described below.
Our subsidiaries in 17 foreign countries use the local currency as their functional currency. For
the year ended December 31, 2008, 40% of our revenue was attributable to sales of products and
services to customers outside the U.S.

The primary purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to protect against the
volatility associated with foreign currency transactions. We also utilize some natural hedges to
mitigate our transaction and commitment exposures. Corporate policy prescribes the range of
allowable hedging activity. We enter into exchange contracts with large multinational financial
institutions and we do not hold or engage in transactions involving derivative instruments for
purposes other than risk management. Our accounting policies for these contracts are based on our
designation of such instruments as hedging transactions. Market gains and losses are deferred in
other current assets or accruals, as appropriate, until the contract matures, which is the period
when the related obligation is settled. We primarily utilize forward exchange contracts with
durations of less than 18 months.

Our subsidiaries enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to minimize the impact of
foreign currency fluctuations associated with their anticipated intercompany inventory purchases
for the next year. From time to time, we may also enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to
minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations associated with specific, significant
transactions.

We identify foreign currency exchange risk by regularly monitoring our transactions
denominated in foreign currencies. We attempt to mitigate currency risk by hedging the majority of
our cash flow on intercompany sales to minimize foreign currency exposure. Currency exposure on
large purchases of foreign currency denominated products are evaluated in our hedging program and
used as natural hedges to offset hedge requirements.

Our hedging strategy is consistent with prior periods and there were no material changes in
our market risk exposure during the year ended December 31, 2008. We enter into forward currency
exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges for amounts that are less than the full value of
forecasted intercompany sales and for amounts that are equivalent to, or less than, other specific,
significant transactions, thus no significant ineffectiveness has resulted or been recorded through
the statement of operations. Our hedging strategy related to intercompany inventory purchases
provides that we employ the full amount of our hedges for the succeeding year at the conclusion of
our budgeting process for that year, which is complete by the end of the preceding year. Quarterly,
we enter into contracts to hedge incremental portions of anticipated foreign currency transactions
for the following year. Accordingly, our risk with respect to foreign currency exchange rate
fluctuations may vary throughout each annual cycle.

We enter into hedge agreements where we believe we have meaningful exposure to foreign
currency exchange risk. The notional amount of foreign currency contracts to hedge forecasted
intercompany sales outstanding at December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $97.7 million and $122.1 million,
respectively. At December 31, 2008, we had $6.8 million in net unrealized gains on foreign exchange
contracts designated as hedges recorded in other comprehensive income, which is net of $3.1 million
in taxes.

Our foreign currency exchange risk at December 31, 2008 consisted of local currency revenues
and expenses, the impact of hedge contracts and balances denominated in a currency other than the
Company’s or our subsidiaries’ functional currencies. A 10% strengthening of the U.S. dollar
relative to foreign currencies, including the impact of hedge contracts currently in place, would
reduce operating income by approximately $7.2 million in 2009. A 10% weakening of the U.S. dollar
relative to foreign currencies would have the exact opposite impact of a 10% strengthening of the
U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies.

We are subject to interest rate risk to the extent that the LIBOR increases or the CDOR
increases. Borrowings under our Credit Facility bear interest in the range from 0.375% to 0.875%
above the LIBOR or the CDOR, dependent on our consolidated leverage ratio, and are outstanding from
one to six months. Borrowings
outstanding at December 31, 2008 were $150.6 million at a weighted-average interest rate of
2.3%. All borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2008 matured one month from the date of the
borrowing. An increase in the LIBOR or the CDOR of 1% would increase interest expense by
approximately $1.5 million.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

Not applicable.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and
procedures, as defined by the SEC in its Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 as amended (the “Exchange Act”). The term “disclosure controls and
procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and
other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by the company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms.
Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or
submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management,
including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no
matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their
objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit
relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure
controls and procedures at December 31, 2008, our chief executive officer and chief financial
officer have concluded that, at the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure
controls and procedures are effective to achieve their stated purpose.

Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. The Company’s
internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of
America and includes those policies and procedures that:

•

Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and
fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;

•

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and

•

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions
and that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.



We conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
based on the framework in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, we conclude that, at
December 31, 2008, our internal control over financial reporting was effective.

The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting at December 31,
2008 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting
firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules
13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the three months ended December 31, 2008
that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting.

over financial reporting of the Company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer are

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of IDEXX Laboratories, Inc

.:

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item
15(a)(1) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of IDEXX Laboratories,
Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the results of their operations and
their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2008 in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our
opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2)
presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in
conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s
management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the Report of Management on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express
opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits
in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal
control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the
financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our
audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed
risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in
which it accounts for uncertain tax positions and compensated absences in 2007.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

IDEXX LABORATORIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1. NATURE OF BUSINESS

We develop, manufacture and distribute products and provide services primarily for the
veterinary and the food and water testing markets. We also sell a line of portable electrolytes and
blood gas analyzers for the human point-of-care medical diagnostics market. During 2008, we
operated primarily through three business segments: products and services for the veterinary
market, which we refer to as our Companion Animal Group (“CAG”), water quality products (“Water”)
and products for production animal health, which we refer to as the Production Animal Segment
(“PAS”). We also operate two smaller segments that comprise products for dairy quality, which we
refer to as Dairy, and products for the human medical diagnostics market, which we refer to as OPTI
Medical. Financial information about the Dairy and OPTI Medical operating segments and other
activities are combined and presented in an “Other” category because they do not meet the
quantitative or qualitative thresholds for reportable segments. Our products and services are sold
worldwide. In addition, we maintain active research and development programs, some of which may
materialize into the development and introduction of new technology, products or services that do
not align with one of our existing business or service categories. In such situations, the related
financial impacts are shown in the Other category. See Note 17 for additional information regarding
our reportable operating segments, products and services, and geographical areas.

NOTE 2. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of IDEXX Laboratories,
Inc. and our wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries, and all other entities in which we have
a variable interest and are determined to be the primary beneficiary. All material intercompany
transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.

In connection with the restructuring of our pharmaceutical business at the end of 2008, as
discussed in Note 16, we realigned two of our remaining product lines to the Rapid Assay business
and we realigned the remainder of the business, which comprised one product line and two
out-licensing arrangements, to the Other segment. Segment information presented for the years ended
December 31, 2007 and 2006 has been restated to conform to our presentation of reportable segments
for the year ended December 31, 2008.

On October 25, 2007, our board of directors approved a two-for-one split of the outstanding
shares of our common stock, to be effected in the form of a 100% stock dividend. Each holder of
common stock of record at November 5, 2007 received one additional share of common stock. The
additional shares of common stock were distributed on November 26, 2007. As a result of the stock
split, the number of outstanding common shares doubled to approximately 61 million shares. 2006
share and per share data (except par value) have been adjusted to reflect the effect of the stock
split. In addition, the exercise of outstanding stock options and the vesting of other stock
awards, as well as the number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under our various
employee benefit plans, were proportionately increased in accordance with the terms of those
respective agreements and plans.

NOTE 3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

(a) Estimates

The preparation of these financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) requires us to make estimates and
judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and
related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these
estimates, including those related to bad debts; goodwill and other intangible assets; income
taxes; inventory; investments; revenue recognition, including customer programs and incentives,
product returns, and multiple element arrangements; share-based compensation; warranty reserves;
and contingencies. We accrue contingent liabilities when it is probable that future expenditures
will be made and such expenditures can reasonably be estimated. We base our estimates on historical
experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the
circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values
of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may
differ from these estimates.

F-7


(b) Inventories

Inventories include material, labor and overhead, and are stated at the lower of cost
(first-in, first-out) or market. We write down inventory for estimated obsolescence when warranted
by estimates of future demand, market conditions, and remaining shelf life. If actual market
conditions are less favorable than those we estimated, additional inventory write-downs may be
required, which would have a negative effect on results of operations.

(c) Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization.
When an item is sold or retired, the cost and related accumulated depreciation is relieved, and the
resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognized in the consolidated statement of income. We provide
for depreciation and amortization primarily using the straight-line method by charges to income in
amounts that allocate the cost of property and equipment over their estimated useful lives as
follows:

Estimated

Asset Classification

Useful Life

Land improvements

15 years

Buildings and improvements

15–40 years

Leasehold improvements

Shorter of life of lease or useful life

Machinery and equipment

3–5 years

Office furniture and equipment

3–7 years

Instruments placed with customers under certain minimum volume commitment programs are
capitalized and depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the instrument or the minimum
volume commitment period.

We capitalize interest in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (“SFAS”) No. 34, “Capitalization of Interest Cost”
(“SFAS No. 34”). Interest is capitalized on the acquisition and construction of significant assets
that require a substantial period of time to be made ready for use. The capitalized interest is
included in the cost of the completed asset and depreciated over the asset’s estimated useful life.
In 2007, we began the renovation and expansion of our primary facility in Westbrook, Maine. During
the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 we capitalized $1.0 million and $0.3 million,
respectively, of interest expense related to this project. For periods prior to 2007, there were no
acquisitions or construction of significant assets that required a substantial period of time to be
made ready for use, and therefore no capitalized interest was recorded.

We account for costs incurred to develop computer software for internal use in accordance with
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position (“SOP”) 98-1, “Accounting
for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use” (“SOP 98-1”). SOP 98-1
requires the capitalization of certain costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining
software designated for internal use based on three distinct stages of development. Qualifying
costs incurred during the application development stage, which consist primarily of internal
payroll, direct fringe benefits and external direct project costs, including labor and travel, are
capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset.
Costs incurred during the preliminary project and post-implementation and operation phases are
expensed as incurred. These costs are general and administrative in nature and relate primarily to
data conversion, the determination of performance requirements and training. During the year ended
December 31, 2008 and 2007 we capitalized $7.3 million and $3.1 million, respectively, in costs
related to computer software developed for internal use.

(d) Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

A significant portion of the purchase price for acquired businesses is assigned to intangible
assets. Intangible assets other than goodwill are initially valued at the lesser of fair value or,
if applicable, fair value proportionately reduced by the excess of the fair value of acquired net
assets over the purchase price (collectively, “fair value”) of the acquired business. If a market
value is not readily available, the fair value of the intangible asset is estimated based on
discounted cash flows using market participant assumptions, which are assumptions that are not
specific to IDEXX. The selection of appropriate valuation methodologies and the estimation of
discounted cash flows require significant assumptions about the timing and amounts of future cash
flows, risks, appropriate discount rates, and the useful lives of intangible assets. When deemed
appropriate by management, we utilize independent
valuation experts to advise and assist us in allocating the purchase prices for acquired
businesses to the fair values of the identified intangible assets and in determining appropriate
amortization methods and periods for those intangible assets. Goodwill is initially valued based on
the excess of the purchase price of a business combination over the fair values of acquired net
assets.

F-8


We provide for amortization using the straight-line and accelerated methods by charges to
income in amounts that allocate the intangible assets over their estimated useful lives as follows:

Estimated

Asset Classification

Useful Life

Patents

8–15 years

Other product rights

2–15 years

Customer-related intangible assets

2–15 years

Other, primarily noncompete agreements

2–10 years

We assess goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or
circumstances indicate an impairment may exist, in accordance with SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets” (“SFAS No. 142”). For impairment testing, the fair values of the reporting
units that include goodwill are estimated using a discounted cash flow approach. The cash flows
used contain our best estimates, using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the
time. Changes in forecast cash flows or the discount rate would affect the estimated fair values of
reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period. No impairments
were identified as a result of the annual or event-driven reviews during the years ended December
31, 2008, 2007 or 2006.

We assess the realizability of intangible assets other than goodwill whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with
SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” If an impairment
review is triggered, we evaluate the carrying value of intangible assets based on estimated
undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the assets and comparing that
value to the carrying value of the assets. The cash flows that are used contain our best estimates,
using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time. No impairments were
identified during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 or 2006 except as discussed in

Note 8.

(e) Warranty Reserves

We provide for the estimated cost of instrument warranties in cost of product revenue at the
time revenue is recognized based on the estimated cost to repair the instrument over its warranty
period. Cost of revenue reflects not only estimated warranty expense for the systems sold in the
current period, but also any changes in estimated warranty expense for the installed base that
results from our quarterly evaluation of service experience. Our actual warranty obligation is
affected by instrument performance in the customer’s environment and associated costs incurred in
servicing instruments. Should actual service rates or costs differ from our estimates, which are
based on historical data and projections of future costs, revisions to the estimated warranty
liability would be required. Following is a summary of changes in accrued warranty reserve for
products sold to customers for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007

(f) Income Taxes

We account for income taxes under SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes” (“SFAS No.
109”). This statement requires that we recognize a current tax liability or asset for current taxes
payable or refundable,
respectively, and a deferred tax liability or asset, as the case may be, for the estimated
future tax effects of temporary differences between book and tax treatment of assets and
liabilities and carryforwards to the extent they are realizable. We record a valuation allowance to
reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. While we
consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in
assessing the need for a valuation allowance, in the event we were to determine that we would be
able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, a
reduction of the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was
made. Likewise, should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net
deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to
income in the period such determination was made.

We adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (“FIN”) No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty
in Income Taxes” (“FIN 48”) as of January 1, 2007. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty
in income taxes recognized in financial statements under SFAS No. 109 and prescribes a
comprehensive model for the recognition, measurement, and financial statement disclosure of
uncertain tax positions. Unrecognized tax benefits are the differences between tax positions taken,
or expected to be taken, in tax returns, and the benefits recognized for accounting purposes
pursuant to FIN 48.

Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and
our income tax filings are regularly under audit by tax authorities. Any audit result differing
from amounts recorded in accordance with FIN 48 would increase or decrease income in the period
that we determine such adjustment is likely. Interest expense and penalties associated with the
underpayment of income taxes are included in income tax expense. See Note 10 for additional
information regarding income taxes.

(g) Sales and Value Added Taxes

We calculate, collect from our customers, and remit to governmental authorities sales, value
added and excise taxes assessed by governmental authorities in connection with revenue-producing
transactions with our customers. We report these taxes on a net basis and do not include these tax
amounts in revenue or cost of revenue.

(h) Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenue when four criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence that an arrangement
exists, (ii) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, (iii) the sales price is fixed
or determinable, and (iv) collectibility is reasonably assured. Revenue-generating transactions
generally fall into one of the following categories of revenue recognition:

•

We recognize revenue at the time of shipment to U.S. distributors for substantially
all products sold through distributors as title and risk of loss pass to these
customers on delivery to the common carrier. Our distributors do not have the right to
return products. We recognize revenue for the remainder of our customers when the
product is delivered to the customer except as noted below.

•

We recognize revenue from the sales of instruments, noncancelable software licenses
and hardware systems upon installation (and completion of training if applicable) and
the customer’s acceptance of the instrument or system because at this time we have no
significant further obligations.

•

We recognize service revenue at the time the service is performed.

•

We recognize revenue associated with extended maintenance agreements over the life
of the contracts using the straight-line method, which approximates the expected timing
in which applicable services are performed. Amounts collected in advance of revenue
recognition are recorded as a current or long-term liability based on the time from the
balance sheet date to the future date of revenue recognition.

•

We recognize revenue on certain instrument systems under rental programs over the
life of the rental agreement using the straight-line method. Amounts collected in
advance of revenue recognition are recorded as a current or long-term liability based
on the time from the balance sheet date to the future date of revenue recognition.

•

We recognize revenue on certain instruments and practice information management
systems sales, where the product includes software that is considered more than
incidental to the utility and value of
the product, either by allocating the revenue to each element of the sale based on
relative fair values of the elements including post-contract support when fair value for
all elements is available or by use of the residual method when only the fair value of
the post-contract support is available. We recognize revenue for the instrument or
system on installation and customer acceptance and recognize revenue equal to the fair
value of the post-contract support over the support period.

•

Shipping costs reimbursed by the customer are included in revenue.

F-10


Multiple element arrangements

. When multiple products and/or services are sold
together, we generally allocate the total consideration received amongst the elements based on
their relative fair values, which is determined by amounts charged separately for the delivered and
undelivered elements to other customers. When there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair
value of the undelivered elements but no such evidence for the delivered elements, the fair value
of the undelivered elements is deferred and the residual revenue is allocated to the delivered
elements. The delivered elements are recognized as revenue when appropriate under the policies
described above. If there is not sufficient evidence of the fair value of the undelivered elements,
no revenue is allocated to the delivered elements and the total consideration received is deferred
until delivery of those elements for which objective and reliable evidence of the fair value is not
available.

Customer programs

. We record estimated reductions to revenue in connection with
customer marketing programs and incentive offerings that may give customers credits or award
points. Award points granted under our IDEXX Points program may be applied to trade receivables
owed to us and/or toward future purchases of our products or services. We establish accruals for
estimated revenue reductions attributable to customer programs and incentive offerings for each
program. Revenue reductions are recorded quarterly based on issuance of credits, points earned but
not yet issued, and estimates of credits and points to be earned in the future based on current
revenue. As points are redeemed we recognize the benefit of points expected to expire, or breakage,
using historical forfeiture rates. On November 30 of each year, unused points granted before
January 1 of the prior year expire and any variance from the breakage estimate is accounted for as
a change in estimate. Within our overall IDEXX Points program, our two most significant customer
programs are Practice Developer

®

and SNAP

®

up the Savings™ (“SUTS”), both of
which are offered only to North American customers. Our Practice Developer

®

program is a
CAG awards program that permits customers to earn points by purchasing quarterly minimums in
certain product and service categories, including IDEXX Reference Laboratories services, Catalyst
Dx™ and
VetTest

®

slides, VetTest

®

SNAP

®

Reader reagents,
LaserCyte

®

and VetAutoread™ tubes, Feline and Canine SNAP

®

tests, and service
and maintenance agreements. Points may then be applied against the purchase price for IDEXX
products and services purchased in the future or applied to trade receivables due to us. SUTS is
our volume incentive program for selected SNAP

®

tests that provides customers with
benefits in the form of (1) discounts off invoice at the time of purchase and (2) points under the
IDEXX Points program awarded quarterly throughout the SUTS program year (which ends on August 31)
based on total purchase volume of qualified
SNAP

®

products during the year. For the
Practice Developer

®

program, the accrued revenue reduction is calculated each quarter
based on sales to end users during the quarter by either us or our distributors and on our estimate
of future points to be issued upon sale of applicable product inventories held by distributors at
the end of the quarter.

Doubtful accounts receivable

. We recognize revenue only in those situations where
collection from the customer is reasonably assured. We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts
for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. We
base our estimates on detailed analysis of specific customer situations and a percentage of our
accounts receivable by aging category. If the financial condition of our customers were to
deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances
might be required. Account balances are charged off against the allowance when we believe the
receivable will not be recovered.

(i) Research and Development Costs

Research and development costs, which consist of salaries, employee benefits, materials and
consulting costs, are expensed as incurred. In accordance with SFAS No. 86, “Accounting for the
Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed,” we evaluate
our software research and development costs for capitalization after the technological feasibility
of software and products containing software has been established.

F-11


(j) Advertising Costs

Advertising costs, which are recognized as sales and marketing expense in the period in which
they are incurred, were $1.4 million, $1.9 million and $1.5 million for the years ended December
31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

(k) Share-Based Compensation

We account for share-based compensation in accordance with SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based
Payment” (“SFAS 123(R)”), which is a revision of SFAS No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation” and SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation—Transition and
Disclosure—An Amendment of FASB No. 123” (collectively, “SFAS No. 123, as Amended”) and supersedes
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.” SFAS 123(R)
requires all share-based compensation to employees, including grants of stock options, to be valued
at fair value on the date of grant, and to be expensed over the requisite service period (generally
the vesting period).

We adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R) on January 1, 2006 and elected the modified
prospective method of transition to the fair-value-based method of accounting for share-based
employee compensation prescribed by SFAS No. 123(R). Effective January 1, 2006, under the modified
prospective method, share-based compensation expense includes expense for unvested awards at
December 31, 2005 and all awards granted subsequent to December 31, 2005. Share-based compensation
expense for the unvested awards outstanding at December 31, 2005 is based on the grant-date fair
value previously calculated in developing the pro forma disclosures in accordance with the
provisions of SFAS No. 123, as Amended. The graded vesting, or accelerated, method has been used to
record the expense for stock options granted prior to January 1, 2006. The straight-line method is
used to record the expense for stock options and awards granted subsequent to December 31, 2005.

Our share-based employee compensation programs allow for the grant of a mix of restricted
stock units and stock options, along with employee stock purchase rights. In addition, our Director
Deferred Compensation Plan and our Executive Deferred Compensation Plan allow for the grant of
deferred stock units, which may or may not have vesting conditions depending on the plan under
which these deferred stock units were issued. See Note 5 for additional information. There were no
modifications to the terms of outstanding options, restricted stock units or deferred stock units
during 2008, 2007 or 2006.

We issue new shares of common stock to satisfy option and employee stock purchase right
exercises and to settle restricted stock units and deferred stock units.

(l) Foreign Currency Translation

The functional currency of most of our subsidiaries is their local currency. Assets and
liabilities of these foreign subsidiaries are translated using the exchange rate in effect at the
balance sheet date. Revenue and expense accounts are translated using the exchange rate at which
those elements are recognized and where it is impractical to do so, a weighted average of exchange
rates in effect during the period is used to translate those elements. Cumulative translation gains
and losses are shown in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as a separate component of
accumulated other comprehensive income. For one of our subsidiaries located in the Netherlands, the
functional currency is the U.S. Dollar. Monetary assets and liabilities for this entity are
remeasured using the current exchange rate at the balance sheet date; revenues and expenses are
recorded at the current exchange rate when the transaction is recognized. The impact of
remeasurement is included in the statement of operations. Exchange gains and losses arising from
transactions denominated in foreign currencies other than our subsidiaries’ respective functional
currencies are included in operating expenses. Included in general and administrative expenses are
aggregate foreign exchange currency transaction gains of $0.1 million, $0.2 million, and $0.8
million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

F-12


(m) Derivative Instruments and Hedging

We follow SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” as
amended by SFAS No. 137, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities—Deferral of
the Effective Date of SFAS No. 133” and SFAS No. 138, “Accounting for Certain Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities—An
Amendment of SFAS No. 133” (“SFAS No. 133, as Amended”). SFAS No. 133, as Amended requires
that all derivatives, including forward currency exchange contracts, be recognized on the balance
sheet at fair value. Derivatives that are not hedges must be recorded at fair value through
earnings. If a derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair
value of the derivative are either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged item
through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in
earnings. We immediately record in earnings the extent to which a hedge is not effective in
achieving offsetting changes in fair value.

The primary purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to protect against the
volatility associated with foreign currency transactions. We also utilize some natural hedges to
mitigate our transaction and commitment exposures. Corporate policy prescribes the range of
allowable hedging activity. We enter into exchange contracts with large multinational financial
institutions and we do not hold or engage in transactions involving derivative instruments for
purposes other than risk management. Our accounting policies for these contracts are based on our
designation of such instruments as hedging transactions. Market gains and losses are deferred in
other current assets or accruals, as appropriate, until the contract matures, which is the period
when the related obligation is settled. We primarily utilize forward exchange contracts with
durations of less than 18 months.

Our subsidiaries enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to minimize the impact of
foreign currency fluctuations associated with their anticipated intercompany inventory purchases
for the next year. From time to time, we may also enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to
minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations associated with specific, significant
transactions.

We enter into currency exchange contracts for amounts that are less than the full value of
forecasted intercompany sales and for amounts that are equivalent to, or less than, other specific,
significant transactions. Our hedging strategy related to intercompany inventory purchases provides
that we employ the full amount of our hedges for the succeeding year at the conclusion of our
budgeting process for that year, which is complete by the end of the preceding year. Quarterly, we
enter into contracts to hedge incremental portions of anticipated foreign currency transactions for
the following year. Accordingly, our risk with respect to foreign currency exchange rate
fluctuations may vary throughout each annual cycle.

In addition to hedges for anticipated 2008 intercompany inventory purchases, we had a foreign
currency exchange contract outstanding at December 31, 2007 to hedge the repayment by our Canadian
subsidiary of an intercompany loan denominated in Canadian dollars that the subsidiary used to fund
the acquisitions of veterinary reference laboratory businesses, which had a U.S dollar equivalent
of $32.1 million at December 31, 2007.

At December 31, 2008, we recorded $8.1 million in unrealized gains through accumulated other
comprehensive income, which is net of $3.6 million in taxes, from foreign exchange contracts with
2009 expiration dates. At December 31, 2007, we recorded less than $0.1 million in unrealized
losses through accumulated other comprehensive income, which is net of less than $0.1 million in
taxes, from foreign exchange contracts with 2008 expiration dates.

Gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts intended as hedges for intercompany sales of
goods are recorded in cost of product revenue. Included in cost of product revenue are foreign
exchange gains of $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 and foreign exchange losses of
$5.7 million, and $2.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

(n) Disclosure of Fair Value of Financial Instruments and Concentration of Risk

Financial instruments consist mainly of cash and cash equivalents, investments, accounts
receivable, derivative instruments, accounts payable, lines of credit, and notes payable. Financial
instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are principally cash, cash
equivalents, investments and accounts receivable. We place our investments in highly-rated
financial institutions and money market funds invested in government securities. Concentration of
credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is limited to certain customers to whom we make
substantial sales. To reduce risk, we routinely assess the financial strength of our customers and
closely monitor their amounts due to us and, as a consequence, believe that our accounts receivable
credit risk exposure is limited. We maintain an allowance for potential credit losses, but
historically have not experienced any significant credit losses related to an individual customer
or group of customers in any particular industry or geographic area. The carrying amounts of our
financial instruments, other than long-term debt, approximate fair market value because of the
short maturity of those instruments. The carrying amount of our long-term debt approximates fair
market value based on current market prices for similar debt issues with similar remaining
maturities. See Note 17 for further discussion of concentration of credit risk of accounts
receivable, Note 9 for discussion of interest rate risk regarding our revolving credit facility,
and Note 18 for discussion of fair value measurements.

We currently purchase many products and materials from single sources or a limited number of
sources. Some of the products that we purchase from these sources are proprietary, and, therefore,
cannot be readily or easily replaced by alternative sources. If we are unable to obtain adequate
quantities of these products in the future, we could face cost increases or reductions, or delays
or discontinuations in product shipments, which could have a material adverse effect on our results
of operations.

(o) Comprehensive Income

SFAS No. 130, “Reporting Comprehensive Income,” requires us to report all changes in equity
during a period resulting from net income and transactions or other events and circumstances from
non-owner sources in a financial statement for the period in which they are recognized. We have
chosen to disclose comprehensive income, which encompasses net income, foreign currency translation
adjustments and the difference between the cost and the fair market value of investments in debt
and equity securities and foreign exchange contracts, in the consolidated statement of
stockholders’ equity. We consider the foreign currency cumulative translation adjustment to be
permanently invested and, therefore, have not provided income taxes on those amounts.

(p) Changes in Accounting Principles

We adopted the provisions of Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) consensus on Issue 06-2,
“Accounting for Sabbatical Leave and Other Similar Benefits Pursuant to FASB Statement No. 43,
Accounting for Compensated Absences” (“EITF 06-2”) and FIN 48, as of January 1, 2007. EITF 06-2
requires that the costs associated with unrestricted sabbaticals and other similar benefit
arrangements be recognized over the service period during which the employee earns the benefit. We
provide an additional four weeks of compensated leave to all U.S. salaried employees in their tenth
anniversary year of employment and again at each fifth year thereafter. As a result of adopting the
provisions of EITF 06-2, we recognized an increase in assets of $1.2 million, an increase in
liabilities of $3.0 million, and a decrease in retained earnings of $1.8 million at January 1,
2007. Beginning in 2007, we recognize estimated costs for estimated future compensated leave
benefits as they are earned. See Note 10 for a discussion of our adoption of FIN 48.

(q) Recent Accounting Pronouncements

We adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (“SFAS No. 157”) on
January 1, 2008. As permitted by FASB Staff Position (“FSP”) No. SFAS 157-2, “Effective Date of
FASB Statement No. 157” (“FSP No. SFAS 157-2”), we elected to defer the adoption of SFAS No. 157
for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those that are recognized or
disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis, until January 1, 2009.
SFAS No. 157 establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands financial statement
disclosures about fair value measurements. There was no cumulative effect of adoption related to
SFAS No. 157 and the adoption did not have an impact on our financial position, results of
operations, or cash flows. We are studying SFAS No. 157 with respect to nonfinancial assets and
nonfinancial liabilities falling under the scope of FSP No. SFAS 157-2. We do not expect that the
adoption of SFAS No. 157 with respect to these nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities
will have an impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. See Note 18
for a discussion of our adoption of SFAS No. 157.

We adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and
Financial Liabilities, including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115” (“SFAS No. 159”) on
January 1, 2008. SFAS No. 159 permits entities to choose, at specified election dates, to measure
eligible items at fair value (the “fair value option”). Under this pronouncement, a business entity
must report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected
in earnings at each subsequent reporting period. We have not elected the fair value option for any
items on our balance sheet.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), “Business Combinations” (“SFAS No. 141(R)”)
which revised SFAS No. 141, “Business Combinations” (“SFAS No. 141”). SFAS No. 141(R) establishes
principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements
the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, any noncontrolling interest in the
acquiree and the goodwill acquired. SFAS No. 141(R) also establishes disclosure requirements,
which will enable users to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination.
This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. As the provisions of
SFAS No. 141(R) are applied prospectively, the impact of this standard cannot be determined until
the transactions occur.

F-15


In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated
Financial Statements” (“SFAS No. 160”). SFAS No. 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards
for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent, the amount of
consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest, changes in a
parent’s ownership interest and the valuation of retained noncontrolling equity investments when a
subsidiary is deconsolidated. SFAS No. 160 also establishes reporting requirements that provide
sufficient disclosures that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent
and the interests of the noncontrolling owners. This standard is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2008. The adoption of SFAS No. 160 will not have an effect on our
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities — an amendment of SFAS No. 133” (“SFAS No. 161”). SFAS No. 161 changes the
disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities. This standard requires
enhanced disclosures about how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, how instruments are
accounted for under SFAS No. 133, and how derivatives and hedging activities affect an entity’s
financial position, financial performance and cash flows. This standard is effective for fiscal
years beginning after November 15, 2008. The adoption of SFAS No. 161 will not have an impact on
our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

In April 2008, the FASB issued FSP FAS 142-3, “Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible
Assets” (“FSP FAS No. 142-3”). FSP FAS No. 142-3 amends SFAS No. 142 to improve the consistency between the
useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS No. 142 and the period of expected cash
flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under SFAS No. 141 and other U.S. GAAP. This FSP
is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The guidance for determining the
useful life of a recognized intangible asset is to be applied prospectively, therefore, the impact
of the implementation of this pronouncement cannot be determined until the transactions occur.

NOTE 4. ACQUISITION OF BUSINESSES AND OTHER ASSETS

We paid $6.8 million in cash to acquire a business and, under separate transactions, to
acquire certain intangible assets that did not comprise businesses during the year ended December
31, 2008 and recognized liabilities of $0.3 million, of which $0.1 million was paid in 2008. In
addition, we have agreed to pay up to $7.7 million in cash in the future upon achievement of
certain revenue and other milestones, of which $7.5 million will be accrued and recorded as
additional intangible assets if and when we determine that it is probable that the milestones will
be achieved.

More specifically, in January 2008, we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed
certain liabilities of VetLab Laboratorio Veterinario de Referencia, S.L. (“VetLab S.L.”). With
operations in Barcelona, Spain, VetLab S.L. is a provider of reference laboratory testing services
to veterinarians. During the year ended December 31, 2008 we also acquired certain intellectual
property and distribution rights associated with a diagnostic test product. We also made purchase
price payments of $1.7 million related to the achievement of milestones realized by certain
businesses acquired in prior years, of which $1.5 million was previously accrued. In connection
with these acquisitions, we recognized goodwill of $0.4 million and amortizable intangible assets
of $6.4 million.

We paid $86.6 million and recognized liabilities, including contingent liabilities and
deferred tax liabilities associated with purchase accounting, of $17.9 million to acquire
businesses and certain intangible assets that did not comprise businesses during the year ended
December 31, 2007. In January 2007, we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain
liabilities of the Critical Care Division of Osmetech plc. The acquired business is based in the
United States and develops, designs, manufactures, and distributes point-of-care electrolyte and
blood gas analyzers and related consumable products for the
human medical and veterinary diagnostics markets. In March 2007, we acquired all of the equity
of Vita-Tech Canada Inc. (“Vita-Tech”) and Institut Pourquier SAS (“Pourquier”) in separate
transactions. Vita-Tech is the largest provider of reference laboratory testing services to
veterinarians in Canada and has operations in Toronto and Montreal, Canada. Pourquier is based in
Montpellier, France and develops, designs, manufactures, and distributes production animal
diagnostic products. In March and October 2007, we acquired veterinary reference laboratories
located in the United States. We also acquired certain assets of other veterinary reference
laboratories during the year ended December 31, 2007 that did not comprise businesses. In
connection with the 2007 acquisitions, we recognized goodwill of $45.2 million and amortizable
intangible assets of $38.9 million. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we also made purchase
price payments of $3.2 million related to the achievement of milestones by certain businesses
acquired in prior years.

F-16


We paid $23.9 million and recognized liabilities, including contingent liabilities and
deferred tax liabilities associated with purchase accounting, of $4.6 million to acquire businesses
and certain intangible assets that did not comprise businesses during the year ended December 31,
2006. The 2006 acquisitions included veterinary reference laboratories in the United States, Canada
and South Africa; a veterinary practice information management software business based in the
United States; and certain intellectual property and distribution rights from a diagnostics company
based in Australia. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we recognized incremental amortizable
intangible assets of $0.3 million in connection with the finalization of purchase price allocations
for certain 2006 acquisitions. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we revised the purchase
price allocations related to certain businesses acquired during the year ended December 31, 2006.
The revisions to the purchase price allocations resulted in a decrease in goodwill assigned to the
Companion Animal Group (“CAG”) segment of $0.8 million and a corresponding increase in property,
equipment and other intangible assets. In connection with these acquisitions, we recognized
goodwill of $11.0 million and amortizable intangible assets of $13.3 million.

We believe that the acquired businesses enhance our existing businesses by either expanding
the geographic range of our existing businesses or expanding our existing product lines. We
determined the purchase price of each acquired business based on our assessment of estimated future
cash flows attributable to the business enterprise taken as a whole, the strength of the business
in the marketplace, the strategic importance of the acquisition to IDEXX, and the seller’s desire
to be acquired by IDEXX versus perceived alternatives. We recognized goodwill based on the excess
of the purchase price for each business over the fair values of the individual tangible and
separately identified intangible assets acquired, which were valued in accordance with SFAS No.
141.

The results of operations of the acquired businesses have been included since their respective
acquisition dates. Pro forma information has not been presented because such information is not
material to the financial statements taken as a whole.

For the year ended December 31, 2008, share-based compensation expense included $9.7 million
for options, restricted stock units and deferred stock units with vesting conditions and $0.6
million for employee stock purchase rights. For the year ended December 31, 2007, share-based
compensation expense included $8.1 million for options, restricted stock units and deferred stock
units with vesting conditions and $0.5 million for employee stock purchase rights. For the year
ended December 31, 2006, share-based compensation expense included $10.3 million for options,
restricted stock units and deferred stock units with vesting conditions and $0.4 million for
employee stock purchase rights. Expense for deferred stock units issued under our Director Deferred
Compensation Plan and our Executive Deferred Compensation Plan that do not have vesting conditions
of $0.5 million, $0.4 million and $0.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and
2006, respectively, has been excluded from share-based compensation in the table above as it
relates to deferred stock units granted in lieu of cash compensation. Share-based compensation
expense was not affected by the two-for-one split of the outstanding shares of our common stock as
discussed in Note 2.

F-17


Additionally, share-based compensation expense is reduced for an estimate of the number of
awards that are expected to be forfeited. We use historical data and other factors to estimate
employee termination behavior and to evaluate whether particular groups of employees have
significantly different forfeiture behaviors.

Share-based compensation costs are classified in cost of revenue and operating expenses
consistently with the classification of cash compensation paid to the employees receiving such
share-based compensation. Capitalized share-based employee compensation cost was $0.4 million, $0.4
million and $0.2 million at December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, which was included in
inventory on the consolidated balance sheets.

The fair value of options, restricted stock units, deferred stock units with vesting
conditions, and employee stock purchase rights awarded during the years ended December 31, 2008,
2007 and 2006 totaled $18.7 million, $18.2 million and $11.9 million, respectively. The total
unrecognized compensation cost for unvested share-based compensation awards outstanding at December
31, 2008, before consideration of estimated forfeitures, was $30.9 million. We estimate that this
cost will be reduced by approximately $3.1 million related to forfeitures. The weighted average
remaining expense recognition period is approximately 2 years.

Stock Incentive Plan

During 2003, our board of directors approved the 2003 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended (the
“2003 Stock Plan”) pursuant to which our employees and directors may receive various types of
share-based incentives, including stock options, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights
and deferred stock units. Any shares that are subject to awards of options or stock appreciation
rights will be counted against the share limit as one share for every share granted. Any shares
that are subject to other awards, such as restricted stock, will be counted against the share limit
as 2.1 shares for every share granted. A total of 6,300,000 shares of common stock are authorized
for issuance under the 2003 Stock Plan, provided that no more than 6,300,000 shares will be
available for the grant of incentive stock options, and no more than 1,200,000 shares will be
available for awards other than stock options and stock appreciation rights (such as restricted
stock). In addition, if any options granted under our prior plans, including the 1991 Stock Option
Plan, the 1998 Stock Incentive Plan or the 2000 Director Option Plan, terminate, expire or are
forfeited without having been exercised in full, the shares subject to such unexercised options are
available for issuance under the 2003 Stock Plan. Options granted under the 2003 Stock Plan and
prior plans may not be granted at an exercise price less than the fair market value of the common
stock on the date granted (or less than 110% of the fair market value in the case of incentive
stock options granted to holders of more than 10% of our Common Stock). Options may not be granted
for a term of more than ten years. The vesting schedule of all options granted under the 2003 Stock
Plan is determined by the compensation committee of our board of directors at the time of grant. At
December 31, 2008, a remaining total of 2,662,000 shares of common stock was authorized by our
shareholders and available for future grants of share-based compensation.

F-18


Options

Option awards are granted to employees with an exercise price equal to not less than the
closing market price of our common stock at the date of grant and generally vest ratably over five
years on each anniversary of the date of grant, conditional on continuous service. Options granted
to non-employee directors vest fully on the first anniversary of the date of grant. Upon any change
in control of the company, 25% of the unvested stock options then outstanding will vest and become
exercisable. However, if the acquiring entity does not assume outstanding options, then all options
will vest immediately prior to the change in control.

We use the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model to determine the fair value of options
granted. Option-pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, particularly for
the expected stock price volatility. Changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially
affect the fair value estimate. Our expected stock price volatility assumptions are based on the
historical volatility of our stock for the expected term and other relevant factors. The risk-free
interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yields for the expected term in effect at the
approximate date of grant. We have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we have no
present intention to pay a dividend; therefore, we assumed that no dividends will be paid over the
expected terms of option awards.

The use of the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model, the general methods employed to
develop the above described option valuation assumptions, and the vesting conditions of option
awards are consistent with prior periods. Beginning in 2006, the contractual terms of employee
option grants were reduced from ten years to seven years and we previously elected to use the
simplified method described in the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
107, which is based on vesting and contractual terms, to develop the expected term assumption for
2006 and 2007 option awards. Beginning in January 2008, we have derived the expected term
assumption for options based on historical experience and other relevant factors concerning
expected employee behavior with regard to option exercise.

We determine the assumptions to be used in the valuation of option grants as of the date of
grant. As such, we may use different assumptions during the fiscal year if we grant options at
different dates. The weighted average of the valuation assumptions used to determine the fair value
of each option grant on the date of grant and the weighted average estimated fair values were as
follows:

Intrinsic value represents the amount by which the market price of the common stock exceeded
the exercise price of the options, before applicable income taxes. During the years ended December
31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the total intrinsic value of stock options exercised was $25.4 million,
$38.9 million and $34.4 million, respectively.

The total fair value of options vested during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006
was $11.3 million, $12.6 million and $12.8 million, respectively.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

During 1997, our board of directors approved the 1997 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, under
which we reserved and may issue up to an aggregate of 1,240,000 shares of Common Stock in periodic
offerings. Under the plan, stock is sold at 85% of the closing price of the stock on the last day
of each three-month plan period. The fair value of purchase rights under the program equals the 15%
discount from the market price at the exercise date, which is the last day of the subscription
period.

Restricted and Other Deferred Stock Units With Vesting Conditions

Restricted stock unit awards to employees either vest ratably over five years on each
anniversary of the date of grant, or vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant. Vesting is
conditional on continuous service. Restricted stock units are converted to an equivalent number of
shares of common stock upon vesting. Upon any change in control of the company, 25% of the unvested
restricted stock units then outstanding under the 2003 Stock Incentive Plan will vest, provided,
however, that if the acquiring entity does not assume the restricted stock units, then all such
units will vest immediately prior to the change in control. Deferred stock units with vesting
conditions awarded to non-employee directors under the Director Deferred Compensation Plan vest
fully on the first anniversary of the date of grant. Except upon a change in control, as defined in
the Director Deferred Compensation Plan, or certain limited circumstances, all deferred stock units
will be exchanged for an equivalent number of shares of common stock one year following a
director’s resignation or retirement. Upon a change in control, unvested deferred stock units vest
immediately.

The fair values of restricted and deferred stock units with vesting conditions are based on
the closing sale price of the common stock on the date of grant. The weighted average fair value
per unit of restricted stock units granted during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006
was $55.70, $42.65 and $39.00, respectively. The weighted average fair value per unit of deferred
stock units with vesting conditions granted during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006
was $56.95, $41.94 and $38.73, respectively.

Deferred Stock Units With No Vesting Conditions

Under our Director Deferred Compensation Plan, non-employee directors also may defer a portion
of their cash fees in the form of vested deferred stock units, each of which represents the right
to receive one unissued share of our common stock. Directors receive a number of deferred stock
units equal to the amount of cash fees deferred divided by the closing sale price of the common
stock on the date of deferral. Under our Executive Deferred Compensation Plan (the “Executive
Plan”), certain members of our management may elect to defer a portion of their cash compensation
in deferred stock units. These deferred stock units will be exchanged for a fixed number of shares
of common stock, subject to the limitations of the Executive Plan and applicable law. Except upon a
change in control, as defined in the Director Deferred Compensation Plan and the Executive Plan, or
certain other limited circumstances, directors and officers may not receive shares of common stock
in settlement of deferred stock units earlier than one year following their resignation from the
board or termination of their employment, respectively.

During the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company issued approximately
10,000, 8,000 and 16,000 deferred stock units valued at $0.5 million, $0.7 million and $0.7
million, respectively.

During the year ended December 31, 2008, approximately 1,000 shares of common stock were
issued to settle deferred stock units.

During the year ended December 31, 2007, we recognized a write-down of nitazoxanide raw
materials inventory of $9.1 million associated with Navigator

®

. This write-down is
included in cost of product revenue in the consolidated statement of income. Our analysis of the
realizability of the inventory was triggered upon our receipt of notice from the third-party
contract manufacturer of finished goods that it would discontinue manufacturing the product in
2009. Because of the low production volume of
Navigator

®

, we believed that we would not be able to enter into a replacement
manufacturing arrangement on economically feasible terms, and therefore we would not be able to
obtain the product after termination of the existing manufacturing arrangement. Accordingly, we
evaluated our associated inventory for obsolescence based on our changed estimates of product
availability and estimated future demand and market conditions. This inventory comprised $9.1
million of active ingredient and other raw materials, for which we recognized a full write-down
during 2007.

Amortization expense of intangible assets was $10.2 million, $9.1 million and $5.4 million for
the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

During the year ended December 31, 2008, we acquired customer-related intangible assets of
$1.4 million, product rights of $4.8 million, and other intangible assets of $0.2 million, all of
which were assigned to the CAG segment, with weighted amortization periods of 15 years, 10 years
and 3 years, respectively. See Note 16 for more information. During the year ended December 31,
2007, we recognized $38.9 million of amortizable intangible assets related to business
acquisitions. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we also recognized incremental amortizable
intangible assets of $0.3 million in connection with the finalization of purchase price allocations
for certain 2006 business acquisitions. The weighted average amortization periods for other product
rights, customer-related intangible assets, and other intangible assets acquired during 2007 in
connection with business acquisitions were 13 years, 12 years and 6 years, respectively. See Notes
4 and 12 for additional information. The remaining change in the cost of intangible assets other
than goodwill during the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 resulted primarily from changes in
foreign currency exchange rates.

During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recognized goodwill of $0.6 million (all of which
is expected to be tax deductible) related to business acquisitions prior to December 31, 2008,
which was assigned to the CAG segment. Of this amount, $0.2 million related to business
acquisitions prior to 2008. See Note 4 for additional information. In connection with the sale of
certain of our pharmaceutical product lines in the fourth quarter of 2008, we allocated $7.2
million of goodwill to the pharmaceutical product lines sold based on their relative fair values.
In addition, due to the restructuring of the remaining pharmaceutical business, goodwill of $6.5
million related to the pharmaceutical product lines retained, was realigned into the Other segment.
See note 16 for additional information. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we recognized
$45.2 million of goodwill (of which $27.5 million is expected to be tax deductible) related to
business acquisitions. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we revised the purchase price
allocations related to certain businesses acquired during the year ended December 31, 2006. The
revised purchase price allocations resulted in a decrease in goodwill assigned to the CAG segment
of $0.8 million and a corresponding increase in property, equipment and other intangible assets.
See Note 4 for additional information. The remaining changes in the cost of goodwill during the years
ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 resulted primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange
rates.

During the year ended December 31, 2007, we recognized an impairment charge to write off a
prepaid royalty license of $1.0 million associated with Navigator

®

paste, our
Nitazoxanide product for the treatment of equine protozoal myeloencephalitis. We also recognized a
related inventory write-down as described in Note 6. Based on our changed estimates of product
availability and estimated future demand and market conditions, we determined that we would not
realize our investment in prepaid royalties and, therefore, fully expensed this asset.

F-23


We assessed goodwill attributable to our pharmaceutical business for impairment in 2007 due to
the Nitazoxanide inventory write-down and prepaid royalty license impairment charge. The goodwill
attributable to our pharmaceutical business of $13.7 million was not impaired at that time, or
subsequently, when evaluated as part of the annual assessment.

NOTE 9. DEBT

In May 2006, we acquired our Westbrook, Maine facility. We paid cash of $11.5 million and
assumed a mortgage that had a face value of $6.5 million and a stated interest rate of 9.875%. We
recorded the mortgage at a fair market value of $7.5 million, based on an effective market interest
rate of 6.05%. The mortgage is payable in equal monthly installments of approximately $0.1 million
through May 1, 2015. Annual mortgage principal payments at December 31, 2008, based on the fair
market value of the mortgage at the assumption date, are as follows

In January 2007, we entered into an unsecured short-term revolving credit facility with a bank
in the principal amount of $125.0 million that matured on June 30, 2007. On March 30, 2007, we
refinanced this short-term facility by entering into an unsecured revolving credit facility with
four multinational banks that matures on March 30, 2012 (the “Credit Facility”). In February 2008,
we increased the aggregate principal amount available under our Credit Facility to $200.0 million
and added a fifth bank to the syndication. The Credit Facility may be used for general corporate
purposes, including repurchases of our common stock and business acquisitions. The applicable
interest rates generally range from 0.375% to 0.875% above the London interbank rate or the
Canadian Dollar-denominated bankers’ acceptance rate, dependent on our leverage ratio. Under the
Credit Facility, we pay quarterly commitment fees of 0.08% to 0.20%, dependent on our leverage
ratio, on any unused commitment. The Credit Facility contains financial and other affirmative and
negative covenants, as well as customary events of default, that would allow any amounts
outstanding under the Credit Facility to be accelerated, or restrict our ability to borrow
thereunder, in the event of noncompliance. The financial covenant requires our ratio of debt to
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as defined by the agreement, not to
exceed 3-to-1. At December 31, 2008, our ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization was less than 1-to-1. At December 31, 2008, we had $150.6 million
outstanding under the Credit Facility at a weighted-average interest rate of 2.3%, which
approximates the rate that we would pay on additional borrowings with similar maturities under the
Credit Facility at December 31, 2008. Our availability under the Credit Facility was further
reduced at December 31, 2008 by $0.6 million for a letter of credit issued related to our workers’
compensation policy which commenced January 1, 2009. At December 31, 2007, we had $72.2 million
outstanding under the Credit Facility at a weighted-average interest rate of 5.4%. Of the total
amount outstanding at December 31, 2008 and 2007, $6.6 million and $5.1 million was borrowed by our
Canadian subsidiary and denominated in Canadian dollars.

NOTE 10. INCOME TAXES

We adopted the provisions of FIN 48 as of January 1, 2007. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for
uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements under SFAS No. 109 and prescribes a
comprehensive model for the recognition, measurement, and financial statement disclosure of
uncertain tax positions. Unrecognized tax benefits are the differences between tax positions taken,
or expected to be taken, in tax returns, and the benefits recognized for accounting purposes
pursuant to FIN 48. As a result of adopting the provisions of FIN 48, we recognized an increase in
assets of $4.0 million, an increase in liabilities of $1.1 million, a decrease in additional
paid-in capital of $0.2 million, and an increase in retained earnings of $3.1 million at January 1,
2007. In connection with the adoption of FIN 48, we have classified uncertain tax positions as
long-term liabilities.

F-24


The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007 was
$5.9 million and $5.1 million, respectively. Of the total unrecognized tax benefits at December 31,
2008 and 2007, $5.2 million and $4.7 million, respectively, comprise unrecognized tax positions
that would, if recognized, affect our effective tax rate. The ultimate deductibility of the
remaining unrecognized tax positions is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the timing of
such deductibility. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting, other than interest and
penalties, the disallowance of the shorter deductibility period would not affect the annual
effective tax rate but would accelerate the payment of cash to the taxing authority to an earlier
period.

In the ordinary course of our business, our income tax filings are regularly under audit by
tax authorities. While we believe we have appropriately provided for all uncertain tax positions,
amounts asserted by taxing authorities could be greater or less than our accrued position.
Accordingly, additional provisions on income tax matters, or reductions of previously accrued
provisions, could be recorded in the future as we revise our estimates due to changing facts and
circumstances or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved. We are currently
undergoing tax examinations by various international and state tax authorities and we anticipate
that these examinations will be concluded within the next year. We are no longer subject to U.S.
federal examinations for tax years before 2005. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to
income tax examinations in any state and local, or international jurisdictions in which we conduct
significant taxable activities for years before 2002.

We recognize accrued interest expense and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in
income tax expense. During the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, we recorded interest expense
and penalties of $0.4 million and $0.7 million, respectively, in our consolidated statement of
income. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, we had $0.8 million and $0.6 million of interest expense and
penalties accrued in our consolidated balance sheet.

December 31, 2008 (

In the next year, we could recognize approximately $1.4 million of income tax benefits that
have not been recognized at December 31, 2008 in accordance with FIN 48. The income tax benefits
are primarily due to the lapse in the statutes of limitations for various international and state
tax jurisdictions.

%

Our effective income tax rate was 31.7% for the year ended December 31, 2008 and 30.3% for the
year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in tax rate is
primarily attributable to several
non-recurring items. First, we wrote off non-deductible goodwill related to the pharmaceutical
product lines sold in the fourth quarter of 2008. Additionally, the increase in tax rate was
impacted by certain non-recurring items that favorably impacted the tax rate for the year ended
December 31, 2007, including the reduction of deferred tax liabilities due to a change in
international tax rate and the recognition of state tax benefits resulting from the completion of
an audit in 2007. These unfavorable items were partly offset by tax benefits related to a reduction
in international deferred tax liabilities in 2008 and the 2007 reduction of deferred tax assets due
to changes in statutory income tax rates for jurisdictions in which we operate.

Our effective income tax rate was 30.3% for the year ended December 31, 2007 and 28.4% for the
year ended December 31, 2006. The increase in tax rate is primarily attributable to several
non-recurring items that benefited the tax rate in the year ended December 31, 2006. These 2006
items included the resolution of an income tax audit for years ended December 31, 2003 and 2004, a
reduction of previously recorded deferred tax liabilities as a result of obtaining certain
multi-year tax incentives and the release of a valuation allowance on international deferred tax
assets as a result of a foreign subsidiary demonstrating consistent sustained profitability.
Offsetting the impact of the items occurring in 2006 were several favorable impacts to our rate
that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2007. These items included an increase in certain
federal tax incentives due to changes in legislation, tax benefits related to reductions in
international rates, and the recognition of state tax benefits resulting from the completion of an
audit.

At December 31, 2008, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards in certain state
jurisdictions of approximately $51.2 million available to offset future taxable income. Most of
these net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates through 2020 and the remainder
have indefinite lives. We have recorded a valuation allowance for all of these assets because
realizability is uncertain.

We consider certain operating earnings of non-United States subsidiaries to be indefinitely
invested outside the United States. The cumulative earnings of these subsidiaries were $155.6
million at December 31, 2008. No provision has been made for United States federal and state, or
international taxes that may result from future remittances of these undistributed earnings of
non-United States subsidiaries. Should we repatriate these earnings in the future, we would have to
adjust the income tax provision in the period in which the decision to repatriate earnings is made.
For the operating earnings not considered to be indefinitely invested outside the United States, we
have accrued taxes on a current basis.

NOTE 11. EARNINGS PER SHARE

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of
shares of common stock and vested deferred stock units outstanding during the year. The computation
of diluted earnings per share is similar to the computation of basic earnings per share, except
that the denominator is increased for the assumed exercise of dilutive options and other
potentially dilutive securities using the treasury stock method unless the effect is anti-dilutive.

NOTE 12. COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND GUARANTEES

We lease multiple facilities under operating leases that expire through 2021. In addition, we
are responsible for the real estate taxes and operating expenses related to these facilities. We
also have lease commitments for automobiles and office equipment. Rent expense charged to
operations under operating leases was approximately $14.5 million, $10.9 million and $8.8 million
for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

We purchase the slides sold for use in our Catalyst Dx™ and VetTest

®

Chemistry
Analyzers under an agreement with Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, Inc. that, at December 31, 2008,
required us to purchase a minimum of $13.8 million of slides through 2010. We also have commitments
under certain other agreements that commit us to aggregate future payments of $16.2 million. In
addition, we have various minimum royalty payments due through 2027 of $10.7 million.

In connection with the acquisitions of businesses and intangible assets, we have commitments
outstanding at December 31, 2008 for additional purchase price payments of up to $7.7 million, of
which $0.2 million has been accrued, in connection with acquisitions of businesses and intangible
assets during the current and prior periods, all of which is contingent on the achievement by
certain acquired businesses of specified milestones.

Prior to April 2006, we had a 40% equity interest in a joint venture to market production
animal diagnostic products in China. In April 2006, we paid $0.6 million to acquire an additional
55% equity interest in the joint venture from our partner and we also committed to pay an
additional $0.2 million, which was paid in 2008 in consideration for the additional equity. In
addition, the joint venture entered into a contract with the joint venture partner where the
partner provides promotional and agency services and receives sales commissions at rates escalating
from 2.5% to 8.5% annually based on sales volume. In connection with this step acquisition, we
recognized $0.7 million of intangible assets in PAS in 2006.

Contingencies

We are subject to claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, including with respect
to actual and threatened litigation and other matters. We accrue contingent liabilities when it is
probable that future expenditures will be made and such expenditures can reasonably be estimated.
However, our actual losses with respect to these contingencies could exceed our accruals.

On June 30, 2006, Cyntegra, Inc. filed suit against us in the U.S. District Court for the
Central District of California alleging that we had violated U.S. federal antitrust laws and
California state unfair trade practices laws. The complaint alleged, among other things, that we
were monopolizing the U.S. market for companion animal diagnostic products. The plaintiff
sought injunctive relief and damages for purported lost sales. On October 26, 2007, the trial court
granted summary judgment in our favor on all of Cyntegra’s claims and dismissed the suit. Cyntegra
appealed this decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Cyntegra filed its
opening brief on appeal on May 30, 2008; we filed our opposition brief on July 2, 2008; and
Cyntegra filed its reply brief on July 16, 2008. We expect the Court of Appeals to schedule a
hearing in mid-2009. Until then, the trial court judgment in our favor remains in place. We will
continue to defend ourselves vigorously, as we believe Cyntegra’s claims are without merit.

F-29


Under our workers’ compensation insurance policies for U.S. employees since January 1, 2003,
we have retained the first $250,000 in claim liability per incident and $3.2 million, $2.8 million,
$3.1 million, $2.8 million, $3.0 million, and $1.4 million for 2008 through 2003, respectively, in
aggregate claim liability. The insurance company provides insurance for claims above the individual
occurrence and aggregate limits. We estimate claim liability based on claims incurred and the
estimated ultimate cost to settle the claims. Based on this analysis, we have recognized cumulative
expenses of $0.7 million, $0.3 million, $0.9 million, $0.5 million, $0.9 million, and $0.8 million
for claims incurred during the years ended December 31, 2008 through 2003, respectively. Claims
incurred during the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 are relatively new and significant
additional healthcare and wage indemnification costs could arise from those claims. Our liability
for claims incurred during the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 could exceed our estimates
and we could be liable for up to $2.5 million and $0.9 million, respectively, in excess of the
expense we have recognized. For the four years ended on or prior to December 31, 2006, based on our
retained claim liability per incident and our aggregate claim liability, our maximum liability at
December 31, 2008 is $1.6 million in excess of the amounts deemed probable and previously
recognized.

Under our current employee health care insurance policy, we retain claims liability risk up to
$250,000 per incident. We estimate our liability for the uninsured portion of employee health care
obligations that have been incurred but not reported based on individual coverage, our claims
experience, and the average time from when a claim is incurred to the time it is paid. We
recognized employee health care claim expense of $18.5 million, $14.3 million and $10.8 million
during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, which includes actual claims
paid and an estimate for our liability for the uninsured portion of employee health care
obligations that have been incurred but not paid. Should employee health insurance claims exceed
our estimated liability, we would have further obligations.

We have entered into employment agreements with two of our officers whereby payments may be
required if we terminate their employment without cause other than following a change in control.
The amounts payable are based upon the executives’ salaries at the time of termination and the cost
to us of continuing to provide certain benefits. Had both of such officers been terminated at
December 31, 2008, we would have had aggregate obligations for salaries and benefits of
approximately $2.2 million under such agreements. We have entered into employment agreements with
each of our officers that require us to make certain payments in the event the officer’s employment
is terminated under certain circumstances within a certain period following a change in control of
our stock. The amounts payable by us under these agreements is based on the officer’s salary and
bonus history at the time of termination and the cost to us of continuing to provide certain
benefits. Had all of our officers been terminated in qualifying terminations following a change in
control at December 31, 2008, we would have had aggregate obligations of approximately $16.1
million under these agreements. These agreements also provide for the acceleration of the vesting
of all stock options and restricted stock units upon any qualifying termination following a change
in control.

From time to time, we have received notices alleging that our products infringe third-party
proprietary rights, although we are not aware of any pending litigation with respect to such
claims. Patent litigation frequently is complex and expensive, and the outcome of patent litigation
can be difficult to predict. There can be no assurance that we will prevail in any infringement
proceedings that may be commenced against us. If we lose any such litigation, we may be stopped
from selling certain products and/or we may be required to pay damages as a result of the
litigation.

Guarantees

The following is a summary of our agreements and obligations that we have determined to be
within the scope of FIN 45, “Guarantor’s Accounting and
Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees
of Indebtedness of Others — an interpretation of FASB
Statements No. 5, 57 and
107 and rescission of FASB Interpretation No. 34.”

In October 2005, our former supplier of VetAutoread™ Hematology Analyzers and consumables sold
this business (including the human hematology testing products division) and we simultaneously
entered into a new supply agreement for these products with the acquirer of the business. Under
this new supply agreement, we received guaranteed pricing on certain products through December 31,
2020, among other benefits. In partial consideration for this new supply agreement, we paid cash of
$2.5 million to the acquirer and guaranteed the acquirer’s note (the “Note”) in the principal
amount of $3.5 million given to our former supplier in partial
consideration for the business. The acquirer was obligated to pay the Note through quarterly
principal and interest payments through 2008 and to pay the remaining balance in 2008. We recorded
the fair value of the guaranty of $0.5 million and recognized the associated assets at the
effective date of the agreement. At December 31, 2007, we had written off the guaranty liability
because our recognized contractual liabilities to the supplier exceed the principal balance of the
Note and a legal right of offset exists whereby we may elect to pay to the holder of the Note the
amounts otherwise due to the supplier. In February 2008, the acquirer paid the remaining payment
under the Note, which released our guaranty.

F-30


We enter into agreements with third parties in the ordinary course of business under which we
are obligated to indemnify such third parties for and against various risks and losses. The precise
terms of such indemnities vary with the nature of the agreement. In many cases, we limit the
maximum amount of our indemnification obligations, but in some cases those obligations may be
theoretically unlimited. We have not incurred material expenses in discharging any of these
indemnification obligations, and based on our analysis of the nature of the risks involved, we
believe that the fair value of these agreements is minimal. Accordingly, we have recorded no
liabilities for these obligations at December 31, 2008 and 2007.

When acquiring a business, we sometimes assume liability for certain events or occurrences
that took place prior to the date of acquisition. However, we do not believe that we have any
probable pre-acquisition liabilities or guarantees that should be recognized at December 31, 2008
and 2007.

NOTE 13. PREFERRED STOCK

Our board of directors is authorized, subject to any limitations prescribed by law, without
further stockholder approval, to issue from time to time up to 500,000 shares of Preferred Stock,
$1.00 par value per share (“Preferred Stock”), in one or more series. Each such series of Preferred
Stock shall have such number of shares, designations, preferences, voting powers, qualifications
and special or relative rights or privileges as shall be determined by the board of directors,
which may include, among others, dividend rights, voting rights, redemption and sinking fund
provisions, liquidation preferences, conversion rights and preemptive rights.

NOTE 14. TREASURY STOCK

The board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to 40,000,000 shares of our common
stock in the open market or in negotiated transactions. We believe that the repurchase of our
common stock is a favorable investment and we also repurchase to offset the dilutive effect of our
employee share-based compensation programs. Repurchases of our common stock may vary depending upon
the level of other investing activities and the share price.

From the inception of the program in August 1999 to December 31, 2008, we repurchased
35,787,000 shares for $822.5 million. From the inception of the program to December 31, 2008, we
also received 376,000 shares of stock with a market value of $7.9 million that were surrendered by
employees in payment for the minimum required withholding taxes due on the exercise of stock
options, the vesting of restricted stock units and the settlement of deferred stock units, and in
payment for the exercise price of stock options.

NOTE 15. IDEXX RETIREMENT AND INCENTIVE SAVINGS PLAN

We have established the IDEXX Retirement and Incentive Savings Plan (the “401(k) Plan”).
Employees eligible to participate in the 401(k) Plan may contribute specified percentages of their
salaries, a portion of which will be matched by us. We matched $5.6 million, $3.4 million and $2.7
million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. In addition, we may
make contributions to the 401(k) Plan at the discretion of the board of directors. There were no
discretionary contributions in 2008, 2007 and 2006.

NOTE 16. DISPOSITION OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCT LINES AND RESTRUCTURING

In the fourth quarter of 2008, we sold our Acarexx

®

and SURPASS

®

veterinary pharmaceutical products and a product under development, which were a part of our CAG
segment, for cash of $7.0 million, a short-term receivable of $1.4 million, which was received in
January 2009, and up to $12.0 million of future payments based on the achievement of certain
development and sales milestones. Milestone payments will be included in our results of operations
upon achievement of the milestone.

Additionally in the fourth quarter of 2008, in a separate transaction, we entered into an
agreement to sell our raw material inventory of nitazoxanide (“NTZ”), the active ingredient
associated with our Navigator

®

product, back to the material supplier. We will receive
$25,000 per month for 24 months and a final payment of $1.4 million related to this agreement,
which will be recorded in our results of operations in the period that the payments are received.
In the second quarter of 2007 we recognized a write-down of NTZ inventory of $9.1 million based on
the determination that we would not realize this inventory.

Subsequent to entering into the transactions noted above we restructured the remaining
pharmaceutical business and realigned two of our remaining product lines to the Rapid Assay
products and realigned the remainder of the business, which comprised one product line and two
out-licensing arrangements, to the Other category. Segment information presented for the years
ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 has been restated to conform to our presentation of reportable
segments for the year ended December 31, 2008.

For the year ended December 31, 2008 we recognized a pre-tax loss from the transactions and
the related restructuring costs of approximately $1.5 million and recorded a tax provision of $2.1
million, primarily related to the disposition of $7.2 million of nondeductible goodwill allocated
to the pharmaceutical product lines sold.

The pre-tax loss on disposition of the pharmaceutical product lines and related restructuring
charges have been included in the line item totals of the consolidated statements of income as

agreement related to certain intellectual property of our pharmaceutical business. Under this
agreement we received $0.25 million up front and are entitled to receive a total of $3.3 million in
milestone payments, related to the achievement of future events, and royalties based on future
product sales. Milestone payments will be included in our results of operations upon achievement of
the milestones.

NOTE 17. SEGMENT REPORTING

We disclose information regarding our segments in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No.
131, “Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information” (“SFAS No. 131”). SFAS
No. 131 requires disclosures about operating segments in annual financial statements and requires
selected information about operating segments in interim financial statements. It also requires
related disclosures about products and services and about geographic areas. Operating segments are
defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that
is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision-maker, or decision-making group, in deciding
how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Our chief operating decision-maker is the
Chief Executive Officer.

We are organized into business units by market and customer group. Our reportable segments
include: products and services for the veterinary market, which we refer to as our Companion Animal
Group (“CAG”), water quality products (“Water”), and products for production animal health, which
we refer to as the Production Animal Segment (“PAS”). We also operate two smaller segments that
comprise products for dairy quality, which we refer to as Dairy, and products for the human medical
diagnostic market, which we refer to as OPTI Medical. In addition, we maintain active research and
development programs, some of which may materialize into the development and introduction of new
technology, products or services that do not align with one of our existing business or service
categories. In such situations, the related financial impacts are shown in the “Other” category.
Financial information about the Dairy and OPTI Medical operating segments and other activities are
combined and presented in an “Other” category because they do not meet the quantitative or
qualitative thresholds for reportable segments.

CAG develops, designs, manufactures, and distributes products and performs services for
veterinarians. Water develops, designs, manufactures and distributes products to detect
contaminants in water. PAS develops, designs, manufactures and distributes products to detect
disease in production animals. Dairy develops, designs, manufactures and distributes products to
detect contaminants in dairy products. OPTI Medical develops, designs, manufactures, and
distributes point-of-care electrolyte and blood gas analyzers and related consumable products for
the human medical diagnostics market. In connection with the restructuring of our pharmaceutical
business at the end of 2008, we realigned two of our remaining product lines to the Rapid Assay
products, and realigned the remainder of the business, which comprised one product line and two
out-licensing arrangements, to the Other category. The segment information for the years ended
December 31, 2007 and 2006 has been restated to conform to our presentation of reportable segments
for the year ended December 31, 2008. Previously, financial information related to the product
lines realigned to Rapid Assay and the product line and out-licensing arrangement realigned to
Other were included in the pharmaceutical business and reported in the CAG segment.

Items that are not allocated to our operating segments are comprised primarily of corporate
research and development expenses, interest income and expense, and income taxes. Share-based
compensation expense was also reported in “unallocated amounts” in 2006. Beginning in 2007, we
allocate a portion of share-based compensation expense to the operating segments. This allocation
differs from the actual expense and consequently yields a difference between the total allocated
share-based compensation expense and the actual expense for the total company, which is categorized
as “unallocated amounts.”

F-33


The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in the
summary of significant accounting policies except that most interest income and expenses and income
taxes are not allocated to individual operating segments. Below is our segment information (

NOTE 18. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

On January 1, 2008, we adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 157 for our financial assets and
liabilities. As permitted by FSP No. SFAS 157-2, we elected to defer the adoption of SFAS No. 157
for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those that are recognized or
disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis, until January 1, 2009.
SFAS No. 157 provides a framework for measuring fair value under U.S. GAAP and requires expanded
disclosures regarding fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value as the exchange
price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the
principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants on the measurement date. SFAS No. 157 also establishes a fair value hierarchy
which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs, where available, and minimize
the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.

SFAS No. 157 describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:

Level 1

Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or
liabilities. Our Level 1 assets and liabilities include
investments in money market funds and marketable securities
related to a deferred compensation plan assumed in a business
combination. The liabilities associated with this plan relate to
deferred compensation, which is indexed to the performance of the
underlying investments.

Level 2

Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices
for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that
are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be
corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full
term of the assets or liabilities. Our Level 2 assets include
unrealized gains and losses on hedge contracts.

Level 3

Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market
activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets
or liabilities. At December 31, 2008, we had no Level 3 assets or
liabilities.

F-36


The following table sets forth our financial assets and liabilities that were measured at fair
value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2008 by level within the fair value hierarchy. We did
not have any nonfinancial assets or liabilities that were measured or disclosed at fair value on a
recurring basis at December 31, 2008. As required by SFAS No. 157, assets and liabilities measured
at fair value are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is
significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input
to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to
the asset or liability (
