requires), develops, manufactures and distributes products and provides services for the
veterinary and the food and water testing markets. Our products and services include:

•

Point-of-care
veterinary diagnostic products, comprising rapid assays and instruments and instrument
consumables;

•

Laboratory
and consulting services used by veterinarians;

•

Veterinary
pharmaceutical products;

•

Information
products and services and digital radiography systems for veterinarians;

•

Diagnostic
and health-monitoring products for production animals;

•

Products
that test water for certain microbiological contaminants; and

•

Products
that test milk for antibiotic residues.

We
are a Delaware corporation and were incorporated in 1983. Our principal executive offices
are located at One IDEXX Drive, Westbrook, Maine 04092, our telephone number is
207-856-0300, and our Internet address is idexx.com.

We
make available free of charge on our Web site our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly
Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports as soon
as reasonably practicable after we file such information with, or furnish it to, the
Securities and Exchange Commission.


PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

We
operate primarily through three business segments: products and services for the
veterinary market, which we refer to as our Companion Animal Group (“CAG”),
water quality products (“Water”) and products for production animal health and
dairy quality, which we refer to as the Food Diagnostics Group (“FDG”). See Note
18 to our financial statements included elsewhere in this report for financial information
about our business segments, including geographic information, and about our product and
service categories.

COMPANION ANIMAL GROUP

Rapid
Assays

We
provide a broad range of single-use, hand-held test kits that allow quick (in most cases,
less than ten minutes), accurate and convenient test results for a variety of companion
animal diseases and health conditions. These products enable veterinarians to provide
improved service to animal owners by delivering test results and a diagnosis at the time
of the patient visit, allowing the veterinarian to initiate therapy or prevention, if
required.

Our
principal single-use tests are sold under the SNAP

®

name, and include a
feline combination test, the SNAP

®

Combo FIV antibody/FeLV antigen test,
which enables veterinarians to test simultaneously for feline immunodeficiency virus
(“FIV”) (which is similar to the human AIDS virus) and feline leukemia virus
(“FeLV”); a canine combination test, the SNAP

®

3Dx

®

, which tests simultaneously for Lyme disease,

Ehrlichia canis

and heartworm; a canine heartworm-only test; and canine and feline tests for

Giardia

, a parasitic disease. Sales of heartworm tests are greater in the first
half of our fiscal year due to seasonality of the disease.

In
addition to our single-use tests, we sell a line of microwell-based test kits, under the
PetChek

®

name, which are used by larger clinics and independent
laboratories to test multiple samples. PetChek

®

tests offer accuracy, ease
of use and cost advantages to high-volume customers. We currently sell
PetChek

®

tests for FeLV, FIV and canine heartworm disease.

Instruments
and Consumables

We
currently market several instrument systems, as well as associated consumable products,
for use in veterinary clinics. These instruments, which we refer to collectively as the
IDEXX VetLab

®

, are described below.

Blood
and Urine Chemistry

. Our VetTest

®

blood and urine chemistry analyzer is
used to measure levels of certain enzymes and other substances in blood or urine in order
to assist the veterinarian in diagnosing physiologic conditions. Twenty-three separate
tests can be performed on the VetTest

®

analyzer. Blood tests commonly run
include glucose, alkaline phosphatase, ALT (alanine aminotransferase), creatinine, BUN
(blood urea nitrogen) and total protein. The VetTest

®

also runs tests for
urine protein/urine creatinine ratio, which assists in the detection of early renal
disease. Tests are sold individually and in prepackaged panels, such as the
preanesthetic Panel and the General Health Profile.

We
purchase all of the reagents used in the VetTest

®

analyzer (“dry
chemistry slides” or “VetTest

®

slides”) from Ortho-Clinical
Diagnostics, Inc. (“Ortho”), a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson. See
“Business-Production and Supply.” In October 2003, we entered into a new
agreement with Ortho under which we are developing a next-generation chemistry analyzer
for the veterinary market based on Ortho’s dry-slide technology, and Ortho will
supply the slide consumables used in both the VetTest

®

analyzer and the new
analyzer through 2018. We do not expect this new instrument to be commercially available
before 2006.

Hematology

. We
sell two hematology analyzers: the LaserCyte

®

system, which           uses
laser-flow cytometry technology to analyze components of blood, including           red
blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets; and the QBC

®

VetAutoread™ hematology
analyzer, which is based on the Becton, Dickinson           & Company (“Becton
Dickinson”) QBC® Autoread™ hematology           system that is sold to
physicians for human applications. We purchase all of our           QBC

®

VetAutoread™ analyzers
and consumables from Becton           Dickinson.


Electrolytes
and Blood Gases

. Our VetLyte

®

system measures three
electrolytes—sodium, potassium and chloride—to aid in evaluating acid-base and
electrolyte balances and assessing plasma hydration. Test results are available in less
than one minute after sample introduction and are either displayed on the
VetLyte

®

analyzer or downloaded to the VetTest

®

analyzer. We
purchase our VetLyte® instruments and consumables from Roche Diagnostics Corporation.

Our
VetStat™ analyzer, which we expect to introduce in the second quarter of 2005, measures
electrolytes, blood gases, acid-base balance, glucose and ionized calcium and calculates
other parameters, such as bicarbonate and anion gap. These measurements aid veterinarians
in evaluating fluid therapy choices and measuring respiratory function. The VetStat™
analyzer runs single-use disposable cassettes that contain various configurations of
analytes, and provides results in less than two minutes. We purchase all of our
VetStat™ analyzers and consumables from Osmetech, Inc.

Quantitative
Hormone Testing

. The VetTest

®

SNAP

®

Reader allows the
veterinarian to obtain quantitative measurement of hormones, including thyroxine (T


) and
cortisol. These measurements assist in diagnosing and monitoring the treatment of certain
endocrine diseases, such as hyper- and hypothyroidism, Cushing’s syndrome and
Addison’s disease. Samples and reagents are introduced to the analyzer using our
SNAP

®

device platform.

Veterinary
Laboratory and Consulting Services

We
offer commercial veterinary laboratory and consulting services to veterinarians in the
U.S., Europe, Australia and Japan. In November 2004, we completed the acquisition of Vet
Med Lab, a laboratory based in Germany, for cash consideration of approximately $31.3
million, net of cash acquired. In February 2004 we completed the acquisition of a
veterinary laboratory located in Ohio for cash consideration of $5.3 million and issued
$1.0 million in notes payable. Veterinarians use our services by submitting samples by
courier or overnight delivery to one of our facilities. Our laboratories offer a large
selection of tests and diagnostic panels to detect a number of disease states and other
conditions in production and companion animals.

Additionally,
we provide specialized veterinary consultation, telemedicine and advisory services,
including cardiology, radiology, internal medicine and ultrasound consulting. These
services permit veterinarians to obtain readings and interpretations of test results
transmitted by telephone and over the Internet from the veterinarians’ offices.

Information
Products and Services and Digital Radiography Systems

Information
Products and Services

. We develop, market and sell practice information management
software systems and related hardware that run key functions of veterinary clinics,
including scheduling, billing and patient records management. Our systems permit automated
electronic transfer of test results from our IDEXX VetLab analyzers and from our
veterinary reference laboratories directly into the patients’ medical records. We
believe we are the leading provider of veterinary practice information management software
systems in North America, with an installed base of more than 7,300 of the approximately
25,000 veterinary hospitals in North America. We also provide software and hardware
support, and related supplies, and we derive a significant portion of our revenues for this
product line from ongoing service contracts.

Digital
Radiography Systems

. We market and sell two digital radiography systems: the
IDEXX Digital Radiography System, which is appropriate for use in the veterinary clinic, and the
IDEXX Digital Radiography Compact System, which is primarily used as a portable unit in ambulatory
veterinary practices, such as equine practices. Our digital radiography systems generate
digital radiograph images, which replace traditional x-ray film. Use of digital
radiographs eliminates the need for the film and processor, hazardous chemicals and
darkroom required for the production of film images.

Pharmaceutical
Products

We
develop, market and sell novel therapeutics for the veterinary market. We currently market
and sell four pharmaceutical products: PZI VET

®

, an insulin product for the
treatment of diabetic cats; ACAREXX

®

(.01% ivermectin) otic suspension for
the treatment of ear mites in cats; SURPASS

®

(1% diclofenac sodium), a
topical, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory for equine use; and Navigator

®

(32% nitazoxanide) Antiprotozoal Oral Paste, a treatment for equine protozoal
myeloencephalitis (EPM). We are developing a long-acting, injectable form of the
antibiotic tilmicosin for cats.

Our new animal drug application (“NADA”)
for this product is under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(“FDA”) and we do not expect FDA approval of this product before 2006.


WATER

Our
Colilert

®

, Colilert-18 and Colisure

®

tests simultaneously
detect total coliforms and

E. coli

in water. These organisms are broadly used as
indicators of microbial contamination in water. These products utilize indicator-nutrients
that produce a change in color or fluorescence when metabolized by target microbes in the
sample. Our water tests are used by government laboratories, water utilities and private
certified laboratories to test drinking water in compliance with U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (“EPA”) standards. The tests also are used in evaluating water
used in production processes (for example, in beverage and pharmaceutical applications)
and in evaluating bottled water, recreational water, waste water and water from private
wells.

Our
Enterolert™ product detects enterococci in drinking and recreational waters. Our
Quanti-Tray

®

products, when used in conjunction with our
Colilert

®

, Colilert-18, Colisure

®

or Enterolert™
products, provide users quantitative measurements of microbial contamination, rather then
a presence/absence indication. The Colilert

®

, Colilert-18,
Colisure

®

and Quanti-Tray

®

products have been approved by
the EPA and by regulatory agencies in certain other countries.

In
August 2000, we acquired Genera Technologies Limited, a U.K.-based company that develops
and sells products for detection of

Cryptosporidia

in water.

Cryptosporidia

are parasites
that can cause potentially fatal gastrointestinal illness if ingested. Testing of water
supplies for

Cryptosporidia

is mandated by regulation in the United Kingdom, but is not
regulated in other countries at this time.

FOOD DIAGNOSTICS GROUP

Production
Animal Services

We
sell diagnostic tests and related instrumentation and software that are used to detect a
wide range of diseases and to monitor health status in production animals. Our production
animal products are purchased primarily by government laboratories and poultry and swine
producers. Significant products include diagnostic tests for porcine reproductive and
respiratory syndrome and pseudorabies virus in pigs, Newcastle disease in poultry, and
Johne’s disease and brucellosis in cattle. In December 2004, we completed the
acquisition of Dr. Bommeli AG, a Swiss manufacturer of production animal tests, for cash
consideration of approximately $15.8 million, net of cash acquired.

We
have developed a postmortem test for bovine spongiform encephalopathy (“BSE” or
“mad cow disease”). This test was approved for use in the U.S. by the United
States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) in 2004 and for use in the European
Union (“EU”) by the European Commission in February 2005. Testing for BSE in the
U.S. is limited, and we do not know when or if the USDA will expand its testing program,
which would increase the domestic market for these tests. The European Union
(“EU”) maintains a much more significant testing program, and we believe approximately 10
million tests are performed annually in EU member countries.

Dairy
Testing

Our
principal product for use in testing for antibiotic residue in milk is the
SNAP

®

beta-lactam test. Dairy producers and processors use our tests for
quality assurance of raw milk, and government and food-quality managers use them for
ongoing surveillance.

In
March 2003, we entered into an agreement with the FDA under which we agreed, among other
things, to perform specified lot release and stability testing of our SNAP

®

beta-lactam products and to provide related data to the FDA. If the FDA were to determine
that one or more lots of product failed to meet applicable criteria for product
performance or stability, the FDA could take various actions, including requiring us to
recall products or restricting our ability to sell these products. Sales of dairy
antibiotic residue testing products were $15.7 million in 2004.


MARKETING AND
DISTRIBUTION

We
market, sell and service our products worldwide through our marketing, sales and technical
service groups, as well as through independent distributors and other resellers. We
maintain sales offices outside the U.S. in Australia, China, France, Germany, Italy,
Japan, the Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland, Taiwan and the United Kingdom. In 2004, 2003
and 2002, we spent $85.7 million, $71.8 million and $56.8 million or 16%, 15% and 14% of
sales, respectively, on sales and marketing.

Generally,
we select the appropriate distribution channel for our products based on the type of
product, technical service requirements, number and concentration of customers, regulatory
requirements and other factors. We market our veterinary diagnostic and pharmaceutical
products to veterinarians both directly and through independent veterinary distributors in
the U.S., with most instruments and laboratory services sold directly by IDEXX sales
personnel, and test kits, pharmaceutical products and instrument consumables supplied
primarily by the distribution channel. Outside the U.S., we sell our veterinary diagnostic
products through our direct sales force and, in certain countries, through distributors
and other resellers. We market our software products and veterinary laboratory services
through our direct sales force. We market our water and food diagnostics products
primarily through our direct sales force in the U.S. and Canada. Outside the U.S. and
Canada, we market these products through selected independent distributors and, in certain
countries, through our direct sales force.

In
2004, 2003 and 2002, no customer accounted for greater than 10% of our sales. Our largest
customers are our U.S. distributors of our products in the CAG segment. The largest
consumer of our products accounts for approximately 1% of our sales.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

Our
business includes the development and introduction of new products and may involve entry
into new business areas. Our research and development activity is focused primarily on
development of new diagnostic instrument platforms, new immunoassay devices, new
diagnostic tests, new animal drugs, and improvements to our products and services. Our
research and development expenses, which consist of salaries, employee benefits, materials
and consulting costs, were approximately $35.4 million, $32.3 million and $29.3 million,
or 6%, 7% and 7% of sales, in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

PATENTS AND LICENSES

We
actively seek to obtain patent protection in the U.S. and other countries for inventions
covering our products and technologies. We also license patents and technologies from
third parties. These licenses include an exclusive royalty-bearing license of certain
patents relating to diagnostic products for FIV that expire in 2009, from The Regents of
the University of California; an exclusive royalty-bearing license of certain patents
expiring in 2007 that are utilized in the Colilert

®

, Colilert-18,
Colisure

®

and Enterolert™ water-testing products; and exclusive
licenses from Tulane University and the University of Texas to certain patents and patent
applications expiring beginning in 2019 that relate to the detection of Lyme disease. In
addition, we hold a U.S. patent that expires in 2014 and relates to certain methods and
kits for simultaneously detecting antigens and antibodies, which covers our
SNAP

®

Combo FIV/FeLV and Canine SNAP

®

3Dx

®

combination tests.

To
the extent some of our products may now, or in the future, embody technologies protected
by patents, copyrights or trade secrets of others, we may be required to obtain licenses
to such technologies in order to continue to sell our products. These licenses may not be
available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our failure to obtain any such licenses may
delay or prevent the sale of certain new or existing products. See “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Future
Operating Results.”

PRODUCTION AND SUPPLY

VetTest

®

analyzers are manufactured for us by Tokyo Parts Industrial Company, Ltd. under an
agreement that renews annually unless either party notifies the other of its decision not
to renew. VetTest

®

slides are supplied exclusively by Ortho under supply
agreements with Ortho (the “Ortho Agreements”). We are required to purchase all
of our requirements for our current menu of VetTest

®

slides from Ortho to
the extent Ortho is able to supply those requirements. In addition, we have committed to
minimum annual purchase volumes of certain VetTest

®

slides through 2010.
The Ortho Agreements expire on December 31, 2018.


The
QBC

®

VetAutoread™ system is manufactured for us by Becton Dickinson
under a development and distribution agreement that requires Becton Dickinson to supply
analyzers to us through 2008 and reagents through 2010. Becton Dickinson is the sole
source of these analyzers and reagents.

The
VetLyte

®

system is manufactured for us by Roche Diagnostics Corporation
under an agreement that requires Roche Diagnostics to supply analyzers through December
31, 2006, and consumables and spare parts through December 31, 2013. We have certain
minimum purchase obligations under this agreement.

We
purchase certain other products, raw materials and components from only one source. These
include active ingredients for our pharmaceutical products, including
Navigator

®

, digital radiography systems, VetStat™ instruments and
consumables, and certain components used in our SNAP

®

rapid assay devices,
water testing products and LaserCyte

®

systems.

We
have in the past been successful in extending important sole and single source supply
agreements to ensure an uninterrupted supply of the relevant products, and we will seek in
the future to extend any such agreements that would otherwise expire under their terms.
However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in extending any such
agreements on equivalent or better terms, or that we will be able to extend such
agreements at all.

We
do not generally maintain significant backlog and believe that our backlog at any
particular date historically has not been indicative of future sales.

COMPETITION

We
face intense competition within the markets in which we sell our products and services. We
expect that future competition will become even more intense, and that we will have to
compete with changing technologies, which could affect the marketability of our products
and services. Our competitive position also will depend on our ability to develop
proprietary products, attract and retain qualified scientific and other personnel, develop
and implement production and marketing plans, obtain or license patent rights and obtain adequate
capital resources.

We
compete with many companies ranging from small businesses focused on animal health to
large pharmaceutical companies. Our competitors vary in our different markets. Academic
institutions, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations
also conduct research activities and may commercialize products, which could compete with
our products, on their own or through joint ventures. Some of our competitors have
substantially greater capital, manufacturing, marketing, and research and development
resources than we do.

Competitive
factors in our different business areas are detailed below:

•

Veterinary
diagnostic products and food and water testing products

. We compete primarily on the
basis of the ease of use, speed, accuracy and other performance characteristics of our
products and services, the breadth of our product line and services, the effectiveness of
our sales and distribution channels, the quality of our technical and customer service,
and our pricing relative to the value of our products.

•

Veterinary
laboratory and consulting services

. In this market, we compete primarily on the basis
of quality, service, technology, and our pricing relative to the value of our services.
We compete in certain geographic locations with Antech Diagnostics, a unit of VCA Antech,
Inc.

•

Veterinary
pharmaceuticals

. We compete primarily on the basis of the performance characteristics
of our products.

•

Information
products and services and digital radiography systems

. We compete primarily on the
basis of ease of use, connectivity to equipment and other systems, performance
characteristics, effectiveness of our customer service, information handling
capabilities, advances in technologies, and our pricing relative to the value of our
products and services.


GOVERNMENT REGULATION

Many
of our products are subject to regulation by U.S. and foreign regulatory agencies.  The
following is a description of the principal regulations affecting our businesses.

Veterinary
diagnostic products

. Most diagnostic tests for animal health applications are
veterinary biological products that are regulated in the U.S. by the Center for Veterinary
Biologics within the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (“APHIS”).
The APHIS regulatory approval process involves the submission of product performance data
and manufacturing documentation. Following regulatory approval to market a product, APHIS
requires that each lot of product be submitted for review before release to customers. In
addition, APHIS requires special approval to market products where test results are used
in part for government-mandated disease management programs. A number of foreign
governments accept APHIS approval as part of their separate regulatory approvals. However,
compliance with an extensive regulatory process is required in connection with marketing
diagnostic products in Japan, Germany, the Netherlands and many other countries. We also
are required to have a facility license from APHIS to manufacture USDA-licensed products.
We have obtained such a license for our manufacturing facility in Westbrook, Maine.

Our
instrument systems are medical devices regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(“FDA”) under the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act (the “FDC Act”). While
the sale of these products does not require premarket approval by FDA and does not subject
us to the FDA’s Good Manufacturing Practices regulations (“GMPs”), these
products must not be adulterated or misbranded under the FDC Act.

Veterinary
pharmaceuticals

. The manufacture and sale of veterinary pharmaceuticals are regulated
by the Center for Veterinary Medicine (“CVM”) of the FDA. A new animal drug may
not be commercially marketed in the U.S. unless it has been approved as safe and effective
by CVM. Approval may be requested by filing an NADA with CVM containing substantial
evidence as to the safety and effectiveness of the drug. Data regarding manufacturing
methods and controls also are required to be submitted with the NADA. Manufacturers of
animal drugs must also comply with GMPs and Good Laboratory Practices (“GLPs”).
Sales of animal drugs in countries outside the U.S. require compliance with the laws of
those countries, which may be extensive.

Water
testing products

. Our water tests are not subject to formal premarket regulatory
approval. However, before a test can be used as part of a water-quality monitoring program
required by the EPA, the test must first be approved by the EPA. The EPA approval process
involves submission of extensive product performance data in accordance with an EPA-approved
protocol, evaluation of the data by the EPA and publication for public comment of
any proposed approval in the Federal Register before final approval. Our
Colilert

®

, Colilert-18, Colisure

®

,
Quanti-Tray

®

, Filta-Max

®

and SimPlate

®

for
heterotropic plate counts (“HPC”) products have been approved by the EPA. The
sale of water-testing products also is subject to extensive and lengthy regulatory
processes in many other countries around the world.

Dairy
testing products

. The sale of dairy testing products in the U.S. is regulated by the
FDA in conjunction with the Association of Official Analytical Chemists — Research
Institute (“AOAC-RI”). Before a product can be sold, extensive product
performance data must be submitted in accordance with a protocol that is approved by the
FDA and the AOAC-RI. Following approval of a product by the FDA, the product must also be
approved by the National Conference on Interstate Milk Shipments (“NCIMS”), an
oversight body that includes state, federal and industry representatives. Our dairy
antibiotic residue testing products have been approved by the FDA and NCIMS. While some
foreign countries accept AOAC-RI approval as part of their regulatory approval process,
many countries have separate regulatory processes.

Any
acquisitions of new products and technologies may subject us to additional areas of
government regulation. These may involve food, drug and water-quality regulations of the
FDA, the EPA and the USDA, as well as state, local and foreign governments. See
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations—Future Operating Results.”

EMPLOYEES

As
of December 31, 2004, IDEXX had approximately 2,995 full-time and part-time employees. We
are not a party to any collective bargaining agreement and we believe that relations with
our employees are good.


ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

We
lease approximately 297,000 square feet of office and manufacturing space in Westbrook,
Maine, under a lease expiring in 2018; approximately 97,500 square feet of industrial space
in Memphis, Tennessee, for use as a distribution facility, under a lease expiring in 2013;
approximately 40,000 square feet of office and manufacturing space in Eau Claire,
Wisconsin, for our veterinary practice information management software business, under a
lease expiring in 2009; and approximately 48,000 square feet of warehouse and office space
in the Netherlands for use as our headquarters for European operations, under a lease
expiring in 2008.

We
also lease a total of approximately 40,000 square feet of smaller office, manufacturing
and warehouse space in the U.S. and elsewhere in the world. In addition, we own or lease
approximately 203,000 square feet of space in the U.S., Australia, Germany, Switzerland
and the United Kingdom for use as veterinary reference laboratories and office space for
our veterinary consulting services. Of this space, 69,000 square feet is owned by us and
the remaining amount is leased, under leases having expiration dates up to the year 2012.

We

ITEM 7.
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

BUSINESS OVERVIEW

We
operate primarily through three business segments: the Companion Animal Group
(“CAG”), Water testing business (“Water”) and the Food Diagnostics
Group (“FDG”). CAG is comprised of the following product and service categories:
rapid assays, instruments and consumables, laboratory and consulting services,
pharmaceuticals, and information products and services and digital radiography systems.
Water develops, designs, manufactures and distributes products to detect contaminants in
water. FDG develops, designs, manufactures and distributes products to detect disease and
contaminants in production animals and food. Other items that are not included in our
reportable segments are comprised primarily of corporate research and development and
interest income. We have conformed the financial information about segments for the year
ended December 31, 2002 to our presentation of reportable segments for the years ended
December 31, 2004 and 2003. Previously we reported two operating segments. Additionally,
we have conformed the discussion of CAG results for 2002 and 2003 to the product and
service categories we are using in 2004 as set forth in the table below.


For
the three years ended December 31, 2004 revenues by product and service categories were as
follows

(in thousands

):

The
following is a discussion of the strategic and operating factors that we believe have the
most significant effect on the performance of our business.

Companion
Animal Group

In
the CAG segment, we believe we have developed a strategic advantage over companies with
more narrow product or service offerings. The breadth of our products and services gives
us scale in sales and distribution, permits us to offer integrated disease-management
solutions that leverage the advantages of both point-of-care and laboratory testing, and
facilitates the flow of medical information in the clinic by integrating practice-management
software systems with laboratory test results and in-clinic test results from
our IDEXX VetLab

®

analyzers.

In
the U.S., we sell instrument consumables, rapid assays and pharmaceuticals primarily
through distributors, and, therefore, our reported sales of these products are sales made to
distributors, rather than sales to veterinarians, the end-users. Because distributor
inventory levels and purchasing patterns may fluctuate, sales of a particular product line
in a particular period may not always be representative of the underlying customer demand
for the product. Therefore, we closely track sales of these products by our U.S.
distributors to the clinics (“clinic-level sales”), which we think provides a
more accurate picture of the real growth rate for these products. In the discussion of
results below, we note certain instances where we believe reported sales have been
influenced, positively or negatively, by changes in distributor inventories.

Instruments
and Instrument Consumables

. Our instrument strategy is to provide veterinarians with
an integrated set of instruments that, individually and together, provide superior
diagnostic information in the clinic, enabling veterinarians to practice better medicine
and build more profitable practices. We derive substantial revenues from the sale of
consumables that are used in these instruments. During the early stage of an instrument's
life cycle, we derive relatively greater revenues from instrument placements, while
consumable sales become relatively more significant in later stages as the installed base
of instruments increases and instrument placements begin to decline.

We
have a large installed base of VetTest

®

chemistry analyzers, and substantially all of
our revenues from that product line are now derived from consumables sales, although we
continue to place instruments through sales and through rental and other programs. Our
long-term success in this area of our business is dependent upon new customer acquisition,
customer retention and increased customer utilization of those instruments. To increase
utilization, we seek to educate veterinarians about best medical practices that emphasize
the importance of blood and urine chemistry testing for a variety of diagnostic purposes.


We
purchase the consumables used in VetTest

®

chemistry analyzers from Ortho
under a supply agreement that continues through 2018. This supply agreement provides us
with a long-term source of slides at costs that improve annually through 2010, and also
improve over the term of the agreement as a result of increasing volume. Under this
agreement, we are developing and expect to introduce a next-generation chemistry analyzer for
the veterinary market based on the Ortho dry-slide technology, and Ortho would supply us
with slide consumables used in both the new instrument and the VetTest

®

chemistry analyzer. We do not expect this next-generation analyzer to be commercially
available before 2006. Our declining cost of VetTest slides is expected to improve margins
in our instruments and consumables product line beginning in 2006.

In
the fourth quarter of 2002, we introduced the LaserCyte

®

hematology
analyzer, which provides more extensive hematological diagnostic information than our
original platform, the QBC

®

VetAutoread™ system. A substantial portion
of LaserCyte

®

placements have been made at veterinary clinics that already
own our QBC

®

VetAutoread™ instruments. Although we have experienced
growth in sales of hematology consumables, LaserCyte

®

consumable sales have
been partially offset by declines in sales of QBC

®

VetAutoread™
consumables. Because the gross margin percentage of LaserCyte

®

consumables
exceeds the gross margin percentage of the QBC

®

VetAutoread™
consumables, gross margin from hematology consumables is expected to increase with continued
penetration of the LaserCyte

®

system. Our gross margins on
LaserCyte

®

system sales have been low due to higher manufacturing, service
and warranty costs associated with a new analyzer. As we have gained experience with the
analyzer, we have improved manufacturing efficiency and reduced warranty and service costs,
which has improved margins. While we expect that LaserCyte

®

margins will continue to
improve, they will continue to have a negative impact on overall CAG gross margins.

With
all of our instrument lines, we seek to differentiate our products based on superior
system capability, quality of diagnostic information, reliability, integration with the
IDEXX VetLab

®

suite, and customer service. Our equipment and consumables typically are sold
at a premium price to competitive offerings. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to
maintain a premium price strategy.

Laboratory
and Consulting Services

. We believe that more than half of all diagnostic testing by
U.S. veterinarians is done at outside reference laboratories such as our IDEXX Reference
Laboratories. We attempt to differentiate our laboratory testing services from those of
our competitors primarily on the basis of quality, customer service and technology.
Revenue growth in this business is achieved both through increased sales at existing
laboratories and through the acquisition of new customers, including through laboratory
acquisitions and opening new laboratories. In February 2004, we acquired a laboratory in
Columbus, Ohio, in November 2004, we opened a laboratory in Seattle, Washington, and we
acquired Vet Med Lab, which is based in Germany and is the largest European veterinary
reference laboratory. Profitability of this business is largely the result of our ability
to achieve efficiencies from both volume and operational improvements. New laboratories
typically will operate at a loss until testing volumes reach a level that permits
profitability. Acquired laboratories frequently operate less profitably than our existing
laboratories and those laboratories may not achieve profitability comparable to our
existing laboratories for a year or more while we implement operating improvements.
Therefore, in the short term, new and acquired laboratories generally will have a negative
effect on the operating margin of the laboratory and consulting services business.

Rapid
Assays

. Our rapid assay business comprises single-use kits for in-clinic testing and
microwell-based kits for large clinic and laboratory testing for canine and feline
diseases and conditions. Our rapid assay strategy is to develop, manufacture, market and
sell proprietary tests with superior performance that address important medical needs. As
in our other lines of business, we also seek to differentiate our products through
superior customer support. These products carry price premiums over competitive products
that we believe do not offer equivalent performance and diagnostic capabilities, and which
we believe do not include a similar level of support. We augment our product development
and customer service efforts with marketing programs that enhance medical awareness and
understanding regarding our target diseases and the importance of diagnostic testing.

Water

Our
strategy in the water testing business is to develop, manufacture, market and sell
proprietary products with superior performance, supported by exceptional customer service.
Our customers are primarily water utilities to whom strong relationships and customer
support are very important. Over the past several years, the rate of growth of this product
line has slowed as a result of increased competition and market penetration. International
sales of water-testing products represented 41% of total water product sales in 2004, and
we expect that future growth in this business will be significantly dependent on our
ability to increase international sales. Growth also will be dependent on our ability to
enhance and broaden our product line. Most water microbiological testing is driven by
regulation, and, in many countries, a test may not be used for regulatory testing unless it
has been approved by the applicable regulatory body. As a result, we maintain an active
regulatory program under which we are seeking regulatory approvals in a number of
countries, primarily in Europe.


Food
Diagnostics Group

Production
Animal Services

. We develop, manufacture, market and sell a broad range of tests for
various poultry, cattle and swine diseases and conditions, and have an active research and
development and in-licensing program in this area. Our strategy is to offer proprietary
tests with superior performance characteristics. Disease outbreaks are episodic and
unpredictable, and certain diseases that are prevalent at one time may be substantially
contained or eradicated. In response to outbreaks, testing initiatives may lead to
exceptional demand for certain products in certain periods. Conversely, successful
eradication programs may result in significantly decreased demand for certain products.
The performance of this business, therefore, can be subject to fluctuation. In 2004,
approximately 73% of our sales in this business was international. Because of the
significant dependence of this business on international sales, the performance of the
business is particularly subject to the various risks described below that are associated
with doing business internationally.

In
2004, we received USDA approval of our postmortem test for BSE (mad cow disease) and, in
February 2005, we were informed that this test was approved by the European Commission for sale
in EU member countries. While BSE testing is very limited in the U.S., a significant
market for BSE testing exists in Europe, and marketing and sale of this product will be a
major priority for our Production Animal Services business in 2005.

Dairy
Testing

. Our strategy in the dairy testing business is to develop, manufacture and
sell antibiotic residue-testing products that satisfy applicable regulatory requirements
for testing of bulk milk by producers and provide reliable field performance. Sales of
dairy-testing products have declined over the last several years largely as a result of
increased competition in the domestic market. To increase sales of dairy-testing products,
we will need to increase penetration in geographies outside the United States and in the
farm segment of the dairy market.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING
POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

The
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based
upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial
statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of
assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related
to customer programs and incentives, product returns, bad debts, inventories, investments,
intangible assets, income taxes, warranty obligations, restructuring and contingencies, and
litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other
assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of
which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and
liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ
from these estimates.

We
believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments
and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.

Inventory

Our
inventories include material, labor and overhead, and are stated at the lower of cost
(first-in, first-out) or market. We write down inventory for estimated obsolescence when
warranted by our estimates of future demand and market conditions. If actual market
conditions are less favorable than those estimated by management, additional inventory
write-downs may be required, which would have a negative effect on our results of
operations.

As
of December 31, 2004 and 2003, our net inventories included $11.9 million and $7.2
million, respectively, of component parts and finished goods associated with our
LaserCyte

®

hematology instrument. In addition, we had firm purchase
commitments for an additional $1.9 million of component parts as of December 31, 2004. As
of December 31, 2004 and 2003, $2.2 million and $3.7 million of this inventory,
respectively, required rework before it could be used to manufacture finished goods. As of
December 31, 2004, the inventory was net of a $0.3 million write-down for inventory
estimated to be obsolete. There were no write-downs of this inventory as of December 31,
2003 for inventory estimated to be obsolete. We expect to fully realize our investment in
inventory and purchase commitments. However, if we alter the design of this product, we
may be required to write off some or all of the remaining associated inventory.


Navigator

®

is our pharmaceutical product for the treatment of equine protozoal myeloencephalitis
(“EPM”) that we launched during the fourth quarter of 2003. Our inventories as
of December 31, 2004 included $8.7 million of inventory associated with
Navigator

®

, consisting of $0.4 million of finished goods and $8.3 million
of active ingredient and other raw materials. In December 2004, we entered into an
amendment to our agreement with our supplier of nitazoxanide, the active ingredient in
Navigator

®

, under which we paid the supplier $0.9 million in January 2005,
and the supplier agreed until 2017 to replace any expiring inventory of nitazoxanide with
longer-dated material. We believe that this agreement has substantially mitigated the risk
that we would be required to write down nitazoxanide inventory due to its anticipated
expiration prior to sale.

Valuation
of Long-Lived and Intangible Assets and Goodwill

We
assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles, long-lived assets and goodwill whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be
recoverable. Factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include,
but are not limited to, the following:

•

Significant
under-performance relative to historical or projected future operating results;

•

Failure
to obtain regulatory approval of certain products;

•

Significant
changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall
         business;

•

Significant
increase in the discount rate assumed to calculate the present value of future cash flow;

•

Significant
negative industry or economic trends; and

•

Significant
advancements or changes in technology.

When
we determine that the carrying value of intangibles, long-lived assets and goodwill may
not be recoverable based on a change in events and circumstances discussed above, we
measure any impairment based on factors such as projected cash flows. Net intangible
assets and goodwill totaled $124.5 million as of December 31, 2004, consisting of $69.2
million related to veterinary laboratories (of which $54.1 million represents goodwill),
$19.3 million related to production animal services (of which $7.6 million represents
goodwill), $19.2 million related to water-testing products (of which $16.9 million represents
goodwill), $15.7 million related to pharmaceutical products (of which $13.7 million
represents goodwill), and $1.1 million of other (of which $0.6 million represents
goodwill).

Revenue
Recognition

We
recognize revenue when four criteria are met. These include (i) persuasive evidence that
an arrangement exists, (ii) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, (iii)
the sales price is fixed and determinable, and (iv) collectibility is reasonably assured.

•

We
recognize revenue at the time of shipment to distributors for substantially all products
sold through distributors, as title and risk of loss pass to these customers on delivery
to the common carrier. We recognize revenue for the remainder of our customers when the
product is delivered, except as noted below. Our distributors do not have the right to
return products.

•

We
recognize revenue on sales of instruments after the instrument is installed because
installation is considered essential to the usability of the instrument, and the customer
has accepted the instrument.

•

We
recognize service revenue at the time the service is performed.

•

We
recognize revenue associated with extended maintenance agreements ratably over the life
of the contracts. Amounts collected in advance of revenue recognition are recorded as a
current or long-term liability based on the time from the balance sheet date to the
future date of revenue recognition.


•

We
recognize revenue from noncancelable software licenses and hardware systems upon
installation of the software (and completion of training if applicable) or hardware and
customer acceptance because collection is probable and we have no significant further
obligations.

•

We
recognize revenue on certain instrument systems under rental programs over the life of
the rental agreement. Amounts collected in advance of revenue recognition are recorded as
a current or long-term liability based on the time from the balance sheet date to the
future date of revenue recognition.

When
instruments are sold together with extended maintenance agreements, we allocate revenue to
the extended maintenance agreement under EITF 00-21, “Accounting for Revenue
Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables.” Accordingly, the total consideration
received is allocated to the elements based on their relative fair values, which is
determined by amounts charged separately for the delivered and undelivered elements to
other customers. The deferred revenue related to the extended maintenance agreements is
recognized ratably over the maintenance period. The delivered elements are recognized as
revenue when appropriate under the policies described above. Shipping costs reimbursed by
the customer are included in revenue.

We
record estimated reductions to revenue in connection with customer programs and incentive
offerings, which may give customers credits, award points, which may be applied to trade
amounts owed us and/or toward future purchase of our products and services, or trade-in
rights. We estimate these reductions based on our experience with similar customer
programs in prior years. Revenue reductions are recorded on a quarterly basis based on
issuance of credits, points actually awarded and estimates of points to be awarded in the
future based on current revenue. For the SNAP-Up-the-Savings™ program, estimates of
future points are revised quarterly and finalized annually in the third quarter of each
year upon the issuance of points to customers. For our Practice Developer™ volume
discount program, we have reduced revenue assuming all points granted will result in
future credits because we do not have sufficient experience with this program to estimate
customer point forfeitures.

We
may offer customers the right to trade in instruments for credit against the purchase
price of other instruments acquired in the future. For these trade-in rights, we have
reduced revenue using estimates regarding the percentage of qualifying instruments that
will be traded in and the average trade-in value. In 2001, we began offering guaranteed
trade-in values on current sales of our QBC

®

VetAutoread™ instruments,
when the customer subsequently trades in the QBC

®

VetAutoread™ instrument
for a LaserCyte

®

system. To qualify for a guaranteed trade-in value, the
customer must trade in their QBC

®

VetAutoread™ instrument within five
years of original purchase. The value of the trade-in depends on the amount of time from
original purchase to trade-in. We have recorded a trade-in reserve of $0.5 million for
these trade-ins. The maximum trade-in liability at December 31, 2004 was $3.4 million and
we anticipate that we would receive equipment valued at $0.9 million if all customers were
to exercise their trade-in rights.

We
recognize revenue only in those situations where collection from the customer is
reasonably assured. We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses
resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. We base our
estimates on detailed analysis of specific customer situations and  the percentage of our
accounts receivable by aging category. If the financial condition of our customers were to
deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional
allowances might be required.

Income
Taxes

We
account for income taxes under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 109, “Accounting
for Income Taxes” (“SFAS No. 109”). This
statement requires that we recognize a current tax liability or asset for current taxes
payable or refundable, respectively; and a deferred tax liability or asset, as the case
may be, for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between book and tax
treatment of assets and liabilities and carryforwards to the extent they are realizable.
We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is
more likely than not to be realized. We have recorded a valuation allowance on certain
deferred tax assets that relate to state and international net operating loss
carryforwards and certain other unrealizable international deferred tax assets. While we
have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning
strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event we were to
determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess
of the net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income
in the period such determination was made. Likewise, should we determine that we would not
be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment
to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was
made.


We
consider the operating earnings of non-United States subsidiaries to be indefinitely
invested outside the United States, the cumulative amount of which was $85.5 million as of
December 31, 2004. No provision has been made for United States federal and state, or
international taxes that may result from future remittances of undistributed earnings of
non-United States subsidiaries. Should we repatriate non-United States earnings, we would
have to adjust the income tax provision in the period in which the decision to repatriate
earnings is made.

The
recently enacted

American Jobs Creation Act of 2004

allows for a reduced rate of
United States tax on qualifying repatriations of earnings held outside the United States.
We are currently studying the impact of this provision and we have not made a final
determination as to the amounts, if any, that will be repatriated. As such, the income tax
effect of any repatriation cannot be estimated.

Warranty
Reserves

We
provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized.
Our actual warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and service costs
incurred in correcting a product failure. Should actual product failure rates or service
costs differ from our estimates, which are based on historical data, revisions to the
estimated warranty liability would be required. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, we had
accrued $3.7 million and $3.3 million for estimated warranty expense, respectively,
including warranty reserves of $3.3 million and $3.1 million, respectively, for
LaserCyte

®

systems. Warranty expense was $3.6 million, $3.6 million and
$0.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

The
increase in warranty liability during 2004 compared to 2003 was due to the impact of the
growing installed base of LaserCyte

®

systems, partially offset by a
reduction of warranty cost resulting from our improved service experience for these
instruments. We charge warranty expense to the cost of LaserCyte

®

revenue
at the time revenue is recognized on the system based on the estimated cost to repair the
instrument over its two-year warranty period. Cost of revenue reflects not only estimated
warranty expense for the systems sold in the current period, but also any changes in
estimated warranty expense for the installed base that results from our quarterly
evaluation of service experience. The reduction in estimated warranty costs per instrument
resulted in a reduction of $0.6 million in cost of product revenue for the year ended
December 31, 2004.

We
sell extended maintenance agreements covering our instruments. We anticipate that losses
will be incurred for certain of these contracts and have recognized provisions for the
estimated losses. The anticipated loss reserves were $0.1 million and $0.4 million as of
December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Estimates
for Certain Claims

We
purchase insurance policies annually for individual and aggregate amounts of employee
health insurance claims. We are self-insured for up to $0.1 million per claim and up to an
annual aggregate limit based on the number of employees enrolled in the plan per month,
which was estimated to be $12.0 million as of December 31, 2004. We estimate our liability
for employee health claims based on individual and aggregate coverage, our monthly claims
experience, the number of employees enrolled in the program, and the average time from
when a claim is incurred to the time it is reported.

We
purchase workers’ compensation insurance policies annually. Prior to January 1, 2003,
we were fully insured for workers’ compensation claims. Beginning January 1, 2003, we
purchased an insurance policy under which we are liable for the first $0.25 million in
claims per occurrence and up to an aggregate limit based on payroll, which was
approximately $3.0 million and $1.4 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
We entered into a similar policy effective January 1, 2005. We estimate our liability for
workers’ compensation claims based on the insurance policy limits, claims incurred
and the estimated ultimate cost to litigate and/or settle the claims. Based on this
analysis, we have recognized cumulative expenses of $0.6 million and $0.9 million for
claims incurred during the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Periodically
we are notified that a claim is being made against us. We evaluate each claim based on the
facts and circumstances of that claim. If warranted, we provide for our best estimate of
the cost to settle or litigate the claim and evaluate the liability recorded quarterly.

Represents
the percentage change in revenue attributed to the effect of changes           in

Companion
Animal Group.

Revenue for CAG increased $64.3 million, or 17%, to $448.7 million from
$384.4 million in the same period of the prior year. This increase resulted primarily from
increased sales of laboratory and consulting services, and instruments and consumables and,
to a lesser degree, rapid assay products, information products and services, digital
radiography systems, and pharmaceutical products. The favorable impact of currency
exchange rates on sales outside the U.S. contributed an aggregate of $10.5 million, or 3%,
to the increase in CAG revenue.

The
increase in sales of laboratory and consulting services (an increase of $23.9 million, or
25%) resulted primarily from higher testing volume at established laboratories, mainly in
the U.S. and, to a lesser extent, in the U.K. and Australia; the inclusion of sales from
laboratories acquired in late 2003 and in 2004; and, to a lesser extent, the favorable
impact of currency exchange rates on sales at our laboratories outside the U.S. and higher
pricing. Growth in sales of laboratory services in 2005 will continue to be positively
affected by the inclusion of results from Vet Med Lab, a German veterinary reference
laboratory that we acquired in November 2004. For 2005, we expect incremental sales from
Vet Med Lab of $20.0 million to $25.0 million.

The
increase in sales of instruments and consumables (an increase of $20.6 million, or 12%)
was due mainly to increased sales volume, including higher domestic clinic-level sales of
VetTest

®

slides and, to a lesser extent, tubes used with our hematology
instruments, as well as higher volume outside the U.S.; the favorable impact of currency
exchange rates on sales outside the U.S.; increased instrument sales, due primarily to
increased sales of the LaserCyte

®

hematology system; and the impact of
changes in distributors’ inventory levels. Increased consumables sales volume was due
primarily to an increase in our installed base of instruments during 2003 and 2004.
Shipments to distributors during the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 were reduced as
a result of the Company’s continuing efforts to improve efficiency in the
distribution channel. The reduced shipments during 2003 had a positive impact on sales
growth in the 2004 period. The collective impact of favorable currency exchange and
favorable comparisons resulting from lower distributor purchases in 2003 caused reported
growth for 2004 to be higher than our estimates of the underlying clinic-level growth of
instruments and consumables.

The
increase in sales of rapid assay products (an increase of $10.5 million, or 13%) was due
primarily to increased domestic clinic-level sales volume of canine and, to a lesser
extent, feline products, as well as demand for our new SNAP

®

test to screen
dogs and cats for

Giardia

infection, which was launched during the first quarter of
2004; the impact of changes in distributors’ inventory levels; and the favorable
impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the U.S. Shipments to distributors
during 2003 were reduced as a result of the Company’s efforts to improve efficiency
in the distribution channel, which contributed to a reported sales growth in the 2004
period. The collective impact of changes in distributor inventory levels and favorable
currency exchange caused reported growth for 2004 to be higher than our estimates of the
underlying clinic-level growth of rapid assay products.


The
increase in sales of information products and services and digital radiography systems (an
increase of $5.7 million, or 25%), resulted primarily from higher volume of complete
system sales and increased hardware sales and placements of digital radiography systems,
partly offset by lower service sales.

The
increase in sales of pharmaceutical products (an increase of $3.5 million, or 51%)
resulted in part from sales of new products launched in 2003 and 2004. For 2005, we expect
slower growth in pharmaceutical sales since we will not benefit from the favorable
comparisons created by the 2003 and 2004 product launches, and no new product launches are
planned for 2005.

Water.

Revenue
for Water increased $6.2 million, or 13%, to $53.1 million from $46.9           million
for the same period of the prior year. The increase resulted primarily           from
higher sales volume and, to a lesser extent, the favorable impact of           currency
exchange rates on sales outside the U.S., partly offset by lower           average unit
prices due to price competition in certain foreign countries and           higher
relative sales in geographies where products are sold at lower unit           prices. The
favorable impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the           U.S.
contributed an aggregate of $1.9 million, or 4%, to the increase in Water
          revenue. For 2005, we expect slower growth in Water sales due, in part, to
          increased competitive pressures.

Food
Diagnostics Group.

Revenue for FDG increased $2.8 million, or 6%, to $47.4 million
from $44.6 million for the same period of the prior year. The increase was due primarily
to the favorable impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the U.S. and higher
sales volume of production animal diagnostics. These increases were partly offset by lower
average unit prices of production animal diagnostics and dairy-testing products, and by
decreased sales volume of dairy-testing products. The increase in production animal
diagnostics sales was due to increased sales volume of livestock products outside the U.S.
The lower average unit prices were attributable to greater price competition in certain
geographies and, to a lesser extent, to higher relative sales in geographies where
products are sold at lower unit prices. The favorable impact of currency exchange rates on
sales outside the U.S. contributed an aggregate of $2.4 million, or 5%, to the increase in
FDG revenue. For 2005, we anticipate increased FDG revenue growth led by the launch of our
HerdChek

®

BSE Antigen Test Kit, a rapid test for detection of bovine
spongiform encephalopathy (“BSE”) in Europe and the full-year impact of our
acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2004 of Dr. Bommeli AG (“Bommeli”), a Swiss
manufacturer of production animal diagnostics.

Gross Profit

Total
Company.

Gross profit for the total company increased $48.7 million, or 21%, to $279.0

total company revenue, gross profit increased to 51% in 2004 from 48% in 2003. The

As

our segments.

Companion
Animal Group.

Gross profit for CAG increased $39.3 million, or 22%, to $214.9 million
from $175.6 million in the same period of the prior year due to increased sales volume
across the CAG product lines and to an increase in the gross profit percentage. As a
percentage of CAG revenue, gross profit increased to 48% from 46% for the same period in
the prior year. The increase in gross profit percentage was attributable primarily to
productivity improvements across CAG product lines and services; the favorable impact of
foreign currency rates on sales denominated in those currencies, net of foreign exchange
hedge contract losses; and, to a lesser extent, favorable pricing from our supplier of
slide consumables compared to the same period of the prior year. The productivity
improvements were partly due to manufacturing efficiencies and reductions in service costs
related to our LaserCyte

®

hematology instrument and, to a lesser extent, to
fixed costs spread over a higher revenue base. The LaserCyte

®

service cost
improvements generated a favorable change in our accruals for cost of product warranties
and extended maintenance agreements for all placed instruments for which we have such
future obligations. Beginning in 2006, we expect CAG gross margin percentage to be
favorably affected by improved consumable costs under our supply agreement with Ortho.


These
increases in gross profit percentage were partially offset by a lower gross margin
percentage recognized from laboratories acquired in 2004, including due to the purchase
accounting impact of writing off supplies and, to a lesser extent, by other laboratory
service expansion costs, including start-up costs of laboratories opened in the fourth
quarters of 2003 and 2004. The greater proportion of laboratory sales, resulting largely
from the 2004 acquisitions, relative to total CAG sales may negatively impact our CAG
gross margin percentage as laboratory services generally have a lower gross margin than
our product businesses.

Water.

Gross
profit for Water increased $4.4 million, or 14%, to $35.9 million from           $31.5
million for the same period in the prior year, primarily due to increased
          revenue. As a percentage of Water revenue, gross profit increased to 68% from
          67% for the same period in the prior year. The increase in gross profit
          percentage was attributable primarily to the favorable impact of foreign
          currency rates on sales denominated in those currencies, net of foreign
exchange           hedge contract losses.

Food
Diagnostics Group.

Gross profit for FDG increased $5.0 million, or 22%, to $28.2
million from $23.2 million for the same period in the prior year, primarily due to an
increase in the gross profit percentage. As a percentage of FDG revenue, gross profit
increased to 60% from 52% for the same period in the prior year. The increase in gross
profit percentage was attributable primarily to reductions in an accrual related to a
third-party claim resulting from the settlement of that claim and the favorable impact of
foreign currency rates on sales denominated in those currencies, net of foreign exchange
hedge contract losses, partly offset by unfavorable product costs. The reduction in the
accrual for the third-party claim resulted in an aggregate benefit recognized in 2004 of
$1.8 million or a four-percentage-point increase in the gross margin percentage. The
unfavorable product costs were due to fixed costs spread over lower production volume in
Europe and, to a lesser extent, the impact of expensing a portion of the purchase
accounting fair market value adjustment of inventory obtained in connection with the 2004
acquisitions. We expect to incur integration costs in 2005 associated with the Bommeli
acquisition that will negatively impact our FDG gross margin percentage.

Operating Expenses

Total
Company.

Total company operating expenses increased $21.1 million to $171.0 million
from $149.9 million for the same period of the prior year. As a percentage of revenues,
operating expenses remained relatively constant at 31%. The following tables present

Companion
Animal Group.

Operating expenses for CAG increased $17.4 million, or 14%, to $137.8
million from $120.4 million in the same period of the prior year and were approximately
constant at 31% from year to year as a percent of sales. The increase was attributable to
a 23% ($13.4 million) increase in sales and marketing expense, a 10% ($2.4 million)
increase in research and development expense, and a 4% ($1.6 million) increase in general
and administrative expense. The increase in sales and marketing expense resulted primarily
from increased sales and sales support personnel and marketing program costs; the
unfavorable impact of foreign currency denominated expenses; and, to a lesser extent,
expenses associated with the Vet Med Lab acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2004. The
increase in research and development expense resulted primarily from increased staffing
and higher spending to support instrument and pharmaceutical product development. The
increase in general and administrative expense reflects higher spending on information
technology and other corporate functions, partly due to expenses associated with
Sarbanes-Oxley Act compliance efforts; expenses associated with laboratory acquisitions in
the first and fourth quarters of 2004, including amortization of intangible assets; and
the unfavorable impact of foreign currency denominated expenses, partly offset by the
nonrecurrence in 2004 of expenses incurred in 2003 in connection with the write-down of
fixed assets associated with the discontinuation of development of a clinical chemistry
instrument. In October 2003, we extended our relationship with Ortho, the supplier of our
VetTest

®

slides. We committed to develop a next-generation clinical
chemistry system based on Ortho’s dry-slide technology and discontinued efforts to
develop the alternative system.

For
2005, we expect CAG operating expenses to increase as a percent of sales due primarily to
the full year impact of 2004 sales and customer support personnel additions in the U.S., as
well as similar investments we plan to make in Europe, and to integration costs and
intangible amortization expense associated with the Vet Med Lab acquisition during the
fourth quarter of 2004, partly offset by a slight decline in research and development
expense as a percent of sales as laboratory services, with its negligible research and
development spending requirements, account for a greater proportion of total CAG sales.

Water.

Operating
expenses for Water increased $1.1 million, or 10%, to $11.6 million           from $10.5
million in the same period of the prior year and were approximately           constant at
22% from year to year as a percent of sales. The increase was           attributable to a
25% ($0.8 million) increase in general and administrative           expense, a 7% ($0.1
million) increase in research and development expense, and a           2% ($0.1 million)
increase in sales and marketing expense. The increase in           general and
administrative expense reflects higher spending on information           technology and
other corporate functions, partly due to expenses associated with
          Sarbanes-Oxley Act compliance efforts; the unfavorable impact of foreign
          currency denominated expenses; and the impact of a gain from a legal settlement
          in 2003 that was recorded as a reduction to general and administrative expense.
          There were no significant fluctuations in the nature and amounts of research
and           development expense or of sales and marketing expense.

Food
Diagnostics Group.

Operating expenses for FDG increased $2.8 million, or 18%, to $18.4
million from $15.6 million in the same period of the prior year and, as a percent of
sales, increased to 39% from 35% in the same period of the prior year. The increase was
attributable to a 25% ($1.1 million) increase in general and administrative expense, a 14%
($0.6 million) increase in research and development expense, a 5% ($0.3 million) increase
in sales and marketing expense, and a $0.7 million decrease in other income. The increase
in general and administrative expense resulted primarily from ongoing expenses associated
with the China joint venture formed in 2003; higher spending on information technology and
other corporate functions, partly due to expenses associated with Sarbanes-Oxley Act
compliance efforts; the unfavorable impact of foreign currency denominated expenses; and
expenses associated with the Bommeli acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2004. The
increase in research and development expense was due primarily to higher compensation
costs for additional personnel; increased spending in support of our
HerdChek

®

BSE Antigen Test Kit; and expenses associated with the Bommeli
acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2004. The increase in sales and marketing expense
resulted primarily from increased spending in support of our HerdChek

®

BSE
Antigen Test Kit and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency-denominated expenses,
partly offset by the nonrecurrence in 2004 of expenses incurred in 2003 in connection with
the formation of the China joint venture. The decrease in other income results from the
nonrecurrence in 2004 of the reduction in an accrual related to a third-party claim
recorded as other income in 2003. For 2005, we expect FDG operating expenses to increase
as a percent of sales due to integration costs and intangible amortization expense
associated with the Bommeli acquisition.

Other.

Operating
expenses for 2004, consisting primarily of corporate research and           development,
decreased $0.2 million, or 6%, to $3.2 million from $3.4 million for           the same
period of the prior year.


Interest Income

Net
interest income was $3.1 million for 2004 compared with $2.9 million during 2003. The
increase in interest income was due to higher average invested cash balances partially
offset by lower effective interest rates.

Provision for Income
Taxes

Our
effective income tax rate was 29.7% for 2004 compared with 31.5% for 2003. The majority of
this rate reduction resulted from the resolution of an IRS income tax audit through the
year 2001. As a result of completing this audit, the Company reduced previously accrued
taxes. Other rate reductions resulted from the release in 2004 of a valuation allowance on
international deferred tax assets as a result of a foreign subsidiary demonstrating
consistent sustained profitability and changes in certain state and international tax
estimates partially offset by revisions in 2003 to international tax estimates and a
charge to write-down fixed assets occurring in a high-tax jurisdiction.

The
increase in our valuation allowances from 2002 to 2003 was primarily related to the
generation of state net operating losses that we believe are not likely to be realized.
The generation of state net operating losses increased our valuation allowance by $0.5
million. The reduction in valuation allowances from 2003 to 2004 was primarily related to
releasing a valuation allowance that previously offset the international deferred tax
assets of an international subsidiary. This valuation allowance of $0.7 million was
released as a result of our determination that it is more likely than not that the
deferred tax assets will be realized.

The
recently enacted

American Jobs Creation Act of 2004

allows for a reduced rate of
United States tax on qualifying repatriations of earnings held outside the United States.
We are currently studying the impact of this provision and we have not made a final
determination as to the amounts, if any, that will be repatriated. As such, the income tax
effect of any repatriation cannot be estimated.

Represents
the percentage change in revenue attributed to the effect of changes           in
currency rates from 2002 to 2003.

Companion
Animal Group.

Revenue for CAG increased $57.5 million, or 18%, to $384.4 million from
$326.9 million in the same period of the prior year. This increase resulted primarily from
sales of instruments and consumables and, to a lesser degree, rapid assay products,
laboratory and consulting services, and pharmaceutical products. The favorable impact of
currency exchange rates on sales outside the U.S. contributed an aggregate of $11.8
million, or 4%, to the increase in CAG revenue.

The
increase in sales of our instruments and consumables (an increase of $33.8 million, or
24%) was due to increased sales of the LaserCyte

®

hematology system, which
was launched in the fourth quarter of 2002, partially offset by lower sales of
QBC

®

VetAutoread ™ systems, and increased sales of
VetTest

®

slides and, to a lesser extent, LaserCyte

®

tubes,
partially offset by reduced sales of QBC

®

VetAutoread ™ tubes
resulting from the replacement of QBC

®

VetAutoread ™ systems by
LaserCyte

®

systems. The overall increase in sales of instrument consumables
was due to the favorable impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the U.S., the
impact of reductions in distributors’ inventory levels in 2002, higher volume outside
the U.S. and increased domestic clinic-level sales.


The
increase in sales of rapid assay products (an increase of $12.5 million, or 18%) was due
to increased domestic clinic-level sales of canine products and to a lesser degree, feline
products, higher average unit prices, the impact of reductions in distributors’
inventory levels in 2002 and the favorable impact of currency exchange rates on sales
outside the U.S. The increased sales volume was due in part to the apparent temporary
difficulty of one of our competitors in supplying certain competitive products to the
market. In January 2004, this competitor announced that it had reentered the heartworm
market. In addition, another competitor announced that it had entered the heartworm
market.

Shipments
to distributors of our instrument consumables and rapid assay products during 2002 were
significantly reduced by the Company as part of a plan to reduce product inventories held
by distributors. The reduced shipments during 2002 create a favorable year-to-year
comparison for revenue growth rates for 2003.

The
increase in sales of laboratory and consulting services (an increase of $8.2 million, or
9%) resulted primarily from higher volume primarily in the U.S. and to a lesser extent in
the U.K. and Australia, the favorable impact of currency exchange rates on sales at our
laboratories outside the U.S. and favorable pricing partially offset by the termination of
the veterinary referral business.

The
increase in sales of pharmaceutical products (an increase of $1.8 million, or 35%),
resulted from the commencement of sales of a product licensed to a third party and, to a
lesser extent, growth of existing products.

Water.

Revenue
for Water increased $5.0 million, or 12%, to $46.9 million from $42.0           million
for the same period of the prior year. The increase resulted primarily           from
higher sales volume of water-testing products and the favorable impact of
          currency exchange rates on sales outside the U.S. The favorable impact of
          currency exchange rates on sales outside the U.S. contributed an aggregate of
          $1.8 million, or 4%, to the increase in Water revenue.

Food
Diagnostics Group.

Revenue for FDG increased $0.8 million, or 2%, to $44.6 million
from $43.8 million for the same period of the prior year. The increase was due to the
favorable impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the U.S. The favorable impact
of currency exchange rates on sales outside the U.S. contributed an aggregate of $3.5
million, or 8%, to the increase in FDG revenue.

An
increase in sales of production animal diagnostics (an increase of $1.1 million, or 4%)
resulted from the favorable impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside the U.S.
These increases were partially offset by lower average unit prices and sales volume.

A
decrease in sales of dairy-testing products (a decrease of $0.3 million, or 2%) was
attributable to lower unit sales volume, offset partially by the favorable impact of
currency exchange rates on sales outside the U.S.

Gross Profit

Total
Company.

Gross profit for the total company increased $37.6 million, or 20%, to $230.3
million from $192.7 million for the same period in the prior year. As a percentage of
total company revenue, gross profit increased to 48% in 2003 from 47% in 2002. The
following table presents gross profit and gross profit percentage for the Company and its
operating segments:

Companion
Animal Group.

Gross profit for CAG increased $32.9 million, or 23%, to $175.6 million
from $142.7 million in the same period of the prior year due to increased sales volume
across the CAG product lines and, to a lesser extent, to an increase in the gross profit
percentage. As a percentage of CAG revenue, gross profit increased to 46% from 44% for the
same period in the prior year. The increase in gross profit percentage was attributable
primarily to greater relative sales of rapid assay products and the 2003 termination of a
low-margin veterinary referral business; productivity improvements across CAG product
lines in service and distribution operations; the favorable impact of foreign currency
rates on sales denominated in those currencies, net of foreign exchange hedge contract
losses; reduced amortization of VetTest

®

instruments in our rental and
trade-up programs as units became fully amortized; and increased average unit prices of
rapid assay products and laboratory services. These increases were partially offset by
higher sales of our lower gross margin LaserCyte

®

hematology instrument and
by the temporarily higher cost of VetTest

®

slides purchased in 2002 and
sold in 2003 as a result of the 2002 renegotiation of our VetTest

®

slide
supply agreement with Ortho.

Water.

Gross
profit for Water increased $2.9 million, or 10%, to $31.5 million from           $28.6
million for the same period in the prior year, primarily due to increased
          revenue partially offset by a decrease in the gross profit percentage. As a
          percentage of Water revenue, gross profit decreased to 67% from 68% for the
same           period in the prior year. The decrease in gross profit percentage was
          attributable primarily to higher royalty expenses, the net impact of currency
          exchange and exchange contract losses, unfavorable manufacturing variances, and
          an unfavorable product mix of higher sales of lower margin accessories.

Food
Diagnostics Group.

Gross profit for FDG increased $1.8 million, or 9%, to $23.2
million from $21.4 million for the same period in the prior year, primarily due to an
increase in the gross profit percentage. As a percentage of FDG revenue, gross profit
increased to 52% from 49% for the same period in the prior year. The increase in gross
profit percentage was attributable primarily to reduced inventory writedowns in 2003
compared to those recognized in the same period in 2002, primarily on an instrument and
related components sold by the dairy business.

Operating Expenses

Total
Company.

Total company operating expenses increased $23.0 million to $149.9 million
from $126.9 million for the same period of the prior year. As a percentage of revenues,
operating expenses remained flat at 31%. The following tables present operating expenses

Companion
Animal Group.

Operating expenses for CAG increased $23.7 million, or 25%, to $120.4
million from $96.7 million in the same period of the prior year. The increase was
attributable to a 28% ($12.7 million) increase in sales and marketing expense, a $7.5
million increase in other expense, a 9% ($1.9 million) increase in research and
development expense, and a 6% ($1.7 million) increase in general and administrative
expense. The increase in sales and marketing expense resulted primarily from increased
personnel and marketing program costs, increased costs to support the ramp-up in
LaserCyte

®

sales and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency-denominated
expenses.


The
increase in other expense is primarily due to a $7.4 million charge for the write-down of
production equipment purchased for the manufacture of consumables for use in an
alternative clinical chemistry system as described above.

The
increase in research and development expense resulted from increased staffing. The
increase in administrative expenses reflects higher spending on information technology and
other corporate functions and an increase in bad debt provisions, offset partially by the
elimination of certain expenses related to legal matters that concluded in 2002.

Water.

Operating expenses for Water increased $0.3 million, or 3%, to $10.5 million
          from $10.2 million in the same period of the prior year. The increase was
          attributable to a 21% ($0.9 million) increase in sales and marketing expense and
          an 11% ($0.2 million) increase in research and development expense, partly
          offset by a $0.8 million reduction in other expense. The increase in sales and
          marketing expense resulted primarily from

increased marketing activities
          and headcount. The increase in research and development expense was due
          primarily to compensation and benefits associated with additional personnel. The
          decrease in other expense reflects the absence of certain nonrecurring expenses
          that were recognized in 2002 associated with a write-off of intangible assets
          and litigation that concluded in 2002.

Food
Diagnostics Group.

Operating expenses for FDG increased $1.9 million, or 14%, to $15.6
million from $13.7 million in the same period of the prior year. The increase was
attributable to a 23% ($1.4 million) increase in sales and marketing expense, a 17% ($0.7
million) increase in general and administrative expense, and a 16% ($0.6 million) increase
in research and development expense, partly offset by a $0.8 million increase in other
income. The increase in sales and marketing expense resulted primarily from

increased marketing activities and headcount, and from expenses incurred in connection
with the formation of the China joint venture (see Note 16 to the consolidated financial
statements). The increase in general and administrative expense reflects an increase in
administrative support expenses outside of the U.S., including support of the China joint
venture and higher spending on information technology and other corporate functions. The
increase in research and development expense was due to new product development efforts,
primarily related to products for diagnosis of transmissible spongiform
encephalopathies.

The increase in other income was primarily due to a reduction in
an accrual related to a third-party claim.

Other.

Operating expenses for 2003 decreased $2.9 million, or 46%, to $3.4 million from
          $6.3 million for the same period of the prior year. The decrease resulted
          primarily from $3.4 million in nonrecurring benefits provided in 2002 in
          connection with the retirement of our former Chairman and Chief Executive
          Officer in January 2002, partly offset by corporate research and development
          hiring costs incurred in 2003.

Interest Income

Net
interest income was $2.9 million for 2003 compared with $3.0 million during 2002. The
decrease was due to lower effective interest rates and the receipt in 2002 of $0.3 million
in interest on a domestic tax refund. The decrease was partially offset by interest earned
on higher invested cash balances.

Provision for Income
Taxes

Our
effective tax rate was 31.5% for 2003 compared with 34.0% for 2002. The decrease in the
effective rate is due to ongoing domestic and international tax planning initiatives,
revisions to prior year international tax estimates and the charge to write-down fixed
assets discussed above occurring in a high-tax jurisdiction. The write-down reduced the
effective tax rate by 0.5%.


RECENT ACCOUNTING
PRONOUNCEMENTS

In
December 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (•FASB”) issued FASB Interpretation No. 46R, “Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities, an interpretation of ARB 51” (“FIN 46R”). FIN
46R provides guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved
through means other than through voting rights (“variable interest entities”)
and on the determination of when such entities are required to be included in the
consolidated financial statements of the business enterprise that holds an interest in the
variable interest entity. This new model for consolidation applies to an entity in which
either (1) the equity investors do not have a controlling financial interest or (2) the
equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity’s activities without
receiving additional subordinated financial support from other parties. In addition, FIN
46R requires additional related disclosures. Certain disclosure provisions of FIN 46R
apply to all financial statements issued after January 31, 2003, the consolidation
provisions apply to variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003, and to
variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date, and
the remaining provisions, with the exception of interest in special purpose entities,
apply at the end of the first fiscal year or interim period ending after March 15, 2004 to
variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it
acquired before February 1, 2003. Application for interest in special purpose entities is
required for periods after December 15, 2003. The adoption of FIN 46R had no material
impact on the consolidated financial statements.

In
December 2003, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 104,
“Revenue Recognition,” (“SAB No. 104”) which replaces SAB No. 101.
This staff accounting bulletin revises or rescinds portions of the interpretative guidance
included in Topic 13 of the codification of staff accounting bulletins in order to make
this interpretive guidance consistent with current authoritative accounting and auditing
guidance and SEC rules and regulations. The principal revisions relate to the rescission
of material no longer necessary because of private sector developments in U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles. This staff accounting bulletin also rescinds the Revenue
Recognition in Financial Statements Frequently Asked Questions and Answers document issued
in conjunction with Topic 13. Selected portions of that document have been incorporated
into Topic 13. SAB No. 104 also rescinds the accounting guidance in SAB No. 101 related to
multiple-element arrangements as this guidance has been superseded as a result of the
issuance of EITF 00-21. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on
the consolidated financial statements.

In
December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment”, which is a revision of SFAS
No. 123 and supersedes Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 25. SFAS No. 123(R) requires all
share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be
valued at fair value on the date of grant, and to be expensed over the applicable vesting
period. Pro forma disclosure of the income statement effects of share-based payments is no
longer an alternative. SFAS No. 123(R) is effective for all stock-based awards
granted on or after July 1, 2005. In addition, companies must also recognize
compensation expense related to any awards that are not fully vested as of the effective
date. Compensation expense for the unvested awards will be measured based on the fair
value of the awards previously calculated in developing the pro forma disclosures in
accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123. We plan to use the modified
prospective application method and to adopt the standard on July 1, 2005. We are currently
studying SFAS No. 123R and believe we will recognize approximately $8.0 million in pre-tax
expense for the year ended December 31, 2005 related to this standard.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL
RESOURCES

We
fund the capital needs of our business through cash generated from operations. As of December
31, 2004 and 2003, we had $137.3 million and $220.7 million of cash, cash equivalents and
short-term investments, respectively, and working capital of $201.6 million and $270.2
million, respectively. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, we also had long-term investments
primarily in municipal bonds of $19.7 million and $35.1 million, respectively. As of
December 31, 2004 and 2003, we had total cash, short-term investments and long-term
investments of $157.0 million and $255.8 million, respectively.

Effective
January 1, 2003, we entered into a workers’ compensation insurance policy for U.S.
employees under which we retain the first $0.25 million in claim liability per incident
and up to specific limits, based on payroll, in claim liability in the aggregate. We
renewed this workers’ compensation policy effective January 1, 2004, and entered into
a similar workers’ compensation policy effective January 1, 2005. We are liable for
up to $3.0 million and $1.4 million in aggregate claim liability for 2004 and 2003,
respectively, and estimate that we will be liable for up to $2.5 million for 2005. We have
recorded our estimated claim liability as of December 31, 2004 and 2003 based on claims
incurred and the estimated ultimate cost to settle the claims. The insurance company
administers and pays these claims, and we reimburse the insurance company for our portion
of these claims. The insurance company provides insurance for claims above the individual
occurrence and aggregate limits. We issued a $1.1 million letter of credit to the
insurance company as security for these claims as of December 31, 2004, and agreed to issue
a $0.5 million letter of credit for 2004 for our 2005 policy.


We
purchased approximately $29.1 million in fixed assets and $2.6 million in rental
instruments sold under recourse during the year ended December 31, 2004, principally
related to the CAG segment. Our total capital budget for 2005 is approximately $28.0
million. Research and development expense as a percentage of revenue for 2005 is expected
to be slightly lower than 2004 levels as we will record relatively higher proportion of
our revenues from our laboratory services business, which does not incur significant
research and development expenses. Under certain supply agreements with suppliers of
veterinary instruments, slides for our VetTest

®

instruments and certain raw
materials, at December 31, 2004, we had aggregate commitments to purchase approximately
$64.7 million of products in 2005. In 2004, we utilized cash of $53.9 million to acquire
Vet Med Lab, Bommeli, a laboratory in Columbus, Ohio, and a production animal
diagnostics company in New York.

Cash
provided by operating activities was $95.4 million during 2004. Cash of $8.2 million was
generated from the income tax benefit obtained due to the exercise of nonqualified stock
options and disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options. Non-cash expense of
$4.6 million was recorded from the provision for deferred income taxes primarily due to
accelerated depreciation. Cash of $5.8 million was used to pay vendor payables primarily
due to Ortho for VetTest

®

slides that were received in 2003. Cash of $5.2 million was
used to increase accounts receivable due to higher sales. Cash of $5.4 million was
used by a decrease in accruals due primarily to the settlement of a third-party claim.

During
1999 and 2000, the Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to 10,000,000 shares
of our common stock in the open market or in negotiated transactions. In October 2003, the
Board authorized the purchase of an additional 2,000,000 shares of common stock, and in
October 2004, the Board of Directors increased the authorization by an additional
2,000,000 shares of common stock. During 2004, we repurchased approximately 2,413,000
shares of our common stock for $128.8 million at an average price of $53.37 per share. As
of December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, approximately 11,955,000, 9,541,000, and 8,614,000
cumulative shares, respectively, had been repurchased under these programs. During 2004
and 2003, the Company received approximately 1,000 and 133,000 shares of stock,
respectively, which were owned by the holder for greater than six months, in payment for
the exercise price of stock options. The shares of stock had a fair market value of $0.1
million and $4.9 million, respectively. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial
statements.

FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS

The
future operating results of IDEXX involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual
events or results may differ materially from those discussed in this report. Factors that
could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, the factors
discussed below, as well as those discussed elsewhere in this report.


IDEXX’s
Future Growth and Profitability Depends on Several Factors

The
future success of our business depends upon our ability to successfully implement various
strategies, including:

•

Developing,
manufacturing and marketing new products with new features and capabilities, including
pharmaceutical products and a new clinical chemistry instrument, and improving and
enhancing existing products, including the LaserCyte

®

system;

•

Expanding
our market by increasing use of our products by our customers;

•

Strengthening
our sales and marketing activities both within the U.S. and in geographies outside of the
         U.S.;

•

Developing
and implementing new technology development and licensing strategies; and identifying,
completing and integrating acquisitions that enhance our existing businesses or create
new business areas for us; and

•

Reducing
the costs of manufacturing our products and providing services through operating
efficiencies.

However,
we may not be able to successfully implement some or all of these strategies and increase
or sustain our rate of growth or profitability.

IDEXX’s
Markets Are Competitive and Subject to Rapid and Substantial Technological Change

We
face intense competition within the markets in which we sell our products and services. We
expect that future competition will become even more intense, and that we will have to
compete with changing and improving technologies. Some of our competitors and potential
competitors, including large pharmaceutical companies, have substantially greater capital,
manufacturing, marketing, and research and development resources than we do.

IDEXX’s
Products and Services Are Subject to Various Government Regulations

In
the U.S., the manufacture and sale of our products are regulated by agencies such as the
U.S. Department of Agriculture (“USDA”), U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(“FDA”) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”). Most
diagnostic tests for animal health applications, including our canine, feline, poultry and
livestock tests, must be approved by the USDA prior to sale. Our water-testing products
must be approved by the EPA before they can be used by customers in the U.S. as a part of
a water-quality monitoring program required by the EPA. Our pharmaceutical and dairy-testing
products require approval by the FDA. The manufacture and sale of our products are
subject to similar laws in many foreign countries. Any failure to comply with legal and
regulatory requirements relating to the manufacture and sale of our products in the U.S.
or in other countries could result in fines and sanctions against us or removals of our
products from the market, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations.

We
have entered into an agreement with the FDA under which we have agreed, among other
things, to perform specified lot release and stability testing of our SNAP

®

beta-lactam dairy-testing products and to provide related data to the FDA. If the FDA were
to determine that one or more lots of product failed to meet applicable criteria for
product performance or stability, the FDA could take various actions, including requiring
us to recall products or restricting our ability to sell these products. Sales of dairy
antibiotic residue-testing products were $15.7 million for the 12 months ended December
31, 2004.

Commercialization
of animal health pharmaceuticals in the U.S. requires prior approval by the FDA. To obtain
such approvals, we are required to submit substantial clinical, manufacturing and other
data to the FDA. Regulatory approval for products submitted to the FDA may take several
years and following approval, the FDA continues to regulate all aspects of the
manufacture, labeling, storage, record keeping and promotion of pharmaceutical products.
Failure to obtain, or delays in obtaining, FDA approval for new pharmaceutical products
would have a negative impact on our future growth.


Changes
in Veterinary Medical Practices Could Negatively Affect Operating Results

The
market for diagnostic tests could be negatively impacted by the introduction or broad
market acceptance of vaccines or preventatives for the diseases and conditions for which
we sell diagnostic tests and services. Eradication or substantial declines in the
prevalence of certain diseases also could lead to a decline in diagnostic testing for such
diseases. Such a decline could have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations.

IDEXX’s
Success Is Heavily Dependent Upon Its Proprietary Technologies

We
rely on a combination of patent, trade secret, trademark and copyright laws to protect our
proprietary rights. If we do not have adequate protection of our proprietary rights, our
business may be affected by competitors who develop substantially equivalent technologies
that compete with us.

We
cannot ensure that we will obtain issued patents, that any patents issued or licensed to
us will remain valid, or that any patents owned or licensed by us will provide protection
against competitors with similar technologies. Even if our patents cover products sold by
our competitors, the time and expense of litigating to enforce our patent rights could be
substantial, and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In
addition, expiration of patent rights could result in substantial new competition in the
markets for products previously covered by those patent rights.

In
the past, we have received notices claiming that our products infringe third-party patents
and we may receive such notices in the future. Patent litigation is complex and expensive
and the outcome of patent litigation can be difficult to predict. We cannot ensure that we
will win a patent litigation case or negotiate an acceptable resolution of such a case. If
we lose, we may be stopped from selling certain products and/or we may be required to pay
damages and/or ongoing royalties as a result of the lawsuit. Any such adverse result could
have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

IDEXX
Purchases Materials for Its Products from a Limited Number of Sources

We
currently purchase certain products and materials from single sources or a limited number
of sources. Some of the products that we purchase from these sources are proprietary, and,
therefore, may not be available from other sources. These products include our
VetTest

®

chemistry, QBC

®

VetAutoread™ hematology,
VetLyte

®

electrolyte, and VetStat™ blood gas analyzers and related
consumables, digital radiography systems, active ingredients for pharmaceutical products,
including Navigator

®

paste, and certain components of our
SNAP

®

rapid assay devices, water-testing products and
LaserCyte

®

systems. If we are unable to obtain adequate quantities of these
products in the future, we could face cost increases or reductions or delays in product
shipments, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

The
slides sold for use in our VetTest

®

instruments are purchased under an
agreement with Ortho at fixed prices. Under this agreement we are required to purchase a
minimum of $131.8 million of slides through 2010. To the extent that slides purchased
under the contract exceed demand for the slides, we may incur losses in the future under
this agreement. To the extent that we are unable to maintain current pricing levels on
sales of slides to our customers, our profits on slide sales could decline because we
purchase slides at fixed prices.

IDEXX’s
Biologic Products Are Complex and Difficult to Manufacture

Many
of our products are biologics, which are products that are comprised of materials from
living organisms, such as antibodies, cells and sera. Manufacturing biologic products is
highly complex. Unlike products that rely on chemicals for efficacy (such as most
pharmaceuticals), biologics are difficult to characterize due to the inherent variability
of biological materials. Difficulty in characterizing biological materials limits the
precision of specifications for these materials, which creates greater risk in the
manufacturing process. We attempt to mitigate risk associated with the manufacture of
biologics by utilizing multiple vendors, manufacturing some of these materials ourselves
and maintaining substantial inventories of materials that have demonstrated the
appropriate characteristics. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to
maintain adequate sources of biological materials or that biological materials that we
maintain in inventory will yield finished products that satisfy applicable product release
criteria. Our inability to obtain necessary biological materials or to successfully
manufacture biologic products that incorporate such materials could have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations.


IDEXX’s
Sales Are Dependent on Distributor Purchasing Patterns

We
sell many of our products, including substantially all of the rapid assays and instrument
consumables sold in the U.S., through distributors. Because significant product sales are
made to a limited number of customers, unanticipated changes in the timing and size of
distributor purchases can have a negative effect on quarterly results. Our financial
performance, therefore, is subject to an unexpected downturn in product demand and may be
unpredictable.

International
Revenue Accounts for a Significant Portion of IDEXX’s Total Revenue

In
2004, 32% of our revenue was attributable to sales of products and services to customers
outside the U.S. Various risks associated with foreign operations may impact our
international sales. Possible risks include fluctuations in the value of foreign
currencies, disruptions in transportation of our products, the differing product and
service needs of foreign customers, difficulties in building and managing foreign
operations, import/export duties and quotas, and unexpected regulatory, economic or
political changes in foreign markets. Prices that we charge to foreign customers may be
different than the prices we charge for the same products in the U.S. due to competitive,
market or other factors. As a result, the mix of domestic and international sales in a
particular period could have a material impact on our results for that period. In
addition, many of the products for which our selling price may be denominated in foreign
currencies are manufactured, sourced, or both, in the U.S. and our costs are incurred in
U.S. dollars. We utilize nonspeculative forward currency exchange contracts to mitigate
foreign currency exposure, however, an appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the
foreign currencies in which we sell these products would reduce our gross margins.

The
Loss of Our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman Could Adversely Affect Our
Business

We
rely on the management and leadership of Jonathan W. Ayers, our President, Chief Executive
Officer and Chairman. We do not maintain key man life insurance coverage for Mr. Ayers.
The loss of Mr. Ayers could have a material impact on our business.

We
Could Be Subject to Class Action Litigation Due to Stock Price Volatility, which, if
Occurs, Could Result in Substantial Costs or Large Judgments Against Us

The
market for our common stock may experience extreme price and volume fluctuations, which
may be unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance or prospects. In the
past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against companies
following periods of volatility in the market prices of their securities. We may be the
target of similar litigation in the future. Securities litigation could result in
substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources, which could
have a negative effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.

If
Our Quarterly Results of Operations Fluctuate, This Fluctuation May Cause Our Stock Price
to Decline, Resulting in Losses to You

Our
prior operating results have fluctuated due to a number of factors, including seasonality
of certain product lines; changes in our accounting estimates; the impact of acquisitions;
timing of distributor purchases, product launches, research and development expenditures,
litigation and claim-related expenditures; changes in competitors’ product offerings;
and other matters. Similarly, our future operating results may vary significantly from
quarter to quarter due to these and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.
If our operating results do not meet the expectations of market analysts or investors in
future periods, our stock price may fall.


Future
Operating Results Could Be Materially Affected By the Resolution of Various Uncertain
TaxPositions, and Adversely Affected by Potential Changes to Tax Incentives

In
the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where
the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Significant judgment is required in
determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and our income tax filings are
regularly under audit by tax authorities. Management believes that it has adequately
accrued for all potential tax liabilities and, although we believe our tax estimates are
reasonable, the final determination of tax audits could be materially different than that
which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals. Additionally, we
benefit from certain tax incentives offered by various jurisdictions, some of which are
scheduled to expire at the end of 2005. If we are unable to renew such incentives, the
expiration of these benefits could have a material negative effect on future earnings.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE
AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK

Our
financial market risk consists primarily of foreign currency exchange rate risk. We
operate subsidiaries in 16 foreign countries and transact business in local currencies. We
attempt to hedge the majority of our cash flow on intercompany sales to minimize foreign
currency exposure. See Note 2(m) to our consolidated financial statements.

The
primary purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to protect against the
volatility associated with foreign currency transactions. Corporate policy prescribes the
range of allowable hedging activity. We primarily utilize forward exchange contracts with
a duration of less than 18 months. Gains and losses related to qualifying hedges of
foreign currency from commitments or anticipated transactions are deferred in prepaid
expenses or accruals and are included in the basis of the underlying transaction. Our
hedging strategy is consistent with prior periods. Our hedging strategy provides that we
employ the full amount of our hedges for the succeeding year at the conclusion of our
budgeting process for that year, which is complete by the end of the preceding year.
Quarterly, we enter into contracts to hedge incremental portions of anticipated foreign
currency transactions for the following twelve months. Accordingly, our risk with respect
to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may vary throughout each annual cycle. As
of December 31, 2004, the Company had $2.9 million in unrealized losses on foreign
exchange contracts designated as hedges recorded in other comprehensive income, which is
net of $1.5 million in taxes.

Our
currency rate exposure at December 31, 2004 consisted of local currency revenues and
expenses, the impact of hedge contracts and balances denominated in a currency other than
the Company’s or its subsidiaries’ functional currency. Based on our overall
currency rate exposure, excluding unrealized losses of $4.3 million at December 31, 2004
and $4.4 million at December 31, 2003, a 10% strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to
foreign currencies would reduce operating income by approximately $2.3 million for 2005. A
10% strengthening of the U.S. dollar from December 31, 2003 would have reduced operating
income for 2004 by approximately $2.2 million. A 10% weakening of the U.S. dollar relative
to foreign currencies at December 31, 2004 would increase operating income by
approximately $2.3 million in 2005. A 10% weakening of the U.S. dollar from December 31,
2003 would have increased operating income by approximately $2.2 million in 2004. As of
December 31, 2004, a 10% strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies,
excluding the impact of hedge contracts currently in place, would reduce operating income
by approximately $9.3 million in 2005, compared to $8.1 million in 2004, and the effects of
a 10% weakening of U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies, excluding the impact of
hedge contracts currently in place, would increase operating income by approximately $9.3
million in 2005 compared to $8.1 million in 2004.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND
PROCEDURES

Conclusion Regarding the
Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal
executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of our
disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e)
promulgated under Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange
Act”). Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal
financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as
of the end of the period covered by this annual report.

Management’s Report
on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Under the
supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal
executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the
effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

, our management concluded that our
internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2004.

Our
management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2004 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP, an
independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included
herein on page F-2 and F-3.

No
change in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules
13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during the quarter ended
December 31, 2004 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED
PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and
Stockholders of IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.:

We have completed an integrated audit
of IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.’s 2004 consolidated financial statements and of its
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, and audits of its 2003
and 2002 consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Our opinions, based on our audits, are
presented below.

Consolidated financial
statements and financial statement schedule

In our opinion, the consolidated
financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. and its
subsidiaries at December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the results of their operations and their
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004 in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In
addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing
under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth
therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. These
financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the
Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits
of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Internal control over
financial reporting

Also, in our opinion,
management’s assessment, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A, that the Company maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004 based on criteria
established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on those criteria. Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated
Framework

issued by the COSO. The Company’s management is responsible
for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment
of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is
to express opinions on management’s assessment and on the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted
our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of
the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. An
audit of internal control over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding of
internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment,
testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and
performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

F-2

A company’s internal control
over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets
that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations,
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 NATURE OF BUSINESS

IDEXX
Laboratories, Inc. (the “Company”) develops, manufactures and distributes
products and provides services for the veterinary and the food- and water-testing markets.
The Company operates primarily through three business segments: products and services for
the veterinary market, which is referred to as the Companion Animal Group
(“CAG”), water quality products (“Water”) and products for production
animal health and dairy quality, which is referred to as the Food Diagnostics Group
(“FDG”). See Note 18. The Company’s products and services are sold
worldwide.

NOTE 2 SUMMARY OF
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

(a) Consolidation

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, its
wholly-owned subsidiaries, and all other entities in which the Company has a variable
interest and is determined to be the primary beneficiary. All material intercompany
transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.

(b) Estimates

The
preparation of these financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires the Company to make estimates
and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and
expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing
basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to customer programs
and incentives, product returns, bad debts, inventories, investments, intangible assets,
income taxes, warranty obligations, restructuring and contingencies. The Company accrues
contingent liabilities when it is probable that future expenditures will be made and such
expenditures can reasonably be estimated. The Company bases its estimates on historical
experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying
values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual
results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

(c) Inventories

Inventories
include material, labor and overhead, and are stated at the lower of cost (first-in,
first-out) or market. The Company writes down inventory for estimated obsolescence when
warranted by estimates of future demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions
are less favorable than those estimated by management, additional inventory write-downs
may be required, which would have a negative effect on results of operations. Certain
major components of inventory are discussed in more detail below.

Nitazoxanide

.
          The Company’s nitazoxanide product, Navigator

®

for the
          treatment of equine protozoal myeloencephalitis (“EPM”) was approved
          by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) in November 2003. Our
          inventories as of December 31, 2004 included $8.7 million of inventory
          associated with Navigator

®

, consisting of $0.4 million of
          finished goods and $8.3 million of active ingredient and other raw materials. In
          December 2004, the Company entered into an amendment to the Company’s
          agreement with its supplier of nitazoxanide under which the Company paid the
          supplier $0.9 million in January 2005 and the supplier agreed until 2017 to
          replace any expiring inventory of nitazoxanide with longer-dated material. The
          Company believes that this agreement has substantially mitigated the risk that
          we would be required to write down nitazoxanide inventory due to its anticipated
          expiration prior to sale.

VetTest

®

Chemistry Slides

. The Company’s inventories as of December 31, 2004 included
$22.7 million of slides used in its VetTest

®

chemistry instruments. Most of
the slides have a shelf-life of 24 months at the date of manufacture. The average
remaining shelf-life at December 31, 2004 was 16.9 months. In addition, the Company is
required to purchase a minimum of $131.8 million of slides from Ortho-Clinical
Diagnostics, Inc. (“Ortho”) through December 31, 2010.

F-8

During
the quarter ended September 30, 2002, the Company amended the contract with Ortho to
reduce its minimum purchase commitment for both 2002 and the life of the contract by 30
million slides (or approximately $17.7 million) in consideration for the Company’s
agreement to forego approximately $2.0 million of certain volume rebates on slides
purchased in 2002. As a result of this amendment, the Company reversed the previously
established contract loss reserve of $0.7 million, of which $0.4 million was provided in
2002. During the quarter ended December 31, 2003, the Company entered into a new contract
with Ortho, which extended the term of the supply agreement through 2018 and left the
contract minimum purchase commitments unchanged. As a result of the current and projected
demand for VetTest

®

slides, the Company’s commitment to develop a next-generation
chemistry analyzer that will utilize these slides and the ratable decrease in
required annual slide purchases from Ortho through 2010, the Company believes that it will
not incur a loss under the contract.

LaserCyte

®

Hematology Instrument

. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company’s net
inventories included $11.9 million and $7.2 million, respectively, of component parts and
finished goods associated with the LaserCyte

®

hematology instrument. In
addition, the Company had firm purchase commitments for an additional $1.9 million of
component parts as of December 31, 2004. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, $2.2 million
and $3.7 million of this inventory, respectively, required rework before it could be used
to manufacture finished goods. As of December 31, 2004, the inventory was net of a $0.3
million write-down for inventory estimated to be obsolete. There were no write-downs
against this inventory as of December 31, 2003 for obsolete inventory. The Company expects
to fully realize its investment in inventory and purchase commitments. However, if the
Company alters the design of this product, it may be required to write off some or all of
the remaining associated inventory.

(d) Property and
Equipment

The
Company records property and equipment at cost net of accumulated depreciation and
amortization. When an item is sold or retired, the cost and related accumulated
depreciation is relieved, and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognized in the
statement of operations. The Company provides for depreciation and amortization using the
declining-balance and straight-line methods by charges to operations in amounts that
allocate the cost of property and equipment over their estimated useful lives as follows:

Asset Classification

Estimated Useful Life

Leasehold improvements

Shorter of life of lease or useful life

Machinery and equipment

3—5 years

Office furniture and equipment

3—7 years

Buildings

40 years

The
Company recorded depreciation expense of $14.7 million, $14.5 million and $15.2 million
for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

(e) Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets

Intangible
assets, other than goodwill, are valued at fair value when acquired. If a market value is
not readily available, the fair value of the intangible asset is estimated based on
expected cash flows of the associated business acquired that are attributable to the
intangible asset. Goodwill is initially valued based on the excess of the purchase price
of a business combination over the other net assets acquired.

F-9

The
Company provides for amortization using the straight-line method by charges to operations
in amounts that allocate the intangible assets over their estimated useful lives as
follows:

Asset Classification

Estimated

Useful Life

Patents and completed technology

15 years

Noncompete agreements

2—10 years

Other

5—10 years

The
Company assesses the impairment of identifiable intangible assets and other long-lived
assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may
not be recoverable. Factors the Company considers important that could trigger an
impairment review include, but are not limited to, the following:

•

Significant
under-performance relative to historical or projected future operating results;

•

Failures
to obtain regulatory approval of certain products;

•

Significant
changes in the manner of the Company's use of the acquired assets or the strategy for its
         overall business;

•

Significant
increase in the discount rate assumed to calculate the present value of future cash flow;

•

Significant
negative industry or economic trends; and

•

Significant
advancements or changes in technology.

The
Company continually assesses the realizability of these assets in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 144, “Accounting
for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets” (“SFAS No. 144”). If
an impairment review is triggered, the Company evaluates the carrying value of long-lived
assets by determining if impairment exists based on estimated undiscounted future cash
flows over the remaining useful life of the assets and comparing that value to the
carrying value of the assets. If the carrying value of the asset is greater than the
estimated future cash flows, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value. In
determining expected future cash flows, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which
cash flows are identifiable and independent of cash flows from other asset groups. The
cash flow estimates that are used contain management’s best estimates, using
appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time.

Under
SFAS No. 144, the Company is required to perform annual tests of goodwill for impairment
or additional tests whenever events or circumstances indicate an impairment may exist. For
its annual impairment tests, the Company identifies its reporting units, allocates assets
and liabilities (including goodwill) to the reporting units and compares the reporting
units’ net book value to their estimated fair value. The fair value of the reporting
units is estimated using a discounted cash flow approach. The cash flow estimates used
contain management’s best estimates, using appropriate and customary assumptions and
projections at the time. No impairment has been identified as a result of the annual
reviews.

(f) Warranty and
Extended Maintenance Agreement Reserves

The
Company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties in cost of product revenue
at the time revenue is recognized. The Company’s actual warranty obligation is
affected by product failure rates and service costs incurred in correcting a product
failure. Should actual product failure rates or service costs differ from
management’s estimates, which are based on historical data, revisions to the
estimated warranty liability would be required. Following is a summary of changes in
accrued warranty reserve for products sold to customers for the years ended December 31,
2004 and 2003, respectively

The
Company sells extended maintenance agreements covering IDEXX instruments and recognizes
associated revenue over the life of the contracts. The Company anticipates that losses
will be incurred for certain of these contracts and has recognized provisions for the
estimated losses. The anticipated loss reserves were $0.1 million and $0.4 million as of
December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

(g) Income Taxes

The
Company accounts for income taxes under SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income
Taxes.” This statement requires that the Company recognize a current tax liability or
asset for current taxes payable or refundable, respectively; and a deferred tax liability
or asset, as the case may be, for the estimated future tax effects of temporary
differences between book and tax treatment of assets and liabilities and carryforwards to
the extent they are realizable. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce our
deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. While the
Company considers future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning
strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance, in the event the Company were
to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in
excess of the net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase
income in the period such determination was made. Likewise, should the Company determine
that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the
future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period
such determination was made. See Note 8.

(h) Revenue Recognition

The
Company recognizes revenue when four criteria are met. These include (i) persuasive
evidence that an arrangement exists, (ii) delivery has occurred or services have been
rendered, (iii) the sales price is fixed and determinable, and (iv) collectibility is
reasonably assured.

•

The
Company recognizes revenue at the time of shipment to distributors for substantially all
products sold through distributors, as title and risk of loss pass to these customers on
delivery to the common carrier. The Company recognizes revenue for the remainder of its
customers when the product is delivered to the customer except as noted below. The Company’s
distributors do not have the right to return products.

•

The
Company recognizes revenue from the sales of instruments, noncancelable software licenses
and hardware systems upon installation (and completion of training if applicable) and the
customer’s acceptance of the instrument or system because at this time the Company
has no significant further obligations.

•

The
Company recognizes service revenue at the time the service is performed.

•

The
Company recognizes revenue associated with extended maintenance agreements over the life
of the contracts. Amounts collected in advance of revenue recognition are recorded as a
current or long-term liability based on the time from the balance sheet date to the
future date of revenue recognition.

•

The
Company recognizes revenue on certain instrument systems under rental programs over the
life of the rental agreement. Amounts collected in advance of revenue recognition are
recorded as a current or long-term liability based on the time from the balance sheet
date to the future date of revenue recognition.

F-11

When
instruments are sold together with extended maintenance agreements, the Company allocates
revenue to the extended maintenance agreement under EITF 00-21, “Accounting for
Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables.” Accordingly, the total consideration
received is allocated to the elements based on their relative fair values, which is
determined by amounts charged separately for the delivered and undelivered elements to
other customers. The deferred revenue related to the extended maintenance agreements is
recognized ratably over the maintenance period. The delivered elements are recognized as
revenue when appropriate under the policies described above. Shipping costs reimbursed by
the customer are included in revenue.

The
Company records estimated reductions to revenue in connection with customer programs and
incentive offerings, which may give customers credits, award points, which may be applied
to trade amounts owed us and/or toward future purchases of products and services, or
trade-in rights. The Company estimates these reductions based on its experience with
similar customer programs in prior years. Revenue reductions are recorded on a quarterly
basis based on issuance of credits, points actually awarded, and estimates of points to be
awarded in the future based on current revenue. For the SNAP-Up-the-Savings™ program,
estimates of future customer points are revised quarterly and the final calculation and
issuance of points awards to customers are performed annually in the third quarter of each
year. For the Company’s Practice Developer™ volume discount program, the Company
has reduced revenue assuming all points granted will result in future credits because the
Company does not have sufficient experience with this program to estimate customer point
forfeitures.

The
Company may offer customers the right to trade in instruments for credit against the
purchase price of other instruments acquired in the future. For trade-in rights, the
Company has reduced revenue using estimates regarding the percentage of qualifying
instruments that will be traded in and the average trade-in value. In 2001, the Company
began offering guaranteed trade-in values on current sales of QBC

®

VetAutoread™ instruments, when the customer subsequently traded in the
QBC

®

VetAutoread™ instrument for a LaserCyte

®

system. To qualify for a guaranteed trade-in value, the customer must trade in their
QBC

®

VetAutoread™ instrument within five years of original purchase.
The value of the trade-in depends on the amount of time from original purchase to
trade-in. The Company has recorded a trade-in reserve of $0.5 million for these trade-ins.
The maximum trade-in liability at December 31, 2004 is $3.4 million and the Company
anticipates that it would receive equipment valued at $0.9 million if all customers were
to exercise their trade-in rights.

The
Company recognizes revenue only in those situations where collection from the customer is
reasonably assured. The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated
losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. The
Company bases its estimates on detailed analysis of specific customer situations and a
percentage of its accounts receivable by aging category. If the financial condition of the
Company’s customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability
to make payment, additional allowances may be required.

(i) Research and
Development and Software Development Costs

Research
and Development costs are expensed as incurred. In accordance with SFAS No. 86,
“Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise
Marketed” (“SFAS No. 86”), the Company evaluates its software research and
development costs for capitalization after the technological feasibility of software and
products containing software has been established. No software development costs have been
capitalized by the Company because costs eligible for capitalization under SFAS No. 86
have been insignificant. Research and development expenses consist of salaries, employee
benefits, materials and consulting costs.

(j) Advertising and
Promotion Costs

The
Company expenses advertising costs to sales and marketing expense in the period they are
incurred.

(k) Stock-Based
Compensation

The
Company measures costs related to employee stock-based compensation plans in accordance
with Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees” (“APB No. 25”), and elects to disclose the pro
forma impact of accounting for stock-based compensation plans under the provisions of
SFAS No. 123, “Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation” and SFAS No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation—Transition and Disclosure—An Amendment of FASB No. 123”
(collectively, “SFAS No. 123, as Amended”). Accordingly, no employee
compensation cost has been recognized for these plans based on SFAS No. 123, as Amended.

F-12

Had
compensation cost for the Company’s stock-based compensation and employee stock
purchase plans been determined consistent with the provisions of SFAS No. 123, as Amended, the
Company’s net income and net income per common and common equivalent share would have
been reduced to the following pro forma amounts

(l) Foreign Currency
Translation

Assets
and liabilities of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries are translated using the
exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date. Revenue and expense accounts are
translated using a weighted average of exchange rates in effect during the period.
Cumulative translation gains and losses are shown in the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Exchange
gains and losses arising from transactions denominated in foreign currencies other than a
subsidiary’s functional currency are included in current operations. Included in
general and administrative expenses are aggregate foreign exchange currency transaction
gains of $0.4 million, $1.0 million and $0.3 million for the years ended December 31,
2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

(m) Derivative
Instruments and Hedging

The
Company follows SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities” as amended by SFAS No. 137, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities—Deferral of the Effective Date of SFAS No. 133,” and
SFAS No. 138, “Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities—An
Amendment of SFAS No. 133.” (“SFAS No. 133, as Amended”). SFAS
No. 133 as Amended requires that all derivatives, including forward currency exchange
contracts, be recognized on the balance sheet at fair value. Derivatives that are not
hedges must be recorded at fair value through earnings. If a derivative is a hedge,
depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative are
either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged item through earnings or
recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings.
The Company immediately records in earnings the extent to which a hedge is not effective
in achieving offsetting changes in fair value.

The
Company enters into foreign currency exchange contracts of its anticipated intercompany
inventory purchases for the next twelve months in order to minimize the impact of foreign
currency fluctuations on these transactions. The Company’s accounting policies for
these contracts are based on the Company’s designation of such instruments as hedging
transactions. The Company also utilizes some natural hedges to mitigate its transaction
and commitment exposures. The contracts the Company enters into are firm foreign currency
commitments, and, therefore, market gains and losses are deferred until the contract
matures, which is the period when the related obligation is settled. The Company enters
into these exchange contracts with large multinational financial institutions. The Company
does not hold or engage in transactions involving derivative instruments for purposes
other than risk management. The Company hedges less than the full value of forecasted
intercompany sales and thus no significant ineffectiveness has resulted or been recorded
through the statement of operations. As of December 31, 2004, the Company recorded $4.3
million in unrealized losses through accumulated other comprehensive loss from foreign
exchange contracts with 2005 expiration dates. As of December 31, 2003, the Company
recorded $4.4 million in unrealized losses through accumulated other comprehensive loss
from foreign exchange contracts with 2004 expiration dates. The foreign currency
contracts, which extend through December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, consisted of the
following

2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

(n)

Disclosure of Fair Value of Financial Instruments and Concentration of Risk

Financial
instruments consist mainly of cash and cash equivalents, investments, accounts receivable,
accounts payable and notes payable. Financial instruments that potentially subject the
Company to concentrations of credit risk are principally cash, cash equivalents,
investments and accounts receivable. The Company places its investments in highly rated
financial institutions and investment grade money market funds, municipal bonds and
preferred stock. Concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is
limited to certain customers to whom the Company makes substantial sales. To reduce risk,
the Company routinely assesses the financial strength of its customers and, as a
consequence, believes that its accounts receivable credit risk exposure is limited. The
Company maintains an allowance for potential credit losses, but historically has not
experienced any significant credit losses related to an individual customer or group of
customers in any particular industry or geographic area. The carrying amounts of the
Company’s financial instruments approximate fair market value.

The
Company currently purchases certain products and materials from single sources or a
limited number of sources. Some of the products that the Company purchases from these
sources are proprietary, and, therefore, may not be available from other sources. If the
Company is unable to obtain adequate quantities of these products in the future, it
could face cost increases or reductions or delays in product shipments, which could have a
material adverse effect on its results of operations.

(o) Reclassifications

Reclassifications
have been made in the consolidated financial statements to conform to the current
year’s presentation.

In
connection with the preparation of this report, we concluded that it was appropriate to
classify our auction rate municipal bonds as short-term investments. Previously, such
investments had been classified as cash and cash equivalents. Accordingly, we have revised
the classification to report these securities as short-term investments on our
Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2003. We have also made corresponding
adjustments to our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the periods ended December
31, 2003 and 2002, to reflect the gross purchases and sales of these securities as
investing activities rather than as a component of cash and cash equivalents. This change
in classification does not affect previously reported cash flows from operations or from
financing activities in our previously reported Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, or
our previously reported Consolidated Statements of Operations for any period.

As
of December 31, 2003, $89.8 million of these short-term investments were classified as
cash and cash equivalents on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.

For
the fiscal years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, net cash used in investing activities
related to these current investments of $45.5 million and $14.0 million, respectively,
were included in cash and cash equivalents in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

F-14

(p) Comprehensive Income

SFAS
No. 130, “Reporting Comprehensive Income,” requires companies to report all
changes in equity during a period, resulting from net income and transactions or other
events and circumstances from non-owner sources, in a financial statement for the period
in which they are recognized. The Company has chosen to disclose comprehensive income,
which encompasses net income, foreign currency translation adjustments and the difference
between the cost and the fair market value of investments in debt securities and foreign
exchange contracts, in the Consolidated Statement of Stockholders’ Equity. The
Company considers the foreign currency cumulative translation adjustment to be permanently
invested and, therefore, has not provided income taxes on those amounts.

(q) New Accounting
Standards

In
December 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued FASB Interpretation No. 46R, “Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities, an interpretation of ARB 51” (“FIN 46R”). FIN
46R provides guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved
through means other than through voting rights (“variable interest entities”)
and on the determination of when such entities are required to be included in the
consolidated financial statements of the business enterprise that holds an interest in the
variable interest entity. This new model for consolidation applies to an entity in which
either (1) the equity investors do not have a controlling financial interest or (2) the
equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity’s activities without
receiving additional subordinated financial support from other parties. In addition, FIN
46R requires additional related disclosures. Certain disclosure provisions of FIN 46R
apply to all financial statements issued after January 31, 2003, the consolidation
provisions apply to variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003 and to
variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date, and
the remaining provisions, with the exception of interest in special purpose entities,
apply at the end of the first fiscal year or interim period ending after March 15, 2004 to
variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it
acquired before February 1, 2003. Application for interest in special purpose entities is
required for periods after December 15, 2003. The adoption of FIN 46R had no material
impact on the consolidated financial statements.

In
December 2003, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 104,
“Revenue Recognition,” (“SAB No. 104”) which replaces SAB No. 101.
This staff accounting bulletin revises or rescinds portions of the interpretative guidance
included in Topic 13 of the codification of staff accounting bulletins in order to make
this interpretive guidance consistent with current authoritative accounting and auditing
guidance and SEC rules and regulations. The principal revisions relate to the rescission
of material no longer necessary because of private sector developments in U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles. This staff accounting bulletin also rescinds the Revenue
Recognition in Financial Statements Frequently Asked Questions and Answers document issued
in conjunction with Topic 13. Selected portions of that document have been incorporated
into Topic 13. SAB No. 104 also rescinds the accounting guidance in SAB No. 101 related to
multiple-element arrangements as this guidance has been superseded as a result of the
issuance of EITF 00-21. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on
the consolidated financial statements.

In
December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment,” which is a revision of SFAS
No. 123 and supersedes APB No. 25. SFAS No. 123(R) requires all
share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be
valued at fair value on the date of grant, and to be expensed over the applicable vesting
period. Pro forma disclosure of the income statement effects of share-based payments is no
longer an alternative. SFAS No. 123(R) is effective for all stock-based awards
granted on or after July 1, 2005. In addition, companies must also recognize
compensation expense related to any awards that are not fully vested as of the effective
date. Compensation expense for the unvested awards will be measured based on the fair
value of the awards previously calculated in developing the pro forma disclosures in
accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123. The Company plans to use the modified
prospective application method and plans to adopt the standard on July 1, 2005. The
Company is studying SFAS No. 123R and believes it will recognize approximately $8.0
million (unaudited) in pre-tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2005 related to
this standard.

NOTE 3 BUSINESS
ACQUISITIONS

In
February 2004, the Company acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of a
veterinary reference laboratory located in Ohio. The Company paid cash of $5.3 million,
issued a note for $1.0 million and assumed liabilities of $0.5 million, for a total
purchase price of $6.8 million. Goodwill and amortizable intangible assets of $1.9 million
and $3.9 million, respectively, were assigned to the Companion Animal Group segment.

In
August 2004, the Company paid cash of $1.5 million to acquire all of the shares of a
production animal diagnostics company located in New York. Amortizable intangible assets
of $2.2 million were assigned to the Food Diagnostics Group segment.

In
November 2004, the Company acquired all of the shares of the Institut für klinische
Prüfung Ludwigsburg GmbH, which conducted business under the name Vet Med Lab. The
business of the acquired company and its subsidiaries comprises veterinary reference
laboratories in Germany and Switzerland, and additional customer service locations in the
Netherlands, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Austria and Denmark. The Company paid cash,
including acquisition costs and net of cash acquired, of $31.3 million; assumed
liabilities of $11.5 million; and recognized a purchase price adjustment receivable from
sellers of $0.5 million for a total purchase price of $42.3 million. The purchase price
adjustment is subject to agreement by the sellers. Goodwill and amortizable intangible
assets of $26.3 million and $11.2 million, respectively, were assigned to the Companion
Animal Group segment.

In
December 2004, the Company acquired all of the shares of Dr. Bommeli AG, a production
animal diagnostics company based in Switzerland. The Company paid cash, including
acquisition costs and net of cash acquired, of $15.8 million, and assumed liabilities of
$3.1 million for a total purchase price of $18.9 million. Goodwill and amortizable
intangible assets of $7.4 million and $8.8 million, respectively, were assigned to the
Food Diagnostics Group.

The
results of operations of the acquired businesses have been included with those of the
Company since the respective acquisition dates. Pro forma information has not been
presented because such information is not material to the financial statements of the
Company taken as a whole.

NOTE 4 CASH EQUIVALENTS,
SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS

Cash
equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities
of less than three months.

The
Company accounts for investments under SFAS No. 115, “Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities” as available-for-sale. Investments are
recorded at amortized cost and adjusted to fair market value through other comprehensive
income. Gains on sales of investments were not significant for the years ended December
31, 2004 and 2003. Short-term investments, which have cost basis of $90.2 million and
$123.7 million as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, are investment securities
with maturities of greater than three months, but less than one year, and consist of the

At
December 31, 2004 and 2003, we held $90.1 million and $123.8 million, respectively, of
short-term investments, which included $40.4 million and $89.8 million, respectively, of
auction rate municipal bonds classified as available-for-sale securities. Our investments
in these securities are recorded at cost, which approximates fair market value due to
their variable interest rates, which typically reset every 28 to 35 days, and, despite the
long-term nature of their stated contractual maturities, we have the ability to quickly
liquidate these securities. As a result, we had no cumulative gross unrealized holding
gains (losses) or gross realized gains (losses) from these short-term investments. All
income generated from these short-term investments was recorded as interest income.

Long-term
investments, which have a cost basis of $19.8 million and $35.1 million as of December 31,
2004 and 2003, respectively, are investment securities with maturities of greater than one
year and less than five years and consist of municipal bonds.

$26.3 million is not tax-deductible) related to two acquisitions in the CAG segment, and
$7.4 million of goodwill (all of which is not tax-deductible) related to an acquisition in
the FDG segment. The remaining change in goodwill noted above is a result of changes in
foreign currency exchange rates. The Company did not acquire any goodwill nor did it
record any goodwill impairment charges in 2003.

NOTE 6 IMPAIRMENT OF
LONG-LIVED ASSETS

During
the second quarter of 2002, the Company ceased its distributorship of certain third-party
products in Taiwan. As a result of this event, the Company recorded an impairment charge
of $0.25 million related to goodwill of its Taiwan subsidiary, which was acquired in 1997.

During
the third quarter of 2002, the Company discontinued certain products acquired in the
acquisition of Genera, a reporting unit in the Water segment. The Company allocated a
portion of the purchase price to an intangible asset related to this product at the
acquisition date. The remaining unamortized balance of the intangible asset at the time of
impairment of $0.5 million was charged to general and administrative expense within the
Water segment.

During
the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company entered into a new agreement with Ortho. Under the
new agreement, the Company is developing and will introduce a next-generation chemistry
analyzer for the veterinary market based on Ortho’s dry-slide technology, and Ortho
will supply the Company with the slide consumables used in both the new instrument and the
VetTest

®

chemistry analyzer currently sold by the Company. As a result of
this agreement, the Company decided to discontinue efforts to develop an alternative
chemistry system and incurred a non-cash charge of $7.4 million to write down equipment
purchased to manufacture the consumable used in the alternative chemistry system.

NOTE 7 NOTES PAYABLE

In
connection with the acquisition of a water-testing products business in August 2000, the
Company issued $8.5 million in notes payable to a former shareholder of Genera, of which
$7.0 million was secured by cash in escrow. The remaining $1.5 million was unsecured and
noninterest bearing, and was discounted at 6% to a fair value of $1.3 million. In April
2002, the Company repaid $7.5 million, of which $7.0 million was paid from the cash held
in escrow. The remaining unsecured portion of $1.0 million was due in three annual
installments, beginning in August 2002. The noteholder elected to defer the August 2002
payment of $0.5 million until April 2003. The noteholder elected to defer the August 2003
payment of $0.25 million until February 2004. The noteholder elected to defer the August
2004 payment of $0.25 million until February 2005. The interest rate on the deferred notes
was 3%.

In
connection with the February 2004 acquisition of a veterinary reference laboratory,
described in Note 3, the Company issued a note payable to the sellers for $1.0 million.
The note bears interest at the prime rate. The balance outstanding at December 31, 2004
was $0.9 million. Payments of $0.4 million and $0.5 million, plus accrued interest, are
due in February 2005 and February 2006, respectively.

In
connection with the November 2004 acquisition of the Institut für klinische
Prüfung Ludwigsburg GmbH, described in Note 3, the Company assumed a note payable to
a bank of $0.6 million. The interest rate on the note was 2.9%. The balance outstanding at
December 31, 2004 was $0.6 million. The Company paid the note in full during the first
quarter of 2005.

The
reduction in the effective tax rate from 2002 to 2003 was primarily due to domestic and
international tax-planning initiatives, the charge to write down fixed assets occurring in
a high-tax rate jurisdiction and revisions to prior year international estimates. The
reduction in the effective tax rate from 2003 to 2004 primarily resulted from the
resolution of an IRS income tax audit through the year 2001. As a result of completing
this audit, the company reduced previously accrued taxes. Other rate reduction resulted
from the release in 2004 of a valuation allowance on international deferred tax assets as
a result of a foreign subsidiary demonstrating consistent sustained profitability and
changes in certain state and international tax estimates partially offset by revisions in
2003 to international tax estimates and a charge to write down fixed assets occurring in a
high-tax jurisdiction.

F-19

The
components of the net deferred tax asset (liability) included in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets are as follows

(in thousands)

:

At
December 31, 2004, the Company had United States federal domestic net operating loss
carryforwards of approximately $0.2 million available to offset future taxable income. Net
operating loss carryforwards expire at various dates through 2014. The Tax Reform Act of
1986 contains provisions that limit annual availability of the net operating loss
carryforwards due to a more than 50% change in ownership that occurred upon the
acquisition of some companies.

At
December 31, 2004, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards in foreign and state
jurisdictions of approximately $60.6 million available to offset future taxable income.
These net operating loss carryforwards expire at various dates beginning in 2005. The
Company has recorded a valuation allowance for these assets because realizability is
uncertain.

The
increase in the Company’s valuation allowances from 2002 to 2003 was primarily
related to the generation of state net operating losses that the Company believes are not
likely to be realized. The generation of state net operating losses increased the
Company’s valuation allowance by $0.5 million. The reduction in valuation allowances
from 2003 to 2004 was primarily related to releasing a valuation allowance that previously
offset the international deferred tax assets of an international subsidiary. This
valuation allowance of $0.7 million was released as a result of the Company’s
determination that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be
realized.

The
Company considers the operating earnings of non-United States subsidiaries to be
indefinitely invested outside the United States. No provision has been made for United
States federal and state, or international taxes that may result from future remittances
of undistributed earnings of non-United States subsidiaries, the cumulative amount of
which is $85.5 million as of December 31, 2004. Should the Company repatriate non-United
States earnings, it would have to adjust the income tax provision in the period in which
the decision to repatriate earnings is made.

The
recently enacted

American Jobs Creation Act of 2004

allows for a reduced rate of
United States tax on qualifying repatriations of earnings held outside the United States.
The Company is currently studying the impact of this provision and has not made a final
determination as to the amounts, if any, that will be repatriated. As such, the income tax
effect of any repatriation cannot be estimated.

NOTE 9 EARNINGS PER SHARE

Basic
earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of
shares of common stock and deferred stock units outstanding during the year. The
computation of diluted earnings per share is similar to the computation of basic earnings
per share, except that the denominator is increased for the assumed exercise of dilutive
options and other potentially dilutive securities using the treasury stock method unless
the effect is anti-dilutive.

F-20

The
following is a reconciliation of shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per
share

(in thousands)

:

Deferred
stock units outstanding are included in shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings
per share because the associated shares of the Company’s common stock are issuable
for no cash consideration, the number of shares of the Company’s common stock to be
issued is fixed and issuance is not contingent. See Note 14.

In
connection with the Company’s acquisition of the capital stock of Blue Ridge
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Blue Ridge”) in 1998, the Company issued warrants to
acquire 806,000 shares of common stock at $31.59 per share that expired on September 30,
2003. As of December 31, 2003, all of the warrants were exercised or had expired.

Certain
options and warrants to acquire shares have been excluded from the calculation of shares
outstanding for dilutive earnings per share because they were anti-dilutive. The weighted
average number of anti-dilutive rights (options and warrants) to acquire shares, the
weighted average exercise prices of such anti-dilutive rights and the weighted average

Under
the terms of certain supply agreements with suppliers of the Company’s veterinary
instruments, slides for its VetTest

®

instruments, electrolyte components
and consumables, and certain raw materials, the Company has aggregate commitments to
purchase approximately $152.9 million of products through 2010. In addition, the Company
has various minimum royalty payments due through 2017 of $8.5 million.

The
Company also has certain commitments associated with a joint venture. See Note 16.

Contingencies

The Company
is subject to claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, including with respect
to actual and threatened litigation and other matters. The Company accrues contingent
liabilities when it is probable that future expenditures will be made and such
expenditures can reasonably be estimated. However, the Company’s actual losses with
respect to these contingencies could exceed the Company’s accruals.

In
October 2004, the Company resolved a contingent liability for a third-party claim related
to alleged patent infringement. As a result, the Company recognized reductions of
previously accrued expenses during 2004 of $1.8 million in cost of product revenue.

In
connection with the Blue Ridge acquisition in 1998, the Company agreed to issue up to
1,241,000 shares of its common stock based on the achievement by the Company’s
pharmaceutical business of net sales and operating profit targets through 2004. The
performance period expired on December 31, 2004, and no shares were issued or issuable in
connection with this agreement.

Under
the Company’s workers’ compensation insurance policy for U.S. employees for the
year ended December 31, 2004, the Company retained the first $0.25 million in claim
liability per incident and $3.0 million in aggregate claim liability. For the year ended
December 31, 2003, the Company retained the first $0.25 million in claim liability per
incident and $1.4 million in aggregate claim liability. The Company entered into a similar
workers’ compensation insurance policy effective January 1, 2005. The Company
estimates claim liability based on claims incurred and the estimated ultimate cost to
settle the claims. Based on this analysis, the Company has recognized cumulative expenses
of $0.6 million and $0.9 million for claims incurred during the years ended December 31,
2004 and 2003, respectively. In connection with these policies, the Company has
outstanding letters of credit totaling $1.1 million to the insurance companies as security
for these claims as of December 31, 2004 and has agreed to issue a $0.5 million letter of
credit for 2005.

F-22

Under
the Company’s employee health care insurance policy, the Company retains claims
liability risk up to $0.1 million per incident and an aggregate claim limit based on
monthly participation levels in the employee health care plan. The Company estimates its
provision for the uninsured portion of employee health care obligations based on costs of
claims incurred and an estimate for claims incurred but not reported. Should actual
employee health care claims liability exceed estimates, the Company is liable for up to an
additional $0.8 million for potential uninsured obligations as of December 31, 2004. The
Company has insurance coverage of $1.0 million for claims above the aggregate limit.
Should employee health insurance claims exceed this coverage, the Company would have
further obligations for the amount in excess of such coverage.

The
Company has entered into employment agreements with two of its officers whereby payments
may be required if the Company terminates their employment without cause. The amounts
payable are based upon the executives’ salaries at the time of termination and the
cost to the Company of continuing to provide certain benefits. Had both of such officers
been terminated as of December 31, 2004, the Company would have had aggregate obligations
of approximately $1.8 million under such agreements. The Company has entered into
employment agreements with each of its officers that require the Company to make certain
payments in the event the officer’s employment is terminated under certain
circumstances within a certain period following a change in control of the Company. The
amounts payable by the Company under these agreements is based on the officer’s
salary and bonus history at the time of termination and the cost to the Company of
continuing to provide certain benefits. Had all of the Company’s officers been
terminated following a change in control as of December 31, 2004, the Company would have
had aggregate obligations of approximately $9.7 million under these agreements. These
agreements also provide for the acceleration of the vesting of all stock options held by
two of the officers immediately upon a change in control, and of all stock options held by
the Company’s other executive officers upon any qualifying termination following a
change in control.

The
Company currently purchases certain products and materials from single sources or a
limited number of sources. Some of the products that the Company purchases from these
sources are proprietary, and, therefore, may not be available from other sources. These
products include the Company’s VetTest

®

chemistry, QBC

®

VetAutoread™ hematology, VetLyte

®

electrolyte, and VetStat™
blood gas analyzers and related consumables, digital radiography systems, active
ingredients for pharmaceutical products, including Navigator

®

, and certain
components of the Company’s SNAP

®

rapid assay devices, water-testing
products, and LaserCyte

®

systems. If the Company is unable to obtain
adequate quantities of these products in the future, it could face cost increases or
reductions or delays in product shipments, which could have a material adverse effect on
its results of operations.

From
time to time, the Company has received notices alleging that the Company’s products
infringe third-party proprietary rights, although the Company is not aware of any pending
litigation with respect to such claims. Patent litigation frequently is complex and
expensive, and the outcome of patent litigation can be difficult to predict. There can be
no assurance that the Company will prevail in any infringement proceedings that may be
commenced against the Company. If the Company loses any such litigation, it may be stopped
from selling certain products and/or it may be required to pay damages as a result of the
litigation.

Guarantees

The
following is a summary of the Company’s agreements and obligations that it has
determined to be within the scope of FIN 45, “Guarantor’s Accounting and
Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of
Others, an Interpretation of FASB No. 5, 57 and 107 and a Rescission of FASB
Interpretation No. 34” (“FIN 45”).

The
Company’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that the Company
will indemnify its officers and directors to the maximum extent permitted by Delaware law.
The maximum payment that the Company may be required to make under such provisions is
theoretically unlimited and is impossible to determine. The Company maintains
directors’ and officers’ liability insurance, which may provide reimbursement to
the Company for payments made to, or on behalf of, officers and directors pursuant to the
indemnification provisions. The Company’s indemnification obligations were
grandfathered under the provisions of FIN 45 as they were in effect prior to December 31,
2002. Accordingly, the Company has recorded no liability for such obligations as of
December 31, 2004 and 2003.

The
Company enters into agreements with third parties in the ordinary course of business under
which the Company is obligated to indemnify such third parties for and against various
risks and losses. The precise terms of such indemnities vary with the nature of the
agreement. In many cases, the Company limits the maximum amount of its indemnification
obligations, but in some cases, those obligations may be theoretically unlimited. The
Company has not incurred material expenses in discharging any of these indemnification
obligations, and based on its analysis of the nature of the risks involved, the Company
believes that the fair value of these agreements is minimal. Accordingly, the Company has
recorded no liabilities for these obligations as of December 31, 2004 and 2003.

F-23

When
acquiring a business, the Company sometimes assumes liability for certain events or
occurrences that took place prior to the date of acquisition. However, the Company does
not believe that there are any preacquisition liabilities or guarantees that have not
been recorded. Accordingly, the Company has no liabilities recorded for these liabilities
as of December 31, 2004.

NOTE 11
STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY

(a) Preferred Stock

The
Board of Directors is authorized, subject to any limitations prescribed by law, without
further stockholder approval, to issue from time to time up to 500,000 shares of Preferred
Stock, $1.00 par value per share (“Preferred Stock”), in one or more series.
Each such series of Preferred Stock shall have such number of shares, designations,
preferences, voting powers, qualifications and special or relative rights or privileges as
shall be determined by the Board of Directors, which may include, among others, dividend
rights, voting rights, redemption and sinking fund provisions, liquidation preferences,
conversion rights and preemptive rights.

(b) Series A Junior
Participating Preferred Stock

On
December 17, 1996, the Company designated 100,000 shares of Preferred Stock as Series A
Junior Participating Preferred Stock (“Series A Stock”) in connection with its
Shareholder Rights Plan. See Note 12. In general, each share of Series A Stock will: (i)
be entitled to a minimum preferential quarterly dividend of $10 per share and to an
aggregate dividend of 1,000 times the dividend declared per share of Common Stock, (ii) in
the event of liquidation, be entitled to a minimum preferential liquidation payment of
$1,000 per share (plus accrued and unpaid dividends) and to an aggregate payment of 1,000
times the payment made per share of Common Stock, (iii) have 1,000 votes, voting together
with the Common Stock, (iv) in the event of any merger, consolidation or other transaction
in which Common Stock is exchanged, be entitled to receive 1,000 times the amount received
per share of Common Stock and (v) not be redeemable. These rights are protected by
customary antidilution provisions. There are no shares of Series A Stock outstanding.

NOTE 12 PREFERRED STOCK
PURCHASE RIGHTS

On
December 17, 1996, the Company adopted a Shareholder Rights Plan and declared a dividend
of one preferred stock purchase right for each outstanding share of Common Stock to
stockholders of record at the close of business on December 30, 1996. Under certain
conditions, each right may be exercised to purchase one one-thousandth of a share of
Series A Stock at a purchase price of $200.00. The rights will be exercisable only if a
person or group has acquired beneficial ownership of 20% or more of the Common Stock or
commenced a tender or exchange offer that would result in such a person or group owning
30% or more of the Common Stock. The Company generally will be entitled to redeem the
rights, in whole, but not in part, at a price of $.01 per right at any time until the
tenth business day following a public announcement that a 20% stock position has been
acquired and in certain other circumstances.

If
any person or group becomes a beneficial owner of 20% or more of the Common Stock (except
pursuant to a tender or exchange offer for all shares at a fair price as determined by the
outside members of the Company’s Board of Directors), each right not owned by a 20%
stockholder will enable its holder to purchase such number of shares of Common Stock as is
equal to the exercise price of the right divided by one-half of the current market price
of the Common Stock on the date of the occurrence of the event. In addition, if the
Company thereafter is acquired in a merger or other business combination with another
person or group in which it is not the surviving corporation or in connection with which
its Common Stock is changed or converted, or if the Company sells or transfers 50% or more
of its assets or earning power to another person, each right that has not previously been
exercised will entitle its holder to purchase such number of shares of common stock of
such other person as is equal to the exercise price of the right divided by one-half of
the current market price of such common stock on the date of the occurrence of the event.

NOTE 13 TREASURY STOCK

The
Company’s Board of Directors has approved the repurchase of up to 14,000,000 shares
of the Company’s common stock in the open market or in negotiated transactions.
During the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, the Company repurchased
approximately 2,413,000, 927,000 and 1,000,000 shares, respectively, of common stock for
$128.8 million, $36.2 million and $29.8 million, respectively. From the inception of the
stock repurchase program in August 1999 to December 31, 2004, the Company had repurchased
11,955,000 shares for $342.3 million. Additionally, during 2004, 2003 and 2002, the
Company received approximately 1,000, 133,000 and 36,000 shares of stock, respectively,
which were owned by the holder for greater than six months, in payment for the exercise
price of stock options. The shares of stock had a fair market value of $0.1 million, $4.9
million and $1.1 million, respectively.

NOTE 14 STOCK-BASED
COMPENSATION PLANS

The
Company’s stock-based compensation plans are described below. Each of these plans,
and any amendments thereto increasing the number of shares issuable thereunder, was
approved by the Company’s stockholders.

1991 Stock Option Plan

During
1991, the Board of Directors approved the 1991 Stock Option Plan (“1991 Stock
Plan”), which, as amended, provided for grants of up to 6,475,000 incentive and
nonqualified stock options at the discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Board of
Directors. Incentive stock options were granted at the fair market value on the date of
grant and expired ten years from the date of grant. Incentive stock options for greater
than 10% shareholders were granted at 110% of the fair market value and expired five years
from the date of grant. Nonstatutory options could be granted at no less than 100% of the
fair market value on the date of grant. The vesting schedule of all options was determined
by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors at the time of grant. In May 2003,
the 1991 Stock Plan was terminated and replaced with the 2003 Stock Incentive Plan, and
shares remaining under the 1991 Stock Plan were transferred to the 2003 Stock Incentive
Plan.

1991 Director Option Plan

During
1991, the Board of Directors approved the 1991 Director Option Plan (as amended, the
“1991 Director Plan”) pursuant to which Directors who were not officers or
employees of the Company were eligible to receive nonstatutory options to purchase shares
of the Company’s common stock. The time period for granting options under the 1991
Director Plan expired in accordance with the terms of the plan in June 1996.

1997 Director Option Plan

During
1997, the Board of Directors approved the 1997 Director Option Plan (the “1997
Director Plan”) pursuant to which Directors who were not officers or employees of the
Company received nonstatutory options to purchase shares of the Company’s common
stock. On May 19, 1999, this plan was terminated and replaced with the 1999 Director Stock
Plan.

1998 Stock Incentive Plan

During
1998, the Board of Directors approved the 1998 Stock Incentive Plan (the “1998 Stock
Plan”), which provided for grants of incentive and nonqualified stock options at the
discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. A total of 4,100,000
shares of common stock could be issued under the 1998 Stock Plan as amended. Options
granted under the 1998 Stock Plan could not be granted at an exercise price less than the
fair market value of the common stock on the date granted (or less than 110% of the fair
market value in the case of incentive stock options granted to holders of more than 10% of
the Company’s common stock). Options could not be granted for a term of more than ten
years. The vesting schedule of all options granted under the 1998 Stock Plan was
determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors at the time of grant.
In May 2003, the 1998 Stock Plan was terminated and replaced with the 2003 Stock Incentive
Plan, and shares remaining under the 1998 Stock Plan were transferred to the 2003 Stock
Incentive Plan.

1999 Director Stock Plan

During
1999, the Board of Directors approved the 1999 Director Stock Plan (the “1999
Director Plan”) pursuant to which Directors who were not officers or employees of the
Company received shares of the Company’s common stock. A total of 80,000 shares of
common stock were issuable under the 1999 Director Plan. In May 2000, the 1999 Director
Plan was terminated and replaced with the 2000 Director Option Plan. As of December 31,
2000, 13,364 shares had been issued under the 1999 Director Plan, and the fair value of
these shares of $0.4 million was charged to expense in 1999 and 2000.

F-25

2000 Director Option Plan

During
2000, the Board of Directors approved the 2000 Director Option Plan (the “2000
Director Plan”) pursuant to which Directors who were not officers or employees of the
Company received nonstatutory options to purchase shares of the Company’s common
stock. Under the 2000 Director Plan, each nonemployee Director was granted an option to
purchase 6,500 shares of common stock at each annual meeting of the Company’s
shareholders. Options granted under the 2000 Director Plan had an exercise price equal to
the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant, vested
fully on the first anniversary of the date of grant and expired ten years from the date of
grant. A total of 200,000 shares of common stock were issuable under the plan. In May
2003, the 2000 Director Plan was terminated and replaced with the 2003 Stock Incentive
Plan, and shares remaining under the 2000 Director Plan were transferred to the 2003 Stock
Incentive Plan.

2003 Stock Incentive Plan

During
2003, the Board of Directors approved the 2003 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended (the
“2003 Stock Plan”) pursuant to which employees and Directors of the Company may
receive various types of stock-based incentives, including stock options, restricted
stock, stock appreciation rights and deferred stock units. A total of 1,850,000 shares of
common stock are authorized for issuance under the 2003 Stock Plan, as amended, provided
that no more than 1,500,000 shares will be available for the grant of incentive stock
options, and no more than 600,000 shares will be available for awards other than stock
options and stock appreciation rights. In addition, if any options granted under the 1991
Stock Plan, the 1998 Stock Plan or the 2000 Director Plan terminate, expire or are
forfeited without having been exercised in full, the shares subject to such unexercised
options are available for issuance under the 2003 Stock Plan. Options granted under the
2003 Stock Plan may not be granted at an exercise price less than the fair market value of
the common stock on the date granted (or less than 110% of the fair market value in the
case of incentive stock options granted to holders of more than 10% of the Company’s
Common Stock). Options may not be granted for a term of more than ten years. The vesting
schedule of all options granted under the 2003 Stock Plan is determined by the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors at the time of grant.

Deferred Compensation
Plans

During
2003, the Company adopted new compensation policies for Directors who are not officers or
employees. Under these new policies, nonemployee Directors are required to defer a
portion of their cash fees in the form of Deferred Stock Units, each of which represents
the right to receive one unissued share of the Company’s common stock pursuant to the
Company’s Director Deferred Compensation Plan. Directors may elect to defer
additional fees in the form of Deferred Stock Units. Directors receive a number of
Deferred Stock Units equal to the amount of cash fees deferred divided by the closing sale
price of the common stock on the date of deferral. Deferred Stock Units will be exchanged
for an equivalent number of shares of common stock by the Company one year following a
Director’s resignation or retirement. The value of these Deferred Stock Units is
expensed as compensation when earned, but in all cases prior to the issuance of the
Deferred Stock Units. The Company also has adopted an Executive Deferred Compensation Plan
(the “Executive Plan”) under which certain members of the Company’s
management may elect to defer a portion of their cash compensation, beginning with 2003
incentive compensation paid in 2004, in Deferred Stock Units. These Deferred Stock Units
will be exchanged for a fixed number of shares of common stock on dates determined by the
employee, subject to the limitations of the Executive Plan and applicable law. The
Deferred Stock Units are presented in the stockholders’ equity section of the balance
sheet as deferred equity-based compensation. During the years ended December 31, 2004 and
2003, approximately 10,400 and 3,300 Deferred Stock Units, respectively, valued at $0.5
million and $0.1 million, respectively, were issued.

Employee Stock Purchase
Plans

During
1997, the Board of Directors approved the 1997 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, under which
the Company has reserved and may issue up to an aggregate of 620,000 shares of Common
Stock in semiannual offerings. Also during 1997, the Board of Directors approved the 1997
International Employee Stock Purchase Plan, under which the Company had reserved and could
issue up to an aggregate of 30,000 shares of Common Stock in semiannual offerings. The
1997 International Employee Stock Purchase Plan was terminated in February 2005, and there
were no shares remaining thereunder at the time of termination. Stock is sold under each
of these plans at 85% of fair market value, as defined in the plans. Shares subscribed to
and issued under the plans were 44,000, 50,000 and 55,000 in 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.

Fair Value of
Stock-Based Compensation

As
discussed in Note 2(k), the Company accounts for stock-based compensation to employees in
accordance with APB No. 25, and elects to disclose the pro forma impact of accounting for

Plan”). Employees eligible to participate in the 401(k) Plan may contribute specified
percentages of their salaries, a portion of which will be matched by the Company. The
Company matched $2.0 million for the year 2004, $1.7 million for the year 2003, and $1.6

NOTE 16 JOINT VENTURE

On
June 18, 2003, the Company and Beijing Fortunate Century Animal Health Co., Ltd.
(“BFCAH”), formed a joint venture, Beijing IDEXX-Yuanheng Laboratories Co.
Limited (the “Venture”), to assemble and market veterinary diagnostic products
for production animals in China. The Venture is headquartered in Beijing, China. The
Company’s initial equity interest in the Venture is 40%, however, the Company is
committed to acquire an additional 20% of the Venture from BFCAH within two years of the
formation of the joint venture, subject to Chinese government approval. The Company bears
an economic risk that is greater than its equity interest and also has the ability to make
decisions that significantly affect the results of the activities of the Venture through
majority board representation. Therefore, the Venture is consolidated into the
Company’s financial statements in accordance with FIN 46R. The Company contributed
$1.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2003, and is obligated to make future
capital contributions of $0.6 million before August 11, 2005. In addition, the Company is
obligated to pay $0.6 million for the additional 20% interest discussed above, and to make
an additional $1.5 million capital contribution to the Venture within three months after
the approval by the Chinese government of the additional 20% interest.

The
Company is also obligated to make available to the Venture selected technology, know-how
and licenses and to assist with certain logistical, management training and operating
matters. In connection with the joint venture agreement, the Company has not entered into
indemnification agreements or assumed liabilities predating the establishment of the
Venture.
