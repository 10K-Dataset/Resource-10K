PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

We operate in two primary business areas: products and services for the veterinary market, which we refer to as our Companion Animal Group ("CAG") segment, and products and services for food and environmental markets, which we refer to as our Food and Environmental Division ("FED") segment.  See Note 11 to the financial statements for financial information about our business segments.

*    COMPANION ANIMAL GROUP

Immunoassays

We provide a broad range of single-use, hand-held test kits that allow quick (in most cases, less than ten minutes), accurate and convenient testing for a variety of companion animal diseases and health conditions.  These products enable veterinarians to provide improved service to animal owners by delivering test results in the clinic, allowing the veterinarian to initiate therapy or prevention during the office visit, if required.

Our test kits incorporate immunoassay technology based on antibody-antigen reactions.  Antibodies are proteins produced as a result of an immune response, a biological mechanism that enables certain animals to recognize and respond to substances foreign to the body, called antigens.  Antibodies are produced by the immune system specifically to bind to these antigens and also to signal other immune system cells to assist in eliminating the antigen.  Antigens include viruses, bacteria, parasites and hormones.  In immunoassay-based tests, a sample containing an unknown quantity of the analyte is mixed with one or more reagents.  Certain of these reagents contain either antibodies or antigens that bind in a highly specific manner to the analyte.  Certain reagents are labeled with an indicator chemical, which identifies the presence or absence of the analyte.  In some cases results can be read visually; in others, instruments are used to det
ermine the results.

Our principal single-use tests are sold under the SNAP name, and include tests for feline leukemia virus ("FeLV") in cats and heartworm disease in dogs and cats.  We also sell a feline combination test, the SNAP Combo FeLV/FIV, which enables veterinarians to test simultaneously for FeLV and feline immunodeficiency virus ("FIV") (similar to the human AIDS virus), and a canine combination test, the SNAP 3Dx, which tests simultaneously for Lyme disease,

Ehrlichia canis

and heartworm.  Sales of heartworm tests are significantly greater in the first half of our fiscal year due to seasonality of the disease.

In addition to our single-use tests, we sell a line of microwell-based test kits, under the PetChek name, which are used by larger clinics and independent laboratories to test multiple samples.  PetChek tests offer accuracy, ease of use and cost advantages to high-volume customers.  We currently sell PetChek tests for FeLV, FIV and canine heartworm disease.

Instruments

We currently market several instrument systems for use in veterinary clinics.  These instruments include the following:

Blood Chemistry

.

Our VetTest blood chemistry analyzer is used to measure levels of certain enzymes and other substances in blood in order to assist the veterinarian in diagnosing physiologic conditions.  Twenty-one separate blood chemistry tests can be performed on the VetTest analyzer.  Commonly run tests include glucose, alkaline phosphatase, ALT (alanine aminotransferase), creatinine, BUN (blood urea nitrogen) and total protein.

Hematology

.

The QBC

â

VetAutoread

ä

hematology analyzer is used to evaluate certain components of blood, including red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets.  These values are useful in determining disease state and health conditions.  This system is based on the Becton Dickinson QBC

â

Autoread

ä

hematology system, which is sold to physicians for human applications.  We also are developing a new hematology system called the LaserCyte system, which uses laser flow cytometry technology.  The LaserCyte system is designed to provide certain diagnostic capabilities that cannot be obtained from existing in-clinic systems, which will provide veterinarians with more information necessary to make important clinical decisions regarding an animal's health.  We expect to introduce the LaserCyte system in the second half of 2002.

Quantitative Hormone Testing

.

The VetTest SNAP Reader allows the veterinarian to obtain quantitative measurement of hormones including thyroxine and cortisol.  These measurements assist in diagnosing and monitoring the treatment of certain endocrine diseases, such as hyper- and hypo-thyroidism, Cushing's syndrome and Addison's disease.  The VetTest SNAP Reader is a

module that can be integrated with the VetTest chemistry analyzer.  Samples and reagents are introduced to the analyzer using our SNAP device.

Page 3

Electrolytes

.

Our VetLyte system measures three electrolytes -- sodium, potassium and chloride -- to aid in evaluating acid-base and electrolyte balances and assessing plasma hydration.  Test results are available in less than one minute after sample introduction and are either displayed on the VetLyte analyzer or downloaded to the VetTest analyzer.

Veterinary Laboratory and Consulting Services

We offer commercial veterinary laboratory and consulting services in the U.S. through facilities located in Arizona, California, Colorado, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Oregon and Texas.  Through subsidiaries located in the United Kingdom, Japan and Australia, we offer commercial veterinary laboratory services to veterinary clinics located in those countries.  Veterinarians use our services by submitting samples by courier or overnight delivery to one of our facilities.  Our laboratories offer a large selection of tests and diagnostic panels to detect a number of disease states and other conditions in production and companion animals.

Additionally, we provide specialized veterinary consultation, telemedicine and advisory services, including cardiology, radiology, internal medicine, dermatology and ultrasound consulting.  These services permit veterinarians to obtain readings and interpretations of test results transmitted by telephone and over the Internet from the veterinarians' offices.

Approximately 74%, 75% and 69% of our revenues were derived from sales of veterinary diagnostic products and services within the CAG segment in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

Information Products and Services

Our practice management information software business was formed in 1997 with the acquisitions of Advanced Veterinary Systems and Professionals' Software, Inc.  Veterinarians use practice information management software to run key functions of their clinics, including scheduling, billing and patient records management.  In January 2000, we launched vetconnect.com, an Internet portal for the veterinary medical market.  Vetconnect.com is a comprehensive suite of information and business services designed to support veterinary medical practice and extend the value of our in-clinic products, laboratory and consulting services and information offerings.  We believe we are the leading provider of veterinary practice information management software systems in the U.S. with an installed based of more than 8,000 of the approximately 25,000 veterinary hospitals in North America.  We also provide software and hardware support and derive a signific
ant portion of our revenues for this product line from ongoing service contracts.

Veterinary Pharmaceuticals

In October 1998, we acquired Blue Ridge Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ("Blue Ridge"), a privately-held company engaged in the development of novel therapeutics for the veterinary market.  Blue Ridge was formed in 1996 to develop products for therapeutic applications in companion animals and livestock that might not fit the strategic goals of larger pharmaceutical companies marketing both human and veterinary products.  In December 2000, we introduced ACAREXX (.01% Ivermectin) otic suspension for the treatment of ear mites in cats.  ACAREXX is our first drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA").  We currently have a number of other products in the registration process with the FDA, including a nitazoxanide-based product for treatment of equine protozoal myeloencephalitis, a neurological disease that is believed to affect approximately 200,000 horses in the U.S.; a topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory for equine use; an in
sulin product for treatment of diabetic cats; and a long-acting, injectable antibiotic for cats.

*    FOOD AND ENVIRONMENTAL DIVISION

We sell products that detect microbial contaminants in water and antibiotic residues in milk, and a broad range of diagnostic and health monitoring products for production animals (primarily poultry, livestock and swine).

Approximately 20%, 20% and 22% of our revenues were derived from sales of food and environmental products and services in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.  Through a series of transactions completed late in 1999 and early 2000, we disposed of our food microbiology testing products and services business.  Revenues from this disposed product line were approximately $0.8 million and $14.0 million in 2000 and 1999, respectively.

Page 4

Water and Dairy Testing Products

Our Colilert, Colilert-18 and Colisure tests, based on patented Defined Substrate Technology ("DST"), simultaneously detect total coliforms and

E. coli

in water.  These organisms are broadly used as indicators of microbial contamination in water.  Our DST products utilize indicator-nutrients that produce a change in color or fluorescence when metabolized by target microbes in the sample.  Our water tests are used by government laboratories, water utilities and private certified laboratories to test drinking water in compliance with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") standards.  The tests also are used in evaluating water used in production processes (for example, in beverage and pharmaceutical applications) and in evaluating bottled water, recreational water, waste water and water from private wells.

Our Enterolert product is also based on DST and detects enterococci in drinking and recreational waters, with results available in 24 hours.  Our Quanti-Tray product, when used in conjunction with our Colilert, Colilert-18, Colisure or Enterolert products, provides users quantitative measurements of microbial contamination, rather then a presence/absence indication.  The Colilert, Colilert-18, Colisure and Quanti-Tray products have been approved by the EPA and by regulatory agencies in certain other countries.

In August 2000, we acquired Genera Technologies Limited, a U.K.-based company that develops and sells products for detection of cryptosporidia in water.  Cryptosporidia are parasites that can cause potentially fatal gastrointestinal illness if ingested.  Testing of water supplies for cryptosporidia is mandated by regulation in the United Kingdom but is not regulated in other countries at this time.

We are a worldwide leader in rapid testing of antibiotic residue in milk.  We offer antibiotic residue tests on our SNAP platform, and we also sell the Parallux system, an instrument-based testing system.  Dairy producers and processors use our tests for incoming quality assurance of raw milk, and government and food quality managers use them for ongoing surveillance.  IDEXX dairy quality tests are designed for convenience in field and laboratory testing applications and are calibrated to detect antibiotic residues at levels specified by regulation.

Production Animal Services

We sell diagnostic tests and related instrumentation and software that are used to detect a wide range of diseases and monitor health status in production animals.  Our production animal products are purchased primarily by government laboratories and poultry and swine producers.  Significant products include diagnostic tests for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome ("PRRS") and pseudorabies virus in pigs; Newcastle disease in poultry; and Johne's disease and brucellosis in cattle.

MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION

We market, sell and service our products in more than 50 countries through our marketing, sales and technical service groups as well as through independent distributors and other resellers.  We maintain sales offices outside the U.S. in Australia, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Mexico, The Netherlands, Spain, Taiwan and the United Kingdom.

Generally, we will select the appropriate distribution channel for our products based on the type of product, technical service requirements, number and concentration of customers, regulatory requirements and other factors.  We market our veterinary diagnostic products to veterinarians both directly and through independent veterinary distributors in the U.S., with most instruments sold directly by IDEXX sales personnel, and test kits and consumables supplied both via the distribution channel and directly.  Outside the U.S., we sell our veterinary diagnostic products through independent distributors and other resellers and, in certain countries, through our direct sales force.  We market our software products and veterinary laboratory services through our direct sales force.  We market our water, dairy, livestock and poultry products primarily through our direct sales force in the U.S. and Canada.  Outside the U.S. and Canada, we market 
these products through selected independent distributors and, in certain countries, through our direct sales force.

In 2001, 2000 and 1999, 28%, 27% and 27%, respectively, of our revenue was attributable to sales of products and services to customers outside the U.S.  Risks associated with foreign operations include the need for additional regulatory approvals, possible disruptions in transportation of our products, the differing product needs of foreign customers, difficulties in building and managing foreign operations, fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies, import/export duties and quotas, and unexpected regulatory, economic or political changes in foreign markets.  We engage in limited hedging activities to reduce the effect of foreign currency fluctuations on our earnings.  See Note 11 to the financial statements for information by geographic region.

Page 5

In 2001 and 2000, no customer accounted for 10% or more of our sales.  In 1999, 10% of our sales were to The Butler Company, a distributor of veterinary products.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

Our business includes the development and introduction of new products and may involve entry into new business areas.  Our research and development activity is focused primarily on development of new animal drugs, new diagnostic instrument platforms and improvements to our diagnostic and testing products.  Our research and development expenses were approximately $28.4, $28.3 and $27.3 million in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

PATENTS AND LICENSES

We actively seek to obtain patent protection in the U.S. and other countries for inventions covering our products and technologies.  We also license patents and technologies from third parties.  These licenses include an exclusive royalty-bearing license of certain patents relating to diagnostic products for FIV from The Regents of the University of California, and an exclusive royalty-bearing license of certain patents relating to DST utilized in the Colilert, Colisure and Enterolert water testing products.  Licensed U.S. patents related to FIV diagnostics expire in 2008 and 2009.  Licensed U.S. patents relating to DST expire in 2007.  In addition, we hold a royalty-bearing patent license relating to canine heartworm tests from Barnes-Jewish Hospital.  The U.S. patent rights licensed from Barnes-Jewish Hospital expire in 2006.

To the extent some of our products may now, or in the future, embody technologies protected by patents, copyrights or trade secrets of others, we may be required to obtain licenses to such technologies in order to continue to sell our products.  These licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.  Our failure to obtain any such licenses may delay or prevent the sale of certain new or existing products.  See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Future Operating Results."

PRODUCTION AND SUPPLY

VetTest analyzers are manufactured for us by Tokyo Parts Industrial Company Ltd. under an agreement that renews annually unless either party notifies the other of its decision not to renew.  The dry chemistry slides used in the VetTest analyzer ("VetTest Slides") are supplied exclusively by Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, Inc. (formerly known as Johnson and Johnson Clinical Diagnostics, Inc.) ("Ortho") under supply agreements with Ortho (the "Ortho Agreements").  We are required to purchase all of our requirements for slides from Ortho to the extent available.  In addition, we have committed to minimum annual purchase volumes of certain VetTest Slides during the term of the Ortho Agreements.  The Ortho Agreements do not prohibit Ortho from selling dry chemistry slides for use in veterinary applications, and Ortho currently sells dry chemistry slides for use in its own analyzer, which is primarily designed for human applications but is also 
used in the veterinary market.  However, Ortho may not sell slides that are bar-coded for use in the VetTest analyzer to any party other than IDEXX.  The Ortho Agreements expire on December 31, 2010 and contain provisions for the negotiation of a renewal term of five years.

The QBC

â

VetAutoread

ä

system is manufactured for us by Becton Dickinson under a development and distribution agreement that requires Becton Dickinson to supply analyzers to us through 2008 and reagents through 2010.  Becton Dickinson is the sole source of these analyzers and reagents.

Certain other components of our products also are available from only one source.  While we do not anticipate difficulties in obtaining any of the components used in our products, the loss of any of these sources of supply would have a material adverse effect on the Company.

Substantially all of our revenue in each quarter results from orders booked in that quarter.  Accordingly, we maintain no significant backlog and believe that our backlog at any particular date is not indicative of future sales.

COMPETITION

We face intense competition within the markets in which we sell our products and services.  We expect that future competition will become even more intense, and that we will have to compete with changing technologies, which could affect the marketability of our products and services.  Our competitive position also will depend on our ability to develop proprietary products, attract and retain

Page 6

qualified scientific and other personnel, develop and implement production and marketing plans, obtain patent protection and obtain adequate capital resources.

We compete with many companies ranging from small businesses focused on animal health to large pharmaceutical companies.  Our competitors vary in our different markets.  Academic institutions, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations also conduct research activities and may commercialize products, which could compete with our products, on their own or through joint ventures.  Many of our competitors have substantially greater capital, manufacturing, marketing and research and development resources than us.

Competitive factors in our different business areas are detailed below:

GOVERNMENT REGULATION

Many of our products are subject to regulation by U.S. and foreign regulatory agencies.  The following is a description of the principal regulations affecting our businesses.

Veterinary diagnostic products

.  Most diagnostic tests for animal health applications are veterinary biological products that are regulated in the U.S. by the Center for Veterinary Biologics within the U.S. Department of Agriculture's ("USDA") Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service ("APHIS").  The APHIS regulatory approval process involves the submission of product performance data and manufacturing documentation.  Following regulatory approval to market a product, APHIS requires that each lot of product be submitted for review before release to customers.  In addition, APHIS requires special approval to market products where test results are used in part for government-mandated disease management programs.  A number of foreign governments accept APHIS approval as part of their separate regulatory approvals.  However, compliance with an extensive regulatory process is required in connection with marketing diagnostic products 
in Japan, Germany, The Netherlands and many other countries.  We also are required to have a facility license from APHIS to manufacture USDA-licensed products.  We have obtained such a license for our manufacturing facility in Westbrook, Maine.

Our instrument systems are medical devices regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") under the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act (the "FDC Act").  While the sale of these products does not require premarket approval by FDA and does not subject us to the FDA's Good Manufacturing Practices regulations ("GMPs"), these products must not be adulterated or misbranded under the FDC Act.

Veterinary pharmaceuticals

.  The manufacture and sale of veterinary pharmaceuticals are regulated by the Center for Veterinary Medicine ("CVM") of the FDA.  A new animal drug may not be commercially marketed in the U.S. unless it has been approved as safe and effective by CVM.  Approval may be requested by filing a New Animal Drug Application ("NADA") with CVM containing substantial evidence as to the safety and effectiveness of the drug.  For food animals, the data must also include extensive data to support a withdrawal period or other use restriction to ensure that the proposed drug use will produce animals and animal products that are safe for human consumption.  Data regarding manufacturing methods and controls is also required to be submitted with the NADA.  Manufacturers of animal drugs must also comply with GMPs.  Sales of animal drugs in countries outside the U.S. require compliance with the laws of those countries, whic
h may be extensive.

Page 7

Water testing products

.  Our water tests are not subject to formal premarket regulatory approval.  However, before a test may be used as part of a water quality monitoring program required by the EPA, the test must first be approved by the EPA.  The EPA approval process involves submission of extensive product performance data in accordance with an EPA approved protocol, evaluation of the data by the EPA and publication for public comment of any proposed approval in the Federal Register before final approval.  Our Colilert, Colilert-18, Colisure and Quanti-Tray products have been approved by the EPA.  The sale of water testing products also is subject to extensive and lengthy regulatory processes in many other countries around the world.

Dairy testing products

.  The sale of dairy testing products in the U.S. is regulated by the FDA in conjunction with the Association of Official Analytical Chemists - Research Institute ("AOAC-RI").  Before a product may be sold, extensive product performance data must be submitted in accordance with a protocol that is approved by the FDA and the AOAC-RI.  Following approval of a product by FDA, the product must also be approved by the National Conference on Interstate Milk Shipments ("NCIMS"), an oversight body that includes state, federal and industry representatives.  Our SNAP Beta-lactam and Parallux dairy antibiotic residue testing products have been approved by the FDA and NCIMS.  While some foreign countries accept AOAC-RI approval as part of their regulatory approval process, many countries have separate regulatory processes.

Any acquisitions of new products and technologies may subject us to additional areas of government regulation.  These may involve food, drug and water quality regulations of the FDA, the EPA and the USDA, as well as state, local and foreign governments.  See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Future Operating Results."

EMPLOYEES

As of December 31, 2001, IDEXX had approximately 2,170 full-time and part-time employees.  We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreement and we believe that relations with our employees are good.

ITEM 2.      PROPERTIES

We own approximately 12 acres of undeveloped land in Westbrook, Maine.  We lease approximately 290,000 square feet of office and manufacturing space in Westbrook, Maine under a lease expiring in 2008, approximately 75,000 square feet of industrial space in Memphis, Tennessee for use as a distribution facility, under a lease expiring in 2007, and approximately 40,000 square feet of office and manufacturing space in Eau Claire, Wisconsin for our veterinary practice information management software business.

We also lease a total of approximately 100,000 square feet of smaller office, manufacturing and warehouse space in the U.S. and elsewhere in the world.  In addition, we own or lease approximately 114,000 square feet of space in the U.S., Australia and the United Kingdom for use as veterinary reference laboratories and office space for our veterinary consulting services.  Of this space, 46,000 square feet is owned by us and the remaining amount is leased, under leases having expiration dates up to the year 2012.

ITEM 3.      LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

We are not a party to any material legal proceedings.

ITEM 4.      SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

No matters were submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year covered by this report.

The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S.  The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.  On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to customer programs and incentives, product returns, bad debts, inventories, investments, intangible assets, income taxes, warranty obligations, restructuring and contingencies and litigation.  We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying v
alues of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.

Inventory

Our inventories include material, labor and overhead, and are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market.  We write down inventory for estimated obsolescence based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions, which may negatively affect our ability to dispose of inventory.  If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required, which would have a negative effect on our results of operations.

Our inventories as of December 31, 2001 included $8.6 million of raw materials associated with our nitazoxanide product in registration with the FDA, of which $8.4 million will expire and become unusable in 2004 and the remainder has no expiration date. We have completed manufacturing and efficacy components of our submission to the FDA.  We have completed additional safety studies requested by the FDA with respect to this product and are preparing a submission reporting the results of these studies. We believe that the product is approvable by the FDA and that this inventory will be saleable upon such approval.  If this product is not approved by the FDA, we believe we have the ability to recoup a substantial portion of our costs through alternative future uses of the material or other means.  We have provided reserves to cover estimated potential losses in this scenario.  However, we cannot provide assurance that the FDA will approve 
this product or, if approval is not obtained, that our current estimates of recovery of our investment in this inventory will not change.

Our inventories include $30.4 million of slides used in our chemistry instruments, which represents approximately 1.3 turns based on recent historical usage.  These slides have a shelf life of 24 months at the date of manufacture.  The average remaining shelf life at December 31, 2001 was 16.5 months.  In addition, we are required to purchase $289.0 million of slides over the remaining nine years of our contract with Ortho.  We believe the demand for these slides is at a level sufficient to ensure that we will not incur a loss on the inventory or the contract.  However, a reduction in the demand for slides could cause us to incur a loss related to our slide inventory or purchase commitments at a future date.

Our inventories include $6.0 million of component parts associated with our LaserCyte hematology instrument, which is in the final stages of development.  In addition, we have placed $0.9 million in deposits with vendors to secure additional critical components and we have firm purchase commitments of an additional $6.2 million.  We expect to launch this product in the second

half of 2002 and to fully realize our investment and purchase commitments.  However, if we are unable to introduce this product, or if we alter the final design, we may be required to write-off a certain amount of the associated inventory.

The slides, nitazoxanide and LaserCyte products are included in our CAG segment.

Valuation of Long-lived and Intangible Assets and Goodwill

We assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles, long-lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.  Factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include but are not limited to the following:

·

significant under-performance relative to historical or projected future operating results;

·

significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business; and

·

significant negative industry or economic trends.

When we determine that the carrying value of intangibles, long-lived assets and goodwill may not be recoverable based on a change in events and circumstances discussed above, we measure any impairment based on the projected undiscounted cash flow method.  Net intangible assets and goodwill amounted to $55.2 million as of December 31, 2001, consisting of $24.3 million related to veterinary laboratories, $15.0 million related to water test products, $14.6 million related to veterinary pharmaceutical products and $1.3 million of other.

In 2002, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets", became effective and as a result, we will cease to amortize approximately $50.9 million of goodwill.  We had recorded approximately $5.1 million of amortization on these amounts during 2001 and would have recorded approximately $4.3 million of amortization during 2002 if the existing standards had been continued.  In lieu of amortization, we are required to perform an initial impairment review of our goodwill in 2002 and an annual impairment review thereafter.  We expect to complete our initial review during the first half of 2002.

We currently do not expect to record an impairment charge upon completion of the initial impairment review.  However, there can be no assurance that at the time the review is completed a material impairment charge will not be recorded.

Revenue Recognition

We recognize product revenue at the time of shipment (including to distributors) for substantially all products except software licenses and hardware systems.  We recognize revenue from non-cancelable software licenses and hardware systems upon installation and customer acceptance of the software because at this time collection is probable and we have no significant further obligations after installation.  Our distributors do not have the right to return products.  Service revenue is recognized at the time the service is performed.  Maintenance revenue is billed in advance and recognized over the life of the contracts, usually one year or less.  Certain instrument systems are sold to a third-party finance company that leases these systems to its customers with a right-of-return privilege.  We allow the third-party finance company to return these instruments to us for a partial refund based on the time from product return to end of lease
 term.  Therefore we recognize revenue under these contracts over the term of the underlying customer lease contract.  We lease certain instruments directly to customers and recognize revenues from those leases over the terms of those leases.  We record estimated reductions to revenue in connection with customer programs and incentive offerings, which may give customers future rights such as free or discounted goods or services or trade-in rights.

Income Taxes

We account for income taxes under SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes".  This statement requires that we recognize a current tax liability or asset for current taxes payable or refundable and a deferred tax liability or asset for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences and carryforwards to the extent they are realizable.  We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.  While we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance, in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made.  Likewise, should we determine that we would not be able t
o realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made.

Page 13

We do not provide for U.S. income taxes on earnings of our subsidiaries outside of the U.S.  Our intention is to reinvest these earnings permanently or to repatriate the earnings only when tax-effective to do so.  It is not practical to estimate the amount of additional taxes that might be payable upon repatriation of foreign earnings; however, we believe that U.S. foreign tax credits would largely eliminate any U.S. taxes or offset any foreign withholding taxes.

Warranty Reserves

We provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized.  Although we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes, our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure.  Should actual product failure rates or service delivery costs differ from our estimates, which are based on historical data and engineering estimates, where applicable, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required.

In the second half of 2002, we expect to introduce the LaserCyte system.  We expect that sales of this system will cause warranty expense to increase significantly in 2002.  We will charge warranty expense to the cost of LaserCyte sales based upon our experience with instrument sales and engineering information about the system.  Should actual warranty expense exceed our estimates, our cost of sales of LaserCyte systems would increase.

*     RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

2001 Compared to 2000

COMPANION ANIMAL GROUP

Revenue for CAG increased $12.3 million, or 4% to $308.0 million from $295.7 million in 2000.  The increase was attributable primarily to an increase in sales of veterinary reference laboratory services, canine test kits and ACAREXX, a treatment for ear mites in cats, partially offset by unfavorable exchange rates and a decrease in sales of slides.  Increased sales of veterinary reference laboratory services were attributable primarily to incremental sales resulting from our acquisition of Veterinary Pathology Services Pty. Ltd. ("VPS") in July 2000 and from increased sales from laboratories in existence during both reporting periods.  Decreased sales of slides resulted primarily from a reduction in distributor inventory levels for this product.  Increased sales of canine test kits were attributable primarily to increased sales of our Canine SNAP 3Dx combination test, which we introduced in March 2001.  Sal
es of ACAREXX in 2001 were largely incremental to 2000 because we launched this product in December 2000.

As of December 31, 2001 our U.S. veterinary diagnostic product distributors were holding $22.5 million of inventory, or approximately eight weeks based on projected future sales.  These distributors were carrying $22.1 million, or approximately nine weeks, of inventory as of December 31, 2000.

Gross profit as a percent of CAG's revenue decreased to 45% from 46% in 2000.  Improved margins on veterinary reference laboratory services and the veterinary practice information management software product line were offset by our inability to absorb fixed costs as a result of delays in the launch of our nitazoxanide new animal drug and our LaserCyte hematology instrument and by unfavorable exchange rates.  The increased margins from veterinary reference laboratory services were attributable primarily to cost savings from process automation and reduced courier costs.  The increase in margin from the veterinary practice information management software product line was attributable primarily to infrastructure reductions in our veterinary Internet portal and customer service operations.

Operating expenses relating to CAG increased $1.1 million, or 1% to $101.2 million from $100.1 million in 2000.  The increase was attributable primarily to an increase in veterinary diagnostic sales personnel and related overhead, offset by a decrease in expenses relating to our veterinary practice information management software product line.

FOOD AND ENVIRONMENTAL DIVISION

Revenue for FED increased $6.3 million, or 9% to $78.0 million from $71.7 million in 2000.  The increase was attributable primarily to increased sales of water testing products, including incremental revenue from the acquisition of Genera Technologies Limited ("Genera"), partially offset by decreased sales of dairy testing products, the impact of unfavorable exchange rates and decreased sales of food testing products.  Sales of dairy testing products declined due to the elimination of our LacTek product in the second quarter of 2001, increased competition and product unavailability due to manufacturing issues.  Sales of food testing products declined due to the divestiture of the food microbiology testing business in the first quarter of 2000.

Page 14

Gross profit as a percent of FED's revenue increased to 58% from 57% in 2000.  The increase in gross margin percentage was attributable primarily to increased sales of higher margin water testing products, including those products from Genera, partially offset by decreased margins on dairy testing products due to our inability to absorb fixed costs as a result of lower manufacturing volumes.

Operating expenses relating to FED increased $1.1 million, or 5% to $22.8 million from $21.7 million in 2000.  The increase was attributable primarily to incremental operating expenses and amortization associated with the acquisition of Genera and a  $1.5 million one-time gain on the sale of the food product lines that was recorded as a reduction of operating expenses in 2000, partially offset by the elimination of operating expenses associated with the food product lines.

2000 Compared to 1999

COMPANION ANIMAL GROUP

Revenue for CAG increased $16.3 million, or 6% to $295.7 million from $279.4 million in 1999.  The increase was attributable primarily to an increase in sales of veterinary reference laboratory services, VetTest slides and feline and canine test kits.  The increase in veterinary reference laboratory services was attributable primarily to incremental revenues from laboratories acquired in 1999 and 2000, including the laboratory businesses of Tufts University School of Veterinary Medicine acquired in December 1999 and VPS acquired in July 2000.  The increase in VetTest slides was attributable to an increase in instrument placements, including those through our rental program, and increased customer utilization per instrument.  These increases were partially offset by a decrease in sales of veterinary practice information management software systems, which were unusually high in 1999 as a result of customer upgrades made in anticipation of
 the year 2000.

Gross profit as a percent of CAG's revenue decreased to 46% from 47% in 1999.  The reduction in gross margin percentage was  attributable primarily to increased sales of lower gross margin veterinary reference laboratory services, higher cost of veterinary instrument service and unabsorbed fixed costs associated with decreased sales of veterinary practice information management software systems, partially offset by increased sales of higher margin instrument consumables.

Operating expenses relating to CAG increased $5.7 million to $100.1 million from $94.4 million in 1999.  The increase was attributable primarily to enhancement of existing diagnostic platforms, an increase in sales and marketing expenses associated with the pharmaceutical product line and research and development expenses related to vetconnect.com, our Internet site for animal health professionals.  Additionally, we incurred non-recurring severance and facilities expenses of $2.1 million associated with consolidation of the Internet business and the veterinary practice information management software systems business.

FOOD AND ENVIRONMENTAL DIVISION

Revenue for FED decreased $7.2 million, or 9% to $71.7 million from $78.9 million in 1999.  The decrease was attributable primarily to the divestiture of the food microbiology testing business, and to a lesser extent, decreased sales of dairy testing products.  These decreases were partially offset by an increase in sales of water testing products, including incremental sales resulting from the acquisition of Genera in August 2000, and increased sales of livestock test kits.

Gross profit as a percent of FED's revenue increased to 57% from 51% in 1999.  The increase was primarily due to the divestiture of the lower gross margin food microbiology testing business and increased sales of higher gross margin water testing products.

Page 15

Operating expenses relating to FED decreased $7.6 million to $21.7 million from $29.3 million in 1999.  The decrease was attributable primarily to the elimination of operating expenses associated with the food microbiology testing products business and to a $1.5 million gain on the sale of such business that was recorded as a decrease of expenses.

INTEREST INCOME, NET

Net interest income was $2.2 million for 2001 compared with $5.0 million during 2000.  The decrease in interest income was mainly due to lower invested cash balances, as discussed below, as well as lower effective interest rates.

Net interest income was $5.0 million for 2000 compared with $5.7 million for the prior year.  The decrease in interest income was principally the result of lower invested cash balances due to the use of cash for our share repurchase program and the purchase of VPS and Genera, partially offset by higher effective interest rates.

*     PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES

Our effective tax rate was 36% for 2001 compared with 37% for 2000 and 38% in 1999.  The reduction in the effective tax rate was the result of continued realization of tax benefits resulting from business operations in jurisdictions with lower effective income tax rates.

*     SUBSEQUENT EVENT

In January 2002, David E. Shaw, IDEXX's Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, was succeeded as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer by Jonathan W. Ayers.  Under an October 2001 agreement with Mr. Shaw, we are required to make certain payments and provide certain benefits to him following a succession to a new Chief Executive Officer.  As a result, we will incur in the first quarter of 2002 a pre-tax charge of approximately $3.0 million, $2.0 million of which is non-cash.

*     RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations."  SFAS No. 141 requires all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 to be accounted for using the purchase method.

In July 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets."  We will adopt the requirements of SFAS No. 142 effective January 1, 2002.  SFAS No. 142 requires companies to test all goodwill for impairment and to cease amortization of this asset.  The provisions of SFAS No. 142 apply to all goodwill regardless of when it was acquired.  We are evaluating the impact of adoption of this standard and have not yet determined the full effect of adoption on our financial statements.  Amortization of goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2001 was $5.1 million.  See "Critical Accounting Policies" above.

In October 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets." Adoption of the standard is required no later than the first quarter of 2002.  We are evaluating the timing and impact of adoption of this standard and have not yet determined the effect of adoption on our financial statements.

*     LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

At December 31, 2001, we had $79.6 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments (of which $7.0 million is restricted) and working capital of $164.2 million.  As of December 31, 2001, we had long-term investments of $21.0 million.

In connection with the acquisition of Genera in August 2000, we issued $8.3 million in notes payable to a former shareholder of Genera.  $7.0 million of the notes are due on demand and secured by cash in escrow.  $1.3 million of the notes are due in annual installments over four years and have been discounted to 6%.  The former shareholder has elected to defer the first $0.5 million payment that was due in August 2001, and therefore, the deferred payment now bears interest at 3% and is due on demand.

We have entered into a $20.0 million uncommitted line of credit with a large multi-national bank.  Under the terms of this agreement the bank retains the right to approve all borrowings and all borrowings are due on demand.  Any borrowings under this line will bear interest at the bank's prime rate.  There were no loans outstanding under this agreement at December 31, 2001.

Page 16

We purchased approximately $17.4 million in fixed assets during the year ended December 31, 2001, principally related to the CAG segment.  Our total capital budget for 2002 is approximately $17.0 million.  Under certain supply agreements with suppliers of

veterinary instruments, slides for our VetTest instruments and certain raw materials, at December 31, 2001 we had aggregate commitments to purchase approximately $66.6 million of products in 2002.

Cash provided by operating activities was $46.4 million during 2001.  Cash of $20.3 million was used to fund an increase in inventories, attributable principally to the CAG segment.  These increases relate primarily to contractually required purchases of VetTest slides, inventory associated with the development of our LaserCyte hematology instrument, and inventory associated with our nitazoxanide new animal drug in registration with the FDA.

During 1999 and 2000, the Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to ten million shares of our Common Stock in the open market or in negotiated transactions.  During 2001, we repurchased 590,000 shares of our Common Stock for $13.0 million.  As of December 31, 1999, 2000, and 2001, approximately 3,899,000, 7,024,000 and 7,614,000 cumulative shares, respectively, had been repurchased under this program.  See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements.

We are required to make the following payments in the years below (in thousands):

We believe that current cash, short-term investments, long-term investments, debt facilities and funds generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations for the foreseeable future.

*    FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS

The future operating results of IDEXX involve a number of risks and uncertainties.  Actual events or results may differ materially from those discussed in this report.  Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, the factors discussed below as well as those discussed elsewhere in this report.

IDEXX's Future Growth Will Depend on Several Factors.

The rate of growth of sales of certain of our products has declined over the past several years.  To increase our growth rate, we will need to successfully implement strategies, including:

However, we may not be able to successfully implement some or all of these strategies and increase our growth rate.

The Markets in Which IDEXX Competes Are Competitive and Subject to Rapid and Substantial Technological Change.

We face intense competition within the markets that we sell our products and services.  We expect that future competition will become even more intense, and that we will have to compete with changing and improving technologies.

Page 17

Some of our competitors and potential competitors, including large pharmaceutical companies, have substantially greater capital, manufacturing, marketing and research and development resources than us.

IDEXX's Products and Services Are Subject to Various Domestic and Foreign Government Regulations.

In the U.S., the manufacture and sale of our products are regulated by agencies such as the USDA, FDA and EPA.  Compliance with regulations of such government agencies can be cumbersome and expensive.  For example, commercialization of animal health pharmaceuticals requires submission of substantial clinical, manufacturing and other data to the FDA.  Regulatory approval for products submitted to the FDA may take several years and following approval, the FDA continues to regulate all aspects of the manufacture, labeling, storage, record keeping and promotion of pharmaceutical products.

Foreign regulatory bodies often establish product standards different from those in the United States, and designing products in compliance with such foreign standards may be difficult or expensive.

Delays in obtaining, or the failure to obtain, any necessary regulatory approvals could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.  Further, any failure to comply with regulatory requirements relating to the manufacture and sale of our products could result in fines and sanctions against us and also could have a negative effect on the sale of our products and services.

IDEXX's Future Operating Results May Be Negatively Impacted by Various Factors.

Factors such as the introduction and market acceptance of new products and services, the mix of products and services sold and the mix of domestic versus international revenue could negatively impact our future operating results.

Since we sell many of our products through distributors, changes in distributors' purchasing patterns could result in lower revenue for us because our revenue for each quarter is usually generated from orders received during that quarter.  Our financial performance, therefore, is subject to an unexpected downturn in product demand and may be unpredictable.

Our expense levels are based in part on expectations of future revenue levels.  Therefore, a loss in expected revenue could result in a disproportionate decrease in our net income.

IDEXX's Success Is Heavily Dependent Upon Its Proprietary Technologies.

We rely on a combination of patent, trade secret, trademark and copyright law to protect our proprietary rights.  If we do not have adequate protection of our proprietary rights, our business may be affected by competitors who develop substantially equivalent technologies that compete with us.

We cannot assure that we will obtain issued patents, that any patents issued or licensed to us will remain valid, or that any patents owned or licensed by us will provide protection against competitors with similar technologies.  We also cannot assure that our non-disclosure agreements will provide protection for our trade secrets and other proprietary information.

Moreover, in the past we have received notices claiming that our products infringe third-party patents and we may receive such notices in the future.  Patent litigation is complex and expensive and the outcome of patent litigation can be difficult to predict.  We cannot assure that we will win a patent litigation case.  If we lose, we may be stopped from selling certain products and/or we may be required to pay damages as a result of the lawsuit.

IDEXX Purchases Materials for Its Products From a Limited Number of Sources.

We currently purchase certain products and materials from single sources or a limited number of sources.  Some of the products that we purchase from these sources are proprietary, and therefore may not be available from other sources.  These products include our chemistry and hematology analyzers and related consumables, active ingredients for pharmaceutical products and certain components of our SNAP devices.  If we are unable to obtain adequate quantities of these products in the future, then we could face cost increases or reductions or delays in product shipments, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

Page 18

International Revenue Accounts for a Significant Portion of IDEXX's Total Revenue.

Various risks associated with foreign operations may impact our international sales.  Possible risks include disruptions in transportation of our products, the differing product and service needs of foreign customers, difficulties in building and managing foreign operations, fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies, import/export duties and quotas, and unexpected regulatory, economic or political changes in foreign markets.

ITEM 7A.      QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK

Our financial market risk consists primarily of foreign currency exchange risk.  We operate subsidiaries in 13 foreign countries and transact business in local currencies.  We attempt to hedge our cash flow on intercompany sales to minimize foreign currency exposure.

The primary purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to protect against the volatility associated with foreign currency transactions.  Corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity.  We primarily utilize forward exchange contracts and options with a duration of less than 12 months.  Gains and losses related to qualifying hedges of
foreign currency from commitments or anticipated transactions are deferred in prepaid expenses or accrued liabilities and are included in the basis of the underlying transaction.

Based on our overall currency rate exposure at December 31, 2001, including derivative and other foreign currency sensitive instruments, a 10% strengthening of the U.S. dollar exchange rates will reduce operating income by approximately $0.5 million and a 10% weakening of the U.S. dollar exchange rates will increase operating income by approximately $0.5 million.  The effects of a 10% strengthening of the U.S. dollar exchange rates, if not offset by hedge contracts or related price adjustments, would reduce operating income by approximately $5.7 million and the effects of a 10% weakening of U.S. dollar exchange rates, if not offset by hedge contracts or related price adjustments, would increase operating income by approximately $5.7 million.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000 and 2001, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001.  These consolidated financial statements and the schedule referred to below are the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in the United States.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000 and 2001, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2001, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.

Our audits were made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole.  The schedule listed in the index to consolidated financial statements is presented for purposes of complying with the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and is not part of the basic consolidated financial statements.  The schedule has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audits of the basic consolidated financial statements and, in our opinion, fairly states, in all material respects, the financial data required to be set forth therein in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole.

IDEXX LABORATORIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(1)          OPERATIONS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") develop, manufacture and distribute products and provide services for the veterinary, food and environmental markets.  In the veterinary market, the Company develops, manufactures and distributes biology-based detection systems, develops and distributes veterinary pharmaceuticals and chemistry-based detection systems, provides laboratory testing and specialized consulting services and develops and distributes veterinary practice information management software systems and provides related services.  In the food and environmental market, the Company develops, manufactures and distributes biology-based detection systems.  The Company's products and services are sold worldwide.

The accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the application of certain significant accounting policies, as discussed below and elsewhere in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.  The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.

(a)          Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, all of which are wholly-owned.  All material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.

(b)          Inventories

Inventories include material, labor and overhead, and are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market.  The Company writes down inventory for estimated obsolescence based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions, which may negatively affect the Company's ability to dispose of inventory.  If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required, which would have a negative effect on the Company's results of operations.

The Company's inventories as of December 31, 2001 included $8.6 million of raw materials associated with the nitazoxanide product in registration with the FDA, of which $8.4 million will expire and become unusable in 2004 and the remainder has no expiration date.  The Company has completed manufacturing and efficacy components of its submission to the FDA.  The Company has completed additional safety studies requested by the FDA with respect to this product and is preparing a submission reporting the results of these studies.  The Company believes that the product is approvable by the FDA and that this inventory will be saleable upon such approval.  If this product is not approved by the FDA, the Company believes that it has the ability to recoup a substantial portion of its costs through alternative future uses of the material or other means.  The Company has provided reserves to cover estimated potential losses in this scenario.  Howe
ver, the Company cannot provide assurance that the FDA will approve this product or if such approval is not obtained, that its current estimates of recovery of its investment in this inventory will not change.

The Company's inventories include $30.4 million of slides used in its chemistry instruments, which represent approximately 1.3 turns based on recent historical usage.  These slides have a shelf life of 24 months at the date of manufacture.  The average remaining shelf life at December 31, 2001 was 16.5 months.  In addition, the Company is required to purchase $289.0 million of slides over the remaining nine years of the contract with Ortho.  The Company believes the demand for these slides is at a level sufficient to ensure that it will not incur a loss on the inventory or the contract.  However, a reduction in the demand for slides could cause the Company to incur a loss related to its slide inventory or purchase commitments at a future date.

The Company's inventories include $6.0 million of component parts associated with its LaserCyte hematology instrument, which is in the final stages of development.  In addition, the Company has placed $0.9 million in deposits with vendors to secure additional critical components and has firm purchase commitments of an additional $6.2 million.  The Company expects to launch this product in the second half of 2002 and to fully realize its investment and purchase commitments.  However, if the Company is unable to introduce this product, or if the Company alters the final design, it may be required to write-off a certain amount of the associated inventory.

The components of inventories are as follows (in thousands):

(c)          Depreciation and Amortization

The Company provides for depreciation and amortization using the declining-balance and straight-line methods by charges to operations in amounts that allocate the cost of property and equipment over their estimated useful lives as follows:

(d)          Other Assets

Other assets are as follows (in thousands):

The Company assesses the impairment of identifiable intangibles, long-lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.  Factors the Company considers important that could trigger an impairment review include, but are not limited to, the following:

·

significant under-performance relative to historical or projected future operating results;

·

significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business; and

·

significant negative industry or economic trends.

When management determines that the carrying value of intangibles, long-lived assets and goodwill may not be recoverable based on a change in events and circumstances discussed above, the Company measures any impairment based on the projected undiscounted cash flow method.  Net intangible assets and goodwill amounted to $55.2 million as of December 31, 2001, consisting of $24.3 million related to veterinary reference laboratories, $15.0 million related to water test products, $14.6 million related to pharmaceutical products and $1.3 million of other.

In 2002, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" ("SFAS No. 142"), became effective and as a result, the Company will cease to amortize approximately $50.9 million of goodwill.  The Company had recorded approximately $5.1 million of amortization on these amounts during 2001 and would have recorded approximately $4.3 million of amortization during 2002 if the existing standards had been continued.  In lieu of amortization, management is required to perform an initial impairment review of the Company's goodwill in 2002 and an annual impairment review thereafter.  Management expects to complete its initial review during the first half of 2002.

Page F-8

The Company currently does not expect to record an impairment charge upon completion of the initial impairment review.  However, there can be no assurance that at the time the review is completed a material impairment charge will not be recorded.

Other intangibles include subscriber lists, existing technology, intangible assets, and prepaid license fees.  Amortization of intangible assets was $7.5 million, $7.9 million and $6.5 million for the years ended December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively.  The Company continually assesses the realizability of these assets in accordance with SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets To Be Disposed Of".  As of the respective balance sheet dates, the Company determined that no impairment has occurred.

(e)            Stock-Based Compensation Plans

The Company measures compensation related to stock-based compensation plans under the provisions of SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" ("SFAS No. 123").  Under SFAS No. 123, the Company elected the disclosure only method and will continue to account for stock-based compensation plans under Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees".  See Note 7.

(f)            Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes under SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes".  This statement requires that the Company recognize a current tax liability or asset for current taxes payable or refundable and a deferred tax liability or asset for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences and carryforwards to the extent they are realizable.  See Note 2.

(g)          Revenue Recognition

The Company recognizes product revenue at the time of shipment (including to distributors) for substantially all products, except software licenses and hardware systems.  The Company recognizes revenue from non-cancelable software licenses and hardware systems upon installation and customer acceptance of the software because at this time collection is probable and the Company has no significant further obligations after installation.  The Company's distributors do not have the right to return products.  Service revenue is recognized at the time the service is performed.  Maintenance revenue is billed in advance and recognized over the life of the contracts, usually one year or less.  Certain instrument systems are sold to a third-party finance company that leases these systems to its customers with a right-of-return privilege.  The Company allows the third-party finance company to return these instruments for a partial refund based on t
he time from product return to end of lease term.  Therefore the Company recognizes revenue under these contracts over the term of the underlying customer lease contract.  The Company leases certain instruments directly to customers and recognizes revenues from those leases over the terms of those leases.  The Company records estimated reductions to revenue in connection with customer programs and incentive offerings, which may give customers future rights such as free or discounted goods or services or trade-in rights.

In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") No. 101.  SAB No. 101 provides guidance on selected revenue recognition issues.  The Company adopted the provisions of SAB No. 101 during 2000.  The adoption of SAB No. 101 did not have a material impact on the financial statements of the Company.

(h)          Research and Development and Software Development Costs

In accordance with SFAS No. 86, "Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to be Sold, Leased or Otherwise Marketed", the Company has evaluated the establishment of technological feasibility of its various products during the development phase.  Due to the dynamic changes in the market, the Company has concluded that it cannot determine technological feasibility until the
development phase of the project is nearly complete.  The Company charges all research and development expenses to operations in the period incurred as the costs from the point of technological feasibility to first product release are immaterial.

Page F-9

(i)            Foreign Currency Translation

Assets and liabilities of the Company's foreign subsidiaries are translated using the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date.  Revenue and expense accounts are translated using a weighted average of exchange rates in effect during the period.  Cumulative translation gains and losses are shown in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).  Exchange gains and losses arising from transactions denominated in foreign currencies other than the functional currency of the entity entering into the transaction are included in current operations.  Included in general and administrative expenses are foreign currency translation losses of $0.3 million, $0.6 million and $0.6 million for the years ended December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively.

(j)            Derivative Instruments and Hedging

Effective in the first quarter of 2001, the Company adopted SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("SFAS No. 133").  SFAS No. 133, as amended, requires that all derivatives, including forward currency exchange contracts, be recognized on the balance sheet at fair value.  Derivatives that are not hedges must be recorded at fair value through earnings.  If a derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative are either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged item through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings.  The Company immediately records in earnings the extent to which a hedge is not effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value.  The adoption of SFAS No. 133 in the first quarter of 2001 was not material.

The Company enters into foreign currency exchange contracts of its anticipated intercompany and third-party inventory purchases for the next twelve months in order to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on these transactions.  The Company's accounting policies for these contracts are based on the Company's designation of such instruments as hedging transactions.  The Company also utilizes some natural hedges to mitigate its transaction and commitment exposures.  The contracts the Company enters into are firm foreign currency commitments, and therefore market gains and losses are deferred until the contract matures, which is the period when the related obligation is settled.  The Company enters into these exchange contracts with large multi-national financial institutions.  The company does not hold or engage in transactions involving derivative instruments for purposes other than risk management.  The Company hedges les
s than the full value of forecasted sales and thus no ineffectiveness has resulted or been recorded through the statement of operations.  As of December 31, 2000, there were no material unrecorded gains or losses.  As of December 31, 2001, the Company recorded $0.4 million in losses through accumulated other comprehensive loss from foreign exchange contracts with 2002 expiration dates.  The forward foreign currency contracts, which extend through December 31, 2001 and 2002, respectively, consisted of the following notional amounts (in thousands):

Gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts intended as hedges for intercompany sales of goods are recorded in cost of sales.  Included in cost of goods sold are foreign exchange gains of $0.9 million, $2.7 million and $1.4 million for the years ended December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively.

(k)               Disclosure of Fair Value of Financial Instruments and Concentration of Credit Risk

Financial instruments consist mainly of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, long-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts payables, notes payable and forward currency contracts.  Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk are principally cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, long-term investments and accounts receivable.  The Company places its investments in highly rated financial institutions.  Concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is limited to certain customers to whom the Company makes substantial sales.  To reduce risk, the Company routinely assesses the financial strength of its customers and, as a consequence, believes that its accounts receivable credit risk exposure is limited.  The Company maintains an allowance for potential credit losses but historically has not experienced any significant credit losses related to an 
individual customer or groups of customers in any particular industry or geographic area.  Short-term investments, long-term investments, and forward currency contracts are marked to fair market value through accumulated other comprehensive loss.  The carrying amounts of the Company's other financial instruments approximate fair market value.

Page F-10

(l)          Earnings per Share

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding during the year.  The computation of diluted earnings per share is similar to the computation of basic earnings per share, except that the denominator is increased for the assumed exercise of dilutive options and other potentially dilutive securities using the
treasury stock method unless the effect is antidilutive.  The following is a reconciliation of shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per share (in thousands):

Options to purchase 1,294,000, 934,000 and 306,000 shares for 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively, have been excluded from the calculation of shares outstanding for diluted earnings per share because they were antidilutive.

(m)        Reclassifications

Reclassifications have been made in the consolidated financial statements to conform to the current year's presentation.

(n)          Comprehensive Income

SFAS No. 130, "Reporting Comprehensive Income", requires companies to report all changes in equity during a period, resulting from net income and transactions or other events and circumstances from non-owner sources, in a financial statement for the period in which they are recognized.  The Company has chosen to disclose comprehensive income, which encompasses net income, foreign currency translation adjustments and the difference between the cost and the fair market value of investments in debt securities and foreign exchange contracts, in the Consolidated Statement of Stockholders' Equity.  The Company considers the foreign currency cumulative translation adjustment to be permanently invested and therefore has not provided income taxes on those amounts.

(o)          New Accounting Standards

In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations." ("SFAS No. 141").  SFAS No. 141 requires all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 to be accounted for using the purchase method.

In July 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 142.  The Company will adopt the requirements of SFAS No. 142 effective January 1, 2002.  SFAS No. 142 requires companies to test all goodwill for impairment and to cease amortization of this asset.  The provisions of SFAS No. 142 apply to all goodwill regardless of when it was acquired.  See Note 1(d).

In October 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets." Adoption of the standard is required no later than the first quarter of 2002.  The Company is evaluating the timing and impact of adoption of this standard and has not yet determined the effect of adoption on its financial statements.

(p)          Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Receivable

The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments.  If the financial condition of the Company's customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.

Page F-11

(q)

Warranty Reserves

The Company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized.  Although the Company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes, its warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure.  Should actual product failure rates or service delivery costs differ from management's estimates, which are based on historical data and engineering estimates where applicable, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required.

In the second half of 2002, the Company expects to introduce the LaserCyte system.  The Company expects that sales of this system will cause warranty expense to increase significantly in 2002.  The Company will charge warranty expense to the cost of LaserCyte sales based on its experience with instrument sales and engineering information about the system.  Should actual warranty expense exceed the Company's estimates, the Company's cost of sales of LaserCyte systems would increase.

(2)          INCOME TAXES

Earnings before income taxes for each year were as follows (in thousands):

The provisions for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001 are comprised of the following (in thousands):

The provision for income taxes differs from the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate as follows:

Page F-12

The components of the domestic net deferred tax asset (liability) included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets are as follows (in thousands):

The components of the foreign net deferred tax asset (in thousands):

At December 31, 2001, the Company had domestic net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $0.6 million available to offset future taxable income.  Net operating loss carryforwards expire at various dates through 2014.  The Tax Reform Act of 1986 contains provisions that limit annual availability of the net operating loss carryforwards due to a more than 50% change in ownership that occurred upon the acquisition of certain companies.

At December 31, 2001, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards in foreign subsidiaries of approximately $3.6 million available to offset future taxable income.  These net operating loss carryforwards expire at various dates beginning in 2003.  The Company has recorded a valuation allowance for the assets because realizability is uncertain.

At December 31, 2001, unremitted earnings in subsidiaries outside the United States totaled $30.4 million, on which no United States taxes have been provided.  The Company's intention is to reinvest these earnings permanently or to repatriate the earnings only when tax effective to do so.  It is not practical to estimate the amount of additional taxes that might be payable upon repatriation of foreign earnings; however, the Company believes that United States foreign tax credits would largely eliminate any United States taxes or offset any foreign withholding taxes.

(3)          CASH EQUIVALENTS, SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS

Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of less than three months.

Page F-13

The Company accounts for investments under SFAS No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity

Securities" as available-for-sale.  Short-term investments are investment securities with maturities of greater than three months but less than one year and consist of the following (in thousands):

Long-term investments are investment securities with maturities of greater than one year and less than five years and consist of the following (in thousands):

(4)          NOTES PAYABLE

In September 2001, the Company entered into a $20.0 million uncommitted line of credit with a large multi-national bank.  Under the terms of the agreement, the bank retains the right to approve all borrowings and all borrowings are due on demand.  Borrowings will bear interest at the bank's prime rate.  There were no amounts outstanding under this agreement at December 31, 2001.

In connection with the acquisition of the business of Genera Technologies Limited in August 2000, the Company issued notes payable to the former principal shareholder for $8.3 million of which $7.0 million is secured by cash in escrow.  The secured portion bears interest at the same rate earned by cash in escrow.  The secured portion is considered a current liability as the note holder has the right to call the payable at any time.  The unsecured portion is non-interest bearing and is discounted to yield at 6% and is due in four annual installments beginning in August 2001.  The note holder elected to defer the August 2001 payment, which now bears interest at 3%.  This payment is now payable on demand.

In connection with the Central Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory acquisition, the Company issued an unsecured note payable for Australian Dollars $0.9 million (US $0.6 million).  The note bore interest at 6% and the final installment was paid on December 3, 2001.

In connection with the Blue Ridge Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ("Blue Ridge") acquisition (see Note 13(c)), the Company issued unsecured notes payable for $7.8 million.  The notes bore interest at 6%, and the final installment was paid on September 30, 2000.

(5)          COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

The Company leases its facilities under operating leases which expire through 2012.  In addition, the Company is responsible for the real estate taxes and operating expenses related to these facilities.  The Company also has lease commitments for automobiles and office equipment.  Minimum annual rental payments under these agreements are as follows (in thousands):

Rent expense charged to operations under operating leases was approximately $5.1 million, $5.6 million and $5.6 million for the years ended December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively.

Page F-14

Under the terms of certain supply agreements with suppliers of the Company's veterinary instruments, slides for its VetTest instruments, and certain raw materials, the Company has aggregate commitments to purchase approximately $299.4 million of products through 2010.

From time to time the Company has received notices alleging that the Company's products infringe third-party proprietary rights.  In particular, the Company has received notices claiming that certain of the Company's immunoassay products infringe third-party patents, although the Company is not aware of any pending litigation with respect to such claims.  Patent litigation frequently is complex and expensive, and the outcome of patent litigation can be difficult to predict.  There can be no assurance that the Company will prevail in any infringement proceedings that have been or may be commenced against the Company.

(6)          STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY

(a)          Preferred Stock

The Board of Directors is authorized, subject to any limitations prescribed by law, without further stockholder approval, to issue from time to time up to 500,000 shares of Preferred Stock, $1.00 par value per share ("Preferred Stock"), in one or more series.  Each such series of Preferred Stock shall have such number of shares, designations, preferences, voting powers, qualifications and special or relative rights or privileges as shall be determined by the Board of Directors, which may include, among others, dividend rights, voting rights, redemption and sinking fund provisions, liquidation preferences, conversion rights and preemptive rights.

(b)          Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock

On December 17, 1996, the Company designated 100,000 shares of Preferred Stock as Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock ("Series A Stock") in connection with its Shareholder Rights Plan.  See Note 8.  In general, each share of Series A Stock will: (i) be entitled to a minimum preferential quarterly dividend of $10 per share and to an aggregate dividend of 1,000 times the dividend declared per share of Common Stock, (ii) in the event of liquidation, be entitled to a minimum preferential liquidation payment of $1,000 per share (plus accrued and unpaid dividends) and to an aggregate payment of 1,000 times the payment made per share of Common Stock, (iii) have 1,000 votes, voting together with the Common Stock, (iv) in the event of any merger, consolidation or other transaction in which Common Stock is exchanged, be entitled to receive 1,000 times the amount received per share of Common Stock and (v) not be redeemable.  These rights
 are protected by customary antidilution provisions.  There are no shares of Series A Stock outstanding.

(7)          STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS

At December 31, 2001, the Company had six stock-based compensation plans, which are described below.  The Company measures compensation related to these plans under the provisions of SFAS No. 123.  Under SFAS No. 123 the Company elected the disclosure method and will continue to account for stock-based compensation plans under APB Opinion No. 25.  Accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized for these plans.  Had compensation cost for the Company's six stock-based compensation and employee stock purchase plans been determined consistent with the provisions of SFAS No. 123, the Company's net income and net income per common and common equivalent share would have been reduced to the following pro forma amounts (shares in thousands):

Because the SFAS No. 123 method of accounting has not been applied to options granted prior to January 1, 1995, the resulting pro forma compensation cost may not be representative of that to be expected in future years.

The weighted average fair value per share of options granted in 1999, 2000 and 2001 was $11.21, $11.01 and $11.21, respectively.

Page F-15

The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions used for the grants in 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively: no dividend yield for all years; expected volatility of 54% for 1999, 65% for 2000 and 48% for 2001; risk-free interest rates of 5.3%, 4.9% and 4.4% for 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively; and expected lives of 4.6 years for 1999 and 2000 and 5.2 years for 2001.  At December 31, 2001, the options outstanding have the following characteristics (in thousands, except per share amount):

(a)          The 1991 Stock Option Plan

During 1991, the Board of Directors approved the 1991 Stock Option Plan which, as amended, provides for grants up to 6,475,000 incentive and nonqualified stock options at the discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.  Incentive Stock Options are granted at the fair market value on the date of grant and expire ten years from the date of grant.  Incentive Stock Options for greater than 10% shareholders are granted at 110% of the fair market value and expire five years from the date of grant.  Nonqualified options may be granted at no less than 100% of the fair market value on the date of grant.  The vesting schedule of all options is determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors at the time of grant.

(b)          The 1991 Director Option Plan

During 1991, the Board of Directors approved the 1991 Director Option Plan (as amended, the "1991 Director Plan") pursuant to which Directors who were not officers or employees of the Company were eligible to receive nonstatutory options to purchase
shares of the Company's Common Stock.  The time period for granting options under the 1991 Director Plan expired in accordance with the terms of the plan in June 1996.

(c)          The 1997 Director Option Plan

During 1997, the Board of Directors approved the 1997 Director Option Plan (the "1997 Director Plan") pursuant to which Directors who were not officers or employees of the Company received nonstatutory options to purchase shares of the Company's Common Stock.  On May 19, 1999, this plan was terminated and replaced with the 1999 Director Stock Plan.

(d)          1998 Stock Incentive Plan

During 1998, the Board of Directors approved the 1998 Stock Incentive Plan (the "1998 Stock Plan") which provides for grants of incentive and nonqualified stock options at the discretion of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.  A total of 3,500,000 shares of Common Stock may be issued under the 1998 Stock Plan as amended.  Options granted under the 1998 Stock Plan may not be granted at an exercise price less than the fair market value of the Common Stock on the date granted (or less than 110% of the fair market value in the case of incentive stock options granted to holders of more than 10% of the Company's Common Stock).  Options may not be granted for a term of more than ten years.  The vesting schedule of all options granted under the 1998 Stock Plan is determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors at the time of grant.

(e)          The 1999 Director Stock Plan

During 1999, the Board of Directors approved the 1999 Director Stock Plan pursuant to which Directors who were not officers or employees of the Company received shares of the Company's Common Stock.  A total of 80,000 shares of Common Stock were issuable under the 1999 Director Stock Plan.  In May 2000, the 1999 Director Stock Plan was terminated and replaced with the 2000 Director Option Plan.  As of December 31, 2000, 13,364 shares had been issued under the 1999 Director Stock Plan, and the fair value of these shares of $0.4 million was charged to expense in 1999 and 2000.

Page F-16

(f)          The 2000 Director Option Plan

During 2000, the Board of Directors approved the 2000 Director Option Plan (the "2000 Director Plan") pursuant to which Directors who are not officers or employees of the Company receive nonstatutory options to purchase shares of the Company's Common Stock.  Under the 2000 Director Plan each non-employee Director is granted an option to purchase 6,500 shares of Common Stock at each annual meeting of the Company's shareholders.  Options granted under the 2000 Director Plan have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the Company's Common Stock on the date of grant, vest fully on the first anniversary of the date of grant and expire ten years from the date of grant.  A total of 200,000 shares of Common Stock may be issued under the plan.

A summary of the status of the Company's stock option plans as of December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001 and changes during the years then ended is presented in the table and narrative below (in thousands, except weighted average exercise price):

(g)          Employee Stock Purchase Plans

During 1994, the Board of Directors approved the 1994 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, under which the Company had reserved up to an aggregate of 300,000 shares of Common Stock for issuance in semiannual offerings over a three-year period.  During 1997, the Board of Directors approved the 1997 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, under which the Company has reserved and may issue up to an aggregate of 420,000 shares of Common Stock in semiannual offerings.  Also during 1997, the Board of Directors approved the 1997 International Employee Stock Purchase Plan, under which the Company has reserved and may issue up to an aggregate of 30,000 shares of Common Stock in semiannual offerings.  Stock is sold under each of these plans at 85% of fair market value, as defined.  Shares subscribed to and issued under the plans were 66,900 in 1999, 68,900 in 2000 and 54,550 in 2001.

Under SFAS No. 123, pro forma compensation cost is recognized for the fair value of the employees' purchase rights, which was estimated using the Black-Scholes model with the following assumptions for 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively: no dividend yield for all years; an expected life of one year for all years; expected volatility of 54% for 1999, 65% for 2000 and 48% for 2001; and risk-free interest rates of 5.5%, 4.7% and 2.2% for 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively.

(8)          PREFERRED STOCK PURCHASE RIGHTS

On December 17, 1996, the Company adopted a Shareholder Rights Plan and declared a dividend of one preferred stock purchase right for each outstanding share of Common Stock to stockholders of record at the close of business on December 30, 1996.  Under certain conditions, each right may be exercised to purchase one one-thousandth of a share of Series A Stock at a purchase price of $200.00.  The rights will be exercisable only if a person or group has acquired beneficial ownership of 20% or more of the Common Stock or commenced a tender or exchange offer that would result in such a person or group owning 30% or more of the Common Stock.  The Company generally will be entitled to redeem the rights, in whole, but not in part, at a price of $.01 per right at any time until the tenth business day following a public announcement that a 20% stock position has been acquired and in certain other circumstances.

If any person or group becomes a beneficial owner of 20% or more of the Common Stock (except pursuant to a tender or exchange offer for all shares at a fair price as determined by the outside members of the Company's Board of Directors), each right not owned by a 20% stockholder will enable its holder to purchase such number of shares of Common Stock as is equal to the exercise price of the right divided by one-half of the current market price of the Common Stock on the date of the occurrence of the event.  In addition, if the Company thereafter is acquired in a merger or other business combination with another person or group in which it is not the surviving corporation or in connection with which its Common Stock is changed or converted, or if the Company sells or transfers 50% or more of its assets or earning power to another person, each right that has not previously been exercised will entitle its holder to purchase such number of 
shares of common stock of such other person as is equal to the exercise price of the right divided by one-half of the current market price of such common stock on the date of the occurrence of the event.
