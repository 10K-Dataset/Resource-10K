®

veterinary pharmaceutical products and a product under development. Upon completion of this
transaction we restructured the remaining pharmaceutical division and realigned the remaining
pharmaceutical product lines to other business units. We retained certain drug delivery
technologies that we will seek to commercialize through agreements with third parties such as
pharmaceutical companies. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended
December 31, 2009 included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

We are a Delaware corporation and were incorporated in 1983. Our principal executive offices
are located at One IDEXX Drive, Westbrook, Maine 04092, our telephone number is 207-556-0300, and
our Internet address is www.idexx.com. References herein to “we,” “us,” the “Company,” or “IDEXX”
include our wholly-owned subsidiaries unless the context otherwise requires. References to our Web
site are inactive textual references only and the content of our Web site should not be deemed
incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K for any purpose.



We make available free of charge on our Web site our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly
Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports as soon as

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS BY SEGMENT

During 2009, we operated primarily through three business segments: diagnostic and information
technology products and services for the veterinary market, which we refer to as our Companion
Animal Group (“CAG”), water quality products (“Water”) and products for production animal health,
which we refer to as our Production Animal Segment (“PAS”). We also operate two smaller operating
segments that comprise products for dairy quality (“Dairy”) and products for the human
point-of-care medical diagnostics market (“OPTI Medical”). In connection with the restructuring of
our pharmaceutical division at the end of 2008, we realigned two of our remaining product lines to
the Rapid Assay line of business, which is part of our CAG segment, and realigned the remainder of
the products, which comprised one product line and two out-licensing arrangements, to the “Other”
category. Financial information about the Dairy and OPTI Medical operating segments and other
licensing arrangements are combined and presented in an “Other” category because they do not meet
the quantitative or qualitative thresholds for reportable segments. Segment information presented
for the year ended December 31, 2007 has been restated to conform to our presentation of reportable
segments for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial
statements for the year ended December 31, 2009 included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for
financial information about our segments, including geographic information, and about our product
and service categories.

COMPANION ANIMAL GROUP

Instruments and Consumables

We currently market an integrated suite of in-clinic laboratory analyzers for use in providing
laboratory diagnostic information in companion animal veterinary practices that we refer to as the
IDEXX VetLab

®

suite of analyzers. The IDEXX VetLab

®

suite includes several
instrument systems, as well as associated proprietary consumable products, all of which are
described below:

Blood and Urine Chemistry

.

We sell two chemistry analyzers, the Catalyst Dx

®

Chemistry Analyzer and the
VetTest

®

Chemistry Analyzer, that are used by veterinarians to measure levels of certain
enzymes and other substances in blood or urine for assistance in diagnosing physiologic conditions.
Both instruments use consumables manufactured for IDEXX by Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, Inc.
(“Ortho”), a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, based on Ortho’s dry slide technology (“dry chemistry
slides,” “Catalyst Dx

®

slides,” “VetTest

®

slides” or “slides”). In addition
to dry chemistry slides, the Catalyst Dx

®

analyzer also uses electrolyte consumables
manufactured by IDEXX at OPTI Medical. Blood tests commonly run on these analyzers include glucose,
alkaline phosphatase, ALT (alanine aminotransferase), creatinine, BUN (blood urea nitrogen), and
total protein. Tests are sold individually and in prepackaged panels. Both analyzers also run a
urine test called urine protein:creatinine ratio, which assists in the detection of early renal
disease.

The Catalyst Dx

®

analyzer is our latest generation chemistry analyzer, which was
launched in the first quarter of 2008. The Catalyst Dx

®

analyzer provides significantly
improved throughput, ease of use and menu relative to the VetTest

®

analyzer, including
the ability to run electrolytes. Key ease-of-use features include the ability to run whole blood by
way of an on-board centrifuge, the ability to run pre-packaged clips in addition to single
chemistry slides, and an automated metering system. The Catalyst Dx

®

analyzer also has
the ability to run automated dilutions, which is an ease-of-use feature both for certain blood
chemistries and the test for urine protein:creatinine ratio. The Catalyst Dx

®

analyzer
allows a veterinarian to run multiple patient samples simultaneously; to run different sample types
including whole blood, plasma, serum and urine; to perform 27
different chemistry and electrolyte parameter tests; and to automatically calculate other
parameters and ratios important to blood chemistry analysis.



Our VetLyte

®

Electrolyte Analyzer measures three electrolytes—sodium, potassium and
chloride—to aid in evaluating acid-base and electrolyte balances and assessing plasma hydration.

Our VetStat

®

Electrolyte and Blood Gas Analyzer measures electrolytes, blood gases,
glucose and ionized calcium, and calculates other parameters, such as base excess and anion gap.
These measurements aid veterinarians in diagnosing various disease states, evaluating fluid therapy
choices and measuring respiratory function. The VetStat

®

analyzer runs single-use
disposable cassettes that contain various configurations of analytes. The VetStat

®

analyzer and its cassettes are manufactured by OPTI Medical.

Sales of consumables for use in our installed base of chemistry analyzers provide the majority
of consumables volumes and revenues generated from our installed base of IDEXX VetLab

®

equipment.

Hematology

. We sell three hematology analyzers: the LaserCyte

®

Hematology
Analyzer, which uses laser-flow cytometry technology to analyze cellular components of blood,
including red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets (also called a complete blood count
(“CBC”)); the Coag Dx

™

Analyzer, which permits the detection and diagnosis of blood
clotting disorders; and the IDEXX VetAutoread

™

Hematology Analyzer, which also provides
a CBC.

Quantitative Immunoassay Testing

. In the first quarter of 2008, we launched the
SNAPshot Dx

®

Analyzer, which automates SNAP

®

testing for veterinarians by
significantly improving ease of use, throughput and test menu, relative to the previous generation
IDEXX SNAP

®

Reader. The SNAPshot Dx

®

analyzer obtains quantitative
measurements of total thyroxine (“T


”), cortisol and bile acids, which assists in the
evaluation of thyroid, adrenal and liver function, and offers multiple-patient testing
functionality. The SNAPshot Dx

®

analyzer also reads, interprets and records the results
of certain IDEXX rapid assay SNAP

®

tests, including our SNAP

®

4Dx

®

Test,

feline SNAP

®

FIV/FeLV Combo Test and canine SNAP

®

cPL

™

Test.

Urinalysis

. The IDEXX VetLab

®

UA

™

Analyzer provides rapid,
semi-quantitative urinalysis and is validated specifically for veterinary use.

IDEXX
VetLab

®

Station

. The IDEXX VetLab

®

Station (“IVLS”)
connects and integrates the diagnostic information from all the IDEXX VetLab

®

equipment
and thus provides laboratory information management system capability. We sell the IVLS as an
integral component of the Catalyst Dx

®

and LaserCyte

®

systems and also as a
standalone hardware platform. The IVLS includes a user interface to input patient information,
connect with a practice management information system and send information to run the individual
analyzers. IVLS also generates one integrated patient report for the lab work generated by the
IDEXX VetLab

®

suite; stores, retrieves and analyzes historical patient diagnostics data,
including SNAP

®

test results; and sends and receives information from practice
information management systems, including IDEXX Cornerstone

®

and Better
Choice

®

systems, as well as a wide variety of third-party systems.

Rapid Assays

We provide a broad range of single-use, handheld test kits under the SNAP

®

name
that allow quick, accurate and convenient diagnostic test results for a variety of companion animal
diseases and health conditions. These kits work without the use of instrumentation, although
certain kits may also be read automatically by the SNAPshot Dx

®

analyzer.

Principal single-use canine tests include

:

•

SNAP

®

3Dx

®

, which tests for Lyme disease,

Ehrlichia canis

and heartworm;

•

SNAP

®

4Dx

®

, which adds a test for

Anaplasma
phagocytophilum

to what is tested by SNAP

®

3Dx

®

;

•

SNAP

®

Heartworm RT, which tests only for canine heartworm;

•

SNAP

®

Parvo, which tests for parvovirus;



•

SNAP

®

cPL

™

, which tests for canine pancreatitis; and

•

SNAP

®

Giardia

, which is a fecal test for soluble

Giardia

antigens

Principal single-use feline tests include

:

•

SNAP

®

FIV/FeLV Combo Test, which tests for feline immunodeficiency
virus (“FIV”) (which is similar to the human AIDS virus) and feline leukemia virus
(“FeLV”);

•

SNAP

®

Feline Triple

®

, which tests for FIV, FeLV and feline
heartworm;

•

SNAP

®

FeLV, which tests only for FeLV; and

•

SNAP

®

Giardia

, which is a fecal test for soluble

Giardia

antigens

Sales of canine parasite tests (including SNAP

®

3Dx

®

, SNAP

®

4Dx

®

, and SNAP

®

Heartworm RT), are greater in the first half of our
fiscal year due to seasonality of disease testing in the veterinary practice.

In addition to our single-use tests, we sell a line of microwell-based test kits for canine
heartworm, FIV and FeLV. These kits, sold under the PetChek

®

name, are used by larger
clinics and laboratories to test multiple samples and provide ease-of-use and cost advantages to
high-volume customers.

Veterinary Laboratory Diagnostic and Consulting Services

We offer commercial veterinary laboratory diagnostic and consulting services to veterinarians
in the U.S., Canada, Europe, Australia, Japan, and South Africa. Veterinarians use our services by
submitting samples by courier or overnight delivery to one of our facilities. Most test results
have same-day or next-day turnaround times. Our laboratories offer a large selection of tests and
diagnostic panels to detect a number of disease states and other conditions in companion and
production animals, including virtually all tests that can be run in-clinic at the veterinary
practice with our instruments or rapid assays. This menu of tests also includes a number of
specialized and proprietary tests that we have developed that allow practitioners to diagnose
increasingly relevant diseases in dogs and cats, including heart disease, pancreatitis and certain
infectious diseases.

Additionally, we provide specialized veterinary consultation, telemedicine and advisory
services, including radiology, cardiology, internal medicine and ultrasound consulting. These
services enable veterinarians to obtain readings and interpretations of test results transmitted by
telephone and over the Internet.

Practice Information Systems and Digital Radiography

Practice Information Systems and Services

. We develop, market and sell practice
information systems, including hardware and software, that run key functions of veterinary clinics,
including managing patient electronic health records, scheduling (including boarding and grooming),
billing and inventory management. Our principal system is the Cornerstone

®

system. We
also support several legacy systems installed with our customers, including IDEXX Better
Choice

®

, IDEXX VPM

™

and IDEXX VetLINK

®

. Additionally, we provide
software and hardware support to our practice information system customers, and related supplies
and services to veterinary practice information system users in general, and we derive a
significant portion of our revenues for this product line from ongoing service contracts.

Digital Radiography Systems and Services

. Our digital radiography systems capture
radiograph images in digital form, replacing traditional x-ray film. Use of digital radiography
systems eliminates the need for the film and processor, hazardous chemicals, and darkroom required
for the production of film images, and provides for image manipulation and enhancement through
contrast management. We market and sell three digital radiography systems: the IDEXX-DR

™

1417 and
the IDEXX-CR

™

1417 systems for use in the small animal (e.g., dog and cat) veterinary
hospital, and the IDEXX EquiView

®

DR system for use as a portable unit in ambulatory
veterinary practices, such as equine practices. Our digital radiography systems use
IDEXX-PACS

™

and IDEXX EquiView PACS

™

picture archiving and communication
system (“PACS”) software for the viewing, manipulation, management, storage and retrieval of the
digital images generated by the digital capture plate. The PACS software also permits images from
our digital radiography systems to be integrated into patients’ medical records in the
Cornerstone

®

system, as well as transferred to other practice information management
systems.



WATER

We offer a range of products used in the detection of various microbiological analytes in
water.

Our Colilert

®

, Colilert

®

-18 and Colisure

®

tests
simultaneously detect total coliforms and

E. coli

in water. These organisms are broadly used as
indicators of microbial contamination in water. These products utilize indicator-nutrients that
produce a change in color or fluorescence when metabolized by target microbes in the sample. Our
water tests are used by government laboratories, water utilities and private certified laboratories
to test drinking water in compliance with regulatory standards, including U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (“EPA”) standards. The tests also are used in evaluating water used in production
processes (for example, in beverage and pharmaceutical applications) and in evaluating bottled
water, recreational water, waste water and water from private wells.

Our Enterolert

®

product detects enterococci in drinking and recreational waters.
Our Quanti-Tray

®

products, when used in conjunction with our Colilert

®

,
Colilert

®

-18, Colisure

®

or Enterolert

®

products, provide users
quantitative measurements of microbial contamination, rather than a presence/absence indication.
The Colilert

®

, Colilert

®

-18, Colisure

®

, Quanti-Tray

®

and Enterolert

®

products have been approved by the EPA and by regulatory agencies in
certain other countries.

Our Filta-Max

®

and Filta-Max

xpress

®

products are used in the
detection of

Cryptosporidium

in water.

Cryptosporidium

is a parasite that can cause potentially
fatal gastrointestinal illness if ingested.

We also distribute certain water testing kits manufactured by Life Technologies Corporation
that complement our

Cryptosporidium

and

Giardia

testing products.

PRODUCTION ANIMAL SEGMENT

We sell diagnostic tests and related instrumentation that are used to detect a wide range of
diseases and to monitor health status in production animals. Our production animal products are
purchased primarily by government laboratories and by cattle, swine and poultry producers. Our
largest product is a post-mortem test for bovine spongiform encephalopathy (“BSE” or “mad cow
disease”). Effective January 1, 2009, the age at which healthy cattle to be slaughtered are
required to be tested for BSE in the European Union was increased from 30 months to 48 months,
which has been estimated to reduce the population of cattle tested by approximately 30%. We may
lose sales of post-mortem tests for BSE in the future as a result of this regulatory change.

OTHER

Dairy

Our principal product for use in testing for antibiotic residue in milk is the
SNAP

®

Beta-Lactam test. Our primary customers are dairy producers and processors
worldwide who use our tests for quality assurance of raw milk. We also sell a SNAP

®

test
for the detection of the chemical melamine in milk.

OPTI Medical Systems

We sell OPTI

®

point-of-care analyzers and related consumables for use in human
medical hospitals and clinics to measure electrolytes, blood gases, acid-base balance, glucose and
ionized calcium, and to calculate other parameters such as base excess and anion gap. These
analyzers are used primarily in emergency rooms, operating rooms, cardiac monitoring areas and any
locations where time-critical diagnostic testing is performed within the hospital setting. The
OPTI

®

CCA and OPTI

®

Touch Electrolyte and Blood Gas Analyzers run single-use
disposable cassettes that contain various configurations of analytes; the OPTI

®

R
Analyzer runs reusable cassettes in various analyte configurations; and the OPTI

®

LION
Stat Electrolyte Analyzer runs single-use electrolyte cassettes. OPTI Medical Systems also supplies
our VetStat

®

analyzer and additionally, provides the electrolyte module and dry slide
reagents that make up the electrolyte testing functionality of the Catalyst Dx

®

analyzer.



Other Activities

In connection with the restructuring of our pharmaceutical product line at the end of 2008, we
realigned two of our remaining product lines to the Rapid Assay line of business, which is part of
our CAG segment, and realigned the remainder of the products, which comprises one product line and
two out-licensing arrangements, from the pharmaceutical division to the Other category. The
financial impacts of the product line and out-licensing arrangements have been shown in the Other
category for 2009 and 2008. The segment information for the year ended December 31, 2007 has been
restated to conform to our presentation of reportable segments for the year ended December 31, 2009
and 2008.

When a research and development program materializes into a product or service offering that
does not align with one of our existing product or service categories, the related financial
impacts are shown in the Other category.

UNALLOCATED AMOUNTS

Items that are not allocated to our operating segments are comprised primarily of corporate
research and development expenses that do not align with one of our existing product or service
categories, a portion of share-based compensation expense, interest income and expense, and income
taxes. We estimate our share-based compensation expense for the year and allocate the estimated
expense to the operating segments. This allocation differs from the actual expense and consequently
yields a difference between the total allocated share-based compensation expense and the actual
expense for the total company resulting in an unallocated amount reported under the caption
“Unallocated Amounts.”

We maintain active research and development programs, some of which may materialize into the
development and introduction of new technology, products or services. Research and development
costs incurred that are not specifically allocated to one of our existing product or service
categories are reported under the caption “Unallocated Amounts.”

MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION

We market, sell and service our products worldwide through our marketing, sales and technical
service groups, as well as through independent distributors and other resellers. We maintain sales
offices outside the U.S. in Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the
Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland, Taiwan and the United Kingdom. Sales and marketing expense was
$167.7 million, $170.0 million and $151.9 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, or 16.3% of
sales in 2009, 16.6% of sales in 2008, and 16.5% of sales in 2007.

Generally, we select the appropriate distribution channel for our products based on the type
of product, technical service requirements, number and concentration of customers, regulatory
requirements and other factors. We market our companion animal diagnostic products to veterinarians
both directly and through independent veterinary distributors in the U.S., with most instruments
sold directly by IDEXX sales personnel, and rapid assay test kits and instrument consumables
supplied primarily by the distribution channel. Outside the U.S., we sell our companion animal
diagnostic products through our direct sales force and, in certain countries, through distributors
and other resellers. We sell our veterinary laboratory diagnostic and consulting services worldwide
through our direct sales force. We market our software and digital radiography products through our
direct sales force and through distributors primarily in the U.S. We market our water, production
animal and dairy products primarily through our direct sales force in the U.S. and Canada. Outside
the U.S. and Canada, we market these products through selected independent distributors and, in
certain countries, through our direct sales force. We sell our OPTI

®

electrolyte and
blood gas analyzers both directly and through independent human medical product distributors in the
U.S. and we sell most of the related consumables through the distribution channel. Outside the
U.S., we sell our OPTI

®

products primarily through distributors and other resellers.

Our largest customers are our U.S. distributors of our products in the CAG segment. One of our
CAG distributors, Butler Animal Health Supply, LLC (“Butler”), accounted for 7% of our 2009 revenue
and 8% of our 2008 and 2007 revenue. Butler accounted for 4% of our net accounts receivable at
December 31, 2009 and 5% of our net accounts receivable at December 31, 2008 and 2007. In December
2009, Butler combined with the U.S. animal health business of Henry Schein, Inc. (“Schein”) to form
Butler Schein Animal Health. Schein accounted for
3% of our 2009, 2008 and 2007 revenue and 2% of our net accounts receivable at December 31,
2009, 2008 and 2007.



RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

Our business includes the development and introduction of new products and services and may
involve entry into new business areas. We maintain active research and development programs in each
of our business areas. Our research and development expenses, which consist of salaries, employee
benefits, materials and consulting costs, were $65.1 million, $70.7 million and $67.3 million in
2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, or 6.3% of sales in 2009, 6.9% of sales in 2008, and 7.3% of
sales in 2007.

commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our failure to obtain any such licenses may delay or
prevent the sale of certain new or existing products. See “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.”

PRODUCTION AND SUPPLY

Many of the instruments that we sell are manufactured by third parties and we rely on third
parties to supply us with certain important components, raw materials and consumables used in or
with our products. In some cases these third parties are sole or single source suppliers.

Significant products supplied by third parties include VetTest

®

analyzers and
consumables, Catalyst Dx

®

consumables (other than electrolyte consumables), and
VetAutoread

™

, VetLyte

®

and Coag Dx

™

analyzers and consumables.

VetTest

®

slides and Catalyst Dx

®

chemistry slides are supplied by Ortho
under supply agreements that expire in 2025. We are required to purchase all of our requirements
for our current menu of VetTest

®

slides and Catalyst Dx

®

chemistry slides
from Ortho to the extent Ortho is able to supply those requirements.

Other analyzers and consumables are purchased under supply agreements with terms ranging from
1 year to 14 years, which in some cases may be extended at our option. We have minimum purchase
obligations under some of these agreements, and our failure to satisfy these obligations may result
in loss of some or all of our rights under these agreements or require us to compensate the
supplier. See “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.”



We purchase certain other products, raw materials and components from a single supplier. These
products include certain digital radiography systems and certain components used in our
SNAP

®

rapid assay and dairy devices, production animal testing kits, water testing
products, and blood analyzers, including our LaserCyte

®

analyzers.

We have in the past been successful in ensuring an uninterrupted supply of products purchased
from single source suppliers. However, there can be no assurance that uninterrupted supply can be
maintained if these agreements terminate for any reason or our suppliers otherwise are unable to
satisfy our requirements for products. See “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.”

We do not generally maintain significant backlog and believe that our backlog at any
particular date historically has not been indicative of future sales.

COMPETITION

We face intense competition within the markets in which we sell our products and services.
This competition is intensifying, as some of our competitors have expanded the range of products
and services offered to the companion animal veterinary market and expanded the geographic scope of
their operations. In addition, we expect that we will have to compete with changing technologies,
which could affect the marketability of our products and services. Our competitive position also
will depend on our ability to develop proprietary or highly differentiated products, integrate our
products, develop and maintain effective sales channels, attract and retain qualified scientific
and other personnel, develop and implement production and marketing plans, obtain or license patent
rights, and obtain adequate capital resources.

We compete with many companies ranging from large human medical diagnostics companies to small
businesses focused on animal health. Several large human diagnostic companies are indirect
competitors in that they have partnered with veterinary-focused companies to provide their products
and technologies to our markets. Our companion animal veterinary diagnostic products and services
compete with both laboratory service and in-clinic product providers. Our competitors vary in our
different markets. In some markets, academic institutions, governmental agencies and other public
and private research organizations conduct research activities and may commercialize products,
which could compete with our products, on their own or through joint ventures. Several of our
direct and indirect competitors have substantially greater capital, manufacturing, marketing, and
research and development resources than we do.

Competitive factors in our different business areas are detailed below:

•

Veterinary diagnostic, water, production animal and dairy testing products

.
We compete primarily on the basis of the ease of use, speed, accuracy, quality of the
information provided, and other performance characteristics of our products and
services (including unique tests), the breadth of our product line and services, the
effectiveness of our sales and distribution channels, the quality of our technical and
customer service, and our pricing relative to the value of our products in comparison
with competitive products and services.

•

Veterinary laboratory diagnostic and consulting services

. We compete
primarily on the basis of quality, consistency of service levels, technology, and our
pricing relative to the value of our services in comparison with competitive products
and services. We compete in most geographic locations in North America with Antech
Diagnostics, a unit of VCA Antech, Inc.

•

Practice information management and digital radiography systems

. We compete
primarily on the basis of functionality, connectivity to equipment and other systems,
performance characteristics, effectiveness of our customer service, information
handling capabilities, advances in technologies, and our pricing relative to the value
of our products and services.

•

Electrolyte and blood gas analyzers for the human point-of-care medical
diagnostics market

. We compete primarily with large human medical diagnostics
companies such as Radiometer A/S, Siemens Medical Solutions Diagnostics,
Instrumentation Laboratory, Abbott Diagnostics, and Roche Diagnostics. We compete
primarily on the basis of the ease of use, menu, convenience, international
distribution and service, instrument reliability, and our pricing relative to the value
of our products.



GOVERNMENT REGULATION

Many of our products are subject to comprehensive regulation by U.S. and foreign regulatory
agencies that relate to, among other things, product approvals, manufacturing, marketing and
promotion, recordkeeping, testing, quality, storage, and product disposal. The following is a
description of the principal regulations affecting our businesses.

Veterinary diagnostic products

. Diagnostic tests for animal health infectious
diseases, including most of our production animal products and our rapid assay products, are
regulated in the U.S. by the Center for Veterinary Biologics within the United States Department of
Agriculture (“USDA”) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (“APHIS”). These products must be
approved by APHIS before they may be sold in the U.S. The APHIS regulatory approval process
involves the submission of product performance data and manufacturing documentation. Following
regulatory approval to market a product, APHIS requires that each lot of product be submitted for
review before release to customers. In addition, APHIS requires special approval to market products
where test results are used in part for government-mandated disease management programs. A number
of foreign governments accept APHIS approval as part of their separate regulatory approvals.
However, compliance with an extensive regulatory process is required in connection with marketing
diagnostic products in Japan, Germany, the Netherlands and many other countries. We also are
required to have a facility license from APHIS to manufacture USDA-licensed products. We have
obtained such a license for our manufacturing facility in Westbrook, Maine and our distribution
center in Memphis, Tennessee.

Our veterinary diagnostic instrument systems are medical devices regulated by the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration (“FDA”) under the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act (the “FDC Act”). While the
sale of these products does not require premarket approval by the FDA and does not subject us to
the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices regulations (“cGMP”), these products must not be
adulterated or misbranded under the FDC Act.

These instrument systems also are subject to the European Medical Device Directives, which
create a single set of medical device regulations for all European Union (“EU”) member countries
and require companies that wish to manufacture and distribute medical devices in EU member
countries to obtain European Conformity (“CE”) marking for their products.

Water testing products

. Our water tests are not subject to formal premarket regulatory
approval. However, before a test can be used as part of a water quality monitoring program in the
U.S. that is required by the EPA, the test must first be approved by the EPA. The EPA approval
process involves submission of extensive product performance data in accordance with an
EPA-approved protocol, evaluation of the data by the EPA and publication for public comment of any
proposed approval in the Federal Register before final approval. Our Colilert

®

,
Colilert

®

-18, Colisure

®

, Quanti-Tray

®

, Filta-Max

®

,
Enterolert

®

, and SimPlate

®

for heterotropic plate counts products have been
approved by the EPA. The sale of water testing products also is subject to extensive and lengthy
regulatory processes in many other countries around the world.

Dairy testing products

. Dairy products used in National Conference on Interstate Milk
Shipments (“NCIMS”) milk-monitoring programs are regulated by the FDA. Before products requiring
FDA approval can be sold in the U.S., extensive product performance data must be submitted in
accordance with an FDA approved protocol administered by AOAC Research Institute (“AOAC RI”).
Following approval of a product by the FDA, the product must also be approved by NCIMS, an
oversight body that includes state, federal and industry representatives. Our SNAP

®

Beta-Lactam dairy antibiotic residue testing product has been approved by the FDA, NCIMS and AOAC
RI. While some foreign countries accept AOAC RI approval as part of their regulatory approval
process, many countries have separate regulatory processes.

Human point-of-care electrolyte and blood gas analyzers

. Our OPTI

®

instrument systems are classified as Class II medical devices, and their design, manufacture and
marketing are regulated by the FDA. Accordingly, we must comply with cGMP in the manufacture of our
OPTI

®

products. The FDA’s Quality System regulations further set forth standards for
product design and manufacturing processes, require the maintenance of certain records, and provide
for inspections of our facilities by the FDA. New OPTI

®

products fall into FDA
classifications that require notification of and review by the FDA before marketing, submitted as a
510(k) application.



OPTI

®

products are also subject to the European Medical Device Directives and
regulations governing the manufacture and marketing of medical devices in other countries in which
they are sold.

Any acquisitions of new products and technologies may subject us to additional areas of
government regulation. These may involve food, medical device and water-quality regulations of the
FDA, the EPA and the USDA, as well as state, local and foreign governments. See “Part I, Item 1A.
Risk Factors.”

EMPLOYEES

At December 31, 2009, we had approximately 4,800 full-time and part-time employees.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Our future operating results involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual events or
results may differ materially from those discussed in this report. Factors that could cause or
contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, the factors discussed below, as
well as those discussed elsewhere in this report.

Our Failure to Successfully Execute Certain Strategies Could Have a Negative Impact on Our
Growth and Profitability

The companion animal health care industry is highly competitive and we anticipate increased
competition from both existing competitors and new market entrants. Our ability to maintain or
enhance our historical growth rates and our profitability depends on our successful execution of
many elements of our strategy, which include:

•

Developing, manufacturing and marketing innovative new in-clinic laboratory
analyzers that drive sales of IDEXX VetLab

®

instruments, grow our installed
base of instruments, and create a recurring revenue stream from consumable products;

•

Developing and introducing new proprietary diagnostic tests and services that
provide valuable medical information to our customers and effectively differentiate our
products and services from those of our competitors;

•

Achieving the benefits of economies of scale in our worldwide network of
laboratories;

•

Increasing the value to our customers of our companion animal products and services
by enhancing the integration of these products and managing the diagnostic information
derived from our products;

•

Growing our market share by strengthening our sales and marketing activities both
within the U.S. and in geographies outside of the U.S.; and

•

Developing and implementing new technology and licensing strategies; and
identifying, completing and integrating acquisitions that enhance our existing
businesses or create new business or geographic areas for us.

If we are unsuccessful in implementing some or all of these strategies, our rate of growth or
profitability may be negatively impacted.

Our Dependence on a Limited Number of Suppliers Could Limit Our Ability to Sell Certain
Products or Reduce Our Profitability

We currently purchase many products and materials from sole or single sources. Some of the
products that we purchase from these sources are proprietary, and, therefore, cannot be readily or
easily replaced by alternative sources. These products include our VetAutoread

™

hematology, VetLyte

®

electrolyte, IDEXX VetLab

®

UA

™

urinalysis,
VetTest

®

chemistry, and Coag Dx

™

blood coagulation analyzers and related
consumables and accessories; image capture plates used in our digital radiography systems; and
certain components and raw materials used in our SNAP

®

rapid assay devices, water
testing products, dairy testing products and LaserCyte

®

hematology analyzers. To
mitigate risks associated with sole and single source suppliers we generally enter into long-term
contracts that ensure an uninterrupted supply of products at predictable prices. However, there can
be no assurance that suppliers will not experience disruptions in their ability to supply products
under our contracts, or that suppliers will always fulfill their obligations



under these contracts. In addition, under some of these
agreements we have minimum purchase obligations and our failure to satisfy those obligations may
result in loss of some or all of our rights under these agreements or require us to compensate the
supplier. Also, in some cases we purchase sole and single source products or components under
short-term contracts or purchase orders. In these cases we are more susceptible to unanticipated
cost increases or changes in other terms of supply and to the risk that a supplier will not fulfill
our requirements for products. If we are unable to obtain adequate quantities of these products in
the future, we may be unable to supply the market, which would have a material adverse effect on
our results of operations.

Our Biologic Products Are Complex and Difficult to Manufacture, Which Could Negatively
Affect Our Ability to Supply the Market

Many of our rapid assay and production animal diagnostic products are biologics, which are
products that are comprised of materials from living organisms, such as antibodies, cells and sera.
Manufacturing biologic products is highly complex. Unlike products that rely on chemicals for
efficacy (such as most pharmaceuticals), biologics are difficult to characterize due to the
inherent variability of biological input materials. Difficulty in characterizing biological
materials or their interactions creates greater risk in the manufacturing process. There can be no
assurance that we will be able to maintain adequate sources of biological materials or that
biological materials that we maintain in inventory will yield finished products that satisfy
applicable product release criteria. Our inability to produce or obtain necessary biological
materials or to successfully manufacture biologic products that incorporate such materials could
result in our inability to supply the market with these products, which could have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations.

A Weak Economy Could Result in Reduced Demand for Our Products and Services

A substantial percentage of our sales are made worldwide to the companion animal veterinary
market. Demand for our companion animal diagnostic products and services is driven in part by the
number of pet visits to veterinary hospitals and the practices of veterinarians with respect to
diagnostic testing. Economic weakness in our significant markets has caused and could continue to
cause pet owners to skip or defer visits to veterinary hospitals or could affect their willingness
to treat certain pet health conditions, approve certain diagnostic tests, or continue to own a pet.
In addition, concerns about the financial resources of pet owners could cause veterinarians to be
less likely to recommend certain diagnostic tests and concerns about the economy may cause
veterinarians to defer purchasing capital items such as our instruments. A decline in pet visits to
the hospital, in the willingness of pet owners to treat certain health conditions or approve
certain tests, in pet ownership, or in the inclination of veterinarians to recommend certain tests
or make capital purchases could result in a decrease in sales of diagnostic products and services.

Disruption in Financial and Currency Markets Could Have a Negative Effect on Our Business

Over the past 18 months, financial markets in the U.S., Europe, Australia and Asia have
experienced extreme disruption, including, among other things, volatility in exchange rates and
security prices, diminished liquidity and credit availability, rating downgrades of certain
investments and declining valuations of others. These economic developments affect businesses such
as ours in a number of ways. The current tightening of credit in financial markets may adversely
affect the ability of customers to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations and
could result in a decrease in orders for our products and services. The inability of pet owners to
obtain consumer credit could lead to a decline in pet visits to the veterinarian, which could
result in a decrease in diagnostic testing. Likewise, a decrease in diagnostic testing could
negatively impact the financial condition of the veterinary practices that are our customers, which
may inhibit their ability to pay us amounts owed for products delivered or services provided. In
addition, although current economic conditions have not impacted our ability to access credit
markets and finance our operations, further deterioration in financial markets could adversely
affect our access to capital. We are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of the
current disruption in financial markets and adverse economic conditions in the U.S. and other
countries.

Strengthening of the Rate of Exchange for the U.S. Dollar Has a Negative Effect on Our
Business

Strengthening of the rate of exchange for the U.S. dollar against the Euro, the British Pound,
the Canadian Dollar, the Japanese Yen and the Australian Dollar adversely affects our results, as
it reduces the dollar value of sales that are made in those currencies and reduces the margins on
products manufactured in the U.S. and exported
to international markets. For the year ended December 31, 2009, approximately 24% of IDEXX
sales were derived from products manufactured in the U.S. and sold internationally in local
currencies.



Various Government Regulations Could Limit or Delay Our Ability to Market and Sell Our
Products

In the U.S., the manufacture and sale of our products are regulated by agencies such as the
USDA, the FDA and the EPA. Most diagnostic tests for animal health applications, including our
canine, feline, poultry and livestock tests, must be approved by the USDA prior to sale in the U.S.
Our water testing products must be approved by the EPA before they can be used by customers in the
U.S. as a part of a water quality monitoring program required by the EPA. Our dairy testing
products require approval by the FDA. The manufacture and sale of our OPTI

®

line of
human point-of-care electrolytes and blood gas analyzers are regulated by the FDA and these
products require approval by the FDA before they may be sold commercially in the U.S. The
manufacture and sale of our products are subject to similar laws in many foreign countries. Any
failure to comply with legal and regulatory requirements relating to the manufacture and sale of
our products in the U.S. or in other countries could result in fines and sanctions against us or
suspensions or discontinuations of our ability to manufacture or sell our products, which could
have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, delays in obtaining
regulatory approvals for new products or product upgrades could have a negative impact on our
growth and profitability.

In January 2010, we received a letter from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), stating
that it was conducting an investigation to determine whether IDEXX or others have engaged in, or
are engaging in, unfair methods of competition in violation of Section 5 of the Federal Trade
Commission Act (“FTC Act”), through pricing or marketing policies for companion animal veterinary
products and services, including but not limited to exclusive dealing or tying arrangements with
distributors or end-users of those products or services. The letter requests that we preserve all
materials potentially relevant to this investigation. The letter states that the FTC has not
concluded that IDEXX or anyone else has violated Section 5 of the FTC Act.

We
anticipate that we will receive a subpoena from the FTC requesting that we
provide the FTC with documents and information relevant to this
investigation and we intend to cooperate fully with the FTC in its
investigation. We cannot predict
how long any investigation might be ongoing.

We believe that our marketing and sales practices for companion animal veterinary products and
services do not violate Section 5 of the FTC Act or any other antitrust law. However, it is
possible that the FTC could reach a different conclusion at the end of its investigation and elect
to commence an enforcement action in an administrative law court within the FTC. If the FTC were to
commence an enforcement action we would expect to defend ourselves vigorously. Were the FTC to
prevail in the action and through all subsequent appeals, we believe that any remedies likely to be
sought by the FTC under Section 5 would not have a material adverse effect on our business.

Our Success Is Heavily Dependent Upon Our Proprietary Technologies

We rely on a combination of patent, trade secret, trademark and copyright laws to protect our
proprietary rights. If we do not have adequate protection of our proprietary rights, our business
may be affected by competitors who utilize substantially equivalent technologies that compete with
us.

We cannot ensure that we will obtain issued patents, that any patents issued or licensed to us
will remain valid, or that any patents owned or licensed by us will provide protection against
competitors with similar technologies. Even if our patents cover products sold by our competitors,
the time and expense of litigating to enforce our patent rights could be substantial, and could
have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, expiration of patent
rights could result in substantial new competition in the markets for products previously covered
by those patent rights. In June 2009, one of the U.S. patents covering our SNAP

®

FIV/FeLV tests expired. We had licensed this broad patent exclusively from the University of
California. Expiration of this patent could result in increased competition in the U.S. market for
feline immunodeficiency virus tests and if so, we would expect that revenues and profit margins
associated SNAP

®

FIV/FeLV tests, including Combo and Triple, will likely decline.



In the past, we have received notices claiming that our products infringe third-party patents
and we may receive such notices in the future. Patent litigation is complex and expensive, and the
outcome of patent litigation
can be difficult to predict. We cannot ensure that we will win a patent litigation case or
negotiate an acceptable resolution of such a case. If we lose, we may be stopped from selling
certain products and/or we may be required to pay damages and/or ongoing royalties as a result of
the lawsuit. Any such adverse result could have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations.

Distributor Purchasing Patterns Could Negatively Affect Our Operating Results

We sell many of our products, including substantially all of the rapid assays and instrument
consumables sold in the U.S., through distributors. Distributor purchasing patterns can be
unpredictable and may be influenced by factors unrelated to the end-user demand for our products.
In addition, our agreements with distributors may generally be terminated by the distributors for
any reason on 60 days notice. Because significant product sales are made to a limited number of
distributors, the loss of a distributor or unanticipated changes in the frequency, timing or size
of distributor purchases, could have a negative effect on our results of operations.

Distributors of veterinary products have entered into business combinations resulting in fewer
distribution companies. Consolidation within distribution channels increases our customer
concentration level, which could increase the risks described in the preceding paragraph. See “Part
1. Item 1 Business – Marketing and Distribution.”

Increased Competition and Technological Advances by Our Competitors Could Negatively Affect
Our Operating Results

We face intense competition within the markets in which we sell our products and services and
we expect that future competition will become even more intense. The introduction by competitors of
new and competitive products and services could result in a decline in sales and/or profitability
of our products and services. In addition, competitors may develop products or services that are
superior to our products and services, which could cause us to lose existing customers and market
share. Some of our competitors and potential competitors, including large diagnostic companies,
have substantially greater financial resources than us, and greater experience in manufacturing,
marketing, research and development and obtaining regulatory approvals than we do.

Changes in Testing Patterns Could Negatively Affect Our Operating Results

The market for our companion and production animal diagnostic tests and our dairy and water
testing products could be negatively impacted by a number of factors. The introduction or broad
market acceptance of vaccines or preventatives for the diseases and conditions for which we sell
diagnostic tests and services could result in a decline in testing. Changes in accepted medical
protocols regarding the diagnosis of certain diseases and conditions could have a similar effect.
Eradication or substantial declines in the prevalence of certain diseases also could lead to a
decline in diagnostic testing for such diseases. Our production animal products business in
particular is subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in disease prevalence. In addition,
changes in government regulations could negatively affect sales of our products that are driven by
compliance testing, such as our production animal, dairy and water products. Declines in testing
for any of the reasons described could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

Effective January 1, 2009, the age at which healthy cattle to be slaughtered are required to
be tested for BSE in the European Union was increased from 30 months to 48 months, which has been
estimated to reduce the population of cattle tested by approximately 30%. As a result, we believe
that we are likely to lose a portion of our sales of post-mortem tests for BSE.

Consolidation of Veterinary Hospitals Could Negatively Affect Our Business

An increasing percentage of veterinary hospitals in the U.S. is owned by corporations that are
in the business of acquiring veterinary hospitals and/or opening new veterinary hospitals
nationally or regionally. Major corporate hospital owners in the U.S. include VCA Antech, Inc.,
National Veterinary Associates, and Banfield, The Pet Hospital, each of which is currently a
customer of IDEXX. A similar trend exists in the U.K. and may in the future also develop in other
countries. Corporate owners of veterinary hospitals could attempt to improve profitability by
leveraging the buying power they derive from their scale to obtain favorable pricing from
suppliers, which could have a negative impact on our results. In addition, certain corporate
owners, most notably VCA Antech, our primary competitor in the U.S. and Canadian markets for
veterinary laboratory diagnostic services, also operate
reference laboratories that serve both their hospitals and unaffiliated hospitals. Any
hospitals acquired by these companies generally use their laboratory services almost exclusively
and shift a large portion of their testing from in-clinic testing to their reference laboratories.
In addition, because these companies compete with us in the laboratory services marketplace,
hospitals acquired by these companies may cease to be customers or potential customers of our other
companion animal products and services, which would cause our sales of these products and services
to decline.



Our Inexperience in the Human Point-of-Care Market Could Inhibit Our Success in this Market

Upon acquiring the Critical Care Division of Osmetech plc in January 2007, we entered the
human point-of-care medical diagnostics market for the first time with the sale of the
OPTI

®

line of electrolyte and blood gas analyzers. The human point-of-care medical
diagnostics market differs in many respects from the veterinary medical market. Significant
differences include the impact of third party reimbursement on diagnostic testing, more extensive
regulation, greater product liability risks, larger competitors, a more segmented customer base,
and more rapid technological innovation. Our inexperience in the human point-of-care medical
diagnostics market could negatively affect our ability to successfully manage the risks and
features of this market that differ from the veterinary medical market. There can be no assurance
that we will be successful in achieving growth and profitability in the human point-of-care medical
diagnostics market comparable to the results we have achieved in the veterinary medical market.

Risks Associated with Doing Business Internationally Could Negatively Affect Our Operating
Results

For the year ended December 31, 2009, 40% of our revenue was attributable to sales of products
and services to customers outside the U.S. Various risks associated with foreign operations may
impact our international sales. Possible risks include fluctuations in the value of foreign
currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, inability of our customers to obtain U.S. dollars to pay
our invoices, disruptions in transportation of our products, the differing product and service
needs of foreign customers, difficulties in building and managing foreign operations, import/export
duties and licensing requirements, and unexpected regulatory, economic or political changes in
foreign markets. Prices that we charge to foreign customers may be different than the prices we
charge for the same products in the U.S. due to competitive, market or other factors. As a result,
the mix of domestic and international sales in a particular period could have a material impact on
our results for that period. In addition, many of the products for which our selling price may be
denominated in foreign currencies are manufactured, sourced, or both, in the U.S. and our costs are
incurred in U.S. dollars. We utilize non-speculative forward currency exchange contracts and
natural hedges to mitigate foreign currency exposure. However, an appreciation of the U.S. dollar
relative to the foreign currencies in which we sell these products would reduce our operating
margins. Additionally, a strengthening U.S. dollar could negatively impact the ability of customers
outside the U.S. to pay for purchases denominated in U.S. dollars.

Our Operations are Vulnerable to Interruption as a Result of Natural Disasters or System
Failures

The operation of all of our facilities is vulnerable to interruption as a result of natural
and man-made disasters, interruptions in power supply, or other system failures. While we maintain
plans to continue business under such circumstances, there can be no assurance that such plans will
be successful in fully or partially mitigating the effects of such events.

We manufacture many of our significant products, including our rapid assay devices, certain
instruments, and most Water, Dairy, and Production Animal testing products, at a single facility in
Westbrook, Maine. Therefore, interruption of operations at this facility would have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations.

We maintain property and business interruption insurance to insure against the financial
impact of certain events of this nature. However, this insurance may be insufficient to compensate
us for the full amount of any losses that we may incur. In addition, such insurance will not
compensate us for the long-term competitive effects of being off the market for the period of any
interruption in operations.



The Loss of Our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman Could Adversely Affect Our
Business

We rely on the management and leadership of Jonathan W. Ayers, our President, Chief Executive
Officer and Chairman. We do not maintain key man life insurance coverage for Mr. Ayers. The loss of
Mr. Ayers could have a material adverse impact on our business.

We Could Be Subject to Class Action Litigation Due to Stock Price Volatility, which, if it
Occurs, Could Result in Substantial Costs or Large Judgments Against Us

The market for our common stock may experience extreme price and volume fluctuations, which
may be unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance or prospects. In the past,
securities class action litigation has often been brought against companies following periods of
volatility in the market prices of their securities. We may be the target of similar litigation in
the future. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s
attention and resources, which could have a negative effect on our business, operating results and
financial condition.

If Our Quarterly or Annual Results of Operations Fluctuate, This Fluctuation May Cause Our
Stock Price to Decline, Resulting in Losses to You

Our prior operating results have fluctuated due to a number of factors, including seasonality
of certain product lines; changes in our accounting estimates; the impact of acquisitions; timing
of distributor purchases, product launches, operating expenditures, litigation and claim-related
expenditures; changes in competitors’ product offerings; changes in the economy affecting consumer
spending; and other matters. Similarly, our future operating results may vary significantly from
quarter to quarter or year to year due to these and other factors, many of which are beyond our
control. If our operating results or projections of future operating results do not meet the
expectations of market analysts or investors in future periods, our stock price may fall.

Future Operating Results Could Be Negatively Affected by the Resolution of Various Uncertain
Tax Positions and by Potential Changes to Tax Incentives

In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the
ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Significant judgment is required in determining our
worldwide provision for income taxes. We periodically assess our exposures related to our worldwide
provision for income taxes and believe that we have appropriately accrued taxes for contingencies.
Any reduction of these contingent liabilities or additional assessment would increase or decrease
income, respectively, in the period such determination was made. Our income tax filings are
regularly under audit by tax authorities and the final determination of tax audits could be
materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals.
Additionally, we benefit from certain tax incentives offered by various jurisdictions. If we are
unable to meet the requirements of such incentives, our inability to use these benefits could have
a material negative effect on future earnings.

PART II

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Description of Segments

. During 2009, we operated primarily through three business
segments: diagnostic and information technology products and services for the veterinary market,
which we refer to as the Companion Animal Group (“CAG”), water quality products (“Water”) and
products for production animal health, which we refer to as the Production Animal Segment (“PAS”).
We also operate two smaller segments that comprise products for dairy quality (“Dairy”) and
products for the human point-of-care medical diagnostic market (“OPTI Medical”). Financial
information about the Dairy and OPTI Medical operating segments and other licensing arrangements
are combined and presented in an “Other” category because they do not meet the quantitative or
qualitative thresholds for reportable segments. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial
statements for the year ended December 31, 2009 included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for
financial information about our segments, including geographic information, and about our product
and service categories.

Items that are not allocated to our operating segments are comprised primarily of corporate
research and development expenses that do not align with one of our existing business or service
categories, a portion of share-based compensation expense, interest income and expense, and income
taxes. In our segment disclosure of gross profit, operating expenses and operating income, these
amounts are shown under the caption “Unallocated Amounts.” We estimate our share-based compensation
expense for the year and allocate the estimated expense to the operating segments. This allocation
differs from the actual expense and consequently yields a difference between the total allocated
share-based compensation expense and the actual expense for the total company resulting in an
unallocated amount reported under the Unallocated Category.

The following is a discussion of the strategic and operating factors that we believe have the
most significant effect on the performance of our business.

Companion Animal Group

In the CAG segment, we believe we have developed a strategic advantage over companies with
more narrow product or service offerings. The breadth and complementary nature of our products and
services give us scale in sales and distribution, permit us to offer integrated disease-management
diagnostic solutions that leverage the advantages of both point-of-care and outside laboratory
testing, and facilitate the flow of medical and business information in the veterinary practice by
connecting practice information software systems with reference laboratory test data, in-clinic
test data from our IDEXX VetLab

®

suite of analyzers, and radiographic data from the
IDEXX-PACS

™

and IDEXX EquiView PACS

™

software generated by our digital
radiography systems.

Instruments and Consumables

. Our strategy in our IDEXX VetLab

®

instrument
line of business is to provide veterinarians with an integrated set of instruments that,
individually and together, provide superior diagnostic information in the clinic, enabling
veterinarians to practice better medicine and, in doing so, achieve their practice economic
objectives, including growth and profitability. We derive substantial revenues and margins from the
sale of consumables that are used in these instruments. The principal instruments used by
veterinarians for in-clinic diagnostic testing are chemistry and hematology analyzers. In addition
we sell instruments used for endocrinology, blood gas, electrolytes, urinalysis, and blood
coagulation testing. Our IDEXX VetLab

®

Station is an in-clinic laboratory information
management system that records and integrates patient diagnostic information from our analyzers for
better practice management. For customers that utilize our IVLS, we offer IDEXX
SmartService

™

Solutions, an electronic customer support and service tool that allows
IDEXX technical support to remotely monitor instrument performance, troubleshoot issues and provide
system updates. Additionally, we offer extended maintenance agreements in connection with the sale
of our instruments.

During the early stage of an instrument’s life cycle, we derive relatively greater revenues
from instrument placements, while consumable sales become relatively more significant in later
stages as the installed base of instruments increases and instrument placement revenues begin to
decline. Instrument sales have significantly lower gross margins than sales of consumables, and
therefore the mix of instrument and consumable sales in a particular period will impact our gross
margins in this line of business.



Our Catalyst Dx

®

analyzer is our latest generation chemistry analyzer, which was
launched in the first quarter of 2008. In addition, we sell and have an active installed base of
approximately 31,000 VetTest

®

analyzers, with substantially all of our revenues from
that product line currently derived from consumable sales. We continue to place VetTest

®

instruments through sales, lease, rental and other programs. A substantial portion of 2009
Catalyst Dx

®

analyzer placements have been made at veterinary clinics that already own
our VetTest

®

analyzer. As we continue to experience growth in sales of Catalyst
Dx

®

analyzers and the related consumables, we expect to see a decline in the sales of
VetTest

®

consumables. Based on projections of future sales volume and the average unit
price of consumables used in the Catalyst Dx

®

and VetTest

®

analyzers, we do
not expect a future shift to Catalyst Dx

®

consumables to significantly impact gross
margin. We do however expect near-term downward pressure on gross margin percentage due to higher
relative instrument placement revenues as compared to consumables’ sales with continued penetration
of the Catalyst Dx

®

analyzer. Our long-term success in this area of our business is
dependent upon new customer acquisition, customer retention and customer utilization of existing
and new assays introduced for use on our analyzers. To increase utilization, we seek to educate
veterinarians about best medical practices that emphasize the importance of blood and urine
chemistry testing for a variety of diagnostic purposes.

We purchase the chemistry consumables, other than electrolyte slides, used in our Catalyst
Dx

®

and VetTest

®

analyzers from Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, Inc. (“Ortho”)
under a supply agreement that continues through 2025. This supply agreement provides us with a
long-term source of slides at costs that improve over the term of the agreement as a result of
increasing purchase volumes.

Our principal hematology analyzer is the LaserCyte

®

analyzer. In addition we sell
the VetAutoread

™

analyzer. A substantial portion of LaserCyte

®

placements
have been made at veterinary clinics that already own our VetAutoread

™

analyzer.
Although we have experienced growth in sales of hematology consumables, LaserCyte

®

consumable sales have been partly offset by declines in sales of VetAutoread

™

consumables.

With all of our instrument lines, we seek to differentiate our products from those of other
in-clinic instrument manufacturers and laboratory diagnostic service providers based on breadth of
diagnostic menu, flexibility of menu selection, accuracy, reliability, ease-of-use, throughput,
ability to handle compromised samples, time-to-result, analytical capability of software,
integration with the IDEXX VetLab

®

Station, education and training, and superior sales
and customer service. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to differentiate our products in
a way that justifies premium pricing.

Rapid Assay Products

. Our rapid assay line of business consists primarily of
single-use kits for point-of-care testing and, to a limited degree, microwell-based kits for
laboratory testing for canine and feline diseases and conditions. Our rapid assay strategy is to
develop, manufacture, market and sell proprietary tests that address important medical needs for
particular diseases prevalent in the companion animal population. We seek to differentiate our
tests from those of other in-clinic test providers and laboratory diagnostic service providers
through ease-of-use and superior performance, including by providing our customers with combination
tests that test a single sample for multiple analytes. Where alternative point-of-care offerings
exist, we seek to differentiate our tests with superior performance. As in our other lines of
business, we also seek to differentiate our products through superior customer service. We further
augment our product development and customer service efforts with sales and marketing programs that
enhance medical awareness and understanding regarding our target diseases and the importance of
diagnostic testing. We also seek to enhance efficiency and test result capture by providing our
customers with the ability to have rapid assay tests read and results recorded into the patient
record by our SNAPshot Dx

®

analyzer. This functionality is currently available for use
with our SNAP

®

tests for evaluation of thyroid, adrenal and liver function; diagnosing
canine pancreatitis, feline leukemia and feline immunodeficiency virus; and for screening for
heartworm and three additional tick-borne diseases, ehrlichiosis, Lyme and anaplasmosis. We are
currently developing this functionality across our canine and feline family of rapid assay
products.



Veterinary Laboratory Diagnostic and Consulting Services

. We believe that more than
half of all diagnostic testing by U.S. veterinarians is done at outside reference laboratories such
as our IDEXX Reference Laboratories. In markets outside the U.S., in-clinic testing is less
prevalent and an even greater percentage of diagnostic testing is done in reference laboratories.
We attempt to differentiate our laboratory testing services from those of our competitors and
in-clinic offerings primarily on the basis of quality, customer service, technology employed and
specialized test menu. Revenue growth in this line of business is achieved both through increased
sales at existing laboratories and through the acquisition of new customers, including through
laboratory acquisitions, customer list
acquisitions and the opening of new laboratories. In 2009, we acquired a telemedicine and
consulting services business located in the U.S. In 2008, we acquired a laboratory in Spain and
acquired certain intellectual property and distribution rights associated with a diagnostic test
product. In 2007, we acquired laboratories in the U.S. and Canada and acquired veterinary
laboratory customer lists in the U.S., Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Profitability of this
business is largely the result of our ability to achieve efficiencies from both volume and
operational improvements. New laboratories that we open typically will operate at a loss until
testing volumes reach a level that permits profitability. Acquired laboratories frequently operate
less profitably than our existing laboratories and those laboratories may not achieve profitability
comparable to our existing laboratories for several years until we complete the implementation of
operating improvements and efficiencies. Therefore, in the short term, new and acquired reference
laboratories generally will have a negative effect on the operating margin of the laboratory
diagnostic and consulting services line of business.

Practice Information Systems and Digital Radiography

. These lines of business consist
of veterinary practice information systems including hardware and software and veterinary-specific
digital radiography systems. Our strategy in the practice information systems line of business is
to provide superior software and hardware integrated information solutions, backed by superior
customer support and education, to allow the veterinarian to practice better medicine and achieve
the practice’s business objectives. We differentiate our software systems through enhanced
functionality and ease of use. Our veterinary-specific digital radiography systems allow
veterinarians to capture digital radiographs with ease and without the use of hazardous chemicals.
The digital radiography systems also incorporate
IDEXX-PACS

™

and IDEXX EquiView PACS

™

picture archiving and communication software developed by IDEXX that allows for image enhancement,
manipulation, storage and retrieval, and integration with the practice information software. Our
strategy in digital radiography is to offer a system that provides superior image quality and
software capability at a competitive price, backed by the same customer support provided for our
other products and services in the Companion Animal Group.

Water

Our strategy in the water testing business is to develop, manufacture, market and sell
proprietary products with superior performance, supported by exceptional customer service. Our
customers are primarily water utilities, government laboratories and private certified laboratories
that highly value strong relationships and customer support. International sales of water testing
products represented 47% of total water product sales in 2009, and we expect that future growth in
this business will be significantly dependent on our ability to increase international sales.
Growth also will be dependent on our ability to enhance and broaden our product line. Most water
microbiological testing is driven by regulation, and, in many countries, a test may not be used for
regulatory testing unless it has been approved by the applicable regulatory body. As a result, we
maintain an active regulatory program that involves applying for regulatory approvals in a number
of countries, primarily in Europe.

Production Animal Segment

We develop, manufacture, market and sell a broad range of tests for various cattle, swine and
poultry diseases and conditions, and have an active research and development, and in-licensing
program in this area. Our strategy is to offer proprietary tests with superior performance
characteristics. Disease outbreaks are episodic and unpredictable, and certain diseases that are
prevalent at one time may be substantially contained or eradicated at a later time. In response to
outbreaks, testing initiatives may lead to exceptional demand for certain products in certain
periods. Conversely, successful eradication programs may result in significantly decreased demand
for certain products. The performance of this business, therefore, can fluctuate. In 2009,
approximately 88% of our sales in this business were international. Because of the significant
dependence of this business on international sales, the performance of the business is particularly
subject to the various risks described above that are associated with doing business
internationally. See “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.”



Other

Dairy

. Our strategy in the dairy testing business is to develop, manufacture and sell
antibiotic residue testing products that satisfy applicable regulatory requirements for testing of
milk by processors and producers and provide reliable field performance. The manufacture of these
testing products leverage, almost exclusively, the SNAP

®

platform as well as the
production equipment of our rapid assay business, incorporating customized reagents for antibiotic
detection. The majority of our sales in this business are international. To successfully increase
sales of
dairy testing products, we believe that we need to increase penetration in the processor and
producer segments of the dairy market, and to develop product line enhancements and extensions.
Because of the significant dependence of this business on international sales, the performance of
the business is particularly subject to the various risks described above that are associated with
doing business internationally. See “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.”

OPTI Medical Systems

. Our strategy in the OPTI Medical Systems business for the human
market is to develop, manufacture, and sell electrolyte and blood gas analyzers and related
consumable products for the medical point-of-care diagnostics market worldwide, with a focus on
small- to mid-sized hospitals. We seek to differentiate our products based on ease of use, menu,
convenience, international distribution and service, and instrument reliability. Similar to our
veterinary instruments and consumables strategy, a substantial portion of the revenues from this
product line is derived from the sale of consumables for use on the installed base of electrolyte
and blood gas analyzers. During the early stage of an instrument’s life cycle, relatively greater
revenues are derived from instrument placements, while consumable sales become relatively more
significant in later stages as the installed base of instruments increases and instrument placement
revenues begin to decline. Our long-term success in this area of our business is dependent upon new
customer acquisition, customer retention and increased customer utilization of existing and new
assays introduced on these instruments.

OPTI Medical Systems also supplies our VetStat

®

analyzer, an instrument and
consumable system that is a member of the IDEXX VetLab

®

suite for the veterinary market.
In addition, OPTI Medical Systems provides the electrolyte module and dry slide reagents that make
up the electrolyte testing functionality of the Catalyst Dx

®

analyzer. Our strategy in
the OPTI Medical Systems business for the veterinary market is to utilize this unit’s know-how,
intellectual property and manufacturing capability to continue to expand the menu and instrument
capability of the VetStat

®

and Catalyst Dx

®

platforms for veterinary
applications.

Other Activities

. We have developed certain proprietary technology that we believe may
have application in areas that do not align with one of our existing business or service
categories. Our strategy is to out-license these technologies to partners that are best positioned
to complete the development and commercialization of products utilizing these technologies. To the
extent we are successful in doing so, we may receive one-time or recurring payments based on the
achievement of development or sales milestones. Our ability to succeed in this area of our business
depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified scientific personnel to develop proprietary
products or technology and our ability to identify suitable third parties to complete the
commercialization of these technologies.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon
our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial
statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On
an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on
various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which
form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are
not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Note 3 to
the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2009 describes the significant accounting policies used in preparation of these
consolidated financial statements.

We believe the following critical accounting estimates and assumptions may have a material
impact on reported financial condition and operating performance and involve significant levels of
judgment to account for highly uncertain matters or are susceptible to significant change.

Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenue when four criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence that an arrangement
exists; (ii) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; (iii) the sales price is fixed
or determinable; and (iv) collectibility is reasonably assured. See Note 3(h) to the consolidated
financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2009 included in this Annual Report on Form
10-K for additional information about our revenue recognition policy and criteria for recognizing
revenue.



Multiple element arrangements (MEA’s)

. Arrangements to sell products to customers
frequently include multiple deliverables. Our most significant MEA’s include the sale of one or
more of the instruments from the IDEXX VetLab

®

suite of analyzers or digital radiography
systems, combined with one or more of the following products: extended maintenance agreements;
consumables; laboratory services; and practice management software. Practice management software is
frequently sold with postcontract customer support and implementation services. Delivery of the
various products or performance of services within the arrangement may or may not coincide.
Interpretation of customer sales agreements is sometimes required to determine the appropriate
accounting, including whether the deliverables specified in a MEA should be treated as separate
units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes, and, if so, how the price should be allocated
among the elements and when to recognize revenue for each element.

When arrangements include multiple elements, we use verifiable objective evidence (“VOE”) of
fair value or vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”) of fair value for software to allocate
revenue to the elements and recognize revenue when the elements have standalone value and the four
criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element. The timing of product and service
revenue recognized is affected by our judgments as to whether an arrangement includes multiple
elements and, if so, whether fair value exists for those elements. Changes to the elements in an
arrangement and the ability to establish fair value for those elements could affect the timing of
the revenue recognition.

We determine VOE and VSOE of fair value by amounts charged separately for the delivered and
undelivered elements to similar customers in standalone sales of the specific elements. We have
determined that the software components of our digital radiography systems and IVLS are more than
incidental to the products as a whole, therefore we account for sales of these products in MEA’s
under software accounting guidance and defer revenue equal to the fair value of the support
provided to the customer during the one-year warranty period. Judgment is required to determine
whether the software within our digital systems and IVLS is essential to the functionality of the
products and judgment and estimation is required to establish the fair value of the updates and
support provided. We have also applied judgment to determine that software used in, or with our
IDEXX VetLab

®

instruments, except for the IVLS, is not more than incidental to the
functionality of those instruments.

Certain arrangements with customers include discounts on future products and services. We
apply judgment in determining whether discounts are significant and incremental and when the future
discount offered is not considered significant and incremental, we do not account for the discount
as an element of the arrangement. If the future discount is significant and incremental, we
recognize that discount as an element of the arrangement and allocate the discount to the other
elements of the arrangement based on relative fair value. To determine whether a discount is
significant and incremental, we look to the discount provided in standalone sales of the same
product to similar customers, the level of discount provided on other elements in the arrangement,
and the significance of the discount to the overall arrangement. If the discount in the MEA
approximates the discount typically provided in standalone sales, that discount is not considered
significant and incremental.

We separately price extended maintenance agreements (“EMA”) sold to customers. When an EMA is
sold as a component of a multi-product sale, we recognize revenue related to the EMA at the stated
contractual price on a straight-line basis over the life of the agreement.

Customer programs

. We record estimated reductions to revenue in connection with
customer marketing programs and incentive offerings that may give customers credits, award points,
or provide other incentives. Future market conditions and changes in product offerings may require
us to change marketing strategies to increase customer incentive offerings, possibly resulting in
incremental reductions of revenue in future periods as compared to reductions in the current or
prior periods. Additionally, certain incentive programs require us to estimate, based on historical
experience, and apply judgment to approximate the number of customers who will actually redeem the
incentive. Differences between estimated and actual customer participation in programs may impact
the amount and timing of revenue recognition.

Revenue reductions are recorded quarterly based on issuance of credits, points earned but not
yet issued, and estimates of credits and points to be earned in the future based on current
revenue. In our analysis, we utilize data supplied from distributors and collected in-house that
details the volume of qualifying products purchased as well as price paid per clinic
(“practice-level sales data”).



Customers can earn IDEXX Points based on their participation in certain customer programs and
making qualifying purchases related to those programs. IDEXX Points may then be applied against the
purchase price for IDEXX products and services purchased in the future or applied to trade
receivables due to us. As points are redeemed we recognize the benefit of points expected to
expire, or breakage, using historical forfeiture rates. On November 30 of each year, unused points
earned before January 1 of the prior year expire and any variance from the breakage estimate is
accounted for as a change in estimate. Our two most significant customer programs are Practice
Developer

®

and SNAP

®

up the Savings

™

(“SUTS”), both of which are
offered only to North American customers. In 2009, the SUTS program was redesigned to allow for
payout of points earned quarterly. The most significant estimate related to SUTS, and other point
programs, is estimating the amount of breakage. Following is a summary of revenue reductions
recorded under these programs and in total for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 (

Inventory Valuation

We write down inventory for estimated obsolescence when warranted by estimates of future
demand, market conditions, remaining shelf life, or product functionality. If actual market
conditions or results of estimated functionality are less favorable than those we estimated,
additional inventory write-downs may be required, which would have a negative effect on results of
operations. Certain major components of inventory for which we have made critical valuation
judgments are discussed in more detail below.

LaserCyte

®

Hematology Analyzer

. At December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, $1.3
million, $2.9 million and $2.7 million, respectively, of inventory associated with our
LaserCyte

®

analyzer required rework before it could be used to manufacture finished
goods, which was net of $2.4 million, $2.2 million and $1.7 million, respectively, of write-downs
for inventory estimated to be obsolete and disposed. We determined write-downs based on our
estimate of the costs to rework inventory compared to replacement cost and the probability of
success, primarily based on historical experience. We expect to fully realize our net investment in
this inventory. However, if we are unsuccessful in reworking this inventory, if we revise our
judgment of our ability to successfully rework inventory due to new experience in reworking this
inventory, if we determine that it is more cost effective to purchase new inventory rather than
rework this inventory, or if we alter the design of this product, we may be required to write off
some or all of the remaining associated inventory.

Valuation of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

A significant portion of the purchase price for acquired businesses is assigned to intangible
assets. Intangible assets other than goodwill are initially valued at fair value. If a market value
is not readily available, the fair value of the intangible asset is estimated based on discounted
cash flows using market participant assumptions, which are assumptions that are not specific to
IDEXX. The selection of appropriate valuation methodologies and the estimation of discounted cash
flows require significant assumptions about the timing and amounts of future cash flows, risks,
appropriate discount rates, and the useful lives of intangible assets. When material, we utilize
independent valuation experts to advise and assist us in allocating the purchase prices for
acquired businesses to the fair values of the identified intangible assets and in determining
appropriate amortization methods and periods for those intangible assets. Goodwill is initially
valued based on the excess of the purchase price of a business combination over the fair values of
acquired net assets, including intangible assets.

We assess goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or
circumstances indicate an impairment may exist. For impairment testing, the fair values of the
reporting units that include goodwill are estimated using an income approach by developing
discounted cash flow models. Model assumptions are based on our projections and best estimates,
using appropriate and customary market participant assumptions. Changes in forecasted cash flows or
the discount rate would affect the estimated fair values of reporting units and could result in a
goodwill impairment charge in a future period. However, at December 31, 2009 a 25% decrease in the
current estimated fair value of any of our reporting units would not result in a goodwill
impairment charge for any of our reporting units that include goodwill. As a measure to assess the
fair values of the reporting units, we aggregate the fair value of each of the reporting units and
compare that aggregate total to the overall market capitalization of the Company. As of November
30, 2009, the date that we performed our assessment of goodwill for impairment, the total aggregate
fair values of the reporting units was approximately $3.2 billion, which approximates the Company’s
market capitalization as of that date. No goodwill impairments were identified as a result of the
annual or event-driven reviews during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 or 2007.

During 2008, we sold certain pharmaceutical product lines and pharmaceutical assets that
qualified as a business. The pharmaceutical business had $13.7 million of related goodwill, of
which we wrote off approximately $7.2 million that was allocated to the product lines sold based on
their respective fair values. Fair values were estimated using a discounted cash flow approach. A
substantial portion of the remaining goodwill is associated with products that have been licensed
to third parties and is included in our “Other” segment. Realization of this goodwill is dependant
upon the success of those third parties in developing and commercializing products, which will
result in our receipt of royalties and other payments.

We assess the realizability of intangible assets other than goodwill whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. If an impairment
review is triggered, we evaluate the carrying value of intangible assets based on estimated
undiscounted future cash flows over the
remaining useful life of the assets and compare that value to the carrying value of the
assets. The cash flows that are used contain our best estimates, using appropriate and customary
assumptions and projections at the time.



During 2009, we recognized an impairment charge of $1.5 million to write off an acquired
intangible asset associated with our equine digital radiography business, which is part of our CAG
segment. Based on changes in estimated future demand and market conditions, we determined that we
would not fully realize our investment and, therefore, fully expensed this asset. No other
impairments were identified during the year ended December 31, 2009. No impairments were identified
during the year ended December 31, 2008.

During 2007, we recognized an impairment charge to write off a prepaid royalty license of $1.0
million associated with Navigator

®

paste. We also recognized a related inventory
write-down, the circumstances of which are described in Note 6 to the consolidated financial
statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on our changed estimates of product
availability and estimated future demand and market conditions, we determined that we would not
realize our investment in prepaid royalties and, therefore, fully expensed this asset. No other
impairments were identified during the year ended December 31, 2007.

Share-Based Compensation

Beginning in 2006, we modified our employee share-based compensation programs to shift from
the grant of stock options and employee stock purchase rights only to the grant of a mix of
restricted stock units and stock options, along with employee stock purchase rights. There were no
modifications to the terms of outstanding options, restricted stock units or deferred stock units
during 2009, 2008 or 2007.

On January 1, 2006 we adopted amendments to the accounting provisions governing share-based
payments and adopted the straight-line method to prospectively expense share-based awards granted
subsequent to December 31, 2005. The graded-vesting, or accelerated, method has been used to
calculate the expense for stock options granted prior to January 1, 2006. If the total fair value
of share-based compensation awards, as well as other features that impact expense, including
forfeitures and capitalization of costs, was consistent from year-to-year in each of the last five
years and through 2010, this change in expense method to straight-line expensing would yield less
than the pro forma graded-vesting expense through 2010 until awards granted prior to January 1,
2006 were fully expensed. However, the total fair value of future awards may vary significantly
from past awards based on a number of factors, including our share-based award practices.
Therefore, share-based compensation expense is likely to fluctuate, possibly significantly, from
year to year.

We determine the assumptions to be used in the valuation of option grants as of the date of
grant. As such, we may use different assumptions during the year if we grant options at different
dates. However, substantially all of our options granted during the years ended December 31, 2009,
2008 and 2007 were granted in the first quarter of each year. The weighted average of each of the
valuation assumptions used to determine the fair value of each option grant during each of the
previous three years is as follows:

Options may not be granted for a contractual term of more than seven years.

We use the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model to determine the fair value of options
granted. Option-pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, particularly for
the expected stock price volatility and the expected term of options. Changes in the subjective
input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate. Our expected stock price
volatility assumptions are based on the historical volatility of our stock over periods that are
similar to the expected terms of grants and other relevant factors. Lower estimated volatility
reduces the fair value of an option. The total fair value of options awarded during the year ended
December 31, 2009 ($5.4 million) would have increased by 9% or decreased by 7% if the weighted
average of the stock price volatility assumptions were increased or decreased by 10% to 33.6% or
27.5%, respectively. The total expense recognized for options awarded during the year ended
December 31, 2009 would have increased or decreased by $0.1 million if the
weighted average of the stock price volatility assumption used to value options granted during
2009 were increased or decreased by 10% to 33.6% or 27.5%, respectively.



To develop the expected term assumption for option awards, we previously elected to use the
simplified method which is based on vesting and contractual terms. Beginning in January 2008, we
derive the expected term assumption for options based on historical experience and other relevant
factors concerning expected employee behavior with regard to option exercise. The expected term for
future awards will be determined using a consistent method. Longer expected term assumptions
increase the fair value of option awards, and therefore increase the expense recognized per award.
The total fair value of options awarded during the year ended December 31, 2009 ($5.4 million)
would have increased by 10% or decreased by 11% if the weighted average of the expected term
assumptions were increased or decreased by one year, respectively. The total cost recognized for
options awarded during the year ended December 31, 2009 would have increased or decreased by $0.1
million if the weighted average of the expected term assumptions were increased or decreased by one
year, respectively.

Share-based compensation expense is based on the number of awards ultimately expected to vest
and is, therefore, reduced for an estimate of the number of awards that are expected to be
forfeited. The forfeiture estimates are based on historical data and other factors, and
compensation expense is adjusted for actual results. Share-based compensation costs for the year
ended December 31, 2009 were $11.4 million, which is net of a reduction of $2.5 million for actual
and estimated forfeitures. Changes in estimated forfeiture rates and differences between estimated
forfeiture rates and actual experience may result in significant, unanticipated increases or
decreases in share-based compensation expense from period to period. The termination of employment
by certain employees who hold large numbers of share-based compensation instruments may also have a
significant, unanticipated impact on forfeiture experience and, therefore, on share-based
compensation expense.

The fair value of options, restricted stock units, deferred stock units with vesting
conditions, and employee stock purchase rights awarded during the years ended December 31, 2009,
2008 and 2007 totaled $16.0 million, $18.7 million and $18.2 million, respectively. The total
unrecognized compensation cost for unvested share-based compensation awards outstanding at December
31, 2009, before consideration of estimated forfeitures, was $33.0 million. We estimate that this
cost will be reduced by approximately $3.4 million related to forfeitures. The weighted average
remaining expense recognition period is approximately 1.6 years.

Income Taxes

We recognize a current tax liability or asset for current taxes payable or refundable,
respectively, and a deferred tax liability or asset, as the case may be, for the estimated future
tax effects of temporary differences between book and tax treatment of assets and liabilities and
carryforwards to the extent they are realizable.

The future tax benefit arising from net deductible temporary differences and tax
carryforwards, net of valuation allowances, was $8.0 million and $7.5 million at December 31, 2009
and 2008, respectively. On a quarterly basis we assess our current earnings by jurisdiction to
determine whether or not our earnings during the periods when the temporary differences become
deductible will be sufficient to realize the related future tax benefits. Should we determine that
we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future, an
adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination
was made. A reduction of net income before taxes in each subsidiary equal to 5% of revenue,
compared to the corresponding reported amounts for the year ended December 31, 2009, would not
result in the recognition of incremental valuation allowances except in two subsidiaries where a 5%
reduction could result in our recording a valuation allowance of $1.2 million for those
subsidiaries.

For those jurisdictions where the expiration date of tax carryforwards or the projected
operating results indicate that realization is not likely, a valuation allowance is recorded to
offset the deferred tax asset within that jurisdiction. In assessing the need for a valuation
allowance, we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning
strategies. Alternatively, in the event that we were to determine that we would be able to realize
our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, an adjustment to the
deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made.



Our net deductible temporary differences and tax carryforwards are recorded using the enacted
tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax liability or
asset is expected to be settled
or realized. Should the expected applicable tax rates change in the future, an adjustment to
the net deferred tax asset would be credited or charged, as appropriate, to income in the period
such determination was made. For example, an increase of one percentage point in our anticipated
U.S. state income tax rate would cause us to increase our net deferred tax asset balance by $0.3
million. This increase in the net deferred asset would increase net income in the period that our
rate was adjusted. Likewise, a decrease of one percentage point to our anticipated U.S. state
income tax rate would have the opposite effect.

We periodically assess our exposures related to our worldwide provision for income taxes and
believe that we have appropriately accrued taxes for contingencies. Any reduction of these
contingent liabilities or additional assessment would increase or decrease income, respectively, in
the period such determination was made.

We consider the majority of the operating earnings of non-United States subsidiaries to be
indefinitely invested outside the U.S. The cumulative earnings of these subsidiaries were $194.0
million at December 31, 2009. No provision has been made for U.S. federal and state, or
international taxes that may result from future remittances of these undistributed earnings of
non-United States subsidiaries. Should we repatriate these earnings in the future, we would have to
adjust the income tax provision in the period in which the decision to repatriate earnings is made.
For the operating earnings not considered to be indefinitely invested outside the United States we
have accrued taxes on a current basis.

We record a liability for uncertain tax provisions in accordance with a comprehensive model
for the recognition, measurement, and financial statement disclosure. This comprehensive model
requires us to assess all tax positions against a more likely than not standard. We record tax
benefits for only those positions that we believe will more likely than not be sustained. For
positions that we believe that it is more likely than not that we will prevail, we record a benefit
considering the amounts and probabilities that could be realized upon ultimate settlement. If our
judgment as to the likely resolution of the uncertainty changes, if the uncertainty is ultimately
settled or if the statute of limitation related to the uncertainty expires, the effects of the
change would be recognized in the period in which the change, resolution or expiration occurs. As
of December 31, 2009 our net liability for uncertain tax positions was $6.0 million, which includes
estimated interest expense and penalties.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Impact of Distribution Channel on Results of Operations

. Because the instrument
consumables and rapid assay products in our CAG segment are sold in the U.S. and certain other
geographies by distributors, distributor purchasing dynamics have an impact on our reported sales
of these products. Distributors purchase products from us and sell them to veterinary practices,
who are the end users. Distributor purchasing dynamics may be affected by many factors and may be
unrelated to underlying end-user demand for our products. As a result, fluctuations in
distributors’ inventories may cause reported results in a period not to be representative of
underlying end-user demand. Therefore, we believe it is important to track distributor sales to end
users and to distinguish between the impact of end-user demand and the impact of distributor
purchasing dynamics on reported revenue growth.

Where growth rates are affected by changes in end-user demand, we refer to the impact of
practice-level sales on growth. Where growth rates are affected by distributor purchasing dynamics,
we refer to the impact of changes in distributors’ inventories. If during the comparable period of
the prior year, distributors’ inventories grew by more than those inventories grew in the current
year, then changes in distributors’ inventories have a negative impact on our reported sales growth
in the current period. Conversely, if during the comparable period of the prior year, distributors’
inventories grew by less than those inventories grew in the current year, then changes in
distributors’ inventories have a positive impact on our reported sales growth in the current
period.

Impact of Economic Factors, Including Foreign Currency Exchange Rates

. Approximately
24% of our revenue is derived from products manufactured in the U.S. and sold internationally in
local currencies. Strengthening of the rate of exchange for the U.S. dollar relative to other
currencies has a negative impact on our international revenues and on margins of products
manufactured in the U.S. and sold internationally. In addition, to the extent that the U.S. dollar
is stronger in future periods relative to the exchange rates in effect in the corresponding prior
periods, our growth rate will be negatively affected. The impact of foreign currency denominated
operating expenses, foreign currency denominated supply contracts and the impact of foreign
currency hedge contracts in place partly offset this exposure.



We believe that our financial results in 2009 continued to be negatively impacted by economic
conditions that weakened over the course of 2008 due, in large part, to fewer patient visits to
U.S. and European veterinary clinics for routine screening, preventive care and elective
procedures. We believe reduced patient visits negatively impacted the growth rate of sales of rapid
assay tests, instrument consumables, and laboratory diagnostic and consulting services in our CAG
segment. In addition, we believe that the rate of growth of sales of our instruments, which are
larger capital purchases for veterinarians, was negatively affected by increased caution among
veterinarians regarding economic prospects. Weaker economic conditions also increased the
sensitivity of our customers to the pricing of our products and services, resulting in lower price
realization for certain products over the course of 2009 relative to prior periods.

Beyond our companion animal business, we are also seeing the weaker economy impact certain
customer groups in our Water and PAS businesses. Lower Water testing volumes in the non-regulatory
segments of the business have been driven by a decline in new home construction and reduced
consumer willingness to spend on certain luxury items, such as vacation cruises. Lower PAS testing
volumes have been driven by a reduction in non-regulatory producer and laboratory testing, as a
measure to reduce operating costs, and by a reduction in testing associated with government
mandated eradication programs, due to lower government funding.

While we expect these trends to continue in the near term, we believe the fundamental drivers
of demand in the markets we serve to remain intact and that growth rates will improve as major
world economies stabilize.

The increase in instruments and consumables revenue was due to higher sales volumes, partly
offset by lower average unit sales prices on instruments. Higher sales volumes were driven
primarily by sales of our Catalyst Dx

®

analyzer, which was launched at the end of the
first quarter of 2008. This impact was partly offset by a decrease in sales of our other IDEXX
VetLab

®

instruments, most notably of LaserCyte

®

analyzers, due primarily to
market penetration and a shift in focus of our sales efforts to our newer instruments. Higher sales
volume was also attributable to sales of consumables used with the Catalyst Dx

®

instrument, partly offset by lower sales of consumables used with our VetTest

®

instrument as Catalyst Dx

®

instruments have replaced VetTest

®

instruments at
certain customers. Instrument service revenue also contributed to revenue growth as our active
installed base of instruments covered under service contracts continued to increase. Lower average
unit sales prices for instruments were primarily related to sales of our LaserCyte

®

analyzers, resulting from discounts associated with customer purchase programs. Changes in
distributors’ inventory levels did not have a meaningful impact on reported instruments and
consumables revenue growth.

The slight increase in rapid assay revenue was due to higher practice-level sales resulting
from increased sales volumes of canine combination test products and SNAP

®

cPL

™

, our test for pancreatitis in dogs, partly offset by lower sales volumes of
feline combination test products. To a lesser extent, higher average unit sales prices also
contributed to the increase in rapid assay revenue. Changes in distributors’ inventory levels did
not have a meaningful impact on reported rapid assay revenue growth.

The increase in laboratory diagnostic and consulting services revenue resulted primarily from the impact
of higher testing volume and price increases. Higher testing volume was the result of growth in our
customer base and the impact of new test offerings. To a lesser extent, revenue was also favorably
impacted by incremental sales from businesses acquired in 2009.

The increase in practice information management systems and digital radiography revenue
resulted primarily from higher sales volumes of companion animal radiography systems and peripheral
equipment and support services related to our practice information management systems. These
favorable items were partly offset by lower sales of equine radiography systems, lower average unit
prices for companion animal radiography systems, and lower sales of Cornerstone

®

practice information management systems.

In the fourth quarter of 2008, we sold a substantial portion of our pharmaceutical assets and
product lines, and therefore did not have significant pharmaceutical product revenue in 2009. We
have retained certain intellectual property and licenses for developed products as well as certain
less significant product lines, which have been
reassigned to other lines of business. Prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to
current year presentation. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended
December 31, 2009 included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.



Water.

The increase in Water revenue resulted primarily from higher average unit sales prices,
partly offset by lower sales volume of certain Water products. Higher average unit sales prices
were attributable to a favorable mix of product sales within certain markets; the impact of price
increases for certain products sold in the U.S.; and higher relative sales in geographies where
products are sold at higher average unit sales prices.

Production Animal Segment.

The decrease in PAS revenue resulted primarily from the impact of
the timing of revenue recognition on shipments to a customer, where revenue for shipments to that
customer is recognized on the cash basis of accounting due to uncertain collectability and lower
average unit sales prices. These unfavorable items were partly offset by higher overall sales
volumes.

Other.

The increase in Other revenue was due primarily to higher sales volumes of Dairy and
OPTI Medical products. Higher Dairy volume was primarily attributable to Dairy SNAP

®

antibiotic residue tests, a recently released Dairy SNAP

®

residue test for detection of
melamine and a recently launched instrument. These favorable items were partly offset by lower
average unit sales prices for OPTI Medical products.

Companion Animal Group.

Gross profit for CAG decreased due to a decrease in the gross profit
percentage of less than one percentage point to 49%. The decrease in the gross profit percentage
was due primarily to the absence of higher margin pharmaceutical product sales in 2009; higher
relative sales of lower margin products and services, primarily IDEXX VetLab

®

instruments and laboratory diagnostic and consulting services; higher product overhead spending due, in part,
to investment in facilities and production equipment to meet anticipated future demand; and the
impact of lower volumes of most of our instruments, except for Catalyst Dx

®

and SNAPshot
Dx

®

analyzers. These unfavorable impacts were partly offset by gross profit improvement
in our laboratory diagnostic and consulting services line of business due, in part, to higher
selling prices and operational efficiencies. Lower depreciation expense associated with IDEXX
VetLab

®

instruments previously placed under rental agreements also favorably impacted
gross profit percentage.

Water.

Gross profit for Water increased due to an increase in the gross profit percentage to
64.5% from 63%. The increase in the gross profit percentage was due primarily to the impact of
lower royalty costs and, to a lesser extent, higher average unit sales prices. These favorable
items were partly offset by higher overall manufacturing costs and higher costs related to product
distribution.

Production Animal Segment.

Gross profit for PAS decreased due to lower sales volume and a
decrease in the gross profit percentage to 66% from 68%. The decrease in gross profit percentage
was due primarily to higher costs of product manufacturing and the impact of lower revenue
recognized related to a customer where revenue is recognized on the cash basis of accounting due to
uncertain collectability. These items were partly offset by the favorable impact of foreign
currency hedge contracts and the favorable currency impact on foreign currency denominated
expenses, net of the unfavorable impact the strengthening of the U.S. dollar had on sales
denominated in foreign currencies and lower royalty costs.



Other.

Gross profit for Other increased due to higher sales volume and an increase in the
gross profit percentage to 45% from 44%. The increase in gross profit percentage was due to lower
overall costs of product manufacturing in our OPTI Medical and Dairy businesses and, to a lesser
extent, greater relative sales of higher margin Dairy SNAP

®

tests and OPTI Medical
instrument consumables. These favorable items were partly offset by lower average unit sales prices
of OPTI Medical products.

As previously described, we sold a substantial portion of our pharmaceutical assets and
product lines and restructured the remainder of this business in the fourth quarter of 2008. As a
result, we did not incur meaningful expenses related to this business in 2009 and will not incur
meaningful expenses in the future. This impact on sales and marketing expense, general and
administrative expense and research and development expense is referred to in the following
operating expense analysis as the impact of the “pharmaceutical transaction.” In relation to
restructuring the remainder of the pharmaceutical business, certain research and development
personnel were realigned to our corporate research and development team, for which expenses are not
allocated to our operating segments. A portion of the decrease in spending explained within the CAG
section is due to this restructuring.



The decrease in sales and marketing expense resulted primarily from the effects of the
pharmaceutical transaction and from the favorable impact of exchange rates on foreign currency
denominated expenses. These decreases were partly offset by higher personnel and personnel-related
costs due, in part, to the addition of customer support, sales and marketing personnel, and an
increase in facility expenses related to completion of significant
phases of our headquarters expansion project in 2009. The decrease in general and
administrative expense resulted primarily from the favorable impact of exchange rates on foreign
currency denominated expenses, the effects of the pharmaceutical transaction and lower bad debt
expense. These decreases were partly offset by an impairment charge of $1.5 million to write off an
acquired intangible asset associated with our equine digital radiography business. To a lesser
extent, the decreases noted were also offset by an increase in spending related to general support
functions in the U.S. and Europe and incremental expenses associated with businesses acquired
subsequent to January 1, 2009, comprised mainly of administrative expenses of a recurring nature to
support the acquired businesses and transaction related expenses. The decrease in research and
development expense resulted primarily from a decrease in spending related to the pharmaceutical
business.

The decrease in sales and marketing expense resulted primarily from the favorable impact of
exchange rates on foreign currency denominated expenses, lower spending on consulting services and
a decrease in spending on travel. The increase in general and administrative expense resulted from
higher bad debt expense and higher spending on corporate support function expenses, partly offset
by lower legal expenses and the favorable impact of exchange rates on foreign currency denominated
expenses. The increase in research and development expense was due primarily to an increase in
spending associated with enhancing the functionality of an existing product, qualifying second
source suppliers of certain raw materials and new product development. These increases were partly
offset by lower spending related to product registration related fees and the favorable impact of
exchange rates on foreign currency denominated expenses.

The decrease in sales and marketing expense resulted primarily from the favorable impact of
exchange rates on foreign currency denominated expenses and lower spending on marketing activities.
The increase in general and administrative expense resulted primarily from increased personnel
costs and higher legal spending, partly offset by the favorable impact of exchange rates on foreign
currency denominated expenses and lower intangible asset amortization expense. The increase in
research and development expense resulted primarily from an increase in spending on product
development, increased personnel-related expenses and increased spending on supplies, partly offset
by the favorable impact of exchange rates on foreign currency denominated expenses.



Other.

Operating expenses for Other operating units increased $0.1 million to $13.6 million
for the year ended December 31, 2009. The unfavorable impact of an increase in deferred
compensation expense associated with an employee plan assumed in the acquisition of OPTI Medical,
higher personnel-related costs and higher bad debt expense were almost entirely offset by the
receipt of a milestone payment and, to a lesser extent, by lower spending on marketing materials
and advertising in our OPTI Medical and Dairy businesses. In the fourth quarter of 2009, we
received a milestone payment of $2 million related to the sale of product rights in connection with
the disposition of our pharmaceutical division in the fourth quarter of 2008. The receipt of this
payment was due to the achievement of
certain development milestones by the third party that purchased the product rights. Because
we have no obligation to deliver product or services, or otherwise provide support to the third
party under this agreement, receipt of milestone payments are included in results of operations,
but are not classified as revenue as the transaction was accounted for as the sale of a product
line. We may receive up to $9.5 million of future payments based on the achievement of future sales
milestones by this third party. Additional milestone payments will be included in our results of
operations upon achievement of the milestone.

Unallocated Amounts.

Operating expenses that are not allocated to our operating segments
increased $0.6 million to $12.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 due to the write-off
of capitalized costs related to an information technology project and higher expense related to
share-based compensation. These increases were partly offset by the impact of the fourth quarter
2008 sale of our Acarexx

®

and SURPASS

®

pharmaceutical products and a product
that was under development, and the subsequent restructuring of the remaining pharmaceutical
division. In 2008, we recognized a loss on the transaction and restructuring of approximately $1.5
million, of which $1.1 million was recorded in general and administrative expense, $0.3 million was
recorded in sales and marketing expense and $0.1 million was recorded in research and development
expense.

Interest Income and Interest Expense

Interest income was $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $2.3 million
for the same period of the prior year. The decrease in interest income was due to lower effective
interest rates, partly offset by higher average invested cash balances.

Interest expense was $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to $4.6
million for the same period of the prior year. The decrease in interest expense was due to lower
effective interest rates on outstanding debt balances, partly offset by lower capitalized interest
and higher average borrowings under our revolving credit facility.

Provision for Income Taxes

Our effective income tax rate was 30.0% for the year ended December 31, 2009 and 31.7% for the
year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease in tax rate was due primarily to the recognition of tax
benefits resulting from the expiration of certain statutes of limitations, settlement of an audit
in an international tax jurisdiction and the write-off of non-deductible goodwill related to the
pharmaceutical product lines sold in the fourth quarter of 2008. These benefits were partly offset
by a reduction in international deferred tax liabilities in 2008 due to a change in the statutory
tax rates for a jurisdiction in which we operate. This non-recurring benefit of approximately $1.5
million reduced our effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2008 by 0.9
percentage points.

In the next year, it is reasonably possible that we could recognize up to $1.5 million of
income tax benefits that have not been recognized at December 31, 2009. The income tax benefits are
primarily due to the lapse in the statutes of limitations for various U.S. and international tax
jurisdictions.

Instruments and consumables revenue increased due to higher consumables sales volumes for most
of our analyzers and higher average unit sales prices, primarily on slides that are sold for use in
our chemistry analyzers. Additionally, increased revenue was due to higher instrument sales
volumes, due primarily to sales of recently launched instruments, including Catalyst Dx

®

chemistry analyzers and SNAPshot Dx

®

analyzers, which we began
shipping to customers in the first quarter of 2008, and sales of Coag Dx

™

blood
coagulation analyzers, which we began shipping to customers in the fourth quarter of 2007. The
increase in volumes due to the placement of recently launched instruments was partly offset by a
decrease in sales of most of our other IDEXX VetLab

®

instruments, due primarily to
increased market penetration and a shift in focus of our sales team to our newer instruments. The
lower sales of our other IDEXX VetLab

®

instruments was also due to lower average unit
sales prices, due largely to increased promotional discounting. Higher instrument service revenue
was due to the increase in number of instruments covered under service contracts as we continue to
increase our active installed base of instruments.

Sales volumes of consumables in the U.S. and Canada in the first half of 2007 benefited from
temporary additional diagnostic testing volume related to the recall of certain pet foods in March
2007. We believe that the recall resulted in a higher than usual number of pet visits to veterinary
clinics in North America in the first and second quarters of 2007. We estimate that this event
negatively impacted year-over-year growth in sales of instruments and consumables for the year
ended December 31, 2008 by approximately 1%. The impact from changes in distributors’ inventory
levels reduced reported instruments and consumables revenue growth by 1%.

The increase in practice-level sales of rapid assay products was due to both higher average
unit sales prices and higher sales volumes. Higher average unit sales prices were due primarily to
the impact of price increases of certain canine and feline combination tests and, to a lesser
extent, less promotional discounting in connection with our SNAP

®

up the
Savings

™

and other customer programs and higher relative sales of canine combination
test products versus single assay test products. Increased volume was due primarily to increased
U.S. practice-level sales of our canine combination test products, such as the SNAP

®

4Dx

®

, and the July 2007 launch of SNAP

®

cPL

™

, our test for
pancreatitis in dogs. The favorable impacts on rapid assay sales noted above were partly offset by
a decrease in the volume of sales of products under our distribution agreement with Agen Biomedical
Limited. The impact from changes in distributors’ inventory levels reduced reported rapid assay
revenue growth by 2%.

The increase in sales of laboratory diagnostic and consulting services resulted from higher testing
volume and the impact of price increases. As discussed above, the first half of 2007 benefited from
temporary additional diagnostic testing volume resulting from the March 2007 pet food recall. We
estimate that this event negatively impacted year-over-year growth in laboratory diagnostic and consulting
services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2008 by approximately 1%.

The increase in sales of practice information management systems and digital radiography
resulted primarily from higher sales volumes of companion animal radiography systems, partly offset
by lower sales of equine radiography systems, lower average unit prices for companion animal
radiography systems, and lower sales of Cornerstone

®

practice information management
systems.

Revenue from the sales of pharmaceutical products was unchanged as the higher average unit
sales price of PZI VET

®

, our insulin product for the treatment of diabetic cats, was
offset by lower sales volumes of Acarexx

®

and SURPASS

®

pharmaceutical
products. As previously discussed, in a series of transactions in the fourth quarter of 2008, we
sold a substantial portion of our pharmaceutical assets and product lines. We retained certain
intellectual property and licenses for developed products as well as certain less significant
product lines, which were reassigned to other business units. See Note 19 to the consolidated
financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2009 included in this Annual Report on Form
10-K.

Water.

The increase in Water revenue resulted primarily from higher sales volume, partly
offset by lower average unit sales prices due to higher relative sales in geographies where
products are sold at lower average unit sales prices. Higher sales volumes were attributable to the
increased sales of our Colilert

®

products, used to detect total coliforms and

E. coli

in
water, and the commencement in September 2007 of distribution of certain water testing kits
manufactured by Life Technologies Corporation, which increased reported Water revenue growth by 5%.

Production Animal Segment.

The increase in PAS revenue resulted from increased sales volume,
partly offset by lower average unit sales prices. The increase in volume resulted primarily from
higher livestock diagnostics sales, including sales attributable to Institut Pourquier, a
France-based manufacturer of production animal diagnostic products that we acquired in March 2007.
The year-over-year growth in sales of Pourquier products contributed 3% to PAS revenue growth. The
decrease in average unit sales prices was due primarily to a reduction in average price for our
post-mortem test for BSE.



Other.

The increase in Other revenue was due primarily to higher sales volume of our OPTI
Medical consumable products and, to a lesser extent, higher sales volume of Dairy SNAP

®

antibiotic residue tests.

Companion Animal Group.

Gross profit for CAG increased due to increased sales volume in all
CAG product and service lines, except the pharmaceutical business, and to an increase in the gross
profit percentage to 49% from 48%. The gross profit percentage in 2007 was unfavorably impacted by
the write-off of pharmaceutical inventory and of a prepaid royalty related to our
Navigator

®

product, as discussed below, which favorably impacted the comparison of
current year gross profit percentage to prior year gross profit percentage by 1%. The increase in
the 2008 gross profit percentage was also due to the favorable impact of foreign currency rates on
sales denominated in those currencies, inclusive of foreign exchange hedge contract gains and
foreign currency denominated expenses; lower cost of slides that are sold for use in our chemistry
analyzers; and higher average unit sales prices on canine combination test products. These
favorable items were partly offset by higher relative sales of lower margin laboratory diagnostic and
consulting services and IDEXX VetLab

®

instruments, and also by higher manufacturing
costs of our instruments, including our Catalyst Dx

®

Chemistry Analyzer.

During 2007, we recognized a write-down of raw material inventory of nitazoxanide (“NTZ”), the
active ingredient associated with our Navigator

®

product, of $9.1 million and a
write-off of a prepaid royalty license of $1.0 million associated with Navigator

®

paste.
We wrote down these assets because the third-party contract manufacturer of finished goods notified
us that it would discontinue manufacturing the product in 2009. Additionally, product sales were
lower than projected. We believed that we would not be able to enter into a replacement
manufacturing arrangement on economically feasible terms and that we would not be able to obtain
the product after termination of the existing manufacturing arrangement because the estimated
production volume was low. Accordingly, we evaluated our associated inventory for obsolescence
based on our changed estimates of product availability and estimated future demand and market
conditions. Additionally, because of lower sales volume estimates and the reduced product life, we
determined that we would not realize our related investment in prepaid royalties and, therefore,
fully expensed this asset. In the fourth quarter of 2008, we cancelled our supply agreement for NTZ
and sold our remaining raw material inventory back to the supplier for $2.0 million, payable in
monthly installments of $25,000 through December 2010 with the remaining balance then due. We will
recognize these payments in our results of operations when they are received due to uncertain
collectibility.

Water.

Gross profit for Water increased due primarily to increased sales volume. Gross profit
percentage remained approximately constant at 63% as lower overall costs of manufacturing and the
favorable impact of foreign currency rates on sales denominated in those currencies, inclusive of
foreign exchange hedge contract gains and foreign currency denominated expense, were offset by the
impact of greater relative sales of lower margin products, consisting primarily of water testing
kits manufactured by Life Technologies Corporation that we began distributing in September 2007;
discrete costs incurred as a result of discontinuing a project to qualify a second source supplier
for certain products; and higher relative sales in geographies where products are sold at lower
unit prices.



Production Animal Segment.

Gross profit for PAS increased due to increased sales volume and to
an increase in the gross profit percentage to 68% from 62%. The increase in the gross profit
percentage was due
primarily to the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on sales denominated in those
currencies, inclusive of foreign exchange hedge contract gains and foreign currency denominated
expenses and, to a lesser extent, higher relative sales of higher margin livestock diagnostic
tests; the impact of revenue recognized in 2008 on shipments prior to January 1, 2008 to a customer
for which we recognize revenue on the cash basis of accounting due to uncertain collectibility; and
the favorable settlement of a royalty liability. The gross profit percentage in 2007 was negatively
affected by 1% as a result of purchase accounting for inventory acquired with the Pourquier
business. These favorable impacts were partly offset by the impact of lower average unit sales
prices.

Other.

Gross profit for Other increased due primarily to increased sales volume and to an
increase in the gross profit percentage to 44% from 41%. The increase in the gross profit
percentage was due primarily to the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on sales denominated
in those currencies, inclusive of foreign exchange hedge contract gains and foreign currency
denominated expenses. The gross profit percentage in 2008 also improved due to an initial payment
under a royalty-bearing license agreement related to certain intellectual property. Under this
agreement, we received an initial payment and are entitled to receive a total of $3.3 million in
future milestone payments in addition to royalties based on future product sales. Milestone
payments will be included in our results of operations upon achievement of each of the milestones.
These favorable impacts were partly offset by higher relative sales of lower margin products.

The increase in sales and marketing expense resulted primarily from higher personnel and
personnel-related costs due, in part, to expanded worldwide sales and marketing and the addition of
customer service headcount. To a lesser extent, the impact of exchange rates on foreign currency
denominated expenses and increased spending on customer support systems also contributed to the
increase in sales and marketing expense. These increases were partly offset by lower overall
spending on commissions and distributor incentives and marketing programs.

The increase in general and administrative expense resulted primarily from higher spending on
corporate support functions; incremental expenses associated with businesses acquired subsequent to
January 1, 2007, comprised mainly of administrative expenses of a recurring nature to support the
acquired businesses and amortization expense for intangible assets acquired; the unfavorable impact
of exchange rates on foreign currency denominated expenses; and, to a lesser extent, increased bad
debt expense and higher personnel costs due, in part, to increased headcount. These increases were
partly offset by the absence of non-recurring costs incurred in 2007 related to acquisitions.

The decrease in research and development expense resulted primarily from a decrease in product
development spending due to the completion of the development of our Catalyst Dx

®

chemistry analyzer, and our quantitative immunoassay platform, SNAPshot Dx

®

, both of
which we began shipping to customers in the first quarter of 2008, and to lower external consulting
costs related to our pharmaceuticals product line. These decreases were largely offset by higher
personnel costs to support development initiatives related primarily to IDEXX VetLab

®

instrumentation, rapid assay and digital radiography products.

The increase in sales and marketing expense resulted primarily from the impact of exchange
rates on foreign currency denominated expenses and, to a lesser extent, increased personnel and
personnel-related costs and incremental activities associated with the Pourquier business, which
was acquired in March 2007. These unfavorable impacts were partly offset by costs incurred in 2007
associated with terminating a distribution agreement, which favorably impacted the comparison of
current year sales and marketing expense to the prior year, and by increased recruiting costs
associated with the increase in headcount. The increase in general and administrative expense
resulted primarily from increased personnel costs, the impact of exchange rates on foreign currency
denominated expenses and incremental costs associated with the acquisition of the Pourquier
business, which are comprised mainly of administrative expenses of a recurring nature to support
the acquired business and amortization expense for intangible assets. These increases were partly
offset by lower overall spending on corporate support function expenses. The increase in research
and development expense resulted primarily from increased headcount and the impact of exchange
rates on foreign currency denominated expenses, partly offset by a decrease in spending on research
and development supplies and on third-party consulting firms used to conduct research.

Other.

Operating expenses for Other increased $2.1 million to $13.6 million for the year ended
December 31, 2008 due primarily to higher spending on corporate support function expenses,
increased personnel costs, partly due to increased headcount, and to incremental expenses related
to OPTI Medical, which was acquired in January 2007. These increases were partly offset by a
reduction in deferred compensation liability related to a deferred compensation plan assumed in the
OPTI Medical acquisition. The deferred compensation liability is determined based on the value of
the investments in an underlying consolidated trust. The unrealized loss on the marketable
securities in the trust is recorded through other comprehensive income.

Unallocated Amounts.

Operating expenses that are not allocated to our operating segments
increased $4.3 million to $12.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 due primarily to
increased corporate research and development spending on software and systems research and
development related to integration of our veterinary product and service offerings. To a lesser
extent, the increase in operating expenses was also attributable to the sale of our
Acarexx

®

and SURPASS

®

pharmaceutical products and a product that was under
development, and the subsequent restructuring of the remaining pharmaceutical division. We
recognized a loss on the transaction and restructuring of approximately $1.5 million, of which $1.1
million was recorded in general and administrative expense, $0.3 million was recorded in sales and
marketing expense and $0.1 million was recorded in research and development expense in 2008.

Interest Income and Interest Expense

Interest income was $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to $2.8 million
for the same period of the prior year. The decrease in interest income was due to lower effective
interest rates, partly offset by higher average invested cash balances.

Interest expense was $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to $4.2
million for the same period of the prior year. The increase in interest expense was due primarily
to higher borrowings under our revolving credit facility, partly offset by lower effective interest
rates on outstanding debt balances and incremental capitalized interest.



Provision for Income Taxes

Our effective income tax rate was 31.7% for the year ended December 31, 2008 and 30.3% for the
year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in tax rate is primarily attributable to several
non-recurring items. First, we wrote off non-deductible goodwill related to the pharmaceutical
product lines sold in the fourth quarter of 2008. Additionally, the increase in tax rate was
impacted by certain non-recurring items that favorably impacted the tax rate for the year ended
December 31, 2007, including the reduction of deferred tax liabilities due to a change in
international tax rate and the recognition of state tax benefits resulting from the completion of
an audit in 2007. These items were partly offset by tax benefits related to a reduction in
international deferred tax liabilities in 2008 and the 2007 reduction of deferred tax assets due to
changes in statutory income tax rates for jurisdictions in which we operate.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

A discussion of recent accounting pronouncements is included in Note 3 to the consolidated
financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2009 included in this Annual Report on Form
10-K.

In September 2009, authoritative literature was issued that modifies the revenue recognition
guidance for establishing separate units of accounting and additionally, how to recognize revenue
for the sale of tangible products that contain software that is more than incidental to the
functionality of the product as a whole. The revised guidance becomes effective on January 1, 2011;
however, may be early adopted as of the beginning of the 2009 fiscal year. We have made the
election to adopt these changes as of January 1, 2010. Adoption of the revisions to the
authoritative guidance will not have a significant impact on our financial position, results of
operations, or cash flows.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Liquidity

We fund the capital needs of our business through cash on hand, funds generated from
operations, and amounts available under our unsecured short-term revolving credit facility (“Credit
Facility”). At December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, we had $106.7 million and $78.9 million,
respectively, of cash and cash equivalents, and working capital of $120.0 million and $60.6
million, respectively. Additionally, at December 31, 2009, we had remaining borrowing availability
under our Credit Facility of $80.2 million. We believe that current cash and cash equivalents,
funds generated from operations, and amounts available under our Credit Facility will be sufficient
to fund our operations, capital purchase requirements, and strategic growth needs for the next
twelve months. We further believe that we could obtain additional borrowings at prevailing market
interest rates to fund our growth objectives. However, based on the current credit market, we
believe that the interest rates, financial covenants and other terms of such borrowings would be
less favorable than those applicable to our current Credit Facility and those which otherwise would
have been available historically.

We consider the operating earnings of certain non-United States subsidiaries to be
indefinitely invested outside the U.S. Changes to this policy could have adverse tax consequences.
Subject to this policy, we manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among
all of our subsidiaries. Our foreign cash balances are generally available without legal
restrictions to fund ordinary business operations outside the U.S.

Operating Activities.

Cash provided by operating activities was $175.0 million for the year
ended December 31, 2009, compared to $143.3 million for the same period in 2008. We historically
have experienced proportionally lower or net negative cash flows from operating activities during
the first quarter and proportionally higher or net positive cash flows from operating activities
for the remainder of the year and for the annual period. Several factors contribute to the seasonal
fluctuations in cash flows generated by operating activities, including the following:

•

Accounts receivable are historically higher in the first quarter of the year due to
seasonality of certain products.

•

We have management and non-management employee incentive programs that provide for
the payment of annual bonuses in the first quarter following the year for which the
bonuses were earned.

•

We have agreements with certain suppliers that require us to make minimum annual
inventory purchases, in some cases in order to retain exclusive distribution rights,
and we have other agreements with suppliers that provide for lower pricing based on
annual purchase volumes. We may place a higher volume of purchase orders for inventory
during the fourth quarter in order to meet our minimum commitments or realize volume
pricing discounts and we receive that inventory in the fourth or first quarters and pay
in the first quarter. The specific facts and circumstances that we consider in
determining the timing and level of inventory purchases throughout the year related to
these agreements may yield inconsistent cash flows from operations, most typically in
the first and fourth quarters.

The total of net income and net non-cash charges was $185.3 million for the year ended
December 31, 2009, compared to $176.8 million for the same period in 2008. During the year ended
December 31, 2009, cash decreased by $10.3 million due to changes in operating assets and
liabilities, compared to a decrease in the same period of 2008 of $33.5 million, resulting in a
year-to-year increase in cash of $23.2 million.

During the year ended December 31, 2009, we realized cash related to investments made during
2008 in inventories and accounts receivable. At December 31, 2008, higher inventory balances, as
compared to balances at December 31, 2007, related primarily to Catalyst Dx

®

analyzers,
digital radiography instruments and Lasercyte

®

hematology analyzers. In 2009, higher
sales of Catalyst Dx

®

analyzers and other products, combined with specific efforts to
manage growth in inventory of all of our products favorably impacted the change in our cash
position. This favorable impact was partly offset by the impact of a large reduction of slides
inventory from 2007 to 2008, as compared to an increase in slides inventory balances from 2008 to
2009. The favorable impact on our cash position due to changes in accounts receivable was driven by
improved collection of cash from customers coupled with growth in sales. However, sales growth in
2009 was at a slower rate than experienced in 2008. The slowing of sales growth and improved
collections caused the use of cash related to accounts receivable to be lower during the year ended
December 31, 2009, as compared to the same period of the prior year. These increases in cash were
partly offset by additional cash used by accounts payable, due to timing of payment for slide
inventory, and accrued expenses related to the timing of payments of royalties and employee
benefits during the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to the same period of the prior year.

Investing Activities.

Cash used by investing activities was $53.6 million for the year ended
December 31, 2009, compared to cash used of $91.6 million for the same period of 2008. The decrease
in cash used by investing activities for 2009, compared to 2008, was due primarily to $39.8 million
less cash used for purchases of property and equipment. The decrease in purchases of property and
equipment was attributable primarily to a reduction in spending of $26.4 million for the renovation
and expansion of our headquarters facility in Westbrook, Maine, which we expect to conclude in the
second quarter of 2011. We paid $49.4 million to purchase fixed assets during the year ended
December 31, 2009. Our total capital expenditure plan for 2010 is approximately $45 million, which
includes approximately $12 million for the continued renovation and expansion of our Westbrook
facility, approximately $10 million related to information technology hardware and software, and
the remainder related to investments in machinery and equipment.

We paid $8.4 million in cash to acquire businesses and certain intangible assets not
comprising businesses during the year ended December 31, 2009. We paid $6.8 million in cash to
acquire a business and, under separate transactions, to acquire certain intangible assets that did
not comprise businesses during the year ended December 31, 2008 and recognized liabilities of $0.3
million, of which $0.1 million was paid in 2008. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial
statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information about our
acquisitions of businesses.

Financing Activities.

At December 31, 2009, we had $118.8 million outstanding under our Credit
Facility, of which $4.8 million was borrowed by our Canadian subsidiary and denominated in Canadian
dollars. The applicable interest rates on the Credit Facility generally range from 0.375 to 0.875
percentage points (“Credit Spread”) above the London interbank rate (“LIBOR”) or the Canadian
Dollar-denominated bankers’ acceptance rate (“CDOR”), dependent on our consolidated leverage ratio.
Under the Credit Facility, we pay quarterly commitment fees of 0.08% to 0.20%, dependent on our
consolidated leverage ratio, on any unused commitment. The Credit Facility agreement contains a
subjective material adverse event clause, which allows the debt holders to call the loans under the
Credit Facility if we fail to notify the debt holder of such an event. The Credit Facility
agreement also contains financial and other affirmative and negative covenants, as well as
customary events of default, that would allow any amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility to
be accelerated, or restrict our ability to borrow thereunder, in the event of noncompliance. The
financial covenant requires our ratio of debt to earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as defined by the agreement, not to exceed
3-to-1. At December 31, 2009, we were in compliance with the covenants of the Credit Facility.



Our board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to 44,000,000 shares of our common
stock in the open market or in negotiated transactions. From the inception of the program in August
1999 to December 31, 2009, we repurchased 37,706,000 shares. Cash used to repurchase shares during
the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $83.1 million and $132.3 million, respectively. We
believe that the repurchase of our common stock is a favorable investment and we also repurchase to
offset the dilutive effect of our share-based compensation programs. Repurchases of our common
stock may vary depending upon the level of other investing activities and the share price. See Note
16 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K
for additional information about our share repurchases.

Other Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees

Under our workers’ compensation insurance policies for U.S. employees since January 1, 2003,
we have retained the first $250,000 in claim liability per incident and an aggregate claim
liability based on payroll for each year. The insurance company provides insurance for claims above
the individual occurrence and aggregate limits. We estimate claim liability based on claims
incurred and the estimated ultimate cost to settle the claims. Based on this analysis, we have
recognized expenses of $0.8 million, $0.9 million, and $0.3 million for claims incurred during the
years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Claims incurred during the years ended
December 31, 2009 and 2008 are relatively undeveloped and significant additional healthcare and
wage indemnification costs could arise from those claims. Our liability for claims incurred during
the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 could exceed our estimates and we could be liable for up
to $1.9 million and $2.0 million, respectively, in excess of the expense we have recognized. For
the five years ended on or prior to December 31, 2007, based on our retained claim liability per
incident and our aggregate claim liability, our maximum liability at December 31, 2009 is $0.8
million in excess of the amounts deemed probable and previously recognized. In connection with
these policies, we have outstanding letters of credit totaling $1.9 million to the insurance
companies as security for these claims.

We have commitments outstanding at December 31, 2009 for additional purchase price payments of
up to $7.7 million, of which $0.2 million has been accrued, in connection with acquisitions of
businesses and intangible assets during the current and prior periods, all of which are contingent
on the achievement by certain acquired businesses of specified milestones.

We are contractually obligated to make the following payments in the years below:

Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion on unrecognized tax benefits.



ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK

Our financial market risk consists primarily of foreign currency exchange risk and interest
rate risk. Our functional currency is the U.S. dollar and our primary manufacturing operations are
in the U.S., but we distribute our products worldwide both through direct export and through our
foreign subsidiaries. Our primary foreign currency
transaction risk consists of intercompany sales of products and we attempt to mitigate this
risk through our hedging program described below. For the year ended December 31, 2009,
approximately 24% of our revenues were derived from products manufactured in the U.S. and sold
internationally in local currencies. The functional currency of most of our subsidiaries is their
local currency. For one of our subsidiaries located in the Netherlands, the functional currency is
the U.S. dollar.

The primary purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to protect against the
volatility associated with foreign currency transactions. We also utilize natural hedges to
mitigate our transaction and commitment exposures. Our corporate policy prescribes the range of
allowable hedging activity. We enter into exchange contracts with large multinational financial
institutions and we do not hold or engage in transactions involving derivative instruments for
purposes other than risk management. Our accounting policies for these contracts are based on our
designation of such instruments as hedging transactions. Market gains and losses are deferred in
other current or long-term assets or accruals, as appropriate, until the contract matures, which is
the period when the related obligation is settled. We primarily utilize forward exchange contracts
with durations of less than 24 months.

Our subsidiaries enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to manage the exchange risk
associated with their forecasted intercompany inventory purchases for the next year. From time to
time, we may also enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to minimize the impact of foreign
currency fluctuations associated with specific, significant transactions.

We identify foreign currency exchange risk by regularly monitoring our transactions
denominated in foreign currencies. We attempt to mitigate currency risk by hedging the majority of
our cash flow on intercompany sales to minimize foreign currency exposure. Currency exposure on
large purchases of foreign currency denominated products are evaluated in our hedging program and
used as natural hedges to offset identified hedge requirements related to intercompany sales.

Our foreign currency hedging strategy is consistent with prior periods and there were no
material changes in our market risk exposure during the year ended December 31, 2009. We enter into
forward currency exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges for amounts that are less than
the full value of forecasted intercompany sales and for amounts that are equivalent to, or less
than, other specific, significant transactions, thus no significant ineffectiveness has resulted or
been recorded through the statements of operations. Our hedging strategy related to intercompany
inventory purchases provides that we employ the full amount of our hedges for the succeeding year
at the conclusion of our budgeting process for that year, which is complete by the end of the
preceding year. Quarterly, we enter into contracts to hedge incremental portions of anticipated
foreign currency transactions for the current and following year that are in excess of amounts
previously hedged. Accordingly, our risk with respect to foreign currency exchange rate
fluctuations may vary throughout each annual cycle.

We enter into hedge agreements where we believe we have meaningful exposure to foreign
currency exchange risk. The notional amount of foreign currency contracts to hedge forecasted
intercompany sales outstanding at December 31, 2009 and 2008 was $116.9 million and $97.7 million,
respectively. At December 31, 2009, we had $2.9 million in net unrealized losses on foreign
exchange contracts designated as hedges recorded in other comprehensive income, which is net of
$1.3 million in taxes.

Our foreign currency exchange risk at December 31, 2009 consisted of local currency revenues
and expenses, the impact of hedge contracts and balances denominated in a currency other than the
Company’s or our subsidiaries’ functional currencies. A 10% strengthening of the U.S. dollar
relative to foreign currencies, including the impact of hedge contracts currently in place, would
reduce operating income by approximately $7.9 million in 2010. A 10% weakening of the U.S. dollar
relative to foreign currencies would have the exact opposite impact of a 10% strengthening of the
U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies.

We are subject to interest rate risk based on the terms of our Credit Facility to the extent
that the LIBOR or the CDOR increases. Borrowings under our Credit Facility bear interest in the
range from 0.375 to 0.875 percentage points above the LIBOR or the CDOR, dependent on our
consolidated leverage ratio, and the interest period terms for the outstanding borrowings, which
range from one to six months. As discussed below, we have entered into forward fixed interest rate
swaps to mitigate interest rate risk in future periods commencing March 31, 2010. Borrowings
outstanding at December 31, 2009 were $118.8 million at a weighted-average interest rate of 0.8%.
Based on amounts outstanding at December 31, 2009, an increase in the LIBOR or the CDOR of 1% until
March 31,
2010 would increase interest expense by approximately $1.2 million on an annualized basis.
Subsequent to March 31, 2010, our forward fixed interest rate swaps commence and based on amounts
outstanding at December 31, 2009, an increase in LIBOR or the CDOR of 1% would decrease interest
expense by approximately $0.4 million on an annualized basis.



In March 2009, we entered into two forward fixed interest rate swap agreements for an
aggregate notional amount of $80 million to manage the economic effect of variable interest
obligations on amounts borrowed under the terms of our Credit Facility. Under these agreements, we
will effectively fix our interest exposure on $80 million of our outstanding borrowings for the
period commencing March 31, 2010, through March 30, 2012 by converting our variable interest rate
payments to fixed interest rate payments at 2% plus the Credit Spread. The critical terms of the
fixed interest rate swap agreements match the critical terms of the underlying borrowings,
including notional amounts, underlying market indices, interest rate reset dates and maturity
dates. Accordingly, we have designated these swaps as qualifying instruments to be accounted for as
cash flow hedges. See Note 15 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this
Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of our derivative instruments and hedging activities.

Not applicable.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and
procedures, as defined by the SEC in its Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 as amended (the “Exchange Act”). The term “disclosure controls and
procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and
other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by the company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms.
Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or
submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management,
including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no
matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their
objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit
relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure
controls and procedures at December 31, 2009, our chief executive officer and chief financial
officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure
controls and procedures are effective to achieve their stated purpose.

Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial
reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. The Company’s
internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of
America and includes those policies and procedures that:

•

Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and
fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;

•

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and



•

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions
and that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.

We conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
based on the framework in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, we conclude that, at
December 31, 2009, our internal control over financial reporting was effective.

The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting at December 31,
2009 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting
firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules
13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the three months ended December 31, 2009
that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of IDEXX Laboratories, Inc

.:

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item
15(a)(1) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of IDEXX Laboratories,
Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the results of their operations and
their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009 in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our
opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2)
presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in
conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s
management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the Report of Management on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express
opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits
in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal
control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the
financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our
audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed
risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

IDEXX LABORATORIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1. NATURE OF BUSINESS

We develop, manufacture and distribute products and provide services primarily for the
veterinary and the production animal, water testing and dairy markets. We also sell a line of
portable electrolytes and blood gas analyzers for the human point-of-care medical diagnostics
market. Our products and services are sold worldwide. During 2009, we operated primarily through
three business segments: diagnostic and information technology products and services for the
veterinary market, which we refer to as our Companion Animal Group (“CAG”), water quality products
(“Water”), and products for production animal health, which we refer to as the Production Animal
Segment (“PAS”). We also operate two smaller operating segments that comprise products for dairy
quality (“Dairy”) and products for the human point-of-care medical diagnostics market (“OPTI
Medical”). Financial information about the Dairy and OPTI Medical operating segments and other
licensing arrangements are combined and presented in an “Other” category because they do not meet
the quantitative or qualitative thresholds for reportable segments. See Note 13 for additional
information regarding our reportable operating segments, products and services, and geographical
areas.

NOTE 2. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of IDEXX Laboratories,
Inc. and our wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries, and all other variable interest entities
in which we have an interest and are determined to be the primary beneficiary. All material
intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.

On October 25, 2007, our board of directors approved a two-for-one split of the outstanding
shares of our common stock, to be effected in the form of a 100% stock dividend. Each holder of
common stock of record at November 5, 2007 received one additional share of common stock. The
additional shares of common stock were distributed on November 26, 2007. As a result of the stock
split, the number of outstanding common shares doubled to approximately 61 million shares. In
addition, the exercise of outstanding stock options and the vesting of other stock awards, as well
as the number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under our various employee benefit
plans, were proportionately increased in accordance with the terms of those respective agreements
and plans.

NOTE 3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

(a) Estimates

The preparation of these financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) requires us to make estimates and
judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and
related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these
estimates, including those related to bad debts; goodwill and other intangible assets; income
taxes; inventory; investments; revenue recognition, product returns, and multiple element
arrangements; share-based compensation; warranty reserves; and contingencies. We accrue contingent
liabilities when it is probable that future expenditures will be made and such expenditures can
reasonably be estimated. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other
assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the
basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily
apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

F-8


(b) Inventories

Inventories include material, labor and overhead, and are stated at the lower of cost
(first-in, first-out) or market. We write down inventory for estimated obsolescence when warranted
based on estimates of future demand, market conditions, remaining shelf life, or product
functionality. If actual market conditions or results of estimated functionality are less favorable
than those we estimated, additional inventory write-downs may be required, which would have a
negative effect on results of operations.

(c) Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization.
When an item is sold or retired, the cost and related accumulated depreciation is relieved, and the
resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognized in the consolidated statement of income. We provide
for depreciation and amortization primarily using the straight-line method by charges to income in
amounts that allocate the cost of property and equipment over their estimated useful lives as
follows:

Asset Classification

Estimated Useful Life

Land improvements

15 years

Buildings and improvements

15–40 years

Leasehold improvements

Shorter of life of lease or useful life

Machinery and equipment

3–7 years

Office furniture and equipment

3–7 years

Computer hardware and software

3–7 years

Instruments placed with customers who are required to purchase a certain minimum volume
of consumables to receive title to the instrument are capitalized and depreciated over the shorter
of the useful life of the instrument or the minimum volume commitment period.

We capitalize interest on the acquisition and construction of significant assets that require
a substantial period of time to be made ready for use. The capitalized interest is included in the
cost of the completed asset and depreciated over the asset’s estimated useful life. In 2007, we
began the renovation and expansion of our primary facility in Westbrook, Maine. During the years
ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, we capitalized interest expense of $0.2 million, $1.0
million and $0.3 million, respectively, of which $0.1 million, $0.8 million and $0.2 million,
respectively, related to the Westbrook renovation and expansion project.

We capitalize certain costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining software
designated for internal use based on three distinct stages of development. Qualifying costs
incurred during the application development stage, which consist primarily of internal payroll,
direct fringe benefits and external direct project costs, including labor and travel, are
capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset.
Costs incurred during the preliminary project and post-implementation and operation phases are
expensed as incurred. These costs are general and administrative in nature and relate primarily to
data conversion, the determination of performance requirements and training. During the years ended
December 31, 2009 and 2008, we capitalized $11.0 million and $7.3 million, respectively, in costs
related to computer software developed for internal use.

(d) Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

A significant portion of the purchase price for acquired businesses is assigned to intangible
assets. Intangible assets other than goodwill are initially valued at fair value. If a market value
is not readily available, the fair value of the intangible asset is estimated based on discounted
cash flows using market participant assumptions, which are assumptions that are not specific to
IDEXX. The selection of appropriate valuation methodologies and the estimation of discounted cash
flows require significant assumptions about the timing and amounts of future cash flows, risks,
appropriate discount rates, and the useful lives of intangible assets. When material, we utilize
independent valuation experts to advise and assist us in allocating the purchase prices for
acquired businesses to the fair values of the identified intangible assets and in determining
appropriate amortization methods and periods for those intangible assets. Goodwill is initially
valued based on the excess of the purchase price of a business combination over the fair values of
acquired net assets, including intangible assets.

F-9


We provide for amortization using the straight-line and accelerated methods by charges to
income in amounts that allocate the intangible assets over their estimated useful lives as follows:

Asset Classification

Estimated Useful Life

Patents

7–15 years

Other product rights

5–15 years

Customer-related intangible assets

7–15 years

Other, primarily noncompete agreements

3–9 years

We assess goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or
circumstances indicate an impairment may exist. For impairment testing, the fair values of the
reporting units that include goodwill are estimated using an income approach by developing
discounted cash flow models. Model assumptions are based on our projections and best estimates,
using appropriate and customary market participant assumptions. Changes in forecasted cash flows or
the discount rate would affect the estimated fair values of reporting units and could result in a
goodwill impairment charge in a future period. No goodwill impairments were identified as a result
of the annual or event-driven reviews during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 or 2007.

We assess the realizability of intangible assets other than goodwill whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. If an impairment
review is triggered, we evaluate the carrying value of intangible assets based on estimated
undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the assets and compare that value
to the carrying value of the assets. The cash flows that are used contain our best estimates, using
appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time. See Note 8 for further
information.

(e) Warranty Reserves

We provide for the estimated cost of instrument warranties in cost of product revenue at the
time revenue is recognized based on the estimated cost to repair the instrument over its warranty
period. As we develop and sell new instruments, our provision for warranty expense increases. Cost
of revenue reflects not only estimated warranty expense for the systems sold in the current period,
but also any changes in estimated warranty expense for the installed base that results from our
quarterly evaluation of service experience. Our actual warranty obligation is affected by
instrument performance in the customers’ environment and costs incurred in servicing instruments.
Should actual service rates or costs differ from our estimates, which are based on historical data
and projections of future costs, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required.

Following is a summary of changes in accrued warranty reserve for products sold to customers
for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008

(f) Income Taxes

We recognize a current tax liability or asset for current taxes payable or refundable,
respectively, and a deferred tax liability or asset, as the case may be, for the estimated future
tax effects of temporary differences between book and tax treatment of assets and liabilities and
carryforwards to the extent they are realizable. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our
deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. While we consider
future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the
need for a valuation allowance, in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize
our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, a reduction of the
valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made. Likewise,
should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset
in the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period
such determination was made.

F-10


We use a comprehensive model for the recognition, measurement, and financial statement
disclosure of uncertain tax positions. Unrecognized tax benefits are the differences between tax
positions taken, or expected to be taken, in tax returns, and the benefits recognized for
accounting purposes.

Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and
our income tax filings are regularly under audit by tax authorities. Any audit result differing
from amounts recorded would increase or decrease income in the period that we determine such
adjustment is likely. Interest expense and penalties associated with the underpayment of income
taxes are included in income tax expense. See Note 10 for additional information regarding income
taxes.

(g) Sales and Value Added Taxes

We calculate, collect from our customers, and remit to governmental authorities sales, value
added and excise taxes assessed by governmental authorities in connection with revenue-producing
transactions with our customers. We report these taxes on a net basis and do not include these tax
amounts in revenue or cost of revenue.

(h) Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenue when four criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence that an arrangement
exists; (ii) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; (iii) the sales price is fixed
or determinable; and (iv) collectibility is reasonably assured. Revenue-generating transactions
generally fall into one of the following categories of revenue recognition:

•

We recognize revenue at the time of shipment to U.S. distributors for substantially
all products sold through distributors as title and risk of loss pass to these
customers on delivery to the common carrier. Our distributors do not have the right to
return products. We recognize revenue for the remainder of our customers when the
product is delivered to the customer except as noted below.

•

We recognize revenue from the sales of instruments, noncancelable software licenses
and hardware systems upon installation (and completion of training if applicable) and
the customer’s acceptance of the instrument or system because at this time we have no
significant further obligations.

•

We recognize service revenue at the time the service is performed.

•

We recognize revenue associated with extended maintenance agreements (“EMA”) over
the life of the contracts using the straight-line method, which approximates the
expected timing in which applicable services are performed. Amounts collected in
advance of revenue recognition are recorded as a current or long-term liability based
on the time from the balance sheet date to the future date of revenue recognition.

•

We recognize revenue on certain instrument systems under rental programs over the
life of the rental agreement using the straight-line method. Amounts collected in
advance of revenue recognition are recorded as a current or long-term liability based
on the time from the balance sheet date to the future date of revenue recognition.

•

We recognize revenue on certain instruments and practice information management
systems sales, where the product includes software that is considered more than
incidental to the utility and value of the product, either by allocating the revenue to
each element of the sale based on relative fair values of the elements including
post-contract support when fair value for all elements is available or by use of the
residual method when only the fair value of the post-contract support is available. We
recognize revenue for the instrument or system on installation and customer acceptance
and recognize revenue equal to the fair value of the post-contract support over the
support period.

•

Shipping costs reimbursed by the customer are included in revenue.

Multiple element arrangements

. When multiple products and/or services are sold
together, we generally allocate the total consideration received amongst the elements based on
their relative fair values, which is determined by amounts charged separately for the delivered and
undelivered elements to other customers. When there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair
value of the undelivered elements but no such evidence for the delivered elements, the fair value
of the undelivered elements is deferred and the residual revenue is allocated to the delivered
elements. The delivered elements are recognized as revenue when appropriate under the policies
described
above. If there is not sufficient evidence of the fair value of the undelivered elements, no
revenue is allocated to the delivered elements and the total consideration received is deferred
until delivery of those elements for which objective and reliable evidence of the fair value is not
available. We separately price EMA’s sold to customers. When an EMA is sold as a component of a
multi-product sale, we recognize revenue related to the EMA at the stated contractual price on a
straight-line basis over the life of the agreement.

F-11


Customer programs

. We record estimated reductions to revenue in connection with
customer marketing programs and incentive offerings that may give customers rebates or award
points, or provide other incentives. Award points granted under our IDEXX Points customer programs
may be applied to trade receivables owed to us and/or toward future purchases of our products or
services. We establish accruals for estimated revenue reductions attributable to customer programs
and incentive offerings for each program. Revenue reductions are recorded quarterly based on
issuance of credits, points earned but not yet issued, and estimates of credits and points to be
earned in the future based on current revenue. As points are redeemed we recognize the benefit of
points expected to expire, or breakage, using historical forfeiture rates. On November 30 of each
year, unused points granted before January 1 of the prior year expire and any variance from the
breakage estimate is accounted for as a change in estimate.

Within our overall IDEXX Points program, our two most significant customer programs are
Practice Developer

®

and SNAP

®

up the Savings

™

(“SUTS”), both of
which are offered only to North American customers. Our Practice Developer

®

program is a
CAG awards program that permits customers to earn points by purchasing quarterly minimums in
certain product and service categories, including IDEXX Reference Laboratories services, Catalyst
Dx

®

and VetTest

®

slides, VetTest

®

SNAP

®

Reader
reagents, LaserCyte

®

and VetAutoread

™

tubes, Feline and Canine
SNAP

®

tests, and service and maintenance agreements. For the Practice
Developer

®

program, the accrued revenue reduction is calculated each quarter based on
sales to end users during the quarter by either us or our distributors and on our estimate of
future points to be issued upon sale of applicable product inventories held by distributors at the
end of the quarter. At the end of 2009, we modified the Practice Developer

®

program to
exclude sales of rapid assay test products, and in 2010 we will be replacing the program with more
specific customer programs. Accrued revenue reductions under the Practice Developer

®

program will continue for purchases made by customers with program agreements in place at the time
of the change. SUTS is our volume incentive program for selected SNAP

®

tests that
provides customers with benefits in the form of (1) discounts off invoice at the time of purchase
and (2) points under the IDEXX Points program awarded and paid out quarterly throughout the SUTS
program year (which ends on August 31) based on total purchase volume of qualified SNAP

®

products during the given quarter.

Doubtful accounts receivable

. We recognize revenue only in those situations where
collection from the customer is reasonably assured. We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts
for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. We
base our estimates on detailed analysis of specific customer situations and a percentage of our
accounts receivable by aging category. If the financial condition of our customers were to
deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances
might be required. Account balances are charged off against the allowance when we believe the
receivable will not be recovered.

(i) Research and Development Costs

Research and development costs, which consist of salaries, employee benefits, materials and
consulting costs, are expensed as incurred. We evaluate our software research and development costs
for capitalization after the technological feasibility of software and products containing software
has been established. No costs were capitalized during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 or
2007.

(j) Advertising Costs

Advertising costs, which are recognized as sales and marketing expense in the period in which
they are incurred, were $1.1 million, $1.4 million and $1.9 million for the years ended December
31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

(k) Share-Based Compensation

We value all share-based compensation to employees, including grants of stock options, at fair
value on the date of grant and recognize expense over the requisite service period (generally the
vesting period). Effective January 1, 2006, under the modified prospective method, share-based
compensation expense includes expense for
unvested awards at December 31, 2005 and all awards granted subsequent to December 31, 2005.
Share-based compensation expense for the unvested awards outstanding at December 31, 2005 is based
on the grant-date fair value previously calculated in developing the pro forma disclosures required
prior to January 1, 2006. The graded vesting, or accelerated, method has been used to record the
expense for stock options granted prior to January 1, 2006. The straight-line method is used to
record the expense for stock options and awards granted subsequent to December 31, 2005.

F-12


Our share-based employee compensation programs allow for the grant of a mix of restricted
stock units and stock options, along with employee stock purchase rights. In addition, our Director
Deferred Compensation Plan and our Executive Deferred Compensation Plan allow for the grant of
deferred stock units, which may or may not have vesting conditions depending on the plan under
which these deferred stock units were issued. See Note 5 for additional information. There were no
modifications to the terms of outstanding options, restricted stock units or deferred stock units
during 2009, 2008 or 2007.

We issue shares of common stock to satisfy option and employee stock purchase right exercises
and to settle restricted stock units and deferred stock units.

(l) Foreign Currency Translation

The functional currency of most of our subsidiaries is their local currency. Assets and
liabilities of these foreign subsidiaries are translated using the exchange rate in effect at the
balance sheet date. Revenue and expense accounts are translated using the exchange rate at which
those elements are recognized and where it is impractical to do so, a weighted average of exchange
rates in effect during the period is used to translate those elements. Cumulative translation gains
and losses are shown in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as a separate component of
accumulated other comprehensive income. For one of our subsidiaries located in the Netherlands, the
functional currency is the U.S. Dollar. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency
other than a subsidiary’s respective functional currency are remeasured using the current exchange
rate at the balance sheet date (“remeasurement”); revenues and expenses are recorded at the current
exchange rate when the transaction is recognized. Exchange gains and losses arising from
remeasurement are included in operating expenses. Included in general and administrative expenses
are aggregate foreign exchange currency transaction and remeasurement gains of $0.5 million, $0.1
million, and $0.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

(m) Derivative Instruments and Hedging

We recognize all derivatives, including forward currency exchange contracts and interest rate
swap agreements, on the balance sheet at fair value at the balance sheet date. Derivatives that are
not hedges must be recorded at fair value through earnings. If a derivative is a hedge, depending
on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative are either offset against
the change in fair value of the hedged item through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive
income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We immediately record in earnings the
extent to which a hedge is not effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value. See Note 15
for additional information.

(n) Disclosure of Fair Value of Financial Instruments and Concentration of Risk

Financial instruments consist mainly of cash and cash equivalents, investments, accounts
receivable, derivative instruments, interest rate swap agreements, accounts payable, lines of
credit, and notes payable. Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of
credit risk are principally cash, cash equivalents, investments and accounts receivable. We place
our investments in highly-rated financial institutions and money market funds invested in
government securities. Concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is limited
to certain customers to whom we make substantial sales. To reduce risk, we routinely assess the
financial strength of our customers and closely monitor their amounts due to us and, as a
consequence, believe that our accounts receivable credit risk exposure is limited. We maintain an
allowance for doubtful accounts, but historically have not experienced any significant losses
related to an individual customer or group of customers in any particular industry or geographic
area. The carrying amounts of our financial instruments, other than long-term debt, approximate
fair market value because of the short maturity of those instruments. The carrying amount of our
long-term debt approximates fair market value based on current market prices for similar debt
issues with similar remaining maturities. See Note 9 for a discussion of interest rate risk
regarding our revolving credit facility, Note 13 for further discussion of concentration of credit
risk of accounts receivable, Note 14 for discussion of fair value measurements and Note 15 for a
discussion of our derivative instruments and hedging activities.

F-13


We currently purchase many products and materials from single sources or a limited number of
sources. Some of the products that we purchase from these sources are proprietary, and, therefore,
cannot be readily or easily replaced by alternative sources. If we are unable to obtain adequate
quantities of these products in the future, we could face cost increases or reductions, or delays
or discontinuations in product shipments, which could have a material adverse effect on our results
of operations.

(o) Comprehensive Income

We report all changes in equity during a period resulting from net income and transactions or
other events and circumstances from non-owner sources in a financial statement for the period in
which they are recognized. We have chosen to disclose comprehensive income, which encompasses net
income, foreign currency translation adjustments and the difference between the cost and the fair
market value of investments in debt and equity securities, foreign exchange contracts, and interest
rate swap agreements, in the consolidated statement of stockholders’ equity. We consider the
foreign currency cumulative translation adjustment to be permanently invested and, therefore, have
not provided income taxes on those amounts.

Accumulated other comprehensive income consisted of the following at December 31, 2009 and
2008, respectively

(p) Recent Accounting Pronouncements

On January 1, 2009, the principles and requirements for how an acquirer of a business
recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the
liabilities assumed, any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired were
revised. Disclosure requirements were also established, which will enable financial statement users
to evaluate the nature and financial effects of business combinations. Among other things, the
amendments to the accounting principles and requirements expand the definitions of a business and
business combination, require recognition of contingent consideration at fair value on the
acquisition date and require acquisition-related transaction costs to be expensed as incurred. See
Note 4 for a discussion of our business combination activity.

On January 1, 2009, we adopted the fair value measurements and disclosures provisions for
nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, which were previously deferred. These provisions
establish a framework for measuring fair value and expand financial statement disclosures about
fair value measurements. Items to which these provisions apply include nonrecurring fair value
measurements of nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, or recurring fair value
measurements of nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, which are not disclosed at fair
value in the consolidated financial statements. We did not have significant nonfinancial assets or
nonfinancial liabilities covered by these provisions which required remeasurement upon adoption or
during the year ended December 31, 2009, and therefore there was no impact of adoption on our
financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

On January 1, 2009, we adopted the accounting standard for ownership interests in subsidiaries
held by parties other than the parent, which establishes accounting for the amount of consolidated
net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest, changes in a parent’s
ownership interest and the valuation of retained noncontrolling equity investments when a
subsidiary is deconsolidated. This accounting standard also establishes reporting requirements that
provide enhanced disclosures that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the
parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners. The impact of adopting this accounting
standard on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows was not significant.

On January 1, 2009, we adopted amendments to the accounting standard addressing derivatives
and hedging. The amendments change the disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and
hedging activities, requiring enhanced disclosures about how and why an entity uses derivative
instruments, how instruments are accounted for under U.S. GAAP, and how derivatives and hedging
activities affect an entity’s financial position,
financial performance and cash flows. The adoption of these amendments required additional
disclosure only, and therefore did not have an impact on our financial position, results of
operations, or cash flows. See Note 15 for a discussion of our derivative instruments and hedging
activities.

F-14


On January 1, 2009, we adopted amendments to the accounting standard addressing intangibles,
goodwill and other assets. The amendments provided new guidance to improve the consistency between
the useful life of a recognized intangible asset and the period of expected cash flows used to
measure the fair value of the asset under U.S. GAAP. The adoption of these amendments did not have
a significant impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. See Note 4
for a discussion of our business combination activities and Note 8 for a discussion of our
intangible assets.

On June 30, 2009, we adopted amendments to the accounting standard for financial instruments.
The amendments require disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments in interim as well
as in annual financial statements. The adoption of these amendments has resulted in additional
disclosures only in our interim financial statements, and therefore did not impact our financial
position, results of operations or cash flows. See Note 9 for the carrying amount of our long-term
debt and for a discussion of interest rate risk regarding our revolving credit facility, Note 14
for discussion of fair value measurements, and Note 15 for a discussion of our derivative
instruments and hedging activities.

On June 30, 2009, we adopted amendments to the accounting standard addressing subsequent
events. The amendments provide guidance to establish general standards of accounting for and
disclosures of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are
issued or are available to be issued. The amendments require entities to disclose the date through
which subsequent events were evaluated as well as the rationale for why that date was selected.
This disclosure should alert all users of financial statements that an entity has not evaluated
subsequent events after that date in the set of financial statements being presented. The
amendments required additional disclosures only, and therefore did not have an impact on our
financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. We have evaluated subsequent events
through February 19, 2010, the date we have issued this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

In September 2009, authoritative literature was issued that modifies the revenue recognition
guidance for establishing separate units of accounting in a multiple element arrangement and
requires the allocation of arrangement consideration to each deliverable in the arrangement based
on relative selling price of the elements. The selling price for each deliverable is based on
vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”) if available, third-party evidence (“TPE”) if VSOE is
not available, or best estimate of selling price (“BESP”) if neither VSOE nor TPE is available.
BESP must be determined in a manner that is consistent with that used to determine the price to
sell the specific elements on a standalone basis. Disclosure requirements related to
multiple-element revenue arrangements will be significantly expanded under the modified accounting
guidance. The revised accounting guidance becomes effective for IDEXX on January 1, 2011; however,
early adoption is permitted. We have made the election to adopt these changes as of January 1,
2010. Adoption of the revisions to the authoritative guidance will not have a significant impact on
our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

In September 2009, authoritative literature was issued that modifies the revenue recognition
guidance for determining how to recognize revenue for the sale of tangible products that contain
software that is more than incidental to the functionality of the product as a whole. More
specifically, the revised accounting guidance indicates that when a product has tangible and
software components that function together to deliver the essential functionality of the product as
a whole, that product should be excluded from the scope of software revenue accounting guidance, as
opposed to the existing accounting guidance where such an instrument would be subject to the rules
detailed in the software revenue guidance. The revised accounting guidance becomes effective for
IDEXX on January 1, 2011; however, early adoption is permitted. We have made the election to adopt
these changes as of January 1, 2010. Adoption of these revisions to the authoritative guidance will
not have a significant impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

NOTE 4. ACQUISITION OF BUSINESSES AND OTHER ASSETS

We paid $8.4 million to acquire businesses and certain intangible assets that did not comprise
businesses during the year ended December 31, 2009. In relation to these acquisitions, we
recognized tangible assets of $1.0 million and assumed liabilities of $0.5 million.

F-15


In August 2009, we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of
VDIC, Inc. (“VDIC”). VDIC is located in Oregon and is a global provider of telemedicine and
cytopathology services and also
provides imaging procedures, such as MRI and CT scans, on a referral basis for clients within
the Oregon area. In August 2009, we also acquired certain assets of Pet Detect. Pet Detect engages
in the marketing, distributing and selling of temporary pet identification systems based on tear-
and humidity-resistant printable pet collars. The main application for these collars is in
veterinary practices with boarding and overnight stay facilities, as well as in kennels. These
acquisitions were accounted for as business combinations. In connection with these acquisitions we
recognized software with a fair value of $2.5 million, which was recorded to property and equipment
and assigned a useful life of 7 years; amortizable intangible assets of $2.6 million; and goodwill
of $2.3 million. The amortizable intangible assets consisted of customer-related intangible assets
of $1.6 million, product rights of $0.7 million, and other intangible assets of $0.3 million, all
of which were assigned to the CAG segment, with weighted amortization periods of 12 years, 7 years
and 5 years, respectively. Additionally, we recognized an amortizable intangible asset for product
rights of $0.5 million, which was assigned to the PAS segment. The goodwill recognized (all of
which is expected to be tax deductible) was assigned to the CAG segment.

We paid $6.8 million in cash to acquire a business and, under separate transactions, to
acquire certain intangible assets that did not comprise businesses during the year ended December
31, 2008 and recognized liabilities of $0.3 million, of which $0.1 million was paid in 2008. In
addition, we agreed to pay up to $7.5 million in cash in the future upon achievement of certain
revenue and other milestones, which will be accrued and recorded as additional intangible assets if
and when we determine that it is probable that the milestones will be achieved.

In January 2008, we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities
of VetLab Laboratorio Veterinario de Referencia, S.L. (“VetLab S.L.”). With operations in
Barcelona, Spain, VetLab S.L. is a provider of reference laboratory testing services to
veterinarians. During the year ended December 31, 2008 we also acquired certain intellectual
property and distribution rights associated with a diagnostic test product. We also made purchase
price payments of $1.7 million related to the achievement of milestones realized by certain
businesses acquired in prior years, of which $1.5 million was previously accrued. In connection
with these acquisitions, we recognized amortizable intangible assets of $6.4 million and goodwill
of $0.4 million. The amortizable intangible assets consisted of customer-related intangible assets
of $1.4 million, product rights of $4.8 million, and other intangible assets of $0.2 million, all
of which were assigned to the CAG segment, with weighted amortization periods of 15 years, 10 years
and 3 years, respectively. The goodwill recognized (all of which is expected to be tax deductible)
was assigned to the CAG segment.

We paid $86.6 million and recognized liabilities, including contingent liabilities and
deferred tax liabilities associated with purchase accounting, of $17.9 million to acquire
businesses and certain intangible assets that did not comprise businesses during the year ended
December 31, 2007.

In January 2007, we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities
of the Critical Care Division of Osmetech plc., which we now refer to as OPTI Medical. The acquired
business is based in the United States and develops, designs, manufactures, and distributes
point-of-care electrolyte and blood gas analyzers and related consumable products for the human
medical and veterinary diagnostics markets. In March 2007, we acquired all of the equity of
Vita-Tech Canada Inc. (“Vita-Tech”) and Institut Pourquier SAS (“Pourquier”) in separate
transactions. Prior to the acquisition, Vita-Tech was the largest provider of reference laboratory
testing services to veterinarians in Canada with operations in Toronto and Montreal, Canada.
Pourquier is based in Montpellier, France and develops, designs, manufactures, and distributes
production animal diagnostic products. In March and October 2007, we acquired veterinary reference
laboratories located in the United States. We also acquired certain assets of other veterinary
reference laboratories during the year ended December 31, 2007 that did not comprise businesses.
During the year ended December 31, 2007, we also made purchase price payments of $3.2 million
related to the achievement of milestones by certain businesses acquired in prior years. In
connection with the 2007 acquisitions we recognized amortizable intangible assets of $38.9 million
and goodwill of $45.2 million (of which $27.5 million is expected to be tax deductible). The
amortizable intangible assets consisted of customer-related intangible assets of $26.4 million,
product rights of $9.9 million, and other intangible assets of $2.6 million, all of which were
assigned to the CAG segment, with weighted amortization periods of 12 years, 13 years and 6 years,
respectively.

We believe that the acquired businesses enhance our existing businesses by either expanding
the geographic range of our existing businesses or expanding our existing product lines. We
determined the purchase price of each acquired business based on our assessment of estimated future
cash flows attributable to the business enterprise taken as a whole, the strength of the business
in the marketplace, the strategic importance of the acquisition to IDEXX, and the seller’s desire
to be acquired by IDEXX versus perceived alternatives. We recognized goodwill based on the excess
of the purchase price for each business over the fair values of the individual tangible and
separately identified intangible assets acquired.

F-16


The results of operations of the acquired businesses have been included since their respective
acquisition dates. Pro forma information has not been presented because such information is not
material to the financial statements taken as a whole.

Expense for deferred stock units that do not have vesting conditions issued under our
Director Deferred Compensation Plan of $0.2 million, $0.3 million and $0.2 million for the years
ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, has been excluded from share-based
compensation in the table above as it relates to deferred stock units granted in lieu of cash
compensation.

Additionally, share-based compensation expense is reduced for an estimate of the number of
awards that are expected to be forfeited. We use historical data and other factors to estimate
employee termination behavior and to evaluate whether particular groups of employees have
significantly different forfeiture behaviors.

Share-based compensation costs are classified in cost of revenue and operating expenses
consistently with the classification of cash compensation paid to the employees receiving such
share-based compensation. Capitalized share-based employee compensation cost was $0.4 million at
December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, which was included in inventory on the consolidated balance
sheets.

The fair value of options, restricted stock units, deferred stock units with vesting
conditions, and employee stock purchase rights awarded during the years ended December 31, 2009,
2008 and 2007 totaled $16.0 million, $18.7 million and $18.2 million, respectively. The total
unrecognized compensation cost for unvested share-based compensation awards outstanding at December
31, 2009, before consideration of estimated forfeitures, was $33.0 million. We estimate that this
cost will be reduced by approximately $3.4 million related to forfeitures. The weighted average
remaining expense recognition period is approximately 1.6 years.

Stock Incentive Plan

During 2009, our board of directors and our stockholders approved the 2009 Stock Incentive
Plan, as amended (the “2009 Stock Plan”) pursuant to which our employees and directors may receive
various types of share-based incentives, including stock options, restricted stock units, stock
appreciation rights and deferred stock units. Any shares that are subject to awards of options or
stock appreciation rights will be counted against the share limit as one share for every share
granted. Any shares that are subject to other awards, such as restricted stock units, will be
counted against the share limit as 2.0 shares for every share granted. A total of 5,200,000 shares
of common stock are authorized for issuance under the 2009 Stock Plan. If any options granted under
our prior plans, including the 1991 Stock Option Plan, the 1998 Stock Incentive Plan, the 2000
Director Option Plan, or the 2003 Stock Plan terminate, expire or are forfeited without having been
exercised in full, the shares subject to such unexercised options are available for issuance under
the 2009 Stock Plan. Options granted under the 2009 Stock Plan and prior plans may not be granted
at an exercise price less than the fair market value of the common stock on the date granted (or
less than 110% of the fair market value in the case of incentive stock options granted to holders
of more than 10% of our Common Stock). Options may not be granted for a term of more than seven
years. The vesting schedule of all options granted under the 2009 Stock Plan is determined by the
compensation committee of our board of directors at the time of grant. At December 31, 2009, a
remaining total of 4,223,000 shares of common stock was authorized by our shareholders and
available for future grants of share-based compensation.

Options

Option awards are granted to employees with an exercise price equal to not less than the
closing market price of our common stock at the date of grant and generally vest ratably over five
years on each anniversary of the date of grant, conditional on continuous service. Options granted
to non-employee directors vest fully on the first anniversary of the date of grant. Options granted
to both employees and non-employee directors have a contractual term of seven years. Upon any
change in control of the company, 25% of the unvested stock options then outstanding will vest and
become exercisable. However, if the acquiring entity does not assume outstanding options, then all
options will vest immediately prior to the change in control.

We use the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model to determine the fair value of options
granted. Option-pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, particularly for
the expected stock price volatility. Changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially
affect the fair value estimate. Our expected stock price volatility assumptions are based on the
historical volatility of our stock for the expected term and other relevant factors. The risk-free
interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yields for the expected term in effect at the
approximate date of grant. We have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we have no
present intention to pay a dividend; therefore, we assumed that no dividends will be paid over the
expected terms of option awards.

The use of the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model, the general methods employed to
develop the above described option valuation assumptions, and the vesting conditions of option
awards are consistent with prior periods. Prior to January 2008, we elected to use the simplified
method, which is based on vesting and contractual terms, to develop the expected term assumption
for option awards. Beginning in January 2008, we have derived the expected term assumption for
options based on historical experience and other relevant factors concerning expected employee
behavior with regard to option exercise.

F-18


We determine the assumptions used in the valuation of option grants as of the date of grant.
Differences in the stock price volatility, terms of options granted to different segments of
employees, or risk-free interest rates may necessitate distinct valuation assumptions at those
grant dates. As such, we may use different assumptions during the fiscal year if we grant options
at different dates or with varying terms. The weighted average of each of the valuation assumptions
used to determine the fair value of each option grant on the date of grant and the weighted average
estimated fair values were as follows:

Intrinsic value represents the amount by which the market price of the common stock
exceeded the exercise price of the options, before applicable income taxes. During the years ended
December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 the total intrinsic value of stock options exercised was $22.1
million, $25.4 million and $38.9 million, respectively.

The total fair value of options vested during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007
was $9.8 million, $11.3 million and $12.6 million, respectively.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

During 1997, our board of directors approved the 1997 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, under
which we reserved and may issue up to an aggregate of 1,240,000 shares of Common Stock in periodic
offerings. Under the plan, stock is sold at 85% of the closing price of the stock on the last day
of each three-month plan period. The fair value of purchase rights under the program equals the 15%
discount from the market price at the exercise date, which is the last day of the subscription
period.

Restricted and Other Deferred Stock Units With Vesting Conditions

Restricted stock unit awards to employees either vest ratably over five years on each
anniversary of the date of grant, or on the third anniversary of the date of grant, depending on
the employee group receiving the award. Vesting is conditioned on continuous service. Restricted
stock units are converted to an equivalent number of shares of common stock upon vesting. Upon any
change in control of the company, 25% of the unvested restricted stock units then outstanding under
the 2009 Stock Incentive Plan will vest, provided, however, that if the acquiring entity does not
assume the restricted stock units, then all such units will vest immediately prior to the change in
control. Deferred stock units with vesting conditions awarded to non-employee directors under the
Director Deferred Compensation Plan vest fully on the first anniversary of the date of grant.
Except upon a change in control, as defined in the Director Deferred Compensation Plan, or certain
limited circumstances, all deferred stock units will be exchanged for an equivalent number of
shares of common stock one year following a director’s resignation or retirement. Upon a change in
control, unvested deferred stock units vest immediately.

The fair values of restricted and deferred stock units with vesting conditions are based on
the closing sale price of the common stock on the date of grant. The weighted average fair value
per unit of restricted stock units granted during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007
was $34.87, $55.70 and $42.65, respectively. The weighted average fair value per unit of deferred
stock units with vesting conditions granted during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007
was $34.37, $56.95 and $41.94, respectively.

Deferred Stock Units With No Vesting Conditions

Under our Director Deferred Compensation Plan, non-employee directors also may defer a portion
of their cash fees in the form of vested deferred stock units, each of which represents the right
to receive one unissued share of our common stock. Directors receive a number of deferred stock
units equal to the amount of cash fees deferred divided by the closing sale price of the common
stock on the date of deferral. Under our Executive Deferred Compensation Plan (the “Executive
Plan”), certain members of our management may elect to defer a portion of their cash compensation
in deferred stock units. These deferred stock units will be exchanged for a fixed number of shares
of common stock, subject to the limitations of the Executive Plan and applicable law. Except upon a
change in control, as defined in the Director Deferred Compensation Plan and the Executive Plan, or
certain other limited circumstances, directors and officers may not receive shares of common stock
in settlement of deferred stock units earlier than one year following their resignation from the
board or termination of their employment, respectively.

During the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company issued approximately
11,000, 10,000 and 8,000 deferred stock units valued at $0.4 million, $0.5 million and $0.7
million, respectively.

During the year ended December 31, 2009, approximately 900 shares of common stock were issued
to settle deferred stock units.

materials inventory of $9.1 million associated with Navigator

®

. This write-down is
included in cost of product revenue in the consolidated statement of income. Our analysis of the
realizability of the inventory was triggered upon our receipt of notice from the third-party
contract manufacturer of finished goods that it would discontinue manufacturing the product in
2009. Because of the low production volume of Navigator

®

, we believed that we would not
be able to enter into a replacement manufacturing arrangement on economically feasible terms, and
therefore we would not be able to obtain the product after termination of the existing
manufacturing arrangement. Accordingly, we evaluated our associated inventory for obsolescence
based on our changed estimates of product availability and estimated future demand and market
conditions. This inventory comprised $9.1 million of active ingredient and other raw materials, for
which we recognized a full write-down during 2007.

See Note 4 for a discussion of amortizable intangible assets recognized during the years ended
December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007.

During 2009, we recognized an impairment charge of $1.5 million to write off an acquired
intangible asset, classified as a product right, associated with our equine digital radiography
business, which is part of our CAG segment. Based on changes in estimated future demand and market
conditions, we determined that we would not fully realize our investment and, therefore, fully
expensed this asset.

During 2007, we recognized an impairment charge to write off a prepaid royalty license of $1.0
million associated with Navigator

®

paste. We also recognized a related inventory
write-down and the circumstances are described in Note 6. Based on our changed estimates of product
availability and estimated future demand and market conditions, we determined that we would not
realize our investment in prepaid royalties and, therefore, fully expensed this asset.

The remaining change in the cost of intangible assets other than goodwill during the years
ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 resulted primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange
rates.

$0.2 million related to business acquisitions prior to 2008, which was assigned to the CAG segment.

In connection with the sale of certain of our pharmaceutical product lines in the fourth
quarter of 2008, we allocated $7.2 million of goodwill to the pharmaceutical product lines sold
based on their relative fair values. In addition, due to the restructuring of the remaining
pharmaceutical product lines, goodwill of $6.5 million related to the pharmaceutical product lines
retained was realigned to the Other segment. See Note 19 for additional information.

The remaining changes in the cost of goodwill during the years ended December 31, 2009 and
2008 resulted primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

NOTE 9. DEBT

At December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had $118.8 million and $150.6 million, respectively,
outstanding under our unsecured short-term revolving credit facility (“Credit Facility”) with a
weighted average interest rate of 0.8% and 2.3%, respectively. Of the total amount outstanding at
December 31, 2009 and 2008, $4.8 million and $6.6 million, respectively, was borrowed by our
Canadian subsidiary and denominated in Canadian dollars. The entire balance due under our Credit
Facility is shown in the current liabilities section in the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets because the Credit Facility agreement contains a subjective material adverse event clause,
which allows the debt holders to call the loans under the Credit Facility if we fail to notify the
debt holder of such an event. At September 30, 2009 and June 30, 2009 we had classified $80 million
of the amount outstanding under the line of credit as long-term. Based on an updated assessment of
the terms of the agreement and, more specifically, with regard to the subjective material adverse
event clause, we have corrected the classification of the balance previously shown in long-term
liabilities to the current liabilities section of the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31,
2009. Our availability under the Credit Facility was further reduced at December 31, 2009 by $1.0
million for a letter of credit issued related to our workers’ compensation policy covering claims
for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2010. Applicable interest rates on borrowings under the
Credit Facility generally range from 0.375 to 0.875 percentage points (“Credit Spread”) above the
London interbank rate or the Canadian Dollar-denominated bankers’ acceptance rate, dependent on our
leverage ratio. Based on current market conditions, we believe that we could obtain an unsecured
short-term revolving credit facility similar to our current Credit Facility; however, that facility
would be at an interest rate that is approximately 2.25 percentage points higher than the interest
rate on our current Credit Facility. Based on this difference, the fair market value of the debt
would be approximately $950 thousand per $1 million of principal outstanding as of December 31,
2009, assuming the amounts outstanding at December 31, 2009 remained outstanding for the duration
of the Credit Facility. Under the Credit Facility, we pay quarterly commitment fees of 0.08% to
0.20%, dependent on our leverage ratio, on any unused commitment. The Credit Facility agreement
contains financial and other affirmative and negative covenants, as well as customary
events of default, that would allow any amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility to be
accelerated, or restrict our ability to borrow thereunder, in the event of noncompliance. The
financial covenant requires our ratio of debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, as defined by the agreement, not to exceed 3-to-1. At December 31, 2009, we were in
compliance with the covenants of the Credit Facility.

F-23


In March 2009, we entered into two forward fixed interest rate swap agreements to manage the
economic effect of variable interest obligations. See Note 15 for a discussion of our derivative
instruments and hedging activities.

In May 2006, we acquired our Westbrook, Maine facility and assumed the related mortgage that
had a face value of $6.5 million and stated interest rate of 9.875%. We recorded the mortgage at a
fair market value of $7.5 million, based on the effective market interest rate at that time. The
carrying amount of our long-term debt approximates fair market value based on current market prices
for similar debt issues with similar remaining maturities. The mortgage is payable in equal monthly
installments of approximately $0.1 million through May 1, 2015. Annual principal payments on
long-term debt at December 31, 2009 are as follows

Our effective income tax rate was 30.0% for the year ended December 31, 2009 and 31.7%
for the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease in tax rate is primarily due to the recognition
of tax benefits resulting from the expiration of certain statutes of limitations, settlement of an
audit in an international tax jurisdiction and the write-off of non-deductible goodwill related to
the pharmaceutical product lines sold in the fourth quarter of 2008. These benefits were partly
offset by a reduction in international deferred tax liabilities in 2008 due to a change in the
statutory tax rates for a jurisdiction in which we operate. This non-recurring benefit of
approximately $1.5 million reduced our effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31,
2008 by 0.9 percentage points.

Our effective income tax rate was 31.7% for the year ended December 31, 2008 and 30.3% for the
year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in tax rate is primarily attributable to several
non-recurring items. We wrote off non-deductible goodwill related to the pharmaceutical product
lines sold in the fourth quarter of 2008 and we recognized certain non-recurring items that
favorably impacted the tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2007, including the reduction of
deferred tax liabilities due to a change in international tax rate and the recognition of state tax
benefits resulting from the completion of an audit in 2007. These unfavorable items were partly
offset by tax benefits related to a reduction in international deferred tax liabilities in 2008 and
the 2007 reduction of deferred tax assets due to changes in statutory income tax rates for
jurisdictions in which we operate.

We utilize a comprehensive model for the recognition, measurement, and financial
statement disclosure of uncertain tax positions. Unrecognized tax benefits are the differences
between tax positions taken, or expected to be
taken, in tax returns, and the benefits recognized for accounting purposes. We classify
certain uncertain tax positions as long-term liabilities.

F-25


The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008 was
$5.4 million and $5.9 million, respectively. Of the total unrecognized tax benefits at December 31,
2009 and 2008, $4.7 million and $5.2 million, respectively, comprise unrecognized tax positions
that would, if recognized, affect our effective tax rate. The ultimate deductibility of the
remaining unrecognized tax positions is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the timing of
such deductibility. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting, other than interest and
penalties, the disallowance of the shorter deductibility period would not affect the annual
effective tax rate but would accelerate the payment of cash to the taxing authority to an earlier
period.

In the ordinary course of our business, our income tax filings are regularly under audit by
tax authorities. While we believe we have appropriately provided for all uncertain tax positions,
amounts asserted by taxing authorities could be greater or less than our accrued position.
Accordingly, additional provisions on income tax matters, or reductions of previously accrued
provisions, could be recorded in the future as we revise our estimates due to changing facts and
circumstances or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved. We are currently
undergoing tax examinations by various state tax authorities and we anticipate that these
examinations will be concluded within the next year. We are no longer subject to U.S. federal
examinations for tax years before 2006. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to income tax
examinations in any state and local, or international jurisdictions in which we conduct significant
taxable activities for years before 2003.

We recognize accrued estimated interest expense and penalties related to unrecognized tax
benefits in income tax expense. During the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, we
recorded interest expense and penalties of $0.3 million, $0.4 million and $0.7 million,
respectively, in our consolidated statement of income. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had $0.6
million and $0.8 million of estimated interest expense and penalties accrued in our consolidated
balance sheet.

The following table summarizes the changes in unrecognized tax benefits during the years ended
December 31, 2009 and 2008 (

In the next year, it is reasonably possible that we could recognize up to $1.5 million of
income tax benefits that have not been recognized at December 31, 2009. The income tax benefits are
primarily due to the lapse in the statutes of limitations for various U.S. and international tax
jurisdictions.

At December 31, 2009, we had net operating loss carryforwards in certain state and
international jurisdictions of approximately $56.0 million available to offset future taxable
income. Most of these net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates through 2020
and the remainder have indefinite lives. We have recorded a valuation allowance of $4.9 million
against certain deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards because
realizability is uncertain.

We consider certain operating earnings of non-United States subsidiaries to be indefinitely
invested outside the United States. The cumulative earnings of these subsidiaries were $194.0
million at December 31, 2009. No provision has been made for United States federal and state, or
international taxes that may result from future remittances of these undistributed earnings of
non-United States subsidiaries. Should we repatriate these earnings in the future, we would have to
adjust the income tax provision in the period in which the decision to repatriate earnings is made.
For the operating earnings not considered to be indefinitely invested outside the United States, we
have accrued taxes on a current basis.

F-26


NOTE 11. EARNINGS PER SHARE

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of
shares of common stock and vested deferred stock units outstanding during the year. The computation
of diluted earnings per share is similar to the computation of basic earnings per share, except
that the denominator is increased for the assumed exercise of dilutive options and other
potentially dilutive securities using the treasury stock method unless the effect is anti-dilutive.

The following is a reconciliation of shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per
share (

cash consideration, the number of shares of our common stock to be issued is fixed and issuance is
not contingent. See Note 5 for additional information regarding deferred compensation plans.

Certain options to acquire shares and restricted stock units have been excluded from the
calculation of shares outstanding for dilutive earnings per share because they were anti-dilutive.

NOTE 12. COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND GUARANTEES

We lease multiple facilities under operating leases that expire through 2021. In addition, we
are responsible for the real estate taxes and operating expenses related to these facilities. We
also have lease commitments for automobiles and office equipment. Rent expense charged to
operations under operating leases was approximately $14.7 million, $14.5 million and $10.9 million
for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

We purchase the slides sold for use in our Catalyst Dx

and
VetTest

®

Chemistry Analyzers under an agreement with Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, Inc.
that, at December 31, 2009, required us to purchase a minimum of $4.6 million of slides through
2010. We also have commitments under certain other agreements that commit us to aggregate future
payments of $6.3 million. In addition, we have various minimum royalty payments due through 2027 of
$6.9 million.

In connection with the acquisitions of businesses and intangible assets, we have commitments
outstanding at December 31, 2009 for additional purchase price payments of up to $7.7 million, of
which $0.2 million has been accrued, in connection with acquisitions of businesses and intangible
assets during the current and prior periods, all of which is contingent on the achievement by
certain acquired businesses of specified milestones.

Contingencies

We are subject to claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, including with respect
to actual and threatened litigation and other matters. We accrue contingent liabilities when it is
probable that future expenditures will be made and such expenditures can reasonably be estimated.
However, our actual losses with respect to these contingencies could exceed our accruals.

Under our workers’ compensation insurance policies for U.S. employees since January 1, 2003,
we have retained the first $250,000 in claim liability per incident and $2.7 million, $3.2 million,
and $2.8 million for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, in aggregate claim liability. The insurance
company provides insurance for claims above the individual occurrence and aggregate limits. We
estimate claim liability based on claims incurred and the estimated ultimate cost to settle the
claims. Based on this analysis, we have recognized cumulative expenses of $0.8 million, $0.9
million, and $0.3 million for claims incurred during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and
2007, respectively. Claims incurred during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 are
relatively undeveloped and significant additional healthcare and wage indemnification costs could
arise from those claims. Our liability for claims incurred during the years ended December 31, 2009
and 2008 could exceed our estimates and we could be liable for up to $1.9 million and $2.0 million,
respectively, in excess of the expense we have recognized. For the five years ended on or prior to
December 31, 2007, based on our retained claim liability per incident and our aggregate claim
liability, our maximum liability at December 31, 2009 is $0.8 million in excess of the amounts
deemed probable and previously recognized.

Under our current employee health care insurance policy, we retain claims liability risk up to
$250,000 per incident. We estimate our liability for the uninsured portion of employee health care
obligations that have been incurred but not reported based on individual coverage, our claims
experience, and the average time from when a claim is incurred to the time it is paid. We
recognized employee health care claim expense of $19.6 million, $18.5 million and $14.3 million
during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, which includes actual claims
paid and an estimate for our liability for the uninsured portion of employee health care
obligations that have been incurred but not paid. Should employee health insurance claims exceed
our estimated liability, we would have further obligations.

F-28


We have entered into employment agreements with two of our officers whereby payments may be
required if we terminate their employment without cause other than following a change in control.
The amounts payable are
based upon the executives’ salaries at the time of termination and the cost to us of
continuing to provide certain benefits. Had both of such officers been terminated at December 31,
2009, we would have had aggregate obligations for salaries and benefits of approximately $2.2
million under such agreements. One of these officers will retire from the Company in March 2010.
Had this officer retired on or prior to December 31, 2009, the total termination obligation would
have been reduced by $0.8 million. We have entered into employment agreements with each of our
officers that require us to make certain payments in the event the officer’s employment is
terminated under certain circumstances within a certain period following a change in control. The
amounts payable by us under these agreements is based on the officer’s salary and bonus history at
the time of termination and the cost to us of continuing to provide certain benefits. Had all of
our officers been terminated in qualifying terminations following a change in control at December
31, 2009, we would have had aggregate obligations of approximately $18.0 million under these
agreements. These agreements also provide for the acceleration of the vesting of all stock options
and restricted stock units upon any qualifying termination following a change in control.

From time to time, we have received notices alleging that our products infringe third-party
proprietary rights, although we are not aware of any pending litigation with respect to such
claims. Patent litigation frequently is complex and expensive, and the outcome of patent litigation
can be difficult to predict. There can be no assurance that we will prevail in any infringement
proceedings that may be commenced against us. If we lose any such litigation, we may be stopped
from selling certain products and/or we may be required to pay damages as a result of the
litigation.

Guarantees

We enter into agreements with third parties in the ordinary course of business under which we
are obligated to indemnify such third parties for and against various risks and losses. The precise
terms of such indemnities vary with the nature of the agreement. In many cases, we limit the
maximum amount of our indemnification obligations, but in some cases those obligations may be
theoretically unlimited. We have not incurred material expenses in discharging any of these
indemnification obligations, and based on our analysis of the nature of the risks involved, we
believe that the fair value of these agreements is minimal. Accordingly, we have recorded no
liabilities for these obligations at December 31, 2009 and 2008.

When acquiring a business, we sometimes assume liability for certain events or occurrences
that took place prior to the date of acquisition. However, we do not believe that we have any
probable pre-acquisition liabilities or guarantees that should be recognized at December 31, 2009
and 2008.

F-29


NOTE 13. SEGMENT REPORTING

Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial
information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision-maker, or
decision-making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Our
chief operating decision-maker is the Chief Executive Officer.

We are organized into business units by market and customer group. Our reportable segments
include: diagnostic and information technology products and services for the veterinary market,
which we refer to as our Companion Animal Group (“CAG”), water quality products (“Water”), and
products for production animal health, which we refer to as the Production Animal Segment (“PAS”).
We also operate two smaller operating segments that comprise products for dairy quality (“Dairy”)
and products for the human point-of-care medical diagnostic market (“OPTI Medical”). In connection
with the restructuring of our pharmaceutical division at the end of 2008, we realigned two of our
remaining product lines to the Rapid Assay line of business within our CAG segment, and realigned
the remainder of the products, which comprised one product line and two out-licensing arrangements,
to the “Other” category. Financial information about the Dairy and OPTI Medical operating segments
and other licensing arrangements are combined and presented in an “Other” category because they do
not meet the quantitative or qualitative thresholds for reportable segments.

CAG develops, designs, manufactures, and distributes products and performs services for
veterinarians, primarily related to diagnostics and information management. Water develops,
designs, manufactures and distributes products to detect contaminants in water. PAS develops,
designs, manufactures and distributes products to detect disease in production animals. Dairy
develops, designs, manufactures and distributes products to detect contaminants in dairy products.
OPTI Medical develops, designs, manufactures, and distributes point-of-care electrolyte and blood
gas analyzers and related consumable products for the human medical diagnostics market. Further,
OPTI Medical manufactures our VetStat

®

Electrolyte and Blood Gas Analyzer and
electrolyte consumables used with our Catalyst Dx

®

analyzer. The segment information for
the year ended December 31, 2007 has been restated to conform to our presentation of reportable
segments for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. Previously, financial information related
to the product lines realigned to Rapid Assay and the product line and out-licensing arrangement
realigned to Other were included in the pharmaceutical business and reported in our CAG segment.

Items that are not allocated to our operating segments are comprised primarily of corporate
research and development expenses that do not align with one of our existing business or service
categories, a portion of share-based compensation expense, interest income and expense, and income
taxes. We estimate our share-based compensation expense for the year and allocate the estimated
expense to the operating segments. This allocation differs from the actual expense and consequently
yields a difference between the total allocated share-based compensation expense and the actual
expense for the total company, resulting in an unallocated amount reported under the caption
“Unallocated Amounts.” We maintain active research and development programs, some of which may
materialize into the development and introduction of new technology, products or services. Research
and development costs incurred that are not specifically allocated to one of our existing business
or service categories are reported under the caption “Unallocated Amounts.”

F-30


The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in the
summary of significant accounting policies except that most interest income and expenses and income
taxes are not allocated to individual operating segments. Below is our segment information (

NOTE 14. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

U.S. GAAP defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid
to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset
or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. U.S.
GAAP also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of
observable inputs, where available, and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair
value.

There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:

Level 1

Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or
liabilities. At December 31, 2009, our Level 1 assets included
investments in money market funds and equity mutual funds related
to a deferred compensation plan assumed in a business combination.
The liability associated with this plan relates to deferred
compensation, which is indexed to the performance of the
underlying investments, and is included in our Level 1
liabilities.

Level 2

Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices
for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that
are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be
corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full
term of the assets or liabilities. At December 31, 2009, our Level
2 liabilities include foreign currency hedge contracts and
interest rate hedge contracts.

Level 3

Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market
activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets
or liabilities. At December 31, 2009, we had no Level 3 assets or
liabilities.

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified in their entirety based on the
lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the
significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment
and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. See Note 3(n) for an overview of our
accounting policy with regard to fair value measurements, Note 9 for the carrying amount of our
long-term debt and for a discussion of interest rate risk regarding our revolving credit facility
and Note 15 for a discussion of our derivative instruments and hedging activities. We did not have
any significant nonfinancial assets or nonfinancial liabilities which required remeasurement during
the year ended December 31, 2009 or 2008.

NOTE 15. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING

Disclosure within this footnote is presented to provide transparency about how and why we use
derivative instruments, how the instruments and related hedged items are accounted for, and how the
instruments and related hedged items affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash
flows. Derivative instruments are recognized on the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities
at fair value with a corresponding offset to other comprehensive income, which is net of tax.

We are exposed to certain risks related to our ongoing business operations. The primary risks
that we manage by using derivative instruments are foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate
risk. Our subsidiaries enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to manage the exchange risk
associated with their forecasted intercompany inventory purchases for the next year. From time to
time, we may also enter into foreign currency
exchange contracts to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations associated with
specific, significant transactions. Interest rate swaps are entered into to manage interest rate
risk associated with $80 million of our variable-rate debt.

F-34


The primary purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to protect against the
volatility associated with foreign currency transactions. We also utilize natural hedges to
mitigate our transaction and commitment exposures. Our corporate policy prescribes the range of
allowable hedging activity. We enter into exchange contracts with large multinational financial
institutions and we do not hold or engage in transactions involving derivative instruments for
purposes other than risk management. Our accounting policies for these contracts are based on our
designation of such instruments as hedging transactions. Market gains and losses are deferred in
other current or long-term assets or accruals, as appropriate, until the contract matures, which is
the period when the related obligation is settled. We primarily utilize forward exchange contracts
with durations of less than 24 months.

Cash Flow Hedges

We have designated our forward currency exchange contracts and variable-to-fixed interest rate
swaps as cash flow hedges. For derivative instruments that are designated as hedges, changes in the
fair value of the derivative are recognized in other comprehensive income (“OCI”) and reclassified
into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.
We de-designate derivative instruments from hedge accounting when the probability of the hedged
transaction occurring becomes less than probable, but remains reasonably possible. For
de-designated instruments, the gain or loss from the time of de-designation through maturity of the
instrument is recognized in earnings. Any gain or loss in other comprehensive income at the time of
de-designation is reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged
transaction affects earnings. We immediately record in earnings the extent to which a hedge is not
effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value of the hedged item. Gains or losses related
to hedge ineffectiveness recognized in earnings during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and
2007 were not material. At December 31, 2009, the estimated net amount of losses that are expected
to be reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income and into earnings within the next
12 months is $2.9 million if exchange rates do not fluctuate from the levels at December 31, 2009.

We enter into currency exchange contracts for amounts that are less than the full value of
forecasted intercompany sales. Our hedging strategy related to intercompany inventory purchases
provides that we employ the full amount of our hedges for the succeeding year at the conclusion of
our budgeting process for that year, which is complete by the end of the preceding year. Quarterly,
we enter into contracts to hedge incremental portions of anticipated foreign currency transactions
for the following year. Accordingly, our risk with respect to foreign currency exchange rate
fluctuations may vary throughout each annual cycle.

In addition to hedges for anticipated 2008 intercompany inventory purchases, we had a foreign
currency exchange contract outstanding at December 31, 2007 to hedge the repayment by our Canadian
subsidiary of an intercompany loan denominated in Canadian dollars that the subsidiary used to fund
the acquisitions of veterinary reference laboratory businesses, which had a U.S dollar equivalent
of $32.1 million at December 31, 2007.

In March 2009, we entered into two forward fixed interest rate swap agreements to manage the
economic effect of variable interest obligations on amounts borrowed under the terms of our Credit
Facility. Under these agreements, the variable interest rate associated with $80 million of
borrowings outstanding beginning on March 31, 2010 will effectively become fixed at 2% plus the
Credit Spread through March 30, 2012. The critical terms of the interest rate swap agreements match
the critical terms of the underlying borrowings, including notional amounts, underlying market
indices, interest rate reset dates and maturity dates.

NOTE 16. TREASURY STOCK

Our board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to 44,000,000 shares of our common
stock in the open market or in negotiated transactions. We believe that the repurchase of our
common stock is a favorable investment and we also repurchase to offset the dilutive effect of our
share-based compensation programs. Repurchases of our common stock may vary depending upon the
level of other investing and financing activities and the share price.

From the inception of the program in August 1999 to December 31, 2009, we repurchased
37,706,000 shares for $905.6 million. During that same period, we received 412,000 shares of stock
with a market value of $9.1 million that were surrendered by employees in payment for the minimum
required withholding taxes due on the exercise of stock options, the vesting of restricted stock
units and the settlement of deferred stock units, and in payment for the exercise price of stock
options.

Our board of directors is authorized, subject to any limitations prescribed by law, without
further stockholder approval, to issue from time to time up to 500,000 shares of Preferred Stock,
$1.00 par value per share (“Preferred Stock”), in one or more series. Each such series of Preferred
Stock shall have such number of shares, designations, preferences, voting powers, qualifications
and special or relative rights or privileges as shall be determined by the board of directors,
which may include, among others, dividend rights, voting rights, redemption and sinking fund
provisions, liquidation preferences, conversion rights and preemptive rights.

NOTE 18. IDEXX RETIREMENT AND INCENTIVE SAVINGS PLAN

We have established the IDEXX Retirement and Incentive Savings Plan (the “401(k) Plan”).
Employees eligible to participate in the 401(k) Plan may contribute specified percentages of their
salaries, a portion of which will be matched by us. We matched $5.9 million, $5.6 million and $3.4
million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. In addition, we may
make contributions to the 401(k) Plan at the discretion of the board of directors. There were no
discretionary contributions in 2009, 2008 or 2007.

NOTE 19. DISPOSITION OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCT LINES AND RESTRUCTURING

In the fourth quarter of 2008, we sold our Acarexx

®

and SURPASS

®

veterinary pharmaceutical products and a product under development, which were a part of our CAG
segment, for cash of $7.0 million, a short-term receivable of $1.4 million, which was received in
January 2009, and up to $11.5 million of future payments based on the achievement of certain
development and sales milestones. In the fourth quarter of 2009 we received a milestone payment of
$2.0 million, which is reflected as a reduction to general and administrative expenses, in
connection with the achievement of certain development milestones by the third party that purchased
the product rights. We are now eligible to receive up to $9.5 million in additional milestone
payments based on revenue related to the product that was under development. Future sales-based
milestone payments will be included in our results of operations upon achievement of the milestone.

Additionally in the fourth quarter of 2008, in a separate transaction, we entered into an
agreement to sell our raw material inventory of nitazoxanide (“NTZ”), the active ingredient
associated with our Navigator

®

product, back to the material supplier. We will receive
$0.3 million annually for 2 years and a final payment of $1.4 million related to this agreement,
which will be recorded in our results of operations in the period that the payments are received.
In the second quarter of 2007 we recognized a $9.1 million write-down of NTZ inventory based on
the determination that we would not realize this inventory.

Subsequent to entering into the transactions noted above we restructured the remaining
pharmaceutical division and realigned two of our remaining product lines to the Rapid Assay line of
business and realigned the remainder of the products, which comprised one product line and two
out-licensing arrangements, to the Other category. Segment information presented for the year ended
December 31, 2007 has been restated to conform to our presentation of reportable segments for the
years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008.

For the year ended December 31, 2008 we recognized a pre-tax loss from the transactions and
the related restructuring costs of approximately $1.5 million and recorded a tax provision of $2.1
million, primarily related to the disposition of $7.2 million of nondeductible goodwill allocated
to the pharmaceutical product lines sold.

agreement related to certain intellectual property of our pharmaceutical division. Under this
agreement we received $0.3 million up front and are entitled to receive a total of $3.3 million in
milestone payments, related to the achievement of future events, and royalties based on future
product sales. Milestone payments will be included in our results of operations upon achievement of
the milestones.
