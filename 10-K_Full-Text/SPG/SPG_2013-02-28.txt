Part I

Item 1.    Business

Simon Property Group, Inc., or Simon Property, is a Delaware corporation that operates as a self-administered and self-managed real
estate investment trust, or REIT, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Internal Revenue Code. REITs will generally not be liable for federal corporate income taxes as long as
they continue to distribute in excess of 100% of their taxable income. Simon Property Group, L.P., or the Operating Partnership, is our majority-owned partnership subsidiary that owns all of our real
estate properties and other assets. In this discussion, the terms "we", "us" and "our" refer to Simon Property, the Operating Partnership, and its subsidiaries.

We
own, develop and manage retail real estate properties, which consist primarily of malls, Premium Outlets®, The Mills®, and community/lifestyle centers. As of
December 31, 2012, we owned or held an interest in 317 income-producing properties in the United States, which consisted of 160 malls, 63 Premium Outlets, 68 community/lifestyle centers, 13 Mills and
13 other shopping centers or outlet centers in 38 states and Puerto Rico. We also have reinstituted redevelopment and expansion initiatives with renovation and expansion projects currently underway at
24 properties in the U.S. with 56 new anchor and big box tenants having opened in 2012 and an additional 30 scheduled to open in 2013. Internationally, as of December 31, 2012, we had ownership
interests in eight Premium Outlets in Japan, two Premium Outlets in South Korea, one Premium Outlet in Mexico, and one Premium Outlet in Malaysia. Additionally, as of December 31, 2012, we owned a
28.9% equity stake in Klépierre SA, or Klépierre, a publicly traded, Paris-based real estate company, which owns, or has an interest in, more than 260 shopping centers
located in 13 countries in Europe.

For
a description of our operational strategies and developments in our business during 2012, see the "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations" section of the 2012 Annual Report to Stockholders filed as Exhibit 13.1 to this Form 10-K.

Other Policies

The following is a discussion of our investment policies, financing policies, conflict of interest policies and policies with respect
to certain other activities. One or more of these policies may be amended or rescinded from time to time without a stockholder vote.

Investment Policies

While we emphasize equity real estate investments, we may also provide secured financing to or invest in equity or debt securities of
other entities engaged in real estate activities or securities of other issuers. However, any of these investments would be subject to the percentage ownership limitations and gross income tests
necessary for REIT qualification. These REIT limitations mean that we cannot make an investment that would cause our real estate assets to be less than 75% of our total assets. We must also derive at
least 75% of our gross income directly or indirectly from investments relating to real property or mortgages on real property, including "rents from real property," dividends from other REITs and, in
certain circumstances, interest from certain types of temporary investments. In addition, we must also derive at least 95% of our gross income from such real property investments, and from dividends,
interest and gains from the sale or dispositions of stock or securities or from other combinations of the foregoing.

Subject
to REIT limitations, we may invest in the securities of other issuers in connection with acquisitions of indirect interests in real estate. Such an investment would normally be
in the form of general or limited partnership or membership interests in special purpose partnerships and limited liability companies that own one or more properties. We may, in the future, acquire
all or substantially all of the securities or assets of other REITs, management companies or similar entities where such investments would be consistent with our investment policies.

Financing Policies

Because our REIT qualification requires us to distribute at least 90% of our taxable income, we regularly access the debt markets to
raise the funds necessary to finance acquisitions, develop and redevelop properties, and refinance maturing debt. We must comply with the covenants contained in our financing agreements that limit our
ratio of debt to total assets or market value, as defined. For example, the Operating Partnership's line of credit and the indentures for the Operating Partnership's debt securities contain covenants
that restrict the total amount of debt of the Operating Partnership to 65%, or 60% in relation to certain debt, of total assets, as defined under the related



arrangement,
and secured debt to 50% of total assets. In addition, these agreements contain other covenants requiring compliance with financial ratios. Furthermore, the amount of debt that we may
incur is limited as a practical matter by our desire to maintain acceptable ratings for our equity securities and the debt securities of the Operating Partnership. We strive to maintain investment
grade ratings at all times, but we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so in the future.

If
our Board of Directors determines to seek additional capital, we may raise such capital by offering equity or debt securities, creating joint ventures with existing ownership
interests in properties, entering into joint venture arrangements for new development projects, retaining cash flows or a combination of these methods. If the Board of Directors determines to raise
equity capital, it may, without stockholder approval, issue additional shares of common stock or other capital stock. The Board of Directors may issue a number of shares up to the amount of our
authorized capital in any manner and on such terms and for such consideration as it deems appropriate. Such securities may be senior to the outstanding classes of common stock. Such securities also
may include additional classes of preferred stock, which may be convertible into common stock. Existing stockholders have no preemptive right to purchase shares in any subsequent offering of our
securities. Any such offering could dilute a stockholder's investment in us.

We
expect most future borrowings would be made through the Operating Partnership or its subsidiaries. We might, however, incur borrowings that would be reloaned to the Operating
Partnership. Borrowings may be in the form of bank borrowings, publicly and privately placed debt instruments, or purchase money obligations to the sellers of properties. Any such indebtedness may be
secured or unsecured. Any such indebtedness may also have full or limited recourse to the borrower or cross-collateralized with other debt, or may be fully or partially guaranteed by
the Operating Partnership. Although we may borrow to fund the payment of dividends, we currently have no expectation that we will regularly do so.

The
Operating Partnership has an unsecured revolving credit facility, or the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility's initial borrowing capacity of $4.0 billion can be increased at our
sole option to $5.0 billion during its term. The Credit Facility will initially mature on October 30, 2015 and can be extended for an additional year at our sole option. On June 1, 2012, we entered
into an additional unsecured revolving credit facility, or the Supplemental Facility, with an initial borrowing capacity of $2.0 billion which can be increased at our sole option to $2.5 billion
during its term. The Supplemental Facility will initially mature on June 30, 2016 and can be extended for an additional year at our sole option. We issue debt securities through the Operating
Partnership, but we may issue our debt securities which may be convertible into capital stock or be accompanied by warrants to purchase capital stock. We also may sell or securitize our lease
receivables.

We
may also finance acquisitions through the following:

•

issuance of shares of common stock or preferred stock;

•

issuance of additional units of partnership interest in the Operating Partnership, or units;

•

issuance of preferred units of the Operating Partnership;

•

issuance of other securities including unsecured notes and mortgage debt;

•

draws on our credit facilities; or

•

sale or exchange of ownership interests in properties.

The
Operating Partnership may also issue units to transferors of properties or other partnership interests which may permit the transferor to defer gain recognition for tax purposes.

We
do not have a policy limiting the number or amount of mortgages that may be placed on any particular property. Mortgage financing instruments, however, usually limit additional
indebtedness on such properties. Additionally, our unsecured credit facilities, unsecured note indentures and other contracts may limit our ability to borrow and contain limits on mortgage
indebtedness we may incur.

Typically,
we invest in or form special purpose entities to assist us in obtaining secured permanent financing at attractive terms. Permanent financing may be structured as a mortgage
loan on a single property, or on a group of properties, and generally requires us to provide a mortgage lien on the property or properties in favor of an institutional third party, as a joint venture
with a third party, or as a securitized financing. For securitized financings, we create special purpose entities to own the properties. These special purpose entities, which are common in the real
estate industry, are structured so that they would not be consolidated in a bankruptcy proceeding involving a parent



company.
We decide upon the structure of the financing based upon the best terms then available to us and whether the proposed financing is consistent with our other business objectives. For
accounting purposes, we include the outstanding securitized debt of special purpose entities owning consolidated properties as part of our consolidated indebtedness.

Conflict of Interest Policies

We maintain policies and have entered into agreements designed to reduce or eliminate potential conflicts of interest. We have adopted
governance principles governing the function, conduct, selection, orientation and duties of our Board of Directors and the Company, as well as written charters for each of the standing Committees of
the Board of Directors. In addition, we have a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which applies to all of our officers, directors, and employees and those of our subsidiaries. At least a majority of
the members of our Board of Directors must qualify as independent under the listing standards for New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, companies and cannot be affiliated with the Simon family who are
significant stockholders and/or unitholders in the Operating Partnership. In addition, the Audit and Compensation Committees of our Board of Directors are comprised of independent members in
accordance with the independence requirements of the NYSE. Any transaction between us and the Simons, including property acquisitions, service and property management agreements and retail space
leases, must be approved by a majority of our independent directors.

The
sale by the Operating Partnership of any property that it owns may have an adverse tax impact on the Simons and/or other limited partners of the Operating Partnership. In order to
avoid any conflict of interest between Simon Property and the Simons, our charter requires that at least six of our independent directors must authorize and require the Operating Partnership to sell
any property it owns. Any such sale is subject to applicable agreements with third parties. Noncompetition agreements executed by Herbert Simon and David Simon contain covenants limiting their ability
to participate in certain shopping center activities.

Policies With Respect To Certain Other Activities

We intend to make investments which are consistent with our qualification as a REIT, unless the Board of Directors determines that it
is no longer in our best interests to so qualify as a REIT. The Board of Directors may make such a determination because of changing circumstances or changes in the REIT requirements. We have
authority to offer shares of our capital stock or other securities in exchange for property. We also have authority to repurchase or otherwise reacquire our shares or any other securities. We may
issue shares of our common stock, or cash at our option, to holders of units in future periods upon exercise of such holders' rights under the Operating Partnership agreement. Our policy prohibits us
from making any loans to our directors or executive officers for any purpose. We may make loans to the joint ventures in which we participate. Additionally, we may make or buy interests in loans for
real estate properties owned by others.

Competition

The retail industry is dynamic and competitive. We compete with numerous merchandise distribution channels including malls, outlet
centers, community/lifestyle centers, and other shopping centers in the United States and abroad. We also compete with internet retailing sites and catalogs which provide retailers with distribution
options beyond existing brick and mortar retail properties. The existence of competitive alternatives could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease space and on the level of rents we
can obtain. This results in competition for both the tenants to occupy the properties that we develop and manage as well as for the acquisition of prime sites (including land for development and
operating properties). We believe that there are numerous factors that make our properties highly desirable to retailers including:

•

the quality, location and diversity of our properties;

•

our management and operational expertise;

•

our extensive experience and relationships with retailers and lenders; and

•

our mall marketing initiatives and consumer focused strategic corporate alliances.

issued 7,627,368 shares of common stock upon the exchange of 8,279,993 units of the Operating Partnership;

Item 1A.    Risk Factors

The following factors, among others, could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in
forward-looking statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and presented elsewhere by our management from time to time. These factors may have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, operating results and cash flows, and you should carefully consider them. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or which are currently not believed to be
material may also affect our actual results. We may update these factors in our future periodic reports.

Risks Relating to Debt and the Financial Markets

We have a substantial debt burden that could affect our future operations.

As of December 31, 2012, our consolidated mortgages and other indebtedness, excluding related premium and discount, totaled $23.1
billion. We are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow from operations will be insufficient to meet required debt service. Our debt service
costs generally will not be reduced if developments at the property, such as the entry of new competitors or the loss of major tenants, cause a reduction in the income from the property. Should such
events occur, our operations may be adversely affected. If a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and income from such property is insufficient to pay that indebtedness, the
property could be foreclosed upon by the mortgagee resulting in a loss of income and a decline in our total asset value.

Disruption in the credit markets or downgrades in our credit ratings may adversely affect our ability to access external financings for our growth and ongoing debt service
requirements.

We depend on external financings, principally debt financings, to fund the growth of our business and to ensure that we can meet
ongoing maturities of our outstanding debt. Our access to financing depends on our credit rating, the willingness of banks to lend to us and conditions in the capital markets. We cannot assure you
that we will be able to obtain the financing we need for future growth or to meet our debt service as obligations mature, or that the financing available to us will be on acceptable terms.

Adverse changes in our credit rating could affect our borrowing capacity and borrowing terms.

Our outstanding senior unsecured notes and preferred stock are periodically rated by nationally recognized credit rating agencies. The
credit ratings are based on our operating performance, liquidity and leverage ratios, overall financial position, and other factors viewed by the credit rating agencies as relevant to our industry and
the economic outlook in general. Our credit rating can affect the amount of capital we can access, as well as the terms of any financing we obtain. Since we depend primarily on debt financing to fund
our growth, adverse changes in our credit rating could have a negative effect on our future growth.

Our hedging interest rate protection arrangements may not effectively limit our interest rate risk.

We selectively manage our exposure to interest rate risk by a combination of interest rate protection agreements to effectively fix or
cap a portion of our variable rate debt. In addition, we refinance fixed rate debt at times when we believe rates and terms are appropriate. Our efforts to manage these exposures may not be
successful.

Our
use of interest rate hedging arrangements to manage risk associated with interest rate volatility may expose us to additional risks, including a risk that a counterparty to a
hedging arrangement may fail to honor its obligations. Developing an effective interest rate risk strategy is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest
rate fluctuations. There can be no assurance that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition. Termination of these hedging
agreements typically involves costs, such as transaction fees or breakage costs.

Factors Affecting Real Estate Investments and Operations

We face risks associated with the acquisition, development, redevelopment and expansion of properties.

We regularly acquire and develop new properties and expand and redevelop existing properties, and these activities are subject to
various risks. We may not be successful in pursuing acquisition, development or redevelopment/



expansion
opportunities. In addition, newly acquired, developed or redeveloped/expanded properties may not perform as well as expected. We are subject to other risks in connection with any
acquisition, development and redevelopment/expansion activities, including the following:

•

construction costs of a project may be higher than projected, potentially making the project unfeasible or unprofitable;

•

we may not be able to obtain financing or to refinance loans on favorable terms, if at all;

•

we may be unable to obtain zoning, occupancy or other governmental approvals;

•

occupancy rates and rents may not meet our projections and the project may not be profitable; and

•

we may need the consent of third parties such as anchor tenants, mortgage lenders and joint venture partners, and those
consents may be withheld.

If
a development or redevelopment/expansion project is unsuccessful, either because it is not meeting our expectations when operational or was not completed according to the project
planning, we could lose our investment in the project. Further, if we guarantee the property's financing, our loss could exceed our investment in the project.

Real estate investments are relatively illiquid.

Our properties represent a substantial portion of our total consolidated assets. These investments are relatively illiquid. As a
result, our ability to sell one or more of our properties or investments in real estate in response to any changes in economic or other conditions may be limited. If we want to sell a property, we
cannot assure you that we will be able to dispose of it in the desired time period or that the sales price of a property will exceed the cost of our investment.

Our international expansion may subject us to different or greater risk from those associated with our domestic operations.

As of December 31, 2012, we hold interests in joint venture properties that operate in Japan, South Korea, Mexico, and Malaysia. We
also have an equity stake in Klépierre, a publicly-traded European real estate company. Accordingly, our operating results and the value of our international operations may be impacted
by any unhedged movements in the foreign currencies in which those operations transact and in which our net investment in the foreign operation is held. We may pursue additional expansion and
development opportunities outside the United States. International development and ownership activities carry risks that are different from those we face with our domestic properties and operations.
These risks include:

•

adverse effects of changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies;

•

changes in foreign political and economic environments, regionally, nationally, and locally;

•

challenges of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws including corporate governance, operations, taxes, and
litigation;

•

differing lending practices;

•

differences in cultures;

•

changes in applicable laws and regulations in the United States that affect foreign operations;

•

difficulties in managing international operations; and

•

obstacles to the repatriation of earnings and cash.

Although
our international activities currently are a relatively small portion of our business (international properties represented approximately 6.3% of net operating income, or NOI,
for the year ended December 31, 2012), to the extent that we expand our international activities, these risks could increase in significance which in turn could adversely affect our results of
operations and financial condition.



Environmental Risks

As owners of real estate, we can face liabilities for environmental contamination.

Federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require us, as a current or previous
owner or operator of real property, to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at a property or at impacted neighboring properties. These laws often impose
liability regardless of whether the property owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances. These laws and regulations may require the abatement or
removal of asbestos containing materials in the event of damage, demolition or renovation, reconstruction or expansion of a property and also govern emissions of and exposure to asbestos fibers in the
air. Those laws and regulations also govern the installation, maintenance and removal of underground storage tanks used to store waste oils or other petroleum products. Many of our properties contain,
or at one time contained, asbestos containing materials or underground storage tanks (primarily related to auto service center establishments or emergency electrical generation equipment). The costs
of investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances may be substantial and could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition but is not estimable. The
presence of contamination, or the failure to remediate contamination, may also adversely affect our ability to sell, lease or redevelop a property or to borrow using a property as collateral.

Our efforts to identify environmental liabilities may not be successful.

Although we believe that our portfolio is in substantial compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and
regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances, this belief is based on limited testing. Nearly all of our properties have been subjected to Phase I or similar environmental audits. These
environmental audits have not revealed, nor are we aware of, any environmental liability that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.
However, we cannot assure you that:

•

existing environmental studies with respect to the portfolio reveal all potential environmental liabilities;

•

any previous owner, occupant or tenant of a property did not create any material environmental condition not known to us;

•

the current environmental condition of the portfolio will not be affected by tenants and occupants, by the condition of
nearby properties, or by other unrelated third parties; or

•

future uses or conditions (including, without limitation, changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations or the
interpretation thereof) will not result in environmental liabilities.

Retail Operations Risks

Overall economic conditions may adversely affect the general retail environment.

Our concentration in the retail real estate market means that we are subject to the risks that affect the retail environment generally,
including the levels of consumer spending, seasonality, the willingness of retailers to lease space in our shopping centers, tenant bankruptcies, changes in economic conditions, increasing use of the
internet by retailers and consumers, consumer confidence, casualties and other natural disasters, and the potential for terrorist activities. The economy and consumer spending appear to be recovering
from the effects of the recent recession. We derive our cash flow from operations primarily from retail tenants, many of whom have been and continue to be under some degree of economic stress. A
significant deterioration in our cash flow from operations could require us to curtail planned capital expenditures or seek alternative sources of financing.

We may not be able to lease newly developed properties and renew leases and relet space at existing properties.

We may not be able to lease new properties to an appropriate mix of tenants or for rents that are consistent with our projections.
Also, when leases for our existing properties expire, the premises may not be relet or the terms of reletting, including the cost of allowances and concessions to tenants, may be less favorable than
the current lease terms. To the extent that our leasing plans are not achieved, our cash generated before debt repayments and capital expenditures could be adversely affected. Changes in economic and
operating conditions that occur subsequent to our review of recoverability of investment property and other assets could impact the assumptions used in that assessment and could result in future
charges to earnings if assumptions regarding those investments differ from actual results.



Some of our properties depend on anchor stores or major tenants to attract shoppers and could be adversely affected by the loss of or a store closure by one or more of these
tenants.

Malls are typically anchored by department stores and other large nationally recognized tenants. The value of some of our properties
could be adversely affected if these tenants fail to comply with their contractual obligations, seek concessions in order to continue operations, or cease their operations. Department store and larger
store, also referred to as "big box", consolidations typically result in the closure of existing stores or duplicate or geographically overlapping store locations. We do not control the disposition of
those department stores or larger stores that we do not own. We also may not control the vacant space that is not re-leased in those stores we do own. Other tenants may be entitled to modify the terms
of their existing leases in the event of such closures. The modification could be unfavorable to us as the lessor and could decrease rents or
expense recovery charges. Additionally, major tenant closures may result in decreased customer traffic which could lead to decreased sales at other stores. If the sales of stores operating in our
properties were to decline significantly due to closing of anchors, economic conditions, or other reasons, tenants may be unable to pay their minimum rents or expense recovery charges. In the event of
default by a tenant or anchor store, we may experience delays and costs in enforcing our rights as landlord to recover amounts due to us under the terms of our agreements with those parties.

We face potential adverse effects from tenant bankruptcies.

Bankruptcy filings by retailers occur regularly in the course of our operations. We continually seek to re-lease vacant spaces
resulting from tenant terminations. The bankruptcy of a tenant, particularly an anchor tenant, may make it more difficult to lease the remainder of the affected properties. Future tenant bankruptcies
could adversely affect our properties or impact our ability to successfully execute our re-leasing strategy.

We face a wide range of competition that could affect our ability to operate profitably.

Our properties compete with other retail properties and other forms of retailing such as catalogs and e-commerce websites. Competition
may come from malls, outlet centers, community/lifestyle centers, and other shopping centers, both existing as well as future development projects, as well as catalogs and e-commerce. The presence of
competitive alternatives affects our ability to lease space and the level of rents we can obtain. New construction, renovations and expansions at competing sites could also negatively affect our
properties.

We
also compete with other retail property developers to acquire prime development sites. In addition, we compete with other retail property companies for tenants and qualified
management.

Risks Relating to Joint Venture Properties

We have limited control with respect to some properties that are partially owned or managed by third parties, which may adversely affect our ability to sell or refinance
them.

As of December 31, 2012, we owned interests in 108 income-producing properties with other parties. Of those, 18 properties are included
in our consolidated financial statements. We account for the other 90 properties under the equity method of accounting, which we refer to as joint venture properties. We serve as general partner or
property manager for 74 of these 90 properties; however, certain major decisions, such as approving the operating budget and selling, refinancing and redeveloping the properties require the consent of
the other owners. Of the properties for which we do not serve as general partner or property manager, 12 are in our international joint ventures. The other owners also have other participating rights
that we consider substantive for purposes of determining control over the properties' assets. The remaining joint venture properties are managed by third parties. These limitations may adversely
affect our ability to sell, refinance, or otherwise operate these properties.

The Operating Partnership guarantees debt or otherwise provides support for a number of joint venture properties.

Joint venture debt is the liability of the joint venture and is typically secured by a mortgage on the joint venture property. As of
December 31, 2012, the Operating Partnership had guaranteed $84.9 million of joint venture related mortgage or other indebtedness. A default by a joint venture under its debt obligations may expose us
to liability under a guaranty or letter of credit. We may elect to fund cash needs of a joint venture through equity contributions (generally on a basis proportionate to our ownership interests),
advances or partner loans, although such fundings are not required contractually or otherwise.



Other Factors Affecting Our Business

Some of our potential losses may not be covered by insurance.

We maintain insurance coverage with third party carriers who provide a portion of the coverage for specific layers of potential losses
including commercial general liability, fire, flood, extended coverage and rental loss insurance on all of our properties in the United States. The initial portion of coverage not provided by third
party carriers is either insured through our wholly-owned captive insurance companies or other financial arrangements controlled by us. A third party carrier has, in turn, agreed to provide evidence
of coverage for this layer of losses under the terms and conditions of the carrier's policy. A similar policy written through our captive insurance entities also provides initial coverage for property
insurance and certain windstorm risks at the properties located in coastal windstorm locations.

There
are some types of losses, including lease and other contract claims, which generally are not insured. If an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs, we could
lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenue it could generate.

We
currently maintain insurance coverage against acts of terrorism on all of our properties in the United States on an "all risk" basis in the amount of up to $1 billion. The current
federal laws which provide this coverage are expected to operate through 2014. Despite the existence of this insurance coverage, any threatened or actual terrorist attacks where we operate could
adversely affect our property values, revenues, consumer traffic and tenant sales.

Risks Relating to Income Taxes

We have elected to be taxed as a REIT in the United States and certain of our international operations currently receive favorable tax treatment.

We are subject to certain income-based taxes, both domestically and internationally, and other taxes, including state and local taxes,
franchise taxes, and withholding taxes on dividends from certain of our international investments. We currently receive favorable tax treatment in various domestic and international jurisdictions
through tax rules and regulations or through international treaties. Should we no longer receive such benefits, the amount of taxes we pay may increase.

In
the U.S., we have elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code. We believe we have been organized and operated in a manner which allows
us to qualify for taxation as a REIT
under the Internal Revenue Code. We intend to continue to operate in this manner. However, our qualification and taxation as a REIT depend upon our ability to meet, through actual annual operating
results, asset diversification, distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership, the various qualification tests imposed under the Internal Revenue Code. REIT qualification is governed by highly
technical and complex provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations. Accordingly, there is no assurance that we have operated or will continue to operate in a
manner so as to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT.

If
we fail to comply with those provisions, we may be subject to monetary penalties or ultimately to possible disqualification as a REIT. If such events occurs, and if available relief
provisions do not apply:

•

we will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income;

•

we will be subject to corporate level income tax, including any applicable alternative minimum tax, on our taxable income
at regular corporate rates; and

•

unless entitled to relief under relevant statutory provisions, we will also be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for
the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost.

Item 2.    Properties

United States Properties

Our U.S. properties primarily consist of malls, Premium Outlets, The Mills, community/lifestyle centers, and other properties. These
properties contain an aggregate of approximately 239.2 million square feet of gross leasable area, or GLA, of which we own approximately 152.9 million square feet.

Malls
typically contain at least one traditional department store anchor or a combination of anchors and big box retailers with a wide variety of smaller stores connecting the anchors.
Additional stores are usually located along the perimeter of the parking area. Our 160 malls are generally enclosed centers and range in size from approximately 400,000 to 2.5 million square feet of
GLA. Our malls contain in the aggregate more than 17,100 occupied stores, including approximately 680 anchors, which are predominately national retailers.

Premium
Outlets generally contain a wide variety of designer and manufacturer stores located in open-air centers. Our 63 Premium Outlets range in size from approximately 150,000 to
850,000 square feet of GLA. The Premium Outlets are generally located near major metropolitan areas and/or tourist destinations.

The
Mills generally range in size from 1.0 million to 2.2 million square feet of GLA and are located in major metropolitan areas. They have a combination of traditional mall, outlet
center, and big box retailers and entertainment uses.

Community/lifestyle
centers are generally unenclosed and smaller than our malls. Our 68 community/lifestyle centers generally range in size from approximately 100,000 to 950,000 square
feet of GLA. Community/lifestyle centers are designed to serve a larger trade area and typically contain anchor stores and other national retail tenants, which occupy a significant portion of the GLA
of the center. We also own traditional community shopping centers that focus primarily on value-oriented and convenience goods and services. These centers are usually anchored by a supermarket,
discount retailer, or drugstore and are designed to service a neighborhood area. Finally, we own open-air centers adjacent to our malls designed to take advantage of the drawing power of the mall.

We
also have interests in 13 other shopping centers or outlet centers. These properties range in size from approximately 85,000 to 1.1 million square feet of GLA, are considered
non-core to our business model, and in total represent less than 1% of our total operating income before depreciation and amortization.

As
of December 31, 2012, approximately 95.3% of the owned GLA in malls and Premium Outlets and the retail space of the other properties was leased, approximately 97.2% of the owned GLA
for The Mills was leased and approximately 94.7% of the owned GLA in the community/lifestyle centers was leased.

We
wholly own 221 of our properties, effectively control 18 properties in which we have a joint venture interest, and hold the remaining 78 properties through unconsolidated joint
venture interests. We are the managing or co-managing general partner or member of 313 properties. Certain of our joint venture properties are subject to various rights of first refusal, buy-sell
provisions, put and call rights, or other sale or marketing rights for partners which are customary in real estate partnership agreements and the industry. We and our partners in these joint ventures
may initiate these provisions (subject to any applicable lock up or similar restrictions) which may result in either the sale of our interest or the use of available cash or borrowings, or the use of
Operating Partnership units, to acquire the joint venture interest from our partner.

The
following property table summarizes certain data for our malls and Premium Outlets, The Mills, and community/lifestyle centers located in the United States, including Puerto Rico,
as of December 31, 2012.

Land

We have direct or indirect ownership interests in approximately 425 acres of land held in the United States for future development.

Sustainability and Energy Efficiency

We focus on energy efficiency as a core sustainability strategy. Through the continued use of energy conservation practices, energy
efficiency projects, and continuous monitoring and reporting, we have reduced our energy consumption at comparable properties every year since 2003. As a result, excluding new developments and
expansions, we reduced the electricity usage over which we have direct control by 374 million kWhs since 2003. This represents a 29% reduction in electricity usage across a portfolio of comparable
properties
and reflects an annual value of over $36 million in avoided operating costs. Our documented reduction in greenhouse gas emissions resulting from our energy management efforts is 229,000 metric tons of
CO2e.

In
2012, we were awarded

NAREIT's Leader in the Light Award

for our energy conservation efforts for the eighth straight year. We are the
only company to have achieved the Leader in the Light distinction every single year since NAREIT launched the program in 2005. We were included in the 2012 Carbon Disclosure Leadership Index published
by the Carbon Disclosure Project and were the only REIT to earn a place on this index for the second straight year.

Mortgage Financing on Properties

The following table sets forth certain information regarding the mortgages and other indebtedness encumbering our properties, and the
properties held by our domestic and international joint venture arrangements, and also our unsecured corporate debt. Substantially all of the mortgage and property related debt is nonrecourse to us.

Item 3.    Legal Proceedings

We are involved from time-to-time in various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business, including, but not
limited to commercial disputes, environmental matters, and litigation in connection with transactions including acquisitions and divestitures. We believe that such litigation, claims and
administrative proceedings will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position or our results of operations. We record a liability when a loss is considered probable and the amount can
be reasonably estimated.

Consists
of a regular quarterly dividend of $0.90 per share and a special common stock dividend of $0.20 per share.

There
is no established public trading market for Simon Property's Class B common stock. Dividends on the Class B common stock are identical to the common stock.

Holders

The number of holders of record of common stock outstanding was 1,588 as of December 31, 2012. The Class B common stock is subject to
two voting trusts as to which Herbert Simon and David Simon are the trustees. Shares of Class B common stock convert automatically into an equal number of shares of common stock upon the occurrence of
certain events and can be converted into shares of common stock at the option of the holders.

Dividends

We must pay a minimum amount of dividends to maintain our status as a REIT. Our dividends typically exceed our net income generated in
any given year primarily because of depreciation, which is a non-cash expense. Our future dividends and future distributions of the Operating Partnership will be determined by the Board of Directors
based on actual results of operations, cash available for dividends and limited partner distributions, cash reserves as deemed necessary for capital and operating expenditures, and the amount required
to maintain our status as a REIT.

Common
stock dividends during 2012 aggregated $4.10 per share. Common stock dividends during 2011 aggregated $3.50 per share, including a special common stock dividend of $0.20 per
share paid in December. On February 1, 2013, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $1.15 per share of common stock payable on February 28, 2013 to stockholders of record on February 14,
2013.

We
offer a dividend reinvestment plan that allows our stockholders to acquire additional shares by automatically reinvesting cash dividends. Shares are acquired pursuant to the plan at
a price equal to the prevailing market price of such shares, without payment of any brokerage commission or service charge.

Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities

During the fourth quarter of 2012, we issued 554,756 shares of common stock to limited partners in exchange for an equal number of
units. The issuance of the shares of common stock was made pursuant to the terms of the Partnership Agreement of the Operating Partnership and was exempt from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2)
of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

Depreciation
of our investment in buildings and improvements reflected in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income is calculated over the estimated original
lives of the assets as noted below.

•

Buildings and Improvements — typically 10-40 years for the structure, 15 years for landscaping and
parking lot, and 10 years for HVAC equipment.

•

Tenant Allowances and Improvements — shorter of lease term or useful life.

(3)

Initial cost generally represents net book value at December 20, 1993, except for acquired properties and new
developments after December 20, 1993. Initial cost also includes any new developments that are opened during the current year. Costs of disposals and impairments of property are first reflected as a
reduction to cost capitalized subsequent to acquisition.

(4)

Not developed/constructed by us or our predecessors. The date of construction represents the initial
acquisition date for assets in which we have acquired multiple interests.

(5)

Initial cost for these properties is the cost at the date of consolidation for properties previously accounted
for under the equity method of accounting.

(6)

Amounts represent preliminary purchase price allocation and are subject to change upon finalization.

(7)

Encumbrances represent face amount of mortgage debt and exclude any premiums or discounts.
