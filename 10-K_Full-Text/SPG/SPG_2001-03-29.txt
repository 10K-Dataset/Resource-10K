Item 1. Business

Background and Description of the Business

The background and description of the business information required by this item is incorporated herein by reference to the Notes to Financial Statements,
Note 1, paragraphs 1 through 4, on pages 51 and 52 of the Annual Report to Shareholders for Simon Property Group, Inc. ("SPG"), a Delaware corporation, and SPG Realty
Consultants, Inc., also a Delaware corporation ("SRC" and together with SPG, the "Companies"), which is filed as Exhibit 13.1 to this Form 10-K. Each share of common
stock of SPG is paired ("Paired Shares") with a beneficial interest in 1/100

th

of a share of common stock of SRC. As of December 31, 2000, SPG and Simon Property Group, L.P. (the
"SPG Operating Partnership") owned or held an interest in 252 income-producing properties in the United States, which consisted of 165 regional malls, 73 community shopping centers, five specialty
retail centers, four office and mixed-use properties and five value-oriented super-regional malls in 36 states (the "Properties"), and five additional retail real estate properties
operating in Europe. SPG and the SPG Operating Partnership also owned an interest in two properties currently under construction and 11 parcels of land held for future development, which together with
the Properties are hereafter referred to as the "Portfolio" or the "Portfolio Properties."

Mergers and Acquisitions

Mergers and acquisitions have been a significant component of the growth and development of Simon Group's business. "Simon Group" consists of the Companies,
the SPG Operating Partnership, and SPG Realty Consultants, L.P. (the "SRC Operating Partnership" and, together with SPG Operating Partnership, the "Operating Partnerships). Beginning with the
$3.0 billion acquisition, through merger, of DeBartolo Realty Corporation ("DRC") in August of 1996, Simon Group has completed five major mergers and/or acquisitions that have helped shape the
current organization. Information regarding Simon Group's mergers and acquisitions required by this item are incorporated herein by reference to
the Notes to Financial Statements, Notes 3, 4, and 5 (acquisitions portion only), on pages 53 to 55, respectively of the Companies' Annual Report to Shareholders, which is filed as Exhibit 13.1
to this Form 10-K.

General

During 2000, regional malls (including specialty retail centers and retail space in the mixed-use Properties), community centers and the remaining
Portfolio comprised 92.4%, 4.7%, and 2.9%, respectively of combined consolidated rent revenues and tenant reimbursements. The Properties contain an aggregate of approximately 185.6 million
square feet of GLA, of which 110.4 million square feet is owned by Simon Group ("Owned GLA"). More than 4,200 different retailers occupy more than 20,400 stores in the Properties. Total
estimated retail sales at the Properties in 2000 were approximately $38 billion.

SPG
and certain of its subsidiaries are taxed as REITs under sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and applicable Treasury
regulations relating to REIT qualification. SPG is self-administered and self-managed and does not engage or pay a REIT advisor. SPG provides management, development, leasing,
accounting, finance and legal, design and construction expertise through its own personnel or, where appropriate, through outside professionals.

Operating Strategies

Simon Group's primary business objectives are to increase cash generated from operations per Paired Share and the value of the Portfolio Properties. Simon
Group plans to achieve these objectives


through a variety of methods discussed below, although no assurance can be made that such objectives will be achieved.

Leasing.

Simon Group pursues an active leasing strategy, which includes aggressively marketing available space; renewing existing leases at
higher base rents per square foot; and continuing to sign leases that provide for percentage rents and/or regular or periodic fixed contractual increases in base rents.

Management.

Drawing upon the expertise gained through management of a geographically diverse Portfolio nationally recognized as high quality
retail and mixed-use Properties, Simon Group seeks to maximize cash flow through a combination of an active merchandising program to maintain its shopping centers as inviting shopping
destinations, continuation of its successful efforts to minimize overhead and operating costs, coordinated marketing and promotional activities directed towards establishing and maintaining customer
loyalty, and systematic planning and monitoring of results.

E-Commerce.

Simon Group is developing unique programs designed to take advantage of new retail opportunities of the digital age.
Elements of the strategy include digitizing the existing assets of the Properties by implementing internet web sites for each of the Properties, creating products that leverage the digitalization of
consumers and Simon merchants through an enhanced broadband network called MerchantWired, LLC and clixnmortar.

Acquisitions.

Simon Group may selectively acquire individual properties and portfolios of properties that meet its investment criteria as
opportunities arise. Management believes, however, that due to the rapid consolidation of the regional mall business, coupled with the current status of the capital markets, that acquisition activity
in the near term will be a less significant component of the Companies' growth strategy.

Development in North America.

Simon Group's strategy is to selectively develop new properties in major metropolitan areas that exhibit strong
population and economic growth. During 2000, Simon Group opened one specialty center, and one value-oriented super-regional mall. These additions added approximately 1.7 million square feet of
GLA to the Portfolio at a cost to Simon Group of approximately $162 million. Simon Group also has two additional projects under construction, which are scheduled to open in 2001.

Strategic Expansions and Renovations.

A key objective of Simon Group is to increase the profitability and market share of the Properties through
the completion of strategic renovations and expansions. During 2000, Simon Group invested approximately $202 million on redevelopment projects and completed five major redevelopment projects.
Simon Group has a number of renovation and/or expansion projects currently under construction, or in preconstruction development.

Simon
Group also has direct or indirect interests in eleven parcels of land being held for future development in eight states totaling approximately 772 acres. Management believes Simon Group is well
positioned to pursue future development opportunities as conditions warrant.

International Expansion.

Simon Group's management believes the expertise it has gained through the development and management of its domestic
Portfolio can be utilized in retail properties throughout the world. Simon Group intends to continue pursuing international opportunities on a selected basis to enhance the value of its Paired Shares.

B2B and B2C Initiatives.

Simon Group recently formed Simon Brand Ventures, LLC ("SBV"), a business to consumer initiative, and Simon Business
Network ("SBN"), a business-to-business initiative to continue to take advantage of Simon Group's size and tenant relationships, primarily through strategic corporate
alliances. SBV is focused on leveraging Simon Group's 100 million unique shoppers and their 2 billion annual shopping visits to contribute to Simon Group's second-


curve revenue strategy. The SBV concept and initiatives were started in 1997 to create an exciting new medium for connecting consumers with retailers and sponsors by developing a unique and compelling
combination of shopping, entertainment and community. SBN is focused on leveraging Simon Group's assets to create new businesses which will drive greater value to its Portfolio Properties, retailers
and other developers and generate new sources of revenue for Simon Group. SBN's strategy is to provide a competitively valued, broad-based offering of products and services via a unique and dominant
business-to-business marketplace and service network focused on the real estate industry and their tenants.

Competition

Simon Group believes that it has a competitive advantage in the retail real estate business as a result of (i) the size, quality and diversity of its
Properties, (ii) its use of innovative retailing concepts, (iii) its management and operational expertise, (iv) its extensive experience and relationships with retailers and
lenders, (v) the mall marketing initiatives of SBV, which Simon Group believes is the world's largest and most sophisticated mall marketing initiative, and (vi) the B2Binitiatives of
SBN. Management believes that the Properties are the largest, as measured by GLA, of any publicly traded REIT, with more regional malls than any other publicly traded REIT. For these reasons,
management believes Simon Group to be the leader in the industry.

All
of the Portfolio Properties are located in developed areas. With respect to certain of such properties, there are other properties of the same type within the market area. The
existence of competitive properties could have a material adverse effect on Simon Group's ability to lease space and on the level of rents Simon Group can obtain.

There
are numerous commercial developers, real estate companies and other owners of real estate that compete with Simon Group in its trade areas. This results in competition for both
acquisition of prime sites (including land for development and operating properties) and for tenants to occupy the space that Simon Group and its competitors develop and manage.

Environmental Matters

General Compliance.

Management believes that the Portfolio Properties are in compliance, in all material respects, with
all Federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances (see Item 3. Legal Proceedings). Nearly all of the Portfolio Properties have been
subjected to Phase I or similar environmental audits (which generally involve only a review of records and visual inspection of the property without soil sampling or ground water analysis) by
independent environmental consultants. The Phase I environmental audits are intended to discover information regarding, and to evaluate the environmental condition of, the surveyed properties and
surrounding properties. The environmental audits have not revealed, nor is management aware of, any environmental liability that management believes will have a material adverse effect on Simon Group.
No assurance can be given that existing environmental studies with respect to the Portfolio Properties reveal all potential environmental liabilities; that any previous owner, occupant or tenant of a
Portfolio Property did not create any material environmental condition not known to management; that the current environmental condition of the Portfolio Properties will not be affected by tenants and
occupants, by the condition of nearby properties, or by unrelated third parties; or that future uses or condition (including, without limitation, changes in applicable environmental laws and
regulations or the interpretation thereof) will not result in imposition of additional environmental liability.

Asbestos-Containing Materials.

Asbestos-containing materials are present in most of the Properties, primarily in the
form of vinyl asbestos tile, mastics and roofing materials, which are generally in good condition. Fireproofing and insulation containing asbestos is also present in certain Properties in limited
concentrations or in limited areas. The presence of such asbestos-containing materials does not


violate currently applicable laws. Simon Group will remove asbestos-containing materials in the ordinary course of any renovation, reconstruction and expansion, and in connection with the retenanting
of space.

Underground Storage Tanks.

Several of the Portfolio Properties contain, or at one time contained, underground storage
tanks used to store waste oils or other petroleum products primarily related to auto services center establishments or emergency electrical generation equipment. All regulated tanks
have been removed, upgraded or abandoned in place in accordance with applicable environmental laws. Site assessments have revealed certain soil and groundwater contamination associated with such tanks
at some of these Properties. Subsurface investigations (Phase II assessments) and remediation activities are either ongoing or scheduled to be conducted at such Properties. The cost of remediation
with respect to such matters has not been and is not expected to be material.

Properties to be Developed or Acquired.

Land held for shopping mall development or that may be acquired for development
may contain residues or debris associated with the use of the land by prior owners or third parties. In certain instances, such residues or debris could be or contain hazardous wastes or hazardous
substances. Prior to exercising any option to acquire any of the optioned properties, Simon Group will conduct environmental due diligence consistent with past practice.

Employees

Simon Group and its affiliates employ approximately 5,370 persons at various centers and offices throughout the United States, of which 2,590 are
part-time. Approximately 930 employees are located at Simon Group's headquarters.

Insurance

Simon Group has comprehensive liability, fire, flood, extended coverage and rental loss insurance with respect to its Properties. Management believes that such
insurance provides adequate coverage.

Corporate Headquarters

Simon Group's executive offices are located at National City Center, 115 West Washington Street, Indianapolis, Indiana 46204, and its telephone number is
(317) 636-1600.

Item 2. Properties

Portfolio Properties

The Properties primarily consist of two types: regional malls and community shopping centers. Regional malls generally contain two or more anchors and a wide
variety of smaller stores ("Mall" stores) located in enclosed malls connecting the anchors. Additional stores ("Freestanding" stores) are usually located along the perimeter of the parking area. The
165 regional malls in the Properties range in size from approximately 200,000 to 2.8 million square feet of GLA, with all but four regional malls over 400,000 square feet. These regional malls
contain in the aggregate more than 17,000 occupied stores, including over 650 anchors which are mostly national retailers. As of December 31, 2000, regional malls (including specialty retail
centers and retail space in the mixed-use Properties) represented 85.4% of total GLA, 80.4% of Owned GLA and 86.0% of total annualized base rent of the Properties.

Community
shopping centers are generally unenclosed and smaller than regional malls. Most of the 73 community shopping centers in the Properties range in size from approximately
50,000 to 600,000 square feet of GLA. Community shopping centers generally are of two types: (i) traditional community centers, which focus primarily on value-oriented and convenience goods and
services, are usually anchored by a supermarket, drugstore or discount retailer and are designed to service a neighborhood area; and (ii) power centers, which are designed to serve a larger
trade area and contain at least two anchors that are usually national retailers among the leaders in their markets and occupy more than 70% of the GLA in the center. As of December 31, 2000,
community shopping centers represented 9.7% of total GLA, 11.6% of Owned GLA and 6.0% of the total annualized base rent of the Properties.

Simon
Group also has interests in five specialty retail centers, four office and mixed-use Properties and five value-oriented super-regional malls. The specialty retail
centers contain approximately 1,838,000 square feet of GLA and do not have anchors; instead, they feature retailers and entertainment facilities in a distinctive shopping environment and location. The
four office and mixed-use Properties range in size from approximately 512,000 to 1,048,000 square feet of GLA. Two of these Properties are regional malls with connected office buildings,
and two are located in mixed-use developments and contain primarily office space. The value-oriented super-regional malls range in size from approximately 1.0 million to
1.6 million square feet of GLA. These Properties combine retail outlets, manufacturers'
off-price stores and other value-oriented tenants. As of December 31, 2000, value-oriented super-regional malls represented 3.5% of total GLA, 5.7% of Owned GLA and 5.7% of the
total annualized base rent of the Properties.

As
of December 31, 2000, approximately 91.8% of the Mall and Freestanding Owned GLA in regional malls, specialty retail centers and the retail space in the mixed use Properties
was leased, approximately 92.9% of the Owned GLA in the value-oriented super-regional malls was leased, and approximately 91.5% of Owned GLA in the community shopping centers was leased.

Of
the 252 Properties, 172 are owned 100% by Simon Group and the remainder are held as joint venture interests. Simon Group is the managing or co-managing general partner
or member of all but 15 of the Properties held as joint venture interests.

Ward stores, of which ten (10) are located at the Portfolio Properties. These transactions are subject to Bankruptcy Court approval.

There
is no established public trading market for SPG's Class B common stock or Class C common stock. Distributions per share of the Class B and Class C
common stock were identical to the other Paired Shares.

Holders

The number of holders of record of the Paired Shares was 2,390 as of March 19, 2001. Additionally, the Class B common stock is held entirely by a
voting trust to which Melvin Simon, Herbert Simon, David Simon and certain of their affiliates are parties and is exchangeable on a one-for-one basis into Paired Shares, and
the Class C common stock is held entirely by The Edward J. DeBartolo Corporation and is also exchangeable on a one-for-one basis into Paired Shares.

Distributions

SPG qualifies as a REIT under the Code. To maintain its status as a REIT, SPG is required each year to distribute to its shareholders at least 90% of its
taxable income after certain adjustments.

Future
distributions paid by the Companies will be at the discretion of the Boards of Directors and will depend on the actual cash flow of the Companies, their financial condition,
capital requirements,


the annual REIT distribution requirements and such other factors as the Board of Directors of the Companies deem relevant.

The
Companies have an Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan") which allows shareholders to acquire additional Paired Shares by automatically reinvesting cash dividends.
Paired Shares are acquired pursuant to the Plan at a price equal to the prevailing market price of such Paired Shares, without payment of any brokerage commission or service charge. Shareholders who
do not participate in the Plan continue to receive cash dividends, as declared.

The Registrants did not issue any equity securities that were not required to be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended during the fourth
quarter of 2000.

We
have audited in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States, the financial statements of SIMON PROPERTY GROUP, INC. and SPG REALTY
CONSULTANTS, INC. included in this Form 10-K and have issued our report thereon dated February 7, 2001. Our audits were made for the purpose of forming an opinion on
the basic financial statements taken as a whole. The schedule, "Schedule III: Real Estate and Accumulated Depreciation", as of December 31, 2000, of Simon Property Group, Inc. and
SPG Realty Consultants, Inc. is the responsibility of the Companies' management and is presented for purposes of complying with the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and is not part of
the basic financial statements. The schedule has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audits of the basic financial statements and, in our opinion, fairly states in all material
respects the financial data required to be set forth therein in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole.
