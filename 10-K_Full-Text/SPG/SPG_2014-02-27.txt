Part I

Item 1.    Business

Simon Property Group, Inc., or Simon Property, is a Delaware corporation that operates as a self-administered and self-managed
real estate investment trust, or REIT, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. REITs will generally not be liable for federal corporate income taxes as long as they continue to distribute
not less than 100% of their taxable income. Simon Property Group, L.P., or the Operating Partnership, is our majority-owned partnership subsidiary that owns all of our real estate properties
and other assets. In this discussion, the terms "we", "us" and "our" refer to Simon Property, the Operating Partnership, and its subsidiaries.

We
own, develop and manage retail real estate properties, which consist primarily of malls, Premium Outlets®, The Mills®, and community/lifestyle centers. As of
December 31, 2013, we owned or held an interest in 308 income-producing properties in the United States, which consisted of 156 malls, 66 Premium Outlets, 62 community/lifestyle centers, 13
Mills and 11 other shopping centers or outlet centers in 38 states and Puerto Rico. We have several Premium Outlets under development and have redevelopment and expansion projects, including the
addition of anchors and big box tenants, underway at more than 25 properties in the U.S., Asia, and Mexico. Internationally, as of December 31, 2013, we had ownership interests in nine Premium
Outlets in Japan, three Premium Outlets in South Korea, one Premium Outlet in Canada, one Premium Outlet in Mexico, and one Premium Outlet in Malaysia. In 2013, we acquired noncontrolling interests in
five operating properties in Europe through our joint venture with McArthurGlen. Of the five properties, two are located in Italy and one each is located in Austria, the Netherlands, and the United
Kingdom. Additionally, as of December 31, 2013, we owned a 28.9% equity stake in Klépierre SA, or Klépierre, a publicly traded, Paris-based real estate
company, which owns, or has an interest in, shopping centers located in 13 countries in Europe.

On
December 13, 2013, we announced a plan to spin off our interests in 98 properties comprised of substantially all of our strip center business and our smaller enclosed malls
into an independent, publicly traded REIT (SpinCo). The spin-off is expected to be effectuated through a pro rata special distribution of all of the outstanding common shares of SpinCo to holders of
Simon Property common stock as of the distribution record date, and is expected to qualify as a tax-free distribution for U.S. federal income tax purposes. At the time of the separation and
distribution, SpinCo will own a percentage of the outstanding units of partnership interest of SpinCo L.P. that is equal to the percentage of outstanding units of partnership interest of the Operating
Partnership owned by Simon Property, with the remaining units of SpinCo L.P. owned by the limited partners of the Operating Partnership. We expect the transaction will become effective in the second
quarter of 2014. The transaction is subject to certain conditions, including declaration by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that SpinCo's registration statement on Form 10 is
effective, filing and approval of SpinCo's listing application, customary third party consents, and formal approval and declaration of the distribution by our Board of Directors. We may, at any time
and for any reason until the proposed transaction is complete, abandon the spin-off or modify or change its terms.

For
a description of our operational strategies and developments in our business during 2013, see Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations" of this Form 10-K.

Other Policies

The following is a discussion of our investment policies, financing policies, conflict of interest policies and policies with respect
to certain other activities. One or more of these policies may be amended or rescinded from time to time without a stockholder vote.

Investment Policies

While we emphasize equity real estate investments, we may also provide secured financing to or invest in equity or debt securities of
other entities engaged in real estate activities or securities of other issuers. However, any of these investments would be subject to the percentage ownership limitations and gross income tests
necessary for REIT qualification. These REIT limitations mean that we cannot make an investment that would cause our real estate assets to be less than 75% of our total assets. We must also derive at
least 75% of our gross income directly or indirectly from investments relating to real property or mortgages on real property, including "rents from real property," dividends from other REITs and, in
certain circumstances, interest from certain types of temporary investments. In addition, we must also derive at least 95% of our gross income from such real property investments, and from dividends,
interest and gains from the sale or dispositions of stock or securities or from other combinations of the foregoing.



Subject
to REIT limitations, we may invest in the securities of other issuers in connection with acquisitions of indirect interests in real estate. Such an investment would normally be
in the form of general or limited partnership or membership interests in special purpose partnerships and limited liability companies that own one or more properties. We may, in the future, acquire
all or substantially all of the securities or assets of other REITs, management companies or similar entities where such investments would be consistent with our investment policies.

Financing Policies

Because our REIT qualification requires us to distribute at least 90% of our taxable income, we regularly access the debt markets to
raise the funds necessary to finance acquisitions, develop and redevelop properties, and refinance maturing debt. We must comply with the covenants contained in our financing agreements that limit our
ratio of debt to total assets or market value, as defined. For example, the Operating Partnership's line of credit and the indentures for the Operating Partnership's debt securities contain covenants
that restrict the total amount of debt of the Operating Partnership to 65%, or 60% in relation to certain debt, of total assets, as defined under the related arrangement, and secured debt to 50% of
total assets. In addition, these agreements contain other covenants requiring compliance with financial ratios. Furthermore, the amount of debt that we may incur is limited as a practical matter by
our desire to maintain acceptable ratings for our equity securities and the debt securities of the Operating Partnership. We strive to maintain investment grade ratings at all times, but we cannot
assure you that we will be able to do so in the future.

If
our Board of Directors determines to seek additional capital, we may raise such capital by offering equity or debt securities, creating joint ventures with existing ownership
interests in properties, entering into joint venture arrangements for new development projects, retaining cash flows or a combination of these methods. If the Board
of Directors determines to raise equity capital, it may, without stockholder approval, issue additional shares of common stock or other capital stock. The Board of Directors may issue a number of
shares up to the amount of our authorized capital in any manner and on such terms and for such consideration as it deems appropriate. Such securities may be senior to the outstanding classes of common
stock. Such securities also may include additional classes of preferred stock, which may be convertible into common stock. Existing stockholders have no preemptive right to purchase shares in any
subsequent offering of our securities. Any such offering could dilute a stockholder's investment in us.

We
expect most future borrowings would be made through the Operating Partnership or its subsidiaries. We might, however, incur borrowings that would be reloaned to the Operating
Partnership. Borrowings may be in the form of bank borrowings, publicly and privately placed debt instruments, or purchase money obligations to the sellers of properties. Any such indebtedness may be
secured or unsecured. Any such indebtedness may also have full or limited recourse to the borrower or cross-collateralized with other debt, or may be fully or partially guaranteed by the Operating
Partnership. Although we may borrow to fund the payment of dividends, we currently have no expectation that we will regularly do so.

The
Operating Partnership has an unsecured revolving credit facility, or Credit Facility. The Credit Facility's initial borrowing capacity of $4.0 billion can be increased at our
sole option to $5.0 billion during its term. The Credit Facility will initially mature on October 30, 2015 and can be extended for an additional year at our sole option. We also have an
additional unsecured revolving credit facility, or Supplemental Facility, with an initial borrowing capacity of $2.0 billion which can be increased at our sole option to $2.5 billion
during its term. The Supplemental Facility will initially mature on June 30, 2016 and can be extended for an additional year at our sole option. We issue debt securities through the Operating
Partnership, but we may issue our debt securities which may be convertible into capital stock or be accompanied by warrants to purchase capital stock. We also may sell or securitize our lease
receivables.

We
may also finance acquisitions through the following:

•

issuance of shares of common stock or preferred stock;

•

issuance of additional units of limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership, or units;

•

issuance of preferred units of the Operating Partnership;

•

issuance of other securities including unsecured notes and mortgage debt;

•

draws on our credit facilities; or

•

sale or exchange of ownership interests in properties.



The
Operating Partnership may also issue units to transferors of properties or other partnership interests which may permit the transferor to defer gain recognition for tax purposes.

We
do not have a policy limiting the number or amount of mortgages that may be placed on any particular property. Mortgage financing instruments, however, usually limit additional
indebtedness on such properties. Additionally, our unsecured credit facilities, unsecured note indentures and other contracts may limit our ability to borrow and contain limits on mortgage
indebtedness we may incur.

Typically,
we invest in or form special purpose entities to assist us in obtaining secured permanent financing at attractive terms. Permanent financing may be structured as a mortgage
loan on a single property, or on a group of properties, and generally requires us to provide a mortgage lien on the property or properties in favor of an institutional third party, as a joint venture
with a third party, or as a securitized financing. For securitized financings, we create special purpose entities to own the properties. These special purpose entities, which are common in the real
estate industry, are structured so that they would not be consolidated in a bankruptcy proceeding involving a parent company. We decide upon the structure of the financing based upon the best terms
then available to us and whether the proposed financing is consistent with our other business objectives. For accounting purposes, we include the outstanding securitized debt of special purpose
entities owning consolidated properties as part of our consolidated indebtedness.

Conflict of Interest Policies

We maintain policies and have entered into agreements designed to reduce or eliminate potential conflicts of interest. We have adopted
governance principles governing the function, conduct, selection, orientation and duties of our Board of Directors and the Company, as well as written charters for each of the standing Committees of
the Board of Directors. In addition, we have a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which applies to all of our officers, directors, and employees and those of our subsidiaries. At least a majority of
the members of our Board of Directors must qualify as independent under the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, and cannot be affiliated with the Simon family who are
significant stockholders and/or
unitholders in the Operating Partnership. In addition, the Audit and Compensation Committees of our Board of Directors are comprised of independent members who meet the additional independence
requirements of the NYSE. Any transaction between us and the Simons, including property acquisitions, service and property management agreements and retail space leases, must be approved by a majority
of our independent directors.

The
sale by the Operating Partnership of any property that it owns may have an adverse tax impact on the Simons and/or other limited partners of the Operating Partnership. In order to
avoid any conflict of interest between Simon Property and the Simons, our charter requires that at least six of our independent directors must authorize and require the Operating Partnership to sell
any property it owns. Any such sale is subject to applicable agreements with third parties. Noncompetition agreements executed by Herbert Simon and David Simon contain covenants limiting their ability
to participate in certain shopping center activities.

Policies With Respect To Certain Other Activities

We intend to make investments which are consistent with our qualification as a REIT, unless the Board of Directors determines that it
is no longer in our best interests to so qualify as a REIT. The Board of Directors may make such a determination because of changing circumstances or changes in the REIT requirements. We have
authority to offer shares of our capital stock or other securities in exchange for property. We also have authority to repurchase or otherwise reacquire our shares or any other securities. We may
issue shares of our common stock, or cash at our option, to holders of units in future periods upon exercise of such holders' rights under the Operating Partnership agreement. Our policy prohibits us
from making any loans to our directors or executive officers for any purpose. We may make loans to the joint ventures in which we participate. Additionally, we may make or buy interests in loans for
real estate properties owned by others.

Competition

The retail industry is dynamic and competitive. We compete with numerous merchandise distribution channels including malls, outlet
centers, community/lifestyle centers, and other shopping centers in the United States and abroad. We also compete with internet retailing sites and catalogs which provide retailers with distribution
options beyond existing brick and mortar retail properties. The existence of competitive alternatives could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease space and on the level of rents we
can obtain. This results in competition for both the tenants to occupy



the
properties that we develop and manage as well as for the acquisition of prime sites (including land for development and operating properties). We believe that there are numerous factors that make
our properties highly desirable to retailers including:

•

the quality, location and diversity of our properties;

•

our management and operational expertise;

•

our extensive experience and relationships with retailers and lenders; and

•

our mall marketing initiatives and consumer focused strategic corporate alliances.

During the past three years, we have:

•

issued 7,975,779 shares of common stock upon the exchange of 8,628,404 units of the Operating Partnership;

•

issued 338,074 restricted shares of common stock and 1,960,333 long-term incentive performance units, or LTIP units, net of

Item 1A.    Risk Factors

The following factors, among others, could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in
forward-looking statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and presented elsewhere by our management from time to time. These factors may have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, operating results and cash flows, and you should carefully consider them. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or which are currently not believed to be
material may also affect our actual results. We may update these factors in our future periodic reports.

Risks Relating to Debt and the Financial Markets

We have a substantial debt burden that could affect our future operations.

As of December 31, 2013, our consolidated mortgages and unsecured indebtedness, excluding related premium and discount, totaled
$23.6 billion. We are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow from operations will be insufficient to meet required debt service. Our
debt service costs generally will not be reduced if developments at the property, such as the entry of new competitors or the loss of major tenants, cause a reduction in the income from the property.
Should such events occur, our operations may be adversely affected. If a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and income from such property is insufficient to pay that indebtedness,
the property could be foreclosed upon by the mortgagee resulting in a loss of income and a decline in our total asset value.

Disruption in the credit markets or downgrades in our credit ratings may adversely affect our ability to access external financings for our growth and ongoing debt service
requirements.

We depend on external financings, principally debt financings, to fund the growth of our business and to ensure that we can meet
ongoing maturities of our outstanding debt. Our access to financing depends on our credit rating, the willingness of banks to lend to us and conditions in the capital markets. We cannot assure you
that we will be able to obtain the financing we need for future growth or to meet our debt service as obligations mature, or that the financing available to us will be on acceptable terms.

Adverse changes in our credit rating could affect our borrowing capacity and borrowing terms.

Our outstanding senior unsecured notes and preferred stock are periodically rated by nationally recognized credit rating agencies. The
credit ratings are based on our operating performance, liquidity and leverage ratios, overall financial position, and other factors viewed by the credit rating agencies as relevant to our industry and
the economic outlook in general. Our credit rating can affect the amount of capital we can access, as well as the terms of any financing we obtain. Since we depend primarily on debt financing to fund
our growth, adverse changes in our credit rating could have a negative effect on our future growth.

Our hedging interest rate protection arrangements may not effectively limit our interest rate risk.

We selectively manage our exposure to interest rate risk by a combination of interest rate protection agreements to effectively fix or
cap a portion of our variable rate debt. In addition, we refinance fixed rate debt at times when we believe rates and terms are appropriate. Our efforts to manage these exposures may not be
successful.

Our
use of interest rate hedging arrangements to manage risk associated with interest rate volatility may expose us to additional risks, including a risk that a counterparty to a
hedging arrangement may fail to honor its obligations. Developing an effective interest rate risk strategy is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest
rate fluctuations. There can be no assurance that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition. Termination of these hedging
agreements typically involves costs, such as transaction fees or breakage costs.

Factors Affecting Real Estate Investments and Operations

We face risks associated with the acquisition, development, redevelopment and expansion of properties.

We regularly acquire and develop new properties and expand and redevelop existing properties, and these activities are subject to
various risks. We may not be successful in pursuing acquisition, development or redevelopment/expansion opportunities. In addition, newly acquired, developed or redeveloped/expanded properties may not
perform as



well
as expected. We are subject to other risks in connection with any acquisition, development and redevelopment/expansion activities, including the
following:

•

construction costs of a project may be higher than projected, potentially making the project unfeasible or unprofitable;

•

we may not be able to obtain financing or to refinance loans on favorable terms, if at all;

•

we may be unable to obtain zoning, occupancy or other governmental approvals;

•

occupancy rates and rents may not meet our projections and the project may not be profitable; and

•

we may need the consent of third parties such as department stores, anchor tenants, mortgage lenders and joint venture
partners, and those consents may be withheld.

If
a development or redevelopment/expansion project is unsuccessful, either because it is not meeting our expectations when operational or was not completed according to the project
planning, we could lose our investment in the project. Further, if we guarantee the property's financing, our loss could exceed our investment in the project.

Real estate investments are relatively illiquid.

Our properties represent a substantial portion of our total consolidated assets. These investments are relatively illiquid. As a
result, our ability to sell one or more of our properties or investments in real estate in response to any changes in economic or other conditions may be limited. If we want to sell a property, we
cannot assure you that we will be able to dispose of it in the desired time period or that the sales price of a property will exceed the cost of our investment.

Our international expansion may subject us to different or greater risk from those associated with our domestic operations.

As of December 31, 2013, we held interests in joint venture properties that operate in Austria, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico,
the Netherlands, South Korea, Canada, and the United Kingdom. We also have an equity stake in Klépierre, a publicly-traded European real estate company. Accordingly, our operating
results and the value of our international operations may be impacted by any unhedged movements in the foreign currencies in which those operations transact and in which our net investment in the
foreign operation is held. We may pursue
additional expansion and development opportunities outside the United States. International development and ownership activities carry risks that are different from those we face with our domestic
properties and operations. These risks include:

•

adverse effects of changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies;

•

changes in foreign political and economic environments, regionally, nationally, and locally;

•

challenges of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws including corporate governance, operations, taxes, and
litigation;

•

differing lending practices;

•

differences in cultures;

•

changes in applicable laws and regulations in the United States that affect foreign operations;

•

difficulties in managing international operations; and

•

obstacles to the repatriation of earnings and cash.

Although
our international activities currently are a relatively small portion of our business (international properties represented approximately 8.4% of net operating income, or NOI,
for the year ended December 31, 2013), to the extent that we expand our international activities, these risks could increase in significance which in turn could adversely affect our results of
operations and financial condition.

Environmental Risks

As owners of real estate, we can face liabilities for environmental contamination.

Federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require us, as a current or previous
owner or operator of real property, to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or



petroleum
product releases at a property or at impacted neighboring properties. These laws often impose liability regardless of whether the property owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for,
the presence of hazardous or toxic substances. These laws and regulations may require the abatement or removal of asbestos containing materials in the event of damage, demolition or renovation,
reconstruction or expansion of a property and also govern emissions of and exposure to asbestos fibers in the air. Those laws and regulations also govern the installation, maintenance and removal of
underground storage tanks used to store waste oils or other petroleum products. Many of our properties contain, or at one time contained, asbestos containing materials or underground storage tanks
(primarily related to auto service center establishments or emergency electrical generation equipment). The costs of investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances may be
substantial and could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition but is not estimable. The presence of contamination, or the failure to remediate contamination, may also
adversely affect our ability to sell, lease or redevelop a property or to borrow using a property as collateral.

Our efforts to identify environmental liabilities may not be successful.

Although we believe that our portfolio is in substantial compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and
regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances, this belief is based on limited testing. Nearly all of our properties have been subjected to Phase I or similar environmental audits. These
environmental audits have not revealed, nor are we aware of, any environmental liability that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.
However, we cannot assure you that:

•

existing environmental studies with respect to the portfolio reveal all potential environmental liabilities;

•

any previous owner, occupant or tenant of a property did not create any material environmental condition not known to us;

•

the current environmental condition of the portfolio will not be affected by tenants and occupants, by the condition of
nearby properties, or by other unrelated third parties; or

•

future uses or conditions (including, without limitation, changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations or the
interpretation thereof) will not result in environmental liabilities.

Retail Operations Risks

Overall economic conditions may adversely affect the general retail environment.

Our concentration in the retail real estate market means that we are subject to the risks that affect the retail environment generally,
including the levels of consumer spending, seasonality, the willingness of retailers to lease space in our shopping centers, tenant bankruptcies, changes in economic conditions, increasing use of the
internet by retailers and consumers, consumer confidence, casualties and other natural disasters, and the potential for terrorist activities. The economy and consumer spending appear to be recovering
from the effects of the recent recession. We derive our cash flow from operations primarily from retail tenants, many of whom have been and continue to be under some degree of economic stress. A
significant deterioration in our cash flow from operations could require us to curtail planned capital expenditures or seek alternative sources of financing.

We may not be able to lease newly developed properties and renew leases and relet space at existing properties.

We may not be able to lease new properties to an appropriate mix of tenants or for rents that are consistent with our projections.
Also, when leases for our existing properties expire, the premises may not be relet or the terms of reletting, including the cost of allowances and concessions to tenants, may be less favorable than
the current lease terms. To the extent that our leasing plans are not achieved, our cash generated before debt repayments and capital expenditures could be adversely affected. Changes in economic and
operating conditions that occur subsequent to our review of recoverability of investment property and other assets could impact the assumptions used in that assessment and could result in future
charges to earnings if assumptions regarding those investments differ from actual results.

Some of our properties depend on anchor stores or major tenants to attract shoppers and could be adversely affected by the loss of one or more of these anchor stores or
major tenants.

Our properties are typically anchored by department stores and other large nationally recognized tenants. The value of some of our
properties could be materially adversely affected if these department stores or major tenants fail to comply with their contractual obligations or cease their operations.



For
example, among department stores and other large stores — often referred to as "big box" stores — corporate merger activity typically results
in the closure of duplicate or geographically overlapping store locations. Further sustained adverse pressure on the results of our department stores and major tenants may have a similarly sustained
adverse impact upon our own results. Certain department stores and other national retailers have experienced, and may continue to experience for the foreseeable future given current macroeconomic
uncertainty and less-than-desirable levels of consumer confidence, considerable decreases in customer traffic in their retail stores, increased competition from alternative retail options such as
those accessible via the Internet and other forms of pressure on their business models. As pressure on these department stores and national retailers increases, their ability to maintain their stores,
meet their obligations both to us and to their external lenders and suppliers, withstand takeover attempts by investors or rivals or avoid bankruptcy and/or liquidation may be impaired and result in
closures of their stores. Other tenants may be entitled to modify the economic or other terms of their existing leases in the event of such closures. The modification could be unfavorable to us as the
lessor, and could decrease rents or expense recovery charges.

Additionally,
department store or major tenant closures may result in decreased customer traffic, which could lead to decreased sales at our properties. If the sales of stores operating
in our properties were to decline significantly due to the closing of anchor stores or other national retailers, adverse economic conditions, or other reasons, tenants may be unable to pay their
minimum rents or expense recovery charges. In the event of any default by a tenant, we may not be able to fully recover, and/or may experience delays and costs in enforcing our rights as landlord to
recover, amounts due to us under the terms of our agreements with such parties.

We face potential adverse effects from tenant bankruptcies.

Bankruptcy filings by retailers occur regularly in the course of our operations. We continually seek to re-lease vacant spaces
resulting from tenant terminations. The bankruptcy of a tenant, particularly an anchor tenant, may make it more difficult to lease the remainder of the affected properties. Future tenant bankruptcies
could adversely affect our properties or impact our ability to successfully execute our re-leasing strategy.

We face a wide range of competition that could affect our ability to operate profitably.

Our properties compete with other retail properties and other forms of retailing such as catalogs and e-commerce websites. Competition
may come from malls, outlet centers, community/lifestyle centers, and other shopping centers, both existing as well as future development projects, as well as catalogs and e-commerce. The presence of
competitive alternatives affects our ability to lease space and the level of rents we can obtain. New construction, renovations and expansions at competing sites could also negatively affect our
properties.

We
also compete with other retail property developers to acquire prime development sites. In addition, we compete with other retail property companies for tenants and qualified
management.

Risks Relating to Joint Venture Properties and our Investment in Klépierre

We have limited control with respect to some properties that are partially owned or managed by third parties, which may adversely affect our ability to sell or refinance
them.

As of December 31, 2013, we owned interests in 111 income-producing properties with other parties. Of those, 18 properties are
included in our consolidated financial statements. We account for the other 93 properties, or the joint venture properties, as well as our investment in Klépierre, using the equity
method of accounting. We serve as general partner or property manager for 70 of these 93 properties; however, certain major decisions, such as approving the operating budget and selling, refinancing
and redeveloping the properties require the consent of the other owners. Of the properties for which we do not serve as general partner or property manager, 20 are in our international joint ventures.
The international properties are managed locally by joint ventures in which we share control of the properties with our partner. The other owners have participating rights that we consider substantive
for purposes of determining control over the properties' assets. The remaining joint
venture properties and Klépierre are managed by third parties. These limitations may adversely affect our ability to sell, refinance, or otherwise operate these properties.

The Operating Partnership guarantees debt or otherwise provides support for a number of joint venture properties.

Joint venture debt is the liability of the joint venture and is typically secured by a mortgage on the joint venture property, which is
non-recourse to us. As of December 31, 2013, the Operating Partnership guaranteed joint venture related mortgage indebtedness of $190.8 million (of which we have a right of recovery from
our venture partners of



$83.0 million).
A default by a joint venture under its debt obligations may expose us to liability under a guaranty or letter of credit. We may elect to fund cash needs of a joint venture
through equity contributions (generally on a basis proportionate to our ownership interests), advances or partner loans, although such fundings are not typically required contractually or otherwise.

Other Factors Affecting Our Business

Some of our potential losses may not be covered by insurance.

We maintain insurance coverage with third party carriers who provide a portion of the coverage for specific layers of potential losses
including commercial general liability, fire, flood, extended coverage and rental loss insurance on all of our properties in the United States. The initial portion of coverage not provided by third
party carriers is either insured through our wholly-owned captive insurance companies or other financial arrangements controlled by us. A third party carrier has, in turn, agreed to provide evidence
of coverage for this layer of losses under the terms and conditions of the carrier's policy. A similar policy written through our captive insurance entities also provides initial coverage for property
insurance and certain windstorm risks at the properties located in coastal windstorm locations.

There
are some types of losses, including lease and other contract claims, which generally are not insured. If an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs, we could
lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenue it could generate.

We
currently maintain insurance coverage against acts of terrorism on all of our properties in the United States on an "all risk" basis in the amount of up to $1 billion. The
current federal laws which provide this coverage are expected to operate through 2014. Despite the existence of this insurance coverage, any threatened or actual terrorist attacks where we operate
could adversely affect our property values, revenues, consumer traffic and tenant sales.

Risks Relating to Income Taxes

We have elected to be taxed as a REIT in the United States and certain of our international operations currently receive favorable tax treatment.

We are subject to certain income-based taxes, both domestically and internationally, and other taxes, including state and local taxes,
franchise taxes, and withholding taxes on dividends from certain of our international investments. We currently receive favorable tax treatment in various domestic and international jurisdictions
through tax rules and regulations or through international treaties. Should we no longer receive such benefits, the amount of taxes we pay may increase.

In
the U.S., we have elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code. We believe we have been organized and operated in a manner which
allows us to qualify for taxation as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code. We intend to continue to operate in this manner. However, our qualification and taxation as a REIT depend upon our ability
to meet, through actual annual operating results, asset diversification, distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership, the various qualification tests imposed under the Internal Revenue Code.
REIT qualification is governed by highly technical and complex provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations. Accordingly, there is no assurance that we have
operated or will continue to operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT.

If
we fail to comply with those provisions, we may be subject to monetary penalties or ultimately to possible disqualification as a REIT. If such events occurs, and if available relief
provisions do not apply:

•

we will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income;

•

we will be subject to corporate level income tax, including any applicable alternative minimum tax, on our taxable income
at regular corporate rates; and

•

unless entitled to relief under relevant statutory provisions, we will also be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for
the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost.

Item 2.    Properties

United States Properties

Our U.S. properties primarily consist of malls, Premium Outlets, The Mills, community/lifestyle centers, and other properties. These
properties contain an aggregate of approximately 236.6 million square feet of gross leasable area, or GLA.

Malls
typically contain at least one traditional department store anchor or a combination of anchors and big box retailers with a wide variety of smaller stores connecting the anchors.
Additional stores are usually located along the perimeter of the parking area. Our 156 malls are generally enclosed centers and range in size from approximately 400,000 to 2.5 million square
feet of GLA. Our malls contain in the aggregate more than 17,100 occupied stores, including approximately 674 anchors, which are predominately national retailers.

Premium
Outlets generally contain a wide variety of designer and manufacturer stores located in open-air centers. Our 66 Premium Outlets range in size from approximately 150,000 to
850,000 square feet of GLA. The Premium Outlets are generally located near major metropolitan areas and/or tourist destinations.

The
13 properties in The Mills generally range in size from 1.0 million to 2.3 million square feet of GLA and are located in major metropolitan areas. They have a
combination of traditional mall, outlet center, and big box retailers and entertainment uses.

Community/lifestyle
centers are generally unenclosed and smaller than our malls. Our 62 community/lifestyle centers generally range in size from approximately 100,000 to 950,000 square
feet of GLA. Community/lifestyle centers are designed to serve a larger trade area and typically contain anchor stores and other national retail tenants, which occupy a significant portion of the GLA
of the center. We also own traditional community shopping centers that focus primarily on value-oriented and convenience goods and services. These centers are usually anchored by a supermarket,
discount retailer, or drugstore and are designed to service a neighborhood area. Finally, we own open-air centers adjacent to our malls designed to take advantage of the drawing power of the mall.

We
also have interests in 11 other shopping centers or outlet centers. These properties range in size from approximately 200,000 to 1.0 million square feet of GLA, are considered
non-core to our business model, and in total represent less than 1% of our total operating income before depreciation and amortization.

As
of December 31, 2013, approximately 96.1% of the owned GLA in malls and Premium Outlets was leased, approximately 98.5% of the owned GLA for The Mills was leased and
approximately 95.0% of the owned GLA in the community/lifestyle centers was leased.

We
wholly own 217 of our properties, effectively control 18 properties in which we have a joint venture interest, and hold the remaining 73 properties through unconsolidated joint
venture interests. We are the managing or co-managing general partner or member of 305 properties. Certain of our joint venture properties are subject to various rights of first refusal, buy-sell
provisions, put and call rights, or other sale or marketing rights for partners which are customary in real estate partnership agreements and the industry. We and our partners in these joint ventures
may initiate these provisions (subject to any applicable lock up or similar restrictions) which may result in either the sale of our interest or the use of available cash or borrowings, or the use of
Operating Partnership units, to acquire the joint venture interest from our partner.

The
following property table summarizes certain data for our malls and Premium Outlets, The Mills, and community/lifestyle centers located in the United States, including Puerto Rico,
as of December 31, 2013.

International Properties

Our ownership interests in properties outside the United States are primarily owned through joint venture arrangements.

European Investments

On March 14, 2012, we completed an acquisition of a 28.7% interest in Klépierre for approximately
$2.0 billion. At December 31, 2013 we owned 57,634,148 shares, or approximately 28.9%, of Klépierre, which had a quoted market price of $46.53 per share.
Klépierre is a publicly traded, Paris-based real estate company, which owns, or has an interest in, shopping centers located in 13 countries in Europe.

During
the second quarter of 2013, we signed a definitive agreement with McArthurGlen, an owner, developer, and manager of designer outlets, to form one or more joint ventures to invest
in certain of its existing designer outlets, development projects, and its property management and development companies. In conjunction with that agreement, we purchased a noncontrolling interest in
the property management and development companies of McArthurGlen, and a noncontrolling interest in a development property located in Vancouver, British Columbia. On August 2, 2013 we acquired
a noncontrolling interest in Ashford Designer Outlets in Kent, UK. On October 16, 2013 we completed the remaining transactions contemplated by our previously announced definitive agreement with
McArthurGlen by acquiring noncontrolling interests in portions of four existing McArthurGlen Designer Outlets — Parndorf (Vienna, Austria), La Reggia (Naples, Italy), Noventa di
Piave (Venice, Italy), and Roermond (Roermond, Netherlands). Our legal ownership interests in these entities range from 22.5% to 90%.

We
own a 13.3% interest in Value Retail PLC and affiliated entities, which own and operate nine luxury outlets throughout Europe. We also have a minority direct ownership in
three of those outlets.

Other International Investments

We also hold a 40% interest in nine operating joint venture properties in Japan, a 50% interest in three operating joint venture
properties in South Korea, a 50% interest in one operating joint venture property in Mexico, a 50% interest in one operating joint venture property in Malaysia, and a 50% interest in one operating
joint venture property in Canada. The nine Japanese Premium Outlets operate in various cities throughout Japan and comprise over 3 million square feet of GLA and were 99.4% leased as of
December 31, 2013.

The
following property tables summarize certain data for our properties located in Japan, South Korea, Mexico, Malaysia, Canada and the various European countries related to the
McArthurGlen joint venture property locations at December 31, 2013:

Land

We have direct or indirect ownership interests in approximately 350 acres of land held in the United States and Canada for
future development.

Sustainability and Energy Efficiency

We focus on energy efficiency as a core sustainability strategy. Through the continued use of energy conservation practices, energy
efficiency projects, and continuous monitoring and reporting, we have reduced our energy consumption at comparable properties every year since 2003. As a result, excluding new developments and
expansions, we reduced the electricity usage over which we have direct control by 260 million kWhs since 2003. This reflects an annual value of over $25 million in avoided operating
costs. Our documented
reduction in greenhouse gas emissions resulting from our energy management efforts is 193,700 metric tons of CO2e.

In
2012, we were awarded

NAREIT's Leader in the Light Award

for our energy conservation efforts for the eighth consecutive year and were
the only company to have achieved the Leader in the Light distinction each year from 2005 through 2012. We were the only Retail REIT included in the 2013 Carbon Disclosure Leadership Index published
by the Carbon Disclosure Project.

Mortgage Financing on Properties

The following table sets forth certain information regarding the mortgages and unsecured indebtedness encumbering our properties, and
the properties held by our domestic and international joint venture arrangements, and also our unsecured corporate debt. Substantially all of the mortgage and property related debt is nonrecourse to
us.

Item 3.    Legal Proceedings

We are involved from time-to-time in various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business, including, but not
limited to commercial disputes, environmental matters, and litigation in connection with transactions including acquisitions and divestitures. We believe that such litigation, claims and
administrative proceedings will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position or our results of operations. We record a liability when a loss is considered probable and the amount can
be reasonably estimated.

Item 4.    Mine Safety Disclosures

Not applicable.

There
is no established public trading market for Simon Property's Class B common stock. Dividends on the Class B common stock are identical to the common stock.

Holders

The number of holders of record of common stock outstanding was 1,461 as of December 31, 2013. The Class B common stock
is subject to two voting trusts as to which Herbert Simon and David Simon are the trustees. Shares of Class B common stock convert automatically into an equal number of shares of common stock
upon the occurrence of certain events and can be converted into shares of common stock at the option of the holders.

Dividends

We must pay a minimum amount of dividends to maintain our status as a REIT. Our dividends typically exceed our net income generated in
any given year primarily because of depreciation, which is a
non-cash expense. Our future dividends and future distributions of the Operating Partnership will be determined by the Board of Directors based on actual results of operations, cash available for
dividends and limited partner distributions, cash reserves as deemed necessary for capital and operating expenditures, and the amount required to maintain our status as a REIT.

Common
stock dividends during 2013 aggregated $4.65 per share. Common stock dividends during 2012 aggregated $4.10 per share. In January of 2014, our Board of Directors declared a cash
dividend of $1.25 per share of common stock payable on February 28, 2014 to stockholders of record on February 14, 2014.

We
offer a dividend reinvestment plan that allows our stockholders to acquire additional shares by automatically reinvesting cash dividends. Shares are acquired pursuant to the plan at
a price equal to the prevailing market price of such shares, without payment of any brokerage commission or service charge.

Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities

During the fourth quarter of 2013, we issued an aggregate of 274,697 shares of common stock to limited partners of the Operating
Partnership in exchange for an equal number of units pursuant to the partnership agreement of the Operating Partnership, as follows:

•

69,691 shares on December 26, 2013, and

•

205,006 shares on November 19, 2013.

In
each case, the issuance of the shares of common stock was exempt from registration pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.



Issuances Under Equity Compensation Plans

For information regarding the securities authorized for issuance under our equity compensation plans, see Item 12 of this
report.

Item 6.    Selected Financial Data

Item 7.    Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto that are included
in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Overview

Simon Property Group, Inc., or Simon Property, is a Delaware corporation that operates as a self-administered and self-managed
real estate investment trust, or REIT, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. REITs will generally not be liable for federal corporate income taxes as long as they continue to distribute
not less than 100% of their taxable income. Simon Property Group, L.P., or the Operating Partnership, is our majority-owned partnership subsidiary that owns all of our real estate properties
and other assets. In this discussion, the terms "we", "us" and "our" refer to Simon Property, the Operating Partnership, and its subsidiaries.

We
own, develop and manage retail real estate properties, which consist primarily of malls, Premium Outlets®, The Mills®, and community/lifestyle centers. As of
December 31, 2013, we owned or held an interest in 308 income-producing properties in the United States, which consisted of 156 malls, 66 Premium Outlets, 62 community/lifestyle centers,
13 Mills, and 11 other shopping centers or outlet centers in 38 states and Puerto Rico. We have several Premium Outlets under development and have redevelopment and expansion projects,
including the addition of anchors and big box tenants, underway at more than 25 properties in the U.S., Asia, and Mexico. Internationally, as of December 31, 2013, we had ownership interests in
nine Premium Outlets in Japan, three Premium Outlets in South Korea, one Premium Outlet in Canada, one Premium Outlet in Mexico, and one Premium Outlet in Malaysia. In 2013, we acquired noncontrolling
interests in five operating properties in Europe through our joint venture with McArthurGlen. Of the five properties, two are located in Italy and one each is located in Austria, the Netherlands, and
the United Kingdom. Additionally, as of December 31, 2013, we owned a 28.9% equity stake in Klépierre SA, or Klépierre, a publicly traded, Paris-based real
estate company, which owns, or has an interest in, shopping centers located in 13 countries in Europe.

On
December 13, 2013, we announced a plan to spin off our interests in 98 properties comprised of substantially all of our strip center business and our smaller enclosed malls
into an independent, publicly traded REIT (SpinCo). The spin-off is expected to be effectuated through a pro rata special distribution of all of the outstanding common shares of SpinCo to holders of
Simon Property common stock as of the distribution record date, and is expected to qualify as a tax-free distribution for U.S. federal income tax purposes. At the time of the separation and
distribution, SpinCo will own a percentage of the outstanding units of partnership interest of SpinCo L.P. that is equal to the percentage of outstanding units of partnership interest of the Operating
Partnership owned by Simon Property, with the remaining units of SpinCo L.P. owned by the limited partners of the Operating Partnership. We expect the transaction will become effective in the second
quarter of 2014. The transaction is subject to certain conditions, including declaration by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that SpinCo's registration statement on Form 10 is
effective, filing and approval of SpinCo's listing application, customary third party consents, and formal approval and declaration of the distribution by our Board of Directors. We may, at any time
and for any reason until the proposed transaction is complete, abandon the spin-off or modify or change its terms.

We
generate the majority of our revenues from leases with retail tenants including:

•

base minimum rents,

•

overage and percentage rents based on tenants' sales volume, and

•

recoverable expenditures such as property operating, real estate taxes, repair and maintenance, and advertising and
promotional expenditures.

Revenues
of our management company, after intercompany eliminations, consist primarily of management fees that are typically based upon the revenues of the property being managed.

We
invest in real estate properties to maximize total financial return which includes both operating cash flows and capital appreciation. We seek growth in earnings, funds from
operations, or FFO, and cash flows by enhancing the profitability and operation of our properties and investments. We seek to accomplish this growth through the
following:

•

attracting and retaining high quality tenants and utilizing economies of scale to reduce operating expenses,

•

expanding and re-tenanting existing highly productive locations at competitive rental rates,

•

selectively acquiring or increasing our interests in high quality real estate assets or portfolios of assets,



•

generating consumer traffic in our retail properties through marketing initiatives and strategic corporate alliances, and

•

selling selective non-core assets.

We
also grow by generating supplemental revenue from the following activities:

•

establishing our malls as leading market resource providers for retailers and other businesses and consumer-focused
corporate alliances, including payment systems (such as handling fees relating to the sales of bank-issued prepaid cards), national marketing alliances, static and digital media initiatives, business
development, sponsorship, and events,

•

offering property operating services to our tenants and others, including waste handling and facility services, and the
provision of energy services,

•

selling or leasing land adjacent to our properties, commonly referred to as "outlots" or "outparcels," and

•

generating interest income on cash deposits and investments in loans, including those made to related entities.

We
focus on high quality real estate across the retail real estate spectrum. We expand or redevelop properties to enhance profitability and market share of existing assets when we
believe the investment of our capital meets our risk-reward criteria. We selectively develop new properties in markets we believe are not adequately served by existing retail outlets.

We
routinely review and evaluate acquisition opportunities based on their ability to enhance our portfolio. Our international strategy includes partnering with established real estate
companies and financing international investments with local currency to minimize foreign exchange risk.

To
support our growth, we employ a three-fold capital strategy:

•

provide the capital necessary to fund growth,

•

maintain sufficient flexibility to access capital in many forms, both public and private, and

•

manage our overall financial structure in a fashion that preserves our investment grade credit ratings.

We
consider FFO, net operating income, or NOI, and comparable property NOI (NOI for properties owned and operating in both periods under comparison) to be key measures of operating
performance that are not specifically defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. We use these measures internally to evaluate the operating performance of our
portfolio and provide a basis for comparison with other real estate companies. Reconciliations of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measure are included below in this discussion.

Results Overview

Diluted earnings per common share was $4.24 in 2013 as compared to $4.72 for 2012. The $0.48 decrease in diluted earnings per share was
primarily attributable to:

•

a 2012 gain due to the acquisition of a controlling interest, sale or disposal of assets and interests in unconsolidated
entities, and impairment charge on investment in unconsolidated entities, net of $510.0 million, or $1.41 per diluted share, primarily driven by a non-cash gain of $488.7 million
resulting from the remeasurement of our previously held interest to fair value for those properties in which we now have a controlling interest,

•

partially offset by a 2013 gain due to the sale or disposal of our interests in fourteen properties and the acquisition of
a controlling interest in an outlet center of $107.5 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, and

•

improved operating performance and core business fundamentals in 2013 and the impact of our acquisition and expansion
activity.

Core
business fundamentals improved during 2013 primarily driven by higher tenant sales and strong leasing activity. Our share of portfolio NOI grew by 10.0% in 2013 as compared to
2012. Comparable property NOI also grew 5.2% for our portfolio of U.S. malls and Premium Outlets. Total sales per square foot, or psf, increased 2.5% from $568 psf at December 31, 2012, to $582
psf at December 31, 2013, for the U.S. malls and Premium Outlets. Average base minimum rent for U.S. malls and Premium Outlets increased 4.0% to $42.34 psf as of December 31, 2013, from
$40.73 psf as of December 31, 2012. Releasing spreads remained positive in the U.S. malls and Premium Outlets as we were able to lease available square feet at higher rents than the expiring
rental rates on the same space, resulting in a releasing spread (based on total tenant payments — base minimum rent plus common area maintenance) of $8.94 psf ($62.19 openings
compared to $53.25 closings) as of December 31, 2013, representing a 16.8% increase over expiring payments. Ending occupancy for the U.S. malls and Premium Outlets was 96.1% as of
December 31, 2013, as compared to 95.3% as of December 31, 2012, an increase of 80 basis points.



Our effective overall borrowing rate at December 31, 2013 on our consolidated indebtedness decreased 15 basis points to 4.84% as compared to 4.99% at
December 31, 2012. This reduction was primarily due to a decrease in the effective overall borrowing rate on fixed rate debt of 19 basis points (5.14% at December 31, 2013 as compared to
5.33% at December 31, 2012) combined with a decrease in the effective overall borrowing rate on variable rate debt of 18 basis points (1.22% at December 31, 2013 as compared to 1.40% at
December 31, 2012). At December 31, 2013, the weighted average years to maturity of our consolidated indebtedness was 5.4 years as compared to 5.9 years at
December 31, 2012.

Our
financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2013, included:

•

the redemption at par or repayment at maturity of $504.5 million of senior unsecured notes with fixed rates ranging
from 5.30% to 7.18%,

•

repayment of $145.0 million on our $4.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, or Credit Facility,

•

new mortgage loan borrowings of $370.0 million on previously unencumbered properties,

•

issuance of €750.0 million ($1.0 billion USD equivalent) of senior unsecured notes at a fixed
interest rate of 2.375% with a maturity date of October 2, 2020,

•

repayment of €422.0 million ($576.1 million USD equivalent) of borrowings on the Euro tranche
of our Credit Facility and

•

borrowings of $300.0 million on our Credit Facility on December 30, 2013 which we used to partially fund the
Sawgrass Mills mortgage repayment on January 2, 2014; we repaid these Credit Facility borrowings in full on January 22, 2014.



United States Portfolio Data

The portfolio data discussed in this overview includes the following key operating statistics: ending occupancy; average base minimum
rent per square foot; and total sales per square foot for our domestic assets. We include acquired properties in this data beginning in the year of acquisition and remove disposed properties in the
year of disposition. For comparative purposes, we separate the information related to community/lifestyle centers and The Mills from our other U.S. operations. We also do not include any properties
located outside of the United States.

The
following table sets forth these key operating statistics for:

•

properties that are consolidated in our consolidated financial statements,

•

properties we account for under the equity method of accounting as joint ventures, and

•

the foregoing two categories of properties on a total portfolio basis.

Percentages
may not recalculate due to rounding. Percentage and basis point changes are representative of the change from the comparable prior period.

Ending Occupancy Levels and Average Base Minimum Rent per Square Foot.

Ending occupancy is the percentage
of gross leasable area, or GLA, which is
leased as of the last day of the reporting period. We include all company
owned space except for mall anchors, mall majors, mall freestanding and mall outlots in the calculation. Base minimum rent per square foot is the average base minimum rent charge in effect for the
reporting period for all tenants that would qualify to be included in ending occupancy.

Total Sales per Square Foot.

Total sales include total reported retail tenant sales on a trailing
12-month basis at owned GLA (for mall stores with
less than 10,000 square feet) in the malls and all reporting tenants at the Premium Outlets and The Mills. Retail sales at owned GLA affect revenue and profitability levels because sales determine the
amount of minimum rent that can be charged, the percentage rent realized, and the recoverable expenses (common area maintenance, real estate taxes, etc.) that tenants can afford to pay.



Current Leasing Activities

During 2013, we signed 1,127 new leases and 1,711 renewal leases (excluding mall anchors and majors, new development, redevelopment,
expansion, downsizing, and relocation) with a fixed minimum rent across our U.S. malls and Premium Outlets portfolio, comprising approximately 8.4 million square feet of which
6.5 million square feet related to consolidated properties. During 2012, we signed 1,217 new leases and 2,074 renewal leases, comprising approximately 10.3 million square feet of which
7.7 million square feet related to consolidated properties. The average annual initial base minimum rent for new leases was $45.13 psf in 2013 and $40.46 psf in 2012 with an average tenant
allowance on new leases of $32.48 psf and $36.45 psf, respectively.

Critical Accounting Policies

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting
policies, including making estimates and assumptions. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These judgments
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during
the reporting periods. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, it is possible that different accounting policies would
have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements. From time to time, we reevaluate our estimates and assumptions. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be
different from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information. Below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may
require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about
matters that are inherently uncertain. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, see Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

•

We, as a lessor, retain substantially all of the risks and benefits of ownership of the investment properties and account
for our leases as operating leases. We accrue minimum rents on a straight-line basis over the terms of their respective leases. Substantially all of our retail tenants are also required to pay overage
rents based on sales over a stated base amount during the lease year. We recognize overage rents only when each tenant's sales exceed its sales threshold.

•

We review investment properties for impairment on a property-by-property basis whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying value of investment properties may not be recoverable. These circumstances include, but are not limited to, a decline in a property's cash flows, occupancy or comparable
sales per square foot. We measure any impairment of investment property when the estimated undiscounted operating income before depreciation and amortization plus its residual value is less than the
carrying value of the property. To the extent impairment has occurred, we charge to income the excess of carrying value of the property over its estimated fair value. We may decide to sell properties
that are held for use and the sale prices of these properties may differ from their carrying values. We also review our investments, including investments in unconsolidated entities, if events or
circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of our investments may not be recoverable. We will record an impairment charge if we determine that a decline in the fair value of the
investments below carrying value is other-than-temporary. Changes in economic and operating conditions that occur subsequent to our review of recoverability of investment property and other
investments could impact the assumptions used in that assessment and could result in future charges to earnings if assumptions regarding those investments differ from actual results.

•

To maintain our status as a REIT, we must distribute at least 90% of our taxable income in any given year and meet certain
asset and income tests. We monitor our business and transactions that may potentially impact our REIT status. In the unlikely event that we fail to maintain our REIT status, and available relief
provisions do not apply, then we would be required to pay federal income taxes at regular corporate income tax rates during the period we did not qualify as a REIT. If we lost our REIT status, we
could not elect to be taxed as a REIT for four years unless our failure was due to reasonable cause and certain other conditions were met. As a result, failing to maintain REIT status would result in
a significant increase in the income tax expense recorded and paid during those periods.

•

We make estimates as part of our allocation of the purchase price of acquisitions to the various components of the
acquisition based upon the fair value of each component. The most significant components of our allocations are typically the allocation of fair value to the buildings as-if-vacant, land and market
value of in-place leases. In the case of the fair value of buildings and the allocation of value to land and other intangibles, our estimates of the values of these components will affect the amount
of depreciation we record over the estimated useful life of the property acquired or the remaining lease term. In the case of the market value of in-place leases, we make our best estimates of the
tenants' ability to pay rents based upon the tenants' operating performance at the property, including the competitive position of the property in its market as well as sales psf, rents psf, and
overall occupancy cost for the tenants in place at the acquisition date. Our assumptions affect the amount of future revenue that we will recognize over the remaining lease term for the acquired
in-place leases.

•

A variety of costs are incurred in the development and leasing of properties. After determination is made to capitalize a
cost, it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited. Determination of when a



development
project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment. The costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs.
The capitalized costs include pre-construction costs essential to the development of the property, development costs, construction costs, interest costs, real estate taxes, salaries and related costs
and other costs incurred during the period of development. We consider a construction project as substantially completed and held available for occupancy and cease capitalization of costs upon
opening.

For
the purposes of the following comparisons between the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 and the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, the above transactions are
referred to as the property transactions. In the following discussions of our results of operations, "comparable" refers to properties we owned and operated in both years in the year-to-year
comparisons.

Year Ended December 31, 2013 vs. Year Ended December 31, 2012

Minimum rents increased $186.1 million during 2013, of which the property transactions accounted for $99.7 million of the
increase. Comparable rents increased $86.4 million, or 3.2%, primarily attributable to an $83.9 million increase in base minimum rents. Overage rents increased $27.7 million, or
14.2%, as a result of an increase in tenant sales at the comparable properties in 2013 compared to 2012 of $20.7 million as well as an increase related to the property transactions of
$7.0 million.



Tenant
reimbursements increased $102.6 million, due to a $40.4 million increase attributable to the property transactions and a $62.2 million, or 5.3%, increase in
the comparable properties primarily due to annual fixed contractual increases related to common area maintenance and higher reimbursements for the tenants' pro rata share of real estate taxes.

Total
other income decreased $25.0 million, principally as a result of the following:

•

a $18.3 million decrease in interest income primarily related to the repayment of related party loans and loans held
for investment,

•

a $12.4 million gain in 2012 on the sale of our investments in two multi-family residential facilities,

•

an $8.4 million decrease in land sale activity, and

•

a $7.7 million decrease in lease settlement income due to a higher number of terminated leases in 2012,

•

partially offset by an increase related to a $7.9 million gain on the sale of a non-retail office building in 2013,

•

a $7.7 million increase in financing and other fee revenue earned from joint ventures, net of eliminations, and

•

a $6.2 million increase in net other activity.

Depreciation
and amortization expense increased $33.0 million primarily due to the additional depreciable assets related to the property transactions.

Real
estate tax expense increased $25.6 million primarily due to an $14.9 million increase related to the property transactions.

Repairs
and maintenance expense increased $4.6 million primarily as a result of increased snow removal costs compared to the prior year period.

During
2013, we recorded a provision for credit losses of $7.7 million whereas in the prior year the provision was $12.8 million. Both amounts reflect the overall strong
economic health of our tenants.

Home
and regional office costs increased $17.0 million primarily related to higher personnel costs.

Interest
expense increased $10.1 million primarily due to an increase of $21.9 million related to the property transactions partially offset by the net impact of the
financing activities and reduction in the effective overall borrowing rate as previously discussed.

Income
and other taxes increased $23.9 million due to taxes related to certain of our international investments and an increase in state income taxes.

Income
from unconsolidated entities increased $73.4 million primarily due to the increase in ownership in the joint venture properties acquired as part of the Mills transaction,
the 2012 acquisition of an equity stake in Klépierre, our acquisition and expansion activity and favorable results of operations from joint venture properties partially offset by an
extinguishment charge related to the refinancing of Aventura Mall.

During
2013, we increased our economic interest in three unconsolidated community centers and subsequently disposed of our interests in those properties. Additionally, we disposed of
our interests in two malls, four community centers, five non-core retail properties and recorded a gain on the acquisition of an outlet center. The aggregate gain recognized on these transactions was
approximately $107.5 million. During 2012, we disposed of our interest in GCI, four unconsolidated properties, and eight consolidated retail properties for a net gain of $43.7 million
and acquired a controlling interest in nine properties previously accounted for under the equity method in the Mills transaction which resulted in the recognition of a non-cash gain of
$488.7 million. In addition, we recorded an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $22.4 million on our remaining investment in SPG-FCM Ventures, LLC, or SPG-FCM, which holds
our investment in TMLP, representing the excess of carrying value over the estimated fair value.

Net
income attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased $53.2 million due to a decrease in the net income of the Operating Partnership and a decline in the percentage
ownership of the limited partners in the Operating Partnership.



Year Ended December 31, 2012 vs. Year Ended December 31, 2011

Minimum rents increased $351.1 million during 2012, of which the property transactions accounted for $280.4 million of
the increase. Comparable rents increased $70.7 million, or 2.7%, primarily attributable to a $76.0 million increase in base minimum rents. Overage rents increased $54.9 million,
or 39.0%, as a result of the property transactions and an increase in tenant sales in 2012 compared to 2011 at the comparable properties of $31.3 million.

Tenant
reimbursements increased $163.0 million, due to a $141.8 million increase attributable to the property transactions and a $21.2 million, or 1.9%, increase in
the comparable properties primarily due to annual fixed contractual increases related to common area maintenance and higher reimbursements for the tenants' pro rata share of real estate taxes, offset
partially by a decrease in utility recoveries due to lower electricity costs.

Total
other income increased $4.2 million, principally as a result of the following:

•

a $12.4 million increase from a gain on the sale of our investments in two multi-family residential facilities,

•

an $11.7 million increase in land sale activity, and

•

a $9.7 million increase in financing and other fee revenue earned from joint ventures net of eliminations,

•

partially offset by a decrease in interest income of $24.8 million related to the repayment of related party loans
and loans held for investment, and

•

$4.8 million of net other activity.

Property
operating expense increased $33.2 million primarily related to a $49.1 million increase attributable to the property transactions partially offset by a
$15.9 million decrease in comparable property activity due primarily to our continued cost savings efforts.

Depreciation
and amortization expense increased $191.6 million primarily due to the additional depreciable assets related to the property transactions.

Real
estate tax expense increased $49.5 million primarily due to a $44.3 million increase related to the property transactions.

During
2012, we recorded a provision for credit losses of $12.8 million whereas in the prior year the provision was $6.5 million. Both amounts reflect the overall strong
economic health of our tenants.

General
and administrative expense increased $10.8 million primarily as a result of increased long-term performance based incentive compensation costs including amortization of
the CEO retention award which commenced mid-year 2011.

Marketable
and non-marketable securities charges and realized gains, net, of $6.4 million in 2012 was the result of the sale of all of our investments in Capital Shopping Centres
Group PLC and Capital & Counties Properties PLC for a gain of $82.7 million, partially offset by other-than-temporary non-cash impairment charges related to certain
non-marketable investments in securities of $76.3 million.

Interest
expense increased $143.5 million primarily due to an increase of $113.3 million related to the property transactions. The remainder of the increase resulted from
the following:

•

borrowings on the Euro tranche of the Credit Facility, and

•

the issuance of unsecured notes in the first and fourth quarters of 2012 and the fourth quarter of 2011,

•

partially offset by a lower effective overall borrowing rate,

•

decreased interest expense related to the repayment of $536.2 million of mortgages at 19 properties during 2012,

•

the payoff of a $735.0 million secured term loan, and

•

the payoff of $231.0 million of unsecured notes in 2012 and $542.5 million of unsecured notes in 2011.

Income
and other taxes increased $4.3 million due to income-based and withholding taxes on dividends from certain of our international investments.



Income
from unconsolidated properties increased $50.7 million as result of the property transactions, primarily due to the increase in ownership in the joint venture properties
acquired as part of the Mills transaction, and favorable results of operations from the portfolio of joint venture properties.

During
2012, we disposed of our interest in GCI, four unconsolidated properties, and eight consolidated retail properties for a net gain of $43.7 million and acquired a
controlling interest in nine properties previously accounted for under the equity method in the Mills transaction which resulted in the recognition of a non-cash gain of $488.7 million. In
addition, we recorded an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $22.4 million on our remaining investment in SPG-FCM, which holds our investment in TMLP, representing the excess of carrying
value over the estimated fair value. During 2011, we disposed of our interest in an unconsolidated mall, one consolidated mall, and four non-core retail properties, and acquired a controlling interest
in a mall previously accounted for under the equity method. In addition, on December 31, 2011, a joint venture in which we had a 50% interest was dissolved and, as a result, distributed a
portfolio of properties to us and our joint venture partner. We now consolidate the six properties we received in the distribution and recorded a non-cash gain representing the fair value of the net
assets received in excess of the carrying value of our interest in the joint venture portfolio. These transactions resulted in an aggregate net gain in 2011 of $216.6 million.

Net
income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased $64.0 million primarily due to an increase in the income of the Operating Partnership.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Because we own long-lived income-producing assets, our financing strategy relies primarily on long-term fixed rate debt. We minimize
the use of floating rate debt and may enter into floating rate to fixed rate interest rate swaps. Floating rate debt comprised only 7.5% of our total consolidated debt at December 31, 2013. We
also enter into interest rate protection agreements to manage our interest rate risk. We derive most of our liquidity from positive net cash flow from operations and distributions of capital from
unconsolidated entities that totaled $3.4 billion during 2013. In addition, the Credit Facility and the $2.0 billion supplemental unsecured revolving credit facility, or Supplemental
Facility, provide alternative sources of liquidity as our cash needs vary from time to time. Borrowing capacity under each of these facilities can be increased at our sole option as discussed further
below.

Our
balance of cash and cash equivalents increased $532.3 million during 2013 to $1.7 billion as of December 31, 2013 as further discussed in "Cash Flows" below.

On
December 31, 2013, we had an aggregate available borrowing capacity of $4.8 billion under the two facilities, net of outstanding borrowings of $1.2 billion and
letters of credit of $41.9 million. For the year ended December 31, 2013, the maximum amount outstanding under the two facilities was $1.6 billion and the weighted average amount
outstanding was $1.3 billion. The weighted average interest rate was 1.05% for the year ended December 31, 2013.

We
and the Operating Partnership have historically had access to public equity and long term unsecured debt markets and access to secured debt and private equity from institutional
investors at the property level.

Our
business model and status as a REIT requires us to regularly access the debt markets to raise funds for acquisition, development and redevelopment activity, and to refinance
maturing debt. We may also, from time to time, access the equity capital markets to accomplish our business objectives. We believe we have sufficient cash on hand and availability under the Credit
Facility and the Supplemental Facility to address our debt maturities and capital needs through 2014.



Cash Flows

Our net cash flow from operating activities and distributions of capital from unconsolidated entities totaled $3.4 billion
during 2013, which includes distributions of $358.0 million for our share of excess proceeds from the refinancing of two joint venture properties. In addition, we had net proceeds from our debt
financing and repayment activities of $473.2 million in 2013. These activities are further discussed below under "Financing and Debt." During 2013, we or the Operating Partnership
also:

•

funded the acquisition of an outlet center, deposits for the acquisition of an undeveloped land parcel, a long-term ground
lease buyout, and an ownership interest in a European property management and development company and related outlet operating properties for $866.5 million,

•

received proceeds of $274.1 million from the sale of two malls, seven community/lifestyle centers, and two other
retail properties,

•

paid stockholder dividends and unitholder distributions totaling $1.7 billion,

•

funded consolidated capital expenditures of $841.2 million (includes development and other costs of
$42.7 million, redevelopment and expansion costs of $553.5 million, and tenant costs and other operational capital expenditures of $245.0 million), and

•

funded investments in unconsolidated entities of $143.1 million and construction loans to joint ventures of
$99.1 million.

In
general, we anticipate that cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet operating expenses, monthly debt service, recurring capital expenditures, and dividends to
stockholders necessary to maintain our REIT qualification on a long-term basis. In addition, we expect to be able to generate or obtain capital for nonrecurring capital expenditures, such as
acquisitions, major building redevelopments and expansions, as well as for scheduled principal maturities on outstanding indebtedness, from:

•

excess cash generated from operating performance and working capital reserves,

•

borrowings on our credit facilities,

•

additional secured or unsecured debt financing, or

•

additional equity raised in the public or private markets.

We
expect to generate positive cash flow from operations in 2014, and we consider these projected cash flows in our sources and uses of cash. These cash flows are principally derived
from rents paid by our retail tenants. A significant deterioration in projected cash flows from operations could cause us to increase our reliance on available funds from our credit facilities,
curtail planned capital expenditures, or seek other additional sources of financing as discussed above.

Financing and Debt

Unsecured Debt

At December 31, 2013, our unsecured debt consisted of $13.9 billion of senior unsecured notes of the Operating
Partnership, net of discounts, $960.1 million outstanding under our Credit Facility, $212.2 million outstanding under our Supplemental Facility, and $240.0 million outstanding
under an unsecured term loan. The December 31, 2013 balance on the Credit Facility included $660.1 million (U.S. dollar equivalent) of Euro-denominated borrowings and the entire balance
on the Supplemental Facility on such date consisted of Yen-denominated borrowings, both of which are designated as net investment hedges of a portion of our international investments.

On
December 31, 2013, we had an aggregate available borrowing capacity of $4.8 billion under the two credit facilities. The maximum outstanding balance of the credit
facilities during the year ended December 31, 2013 was $1.6 billion and the weighted average outstanding balance was $1.3 billion. Letters of credit of $41.9 million were
outstanding under the two facilities as of December 31, 2013.

The
Credit Facility's initial borrowing capacity of $4.0 billion can be increased at our sole option to $5.0 billion during its term. The Credit Facility will initially
mature on October 30, 2015 and can be extended for an additional year at our sole option. As of December 31, 2013, the base interest rate on the Credit Facility was LIBOR plus 95 basis
points (reflects a five basis point reduction effective May 16, 2013) with an additional facility fee of 15 basis points. In addition, the Credit



Facility
provides for a money market competitive bid option program that allows us to hold auctions to achieve lower pricing for short-term borrowings. The Credit Facility also includes a
$2.0 billion multi-currency tranche.

The
Supplemental Facility's borrowing capacity of $2.0 billion can be increased at our sole option to $2.5 billion during its term. The Supplemental Facility will
initially mature on June 30, 2016 and can be extended for an additional year at our sole option. As of December 31, 2013, the base interest rate on the Supplemental Facility was LIBOR
plus 95 basis points (reflects a five basis point reduction effective May 16, 2013) with an additional facility fee of 15 basis points. Like the Credit Facility, the Supplemental Facility
provides for a money market competitive bid option program and allows for multi-currency borrowings.

During
2013, we redeemed at par or repaid at maturity $504.5 million of senior unsecured notes with fixed rates ranging from 5.30% to 7.18% with cash on hand. In addition, we
repaid a $240.0 million mortgage loan with the proceeds from a $240.0 million unsecured term loan. The term loan has a capacity of up to $300.0 million, bears interest at LIBOR
plus 110 basis points and matures on February 28, 2016 with two available one-year extension options.

On
October 2, 2013, the Operating Partnership issued €750.0 million ($1.0 billion USD equivalent) of senior unsecured notes at a fixed interest rate
of 2.375% with a maturity date of October 2, 2020. Proceeds from the unsecured notes offering were used to pay down a portion of Euro-denominated borrowings on the Credit Facility and fund the
acquisition of various assets in the McArthurGlen transactions further discussed in Note 7. These notes are designated as a net investment hedge of our Euro-denominated international
investments.

On
December 30, 2013, we borrowed $300.0 million on our Credit Facility to partially fund the Sawgrass Mills mortgage repayment on January 2, 2014. These Credit
Facility borrowings were repaid in full on January 22, 2014 using unsecured notes proceeds as discussed below.

On
January 21, 2014, the Operating Partnership issued $600.0 million of senior unsecured notes at a fixed interest rate of 2.20% with a maturity date of February 1,
2019 and $600.0 million of senior unsecured notes at a fixed interest rate of 3.75% with a maturity date of February 1, 2024. Proceeds from the unsecured notes offering were used to
repay debt and for general corporate purposes.

Mortgage Debt

Total mortgage indebtedness was $8.2 billion and $8.0 billion at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. During
2013, we added $370.0 million in new mortgage loans on previously unencumbered assets with a weighted average interest rate of 4.04%.

On
January 2, 2014, we repaid the $820.0 million outstanding mortgage at Sawgrass Mills originally maturing July 1, 2014 with cash on hand and the borrowings on our
Credit Facility as discussed above.

In
November 2013, one of our joint venture properties refinanced its $430.0 million mortgage maturing December 11, 2017 with a $1.2 billion mortgage that matures
December 1, 2020. The fixed interest rate was reduced from 5.91% to 3.75% as a result of this transaction and an extinguishment charge of $82.8 million was incurred.

Covenants

Our unsecured debt agreements contain financial covenants and other non-financial covenants. If we were to fail to comply with these
covenants, after the expiration of the applicable cure periods, the debt maturity could be accelerated or other remedies could be sought by the lender including adjustments to the applicable interest
rate. As of December 31, 2013, we are in compliance with all covenants of our unsecured debt.

At
December 31, 2013, we or our subsidiaries were the borrowers under 80 non-recourse mortgage notes secured by mortgages on 80 properties, including seven separate pools of
cross-defaulted and cross-collateralized mortgages encumbering a total of 27 properties. Under these cross-default provisions, a default under any mortgage included in the cross-defaulted pool may
constitute a default under all mortgages within that pool and may lead to acceleration of the indebtedness due on each property within the pool. Certain of our secured debt instruments contain
financial and other non-financial covenants which are specific to the properties which serve as collateral for that debt. If the borrower fails to comply with these covenants, the lender could
accelerate the debt and enforce its right against their collateral. At December 31, 2013, the applicable borrowers under these non-recourse mortgage notes were in compliance with all covenants
where non-compliance could individually, or giving effect to applicable cross-default provisions in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or
cash flows.

Certain
of our consolidated properties have redemption features whereby the remaining interest in a property or portfolio of properties can be redeemed at the option of the holder or in
circumstances that may be outside our control. These amounts are accounted for as temporary equity within limited partners' preferred interest in the Operating Partnership and noncontrolling
redeemable interests in properties in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and totaled $164.9 million at December 31, 2013.

Our
off-balance sheet arrangements consist primarily of our investments in joint ventures which are common in the real estate industry and are described in Note 7 to the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements. Our joint ventures typically fund their cash needs through secured debt financings obtained by and in the name of the joint venture entity. The joint venture debt is
secured by a first mortgage, is without recourse to the joint venture partners, and does not represent a liability of the partners, except to the extent the partners or their affiliates expressly
guarantee the joint venture debt. As of December 31, 2013, the Operating Partnership guaranteed joint venture related mortgage indebtedness of $190.8 million (of which we have a right of
recovery from our venture partners of $83.0 million). Mortgages guaranteed by us are secured by the property of the joint venture which could be sold in order to satisfy the outstanding
obligation and which has an estimated fair value in excess of the guaranteed amount. We may elect to fund cash needs of a joint venture through equity contributions (generally on a basis proportionate
to our ownership interests), advances or partner loans, although such fundings are not required contractually or otherwise.



Acquisitions and Dispositions

Buy-sell, marketing rights, and other exit mechanisms are common in real estate partnership agreements. Most of our partners are
institutional investors who have a history of direct investment in retail real estate. We and our partners in our joint venture properties may initiate these provisions (subject to any applicable lock
up or similar restrictions). If we determine it is in our stockholders' best interests for us to purchase the joint venture interest and we believe we have adequate liquidity to execute the purchase
without hindering our cash flows, then we may initiate these provisions or elect to buy our partner's interest. If we decide to sell any of our joint venture interests, we expect to use the net
proceeds to reduce outstanding indebtedness or to reinvest in development, redevelopment, or expansion opportunities.

Acquisitions.

On January 10, 2014, we acquired one of our partner's remaining redeemable interests
in a portfolio of ten properties for
approximately $113.3 million subject to a pre-existing contractual arrangement. The amount paid to acquire the interests in the seven properties which were previously consolidated is included
in limited partners' preferred interest in the Operating Partnership and noncontrolling redeemable interest in properties in the accompanying December 31, 2013 consolidated balance sheet.

During
the second quarter of 2013, we signed a definitive agreement with McArthurGlen, an owner, developer, and manager of designer outlets, to form one or more joint ventures to invest
in certain of its existing designer outlets, development projects, and its property management and development companies. In conjunction with that agreement, we purchased a noncontrolling interest in
the property management and development companies of McArthurGlen, and a noncontrolling interest in a development property located in Vancouver, British Columbia. On August 2, 2013 we acquired
a noncontrolling interest in Ashford Designer Outlets in Kent, UK. On October 16, 2013 we completed the remaining transactions contemplated by our previously announced definitive agreement with
McArthurGlen by acquiring noncontrolling interests in portions of four existing McArthurGlen Designer Outlets — Parndorf (Vienna, Austria), La Reggia (Naples, Italy), Noventa di
Piave (Venice, Italy), and Roermond (Roermond, Netherlands). Our legal ownership interests in these entities range from 22.5% to 90%.

On
May 30, 2013, we acquired a 100% interest in a 390,000 square foot outlet center located near Portland, Oregon for cash consideration of $146.7 million.

Dispositions.

We continue to pursue the disposition of properties that no longer meet our strategic
criteria or that are not a primary retail venue
within their trade area.

During
2013, we increased our economic interest in three unconsolidated community centers and subsequently disposed of our interests in those properties. Additionally, we disposed of
our interests in eight consolidated retail properties and three unconsolidated retail properties. The aggregate gain recognized on these transactions was approximately $80.2 million.

On
August 8, 2013, we disposed of our interest in an office property located in the Boston, Massachusetts area. The gain on the sale was $7.9 million which is included in
other income in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.

Development Activity

New Domestic Development.

During the third quarter of 2013, we began construction on Charlotte Premium
Outlets, a 400,000 square foot project located
in Charlotte, North Carolina. We own a 50% noncontrolling interest in this project, which is a joint venture with Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. The center is expected to open in July of
2014. Our estimated share of the cost of this project is $46.0 million.

In
addition, during the third quarter we began construction on Twin Cities Premium Outlets, a 410,000 square foot project located in Eagan, Minnesota. We own a 35% noncontrolling
interest in this project. The center is expected to open in August of 2014. Our estimated share of the cost of this project is $38.0 million.

On
August 22, 2013, we opened St. Louis Premium Outlets, a 350,000 square foot upscale outlet center located in Chesterfield, Missouri. We own a 60% noncontrolling
interest in this project, which is a joint venture with Woodmont Outlets. Our share of the cost of this new center was approximately $50.0 million. The center was 100% leased at opening.

On
April 4, 2013, we opened Phoenix Premium Outlets in Chandler, Arizona, a 360,000 square foot upscale outlet center. The cost of this new center, in which we have a 100%
interest, was approximately $70.0 million. The center was 100% leased at opening.



Domestic Redevelopments and Expansions.

We routinely incur costs related to construction for significant
redevelopment and expansion projects at our
properties. We also have reinstituted redevelopment and expansion initiatives which we had previously reduced given the downturn in the economy. Redevelopment and expansion projects, including the
addition of anchors and big box tenants, are underway at more than 25 properties in the U.S.

We
expect our share of development costs for 2014 related to new development, redevelopment, or expansion initiatives to be approximately $1.1 billion. We expect to fund these
capital projects with cash flows from operations. Our estimated stabilized return on invested capital typically ranges between 10-12% for all of our new development, expansion and redevelopment
projects.

International Development Activity.

We typically reinvest net cash flow from our international joint
ventures to fund future international
development activity. We believe this strategy mitigates some of the risk of our initial investment
and our exposure to changes in foreign currencies. We have also funded most of our foreign investments with local currency-denominated borrowings that act as a natural hedge against fluctuations in
exchange rates. Our consolidated net income exposure to changes in the volatility of the Euro, Yen, Won, and other foreign currencies is not material. We expect our share of international development
costs for 2014 will be approximately $180.0 million, primarily funded through reinvested joint venture cash flow and construction loans.

Dividends

Common stock dividends during 2013 aggregated $4.65 per share. Common stock dividends during 2012 aggregated $4.10 per share. In
January of 2014, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $1.25 per share of common stock payable on February 28, 2014 to stockholders of record on February 14, 2014. We must
pay a minimum amount of dividends to maintain our status as a REIT. Our dividends typically exceed our net income generated in any given year primarily because of depreciation, which is a non-cash
expense. Our future dividends and future distributions of the Operating Partnership will be determined by the Board of Directors based on actual results of operations, cash available for dividends and
limited partner distributions, cash reserves as deemed necessary for capital and operating expenditures, and the amount required to maintain our status as a REIT.



Forward-Looking Statements

Certain statements made in this section or elsewhere in this report may be deemed "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of
the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance
that its expectations will be attained, and it is possible that our actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks and
uncertainties. Such factors include, but are not limited to: our ability to meet debt service requirements, the availability of financing, changes in our credit rating, changes in market rates of
interest and foreign exchange rates for foreign currencies, the ability to hedge interest rate risk, risks associated with the acquisition, development and expansion of properties, general risks
related to retail real estate, the liquidity of real estate investments, environmental liabilities, international, national, regional and local economic climates, changes in market rental rates,
trends in the retail industry, relationships with anchor tenants, the inability to collect rent due to the bankruptcy or insolvency of tenants or otherwise, risks relating to joint venture properties,
intensely competitive market environment in the retail industry, costs of common area maintenance, risks related to our international investments and activities, insurance costs and coverage,
terrorist activities, changes in economic and market conditions and maintenance of our status as a real estate investment trust. We discussed these and other risks and uncertainties under the heading
"Risk Factors" in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. We may update that discussion in subsequent Quarterly
Reports on Form 10-Q, but otherwise we undertake no duty or obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments, or
otherwise.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Industry practice is to evaluate real estate properties in part based on performance measures such as FFO, diluted FFO per share, NOI
and comparable property NOI. We believe that these non-GAAP measures are helpful to investors because they are widely recognized measures of the performance of REITs and provide a relevant basis for
comparison among REITs. We also use these measures internally to measure the operating performance of our portfolio.

We
determine FFO based on the definition set forth by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, as consolidated net income computed in accordance with
GAAP:

•

excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization,

•

excluding gains and losses from extraordinary items and cumulative effects of accounting changes,

•

excluding gains and losses from the sales or disposals of previously depreciated retail operating properties,

•

excluding impairment charges of depreciable real estate,

•

plus the allocable portion of FFO of unconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method of accounting based upon
economic ownership interest, and

•

all determined on a consistent basis in accordance with GAAP.

We
have adopted NAREIT's clarification of the definition of FFO that requires us to include the effects of nonrecurring items not classified as extraordinary, cumulative effect of
accounting changes, or a gain or loss resulting from the sale or disposal of, or any impairment charges related to, previously depreciated operating properties.

We
include in FFO gains and losses realized from the sale of land, outlot buildings, marketable and non-marketable securities, and investment holdings of non-retail real estate.

You
should understand that our computation of these non-GAAP measures might not be comparable to similar measures reported by other REITs and that these non-GAAP
measures:

•

do not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP,

•

should not be considered as alternatives to consolidated net income determined in accordance with GAAP as a measure of
operating performance, and

•

are not alternatives to cash flows as a measure of liquidity.



The
following schedule reconciles total FFO to consolidated net income and diluted net income per share to diluted FFO per share.

Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial
reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive and
principal financial officers and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures
that:

•

Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and
disposition of assets;

•

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and

•

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of
our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

We
assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (1992).

Based
on that assessment, we believe that, as of December 31, 2013, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.

Item 7A.    Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosure About Market Risk

Our exposure to market risk due to changes in interest rates primarily relates to our long-term debt obligations. We manage exposure to
interest rate market risk through our risk management strategy by a combination of interest rate protection agreements to effectively fix or cap a portion of variable rate debt. We are also exposed to
foreign currency risk on financings of certain foreign operations. Our intent is to offset gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures, with gains and losses on the derivative contracts
hedging these exposures. We do not enter into either interest rate protection or foreign currency rate protection agreements for speculative purposes.

We
may enter into treasury lock agreements as part of an anticipated debt issuance. Upon completion of the debt issuance, the cost of these instruments is recorded as part of
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and is amortized to interest expense over the life of the debt agreement.

Our
future earnings, cash flows and fair values relating to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market rates of interest, primarily LIBOR, which was at historically low
levels during 2013. Based upon consolidated indebtedness and interest rates at December 31, 2013, a 50 basis point increase in the market rates of interest would decrease future earnings and
cash flows by approximately $8.8 million, and would decrease the fair value of debt by approximately $466.2 million.



Item 8.    Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The
Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Simon Property Group, Inc.:

We
have audited Simon Property Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013 based on criteria established in Internal
Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (1992 Framework) (the COSO criteria). Simon Property Group, Inc.
and Subsidiaries' management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial
reporting based on our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
our opinion, Simon Property Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2013, based on the COSO criteria.

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Simon Property
Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2013 of Simon Property Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries, and our report dated February 27, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The
Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Simon Property Group, Inc.:

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Simon Property Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the related consolidated
statements of operations and comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013. Our audit also included the financial statement
schedule listed in the Index at Item 15. These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Simon Property Group, Inc. and
Subsidiaries at December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013, in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a
whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Simon Property Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries' internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (1992 Framework) and our report dated February 27, 2014, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Simon Property Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts

and where indicated as in millions or billions)

1. Organization

Simon Property Group, Inc., or Simon Property, is a Delaware corporation that operates as a self-administered and self-managed
real estate investment trust, or REIT, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. REITs will generally not be liable for federal corporate income taxes as long as they continue to
distribute not less than 100% of their taxable income. Simon Property Group, L.P., or the Operating Partnership, is our majority-owned partnership subsidiary that owns all of our real estate
properties and other assets. The terms "we", "us" and "our" refer to Simon Property, the Operating Partnership, and its subsidiaries.

We
own, develop and manage retail real estate properties, which consist primarily of malls, Premium Outlets®, The Mills®, and community/lifestyle centers. As of
December 31, 2013, we owned or held an interest in 308 income-producing properties in the United States, which consisted of 156 malls, 66 Premium Outlets, 62 community/lifestyle centers,
13 Mills and 11 other shopping centers or outlet centers in 38 states and Puerto Rico. Internationally, as of December 31, 2013, we had ownership interests in nine Premium Outlets in
Japan, three Premium Outlets in South Korea, one Premium Outlet in Canada, one Premium Outlet in Mexico, and one Premium Outlet in Malaysia. In 2013, as further discussed in Note 7, we acquired
noncontrolling interests in five operating properties in Europe through our joint venture with McArthurGlen. Of the five properties, two are located in Italy and one each is located in Austria, the
Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. Additionally, as of December 31, 2013, we owned a 28.9% equity stake in Klépierre SA, or Klépierre, a publicly traded,
Paris-based real estate company, which owns, or has an interest in, shopping centers located in 13 countries in Europe.

On
December 13, 2013, we announced a plan to spin off our interests in 98 properties comprised of substantially all of our strip center business and our smaller enclosed malls
into an independent, publicly traded REIT (SpinCo). The spin-off is expected to be effectuated through a pro rata special distribution of all of the outstanding common shares of SpinCo to holders of
Simon Property common stock as of the distribution record date, and is intended to qualify as a tax-free distribution for U.S. federal income tax purposes. At the time of the separation and
distribution, SpinCo will own a percentage of the outstanding units of partnership interest of SpinCo L.P. that is equal to the percentage of outstanding units of partnership interest of the
Operating Partnership owned by Simon Property, with the remaining units of SpinCo L.P. owned by the limited partners of the Operating Partnership. We expect the transaction will become
effective in the second quarter of 2014. The transaction is subject to certain conditions, including declaration by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that SpinCo's registration statement on
Form 10 is effective, filing and approval of SpinCo's listing application, customary third party consents, and formal approval and declaration of the distribution by our Board of Directors. We
may, at any time and for any reason until the proposed transaction is complete, abandon the spin-off or modify or change its terms.

We
generate the majority of our revenues from leases with retail tenants including:

•

base minimum rents,

•

overage and percentage rents based on tenants' sales volume, and

•

recoverable expenditures such as property operating, real estate taxes, repair and maintenance, and advertising and
promotional expenditures.

Revenues
of our management company, after intercompany eliminations, consist primarily of management fees that are typically based upon the revenues of the property being managed.

We
also grow by generating supplemental revenues from the following activities:

•

establishing our malls as leading market resource providers for retailers and other businesses and consumer-focused
corporate alliances, including payment systems (such as handling fees relating to the sales of bank-issued prepaid cards), national marketing alliances, static and digital media initiatives, business
development, sponsorship, and events,



Simon Property Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts

and where indicated as in

•

offering property operating services to our tenants and others, including waste handling and facility services, and the
provision of energy services,

•

selling or leasing land adjacent to our properties, commonly referred to as "outlots" or "outparcels," and

•

generating interest income on cash deposits and investments in loans, including those made to related entities.

2. Basis of Presentation and Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all controlled subsidiaries, and all significant
intercompany amounts have been eliminated.

We
consolidate properties that are wholly owned or properties where we own less than 100% but we control. Control of a property is demonstrated by, among other factors, our ability to
refinance debt and sell the property without the consent of any other partner or owner and the inability of any other partner or owner to replace us.

We
also consolidate a variable interest entity, or VIE, when we are determined to be the primary beneficiary. Determination of the primary beneficiary of a VIE is based on whether an
entity has (1) the power to direct activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits
of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. Our determination of the primary beneficiary of a VIE considers all relationships between us and the VIE, including management agreements
and other contractual arrangements. As described in Note 4, on December 4, 2012, we acquired the remaining 50% noncontrolling interest in two previously consolidated outlet properties.
Prior to the acquisition, we had determined these properties were VIEs and we were the primary beneficiary. There have been no other changes during 2013 or 2012 in previous conclusions about whether
an entity qualifies as a VIE or whether we are the primary beneficiary of any previously identified VIE. During 2013 and 2012, we did not provide financial or other support to a previously identified
VIE that we were not previously contractually obligated to provide.

Investments
in partnerships and joint ventures represent our noncontrolling ownership interests in properties. We account for these investments using the equity method of accounting. We
initially record these investments at cost and we subsequently adjust for net equity in income or loss, which we allocate in accordance with the provisions of
the applicable partnership or joint venture agreement, cash contributions and distributions, and foreign currency fluctuations, if applicable. The allocation provisions in the partnership or joint
venture agreements are not always consistent with the legal ownership interests held by each general or limited partner or joint venture investee primarily due to partner preferences. We separately
report investments in joint ventures for which accumulated distributions have exceeded investments in and our share of net income of the joint ventures within cash distributions and losses in
partnerships and joint ventures, at equity in the consolidated balance sheets. The net equity of certain joint ventures is less than zero because of financing or operating distributions that are
usually greater than net income, as net income includes non-cash charges for depreciation and amortization.

As
of December 31, 2013, we consolidated 217 wholly-owned properties and 18 additional properties that are less than wholly-owned, but which we control or for which we are the
primary beneficiary. We account for the remaining 93 properties, or the joint venture properties, as well as our investment in Klépierre, using the equity method of accounting,
as we have determined we have significant influence over their operations. We manage the day-to-day operations of 70 of the 93 joint venture properties, but have determined that our partner or
partners have substantive participating rights with respect to the assets and operations of these joint venture properties. Our investments in joint ventures in Japan, South Korea, Canada, Mexico,
Malaysia, and the five properties through our joint venture with McArthurGlen comprise 20 of the remaining 23 properties. The international properties are managed locally by joint ventures in which we
share control of the properties.

Preferred
distributions of the Operating Partnership are accrued at declaration and represent distributions on outstanding preferred units of partnership interests held by limited
partners, or preferred units, and are included in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. We allocate net operating results of the Operating Partnership after preferred distributions to
third parties and to us based on the partners' respective weighted average ownership interests

in
the Operating Partnership. Net operating results of the Operating Partnership attributable to third parties are reflected in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests.

Our
weighted average ownership interest in the Operating Partnership was as follows:

at the end of each period to reflect their interest in the Operating Partnership.

Reclassifications

We made certain reclassifications of prior period amounts in the consolidated financial statements to conform to the 2013 presentation.
These reclassifications had no impact on previously reported net income attributable to common stockholders or earnings per share.

3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Investment Properties

We record investment properties at cost. Investment properties include costs of acquisitions; development, predevelopment, and
construction (including allocable salaries and related benefits); tenant allowances and improvements; and interest and real estate taxes incurred during construction. We capitalize improvements and
replacements from repair and maintenance when the repair and maintenance extends the useful life, increases capacity, or improves the efficiency of the asset. All other repair and maintenance items
are expensed as incurred. We capitalize interest on projects during periods of construction until the projects are ready for their intended purpose based on interest rates in place during the
construction period. The amount of interest capitalized during each year is as follows:

For the Year Ended

December 31,




Capitalized interest

$

16,604

$

21,145

$

5,815

We
record depreciation on buildings and improvements utilizing the straight-line method over an estimated original useful life, which is generally 10 to 35 years. We review
depreciable lives of investment properties periodically and we make adjustments when necessary to reflect a shorter economic life. We amortize tenant allowances and tenant improvements utilizing the
straight-line method over the term of the related lease or occupancy term of the tenant, if shorter. We record depreciation on equipment and fixtures utilizing the straight-line method over seven to
ten years.

We
review investment properties for impairment on a property-by-property basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of investment properties may
not be recoverable. These
circumstances include, but are not limited to, declines in a property's cash flows, ending occupancy or total sales per square foot. We measure any impairment of investment property when the estimated
undiscounted operating income before depreciation and amortization plus its residual value is less than the carrying value of the property. To the extent impairment has occurred, we charge to income
the excess of carrying value of the property over its estimated fair value. We estimate fair value using unobservable data such as operating income, estimated capitalization rates, or multiples,
leasing prospects and local market information. We may decide to sell properties that are held for use and the sale prices of these properties may differ from their carrying values. We also review our
investments, including investments in unconsolidated entities, if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of our investments may



$_$_CHANGE_INDENT,0

Simon Property Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts

and where indicated as in millions or billions)

not
be recoverable. We will record an impairment charge if we determine that a decline in the fair value of the investments is other-than-temporary. Changes in economic and operating conditions that
occur subsequent to our review of recoverability of investment property and other investments could impact the assumptions used in that assessment and could result in future charges to earnings if
assumptions regarding those investments differ from actual results.

Purchase Accounting Allocation

We allocate the purchase price of acquisitions and any excess investment in unconsolidated entities to the various components of the
acquisition based upon the fair value of each component which may be derived from various observable or unobservable inputs and assumptions. Also, we may utilize third party valuation specialists.
These components typically include buildings, land and intangibles related to in-place leases and we estimate:

•

the fair value of land and related improvements and buildings on an as-if-vacant basis,

•

the market value of in-place leases based upon our best estimate of current market rents and amortize the resulting market
rent adjustment into revenues,

•

the value of costs to obtain tenants, including tenant allowances and improvements and leasing commissions, and

•

the value of revenue and recovery of costs foregone during a reasonable lease-up period, as if the space was vacant.

Amounts
allocated to building are depreciated over the estimated remaining life of the acquired building or related improvements. We amortize amounts allocated to tenant improvements,
in-place lease assets and other lease-related intangibles over the remaining life of the underlying leases. We also estimate the value of other acquired intangible assets, if any, which are amortized
over the remaining life of the underlying related intangibles.

Discontinued Operations

We reclassify any material operations and gains or losses on disposal related to consolidated properties disposed of during the period
to discontinued operations. During 2013, we reported a net gain of approximately $64.8 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, on our consolidated property disposition activity. During 2012, we
reported a net gain of approximately $21.1 million, or $.06 per diluted share, on our consolidated property disposition activity. During 2011, we reported a net loss of approximately
$42.4 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, on our consolidated property disposition activity. These gains and losses are reported in gain upon acquisition of controlling interests, sale or
disposal of assets and interests in unconsolidated entities, and impairment charge on investment in unconsolidated entities, net in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.
The aggregate of the gains and losses on the disposition of these assets and the operating results were not significant to our consolidated results of operations during each of the three years ended
December 31, 2013.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

We consider all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash and cash
equivalents. Cash equivalents are carried at cost, which approximates fair value. Cash equivalents generally consist of commercial paper, bankers acceptances, Eurodollars, repurchase agreements, and
money market deposits or securities. Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk include our cash and cash equivalents and our trade accounts receivable. We
place our cash and cash equivalents with institutions with high credit quality. However, at certain times, such cash and cash equivalents may be in excess of FDIC and SIPC insurance limits. See
Notes 4 and 10 for disclosures about non-cash investing and financing transactions.

Marketable and Non-Marketable Securities

Marketable securities consist primarily of the investments of our captive insurance subsidiaries, available-for-sale securities, our
deferred compensation plan investments, and certain investments held to fund the debt service requirements of debt previously secured by investment properties.

The
types of securities included in the investment portfolio of our captive insurance subsidiaries typically include U.S. Treasury or other U.S. government securities as well as
corporate debt securities with maturities ranging from less than 1 to 10 years. These securities are classified as available-for-sale and are valued based upon quoted market prices or other
observable inputs when quoted market prices are not available. The amortized cost of debt securities, which approximates fair value, held by our captive insurance subsidiaries is adjusted for
amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity. Changes in the values of these securities are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until the gain or loss is
realized or until any unrealized loss is deemed to be other-than-temporary. We review any declines in value of these securities for other-than-temporary impairment and consider the severity and
duration of any decline in value. To the extent an other-than-temporary impairment is deemed to have occurred, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis is established. Subsequent changes
are then recognized through other comprehensive income (loss) unless another other-than-temporary impairment is deemed to have occurred. Net unrealized gains recorded in other comprehensive income
(loss) as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 were approximately $1.1 million and $2.6 million, respectively, and represent the valuation and related currency adjustments for our
marketable securities.

On
October 23, 2012 we completed the sale of all of our investments in Capital Shopping Centres Group PLC, or CSCG, and Capital & Counties Properties PLC, or
CAPC. These investments were accounted for as available-for-sale securities and their value was adjusted to their quoted market price, including a related foreign exchange component, through other
comprehensive income (loss). At the date of sale, we owned 35.4 million shares of CSCG and 38.9 million shares of CAPC. The aggregate proceeds received from the sale were
$327.1 million, and we recognized a gain on the sale of $82.7 million, which is included in marketable and non-marketable securities charges and realized gains, net in the accompanying
consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. The gain includes $79.4 million that was reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

Our
insurance subsidiaries are required to maintain statutory minimum capital and surplus as well as maintain a minimum liquidity ratio. Therefore, our access to these securities may be
limited. Our deferred compensation plan investments are classified as trading securities and are valued based upon quoted market prices. The investments have a matching liability as the amounts are
fully payable to the employees that earned the compensation. Changes in value of these securities and changes to the matching liability to employees are both recognized in earnings and, as a result,
there is no impact to consolidated net income.

At
December 31, 2012, we also had investments of $24.9 million which were used to fund the debt service requirements of mortgage debt previously secured by investment
property. These investments were classified as held-to-maturity and were recorded at amortized cost. We had no such investments at December 31, 2013 because the debt matured during 2013 and the
investments funded the payoff.

At
December 31, 2013 and 2012, we had investments of $118.8 million and $98.9 million, respectively, in non-marketable securities that we account for under the cost
method. We regularly evaluate these investments for any other-than-temporary impairment in their estimated fair value to determine whether an adjustment to the carrying value is required. During the
fourth quarter of 2012, as a result of the significance and duration of the impairment, represented by the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of certain cost method
investments, we recognized other-than-temporary non-cash charges of $71.0 million, which is included in marketable and non-marketable securities charges and realized gains, net in the
accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. The fair value of the remaining investment for the securities that were impaired is not material and was based on
Level 2 fair value inputs.

(Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts

and where indicated as in millions or billions)

Fair Value Measurements

Level 1 fair value inputs are quoted prices for identical items in active, liquid and visible markets such as stock exchanges.
Level 2 fair value inputs are observable information for similar items in active or inactive markets, and appropriately consider counterparty creditworthiness in the valuations. Level 3
fair value inputs reflect our best estimate of inputs and assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability at the measurement date. The inputs are unobservable in the market
and significant to the valuation estimate. We have no investments for which fair value is measured on a recurring basis using Level 3 inputs.

We
hold marketable securities that totaled $148.3 million and $170.2 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, that were primarily classified as having
Level 1 fair value inputs. In addition, we have derivative instruments which are classified as having Level 2 inputs which consist primarily of interest rate swap agreements and foreign
currency forward contracts with a gross liability balance of $1.2 million and $1.5 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and a gross asset value of
$8.4 million and $3.0 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. We also have interest rate cap agreements with nominal values.

Note 8
includes a discussion of the fair value of debt measured using Level 2 inputs. Notes 3 and 4 include a discussion of the fair values recorded in purchase
accounting and impairment, using Level 2 and Level 3 inputs. Level 3 inputs to our purchase accounting and impairment include our estimations of net operating results of the
property, capitalization rates and discount rates.

Use of Estimates

We prepared the accompanying consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States, or GAAP. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements, and revenues and expenses during the reported period. Our actual results could differ from these estimates.

Segment Disclosure

Our primary business is the ownership, development, and management of retail real estate. We have aggregated our retail operations,
including malls, Premium Outlets, The Mills, community/lifestyle centers, and our international investments into one reportable segment because they have similar economic characteristics and we
provide similar products and services to similar types of, and in many cases, the same tenants.

Deferred Financing and Lease Costs

Our deferred costs consist primarily of financing fees we incurred in order to obtain long-term financing and internal and external
leasing commissions and related costs. We record amortization of deferred financing costs on a straight-line basis over the terms of the respective loans or agreements. Our deferred leasing costs
consist primarily of capitalized salaries and related benefits in connection with lease originations. We record amortization of deferred leasing costs on a straight-line basis over the terms of the
related leases. Details of these deferred costs as of December 31 are as follows:

We
report amortization of deferred financing costs, amortization of premiums, and accretion of discounts as part of interest expense. Amortization of deferred leasing costs is a
component of depreciation and amortization expense. We amortize debt premiums and discounts, which are included in mortgages and unsecured indebtedness, over the remaining terms of the related debt
instruments. These debt premiums or discounts arise either at the debt issuance or as part of the purchase price allocation of the fair value of debt assumed in acquisitions. The accompanying
consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income include amortization as follows:

Loans Held for Investment

From time to time, we may make investments in mortgage loans or mezzanine loans of third parties that own and operate commercial real
estate assets located in the United States. Mortgage loans are secured, in part, by mortgages recorded against the underlying properties which are not owned by us. Mezzanine loans are secured, in
part, by pledges of ownership interests of the entities that own the underlying real estate. Loans held for investment are carried at cost, net of any premiums or discounts which are accreted or
amortized over the life of the related loan receivable utilizing the effective interest method. We evaluate the collectability of both interest and principal of each of these loans quarterly to
determine whether the value has been impaired. A loan is deemed to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according
to the existing contractual terms. When a loan is impaired, the amount of the loss accrual is calculated by comparing the carrying amount of the loan held for investment to its estimated realizable
value.

We
had investments in mortgage and mezzanine loans which were repaid during 2011 and 2012. We recorded $6.8 million and $24.3 million during 2012 and 2011, respectively,
in interest income earned from these loans.

Intangibles

The average life of in-place lease intangibles is approximately 3.8 years, is amortized over the remaining life of the leases of
the related property on the straight-line basis and is included with depreciation and amortization in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. The fair market value of above
and below market leases is amortized into revenue over the remaining lease life as a component of reported minimum rents. The weighted average remaining life of these intangibles is approximately
5.0 years. The unamortized amount of below market leases is included in accounts payable, accrued expenses, intangibles and deferred revenues in the consolidated balance sheets

and
was $145.5 million and $199.2 million as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The amount of amortization of above and below market leases, net for the years ended
December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011 was $24.1 million, $16.5 million, and $17.6 million, respectively. If a lease is terminated prior to the original lease termination, any
remaining unamortized intangible is written off to earnings.

Derivative Financial Instruments

We record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on
the intended use of the derivative, whether we have designated a derivative as a hedge and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting. We use a
variety of derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business to selectively manage or hedge a portion of the risks associated with our indebtedness and interest payments. Our
objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish this objective, we primarily use interest
rate swaps and caps. We require that hedging derivative instruments be highly effective in reducing the risk exposure that they are designated to hedge. As a result, there is no significant
ineffectiveness from any of our derivative activities. We formally designate any instrument that meets these hedging criteria as a hedge at the inception of the derivative contract. We have no
credit-risk-related hedging or derivative activities.



Simon Property Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts

and where indicated as in millions or billions)

As
of December 31, 2013, we had the following outstanding interest rate derivatives related to managing our interest rate risk:

Interest Rate Derivative

Number of

Instruments

Notional Amount

Interest Rate Swaps


$491.6 million

Interest Rate Caps


$248.3 million

The
carrying value of our interest rate swap agreements, at fair value, as of December 31, 2013, is a net asset balance of $3.0 million, of which $0.4 million is
included in other liabilities and $3.4 million is included in deferred costs and other assets. The December 31, 2012 carrying value was a liability balance of $1.5 million and is
included in other liabilities. The interest rate cap agreements were of nominal value at December 31, 2013 and 2012 and we generally do not apply hedge accounting to these arrangements.

We
are also exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on financial instruments which are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily in Japan and Europe. We use currency
forward contracts and foreign currency denominated debt to manage our exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates on certain Yen and Euro-denominated receivables and net investments. Currency
forward contracts involve fixing the Yen:USD or Euro:USD exchange rate for delivery of a specified amount of foreign currency on a specified date. The currency forward contracts are typically cash
settled in US dollars for their fair value at or close to their settlement date. Approximately ¥1.6 billion remains as of December 31, 2013 for all forward contracts that we
expect to settle through January 5, 2015. The December 31, 2013 asset balance related to these forward contracts was $5.0 million and is included in deferred costs and other
assets. We have reported the changes in fair value for these forward contracts in earnings. The underlying currency adjustments on the foreign currency denominated receivables are also reported in
income and generally offset the amounts in earnings for these forward contracts.

In
the fourth quarter of 2013, we entered into a Euro:USD forward contract with a €74.0 million notional value maturing on May 30, 2014 which we designated
as a net investment hedge. The December 31, 2013 liability balance related to this forward contract was $0.8 million and is included in other liabilities. We apply hedge
accounting and the change in fair value for this forward contract is reported in other comprehensive income. Changes in the value of this forward contract are offset by changes in the underlying
hedged Euro-denominated joint venture investment.

The
total gross accumulated other comprehensive loss related to our derivative activities, including our share of the other comprehensive loss from joint venture properties,
approximated $61.8 million and $78.1 million as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

Revenue Recognition

We, as a lessor, retain substantially all of the risks and benefits of ownership of the investment properties and account for our
leases as operating leases. We accrue minimum rents on a straight-line basis over the terms of their respective leases. Substantially all of our retail tenants are also required to pay overage rents
based on sales over a stated base amount during the lease year. We recognize overage rents only when each tenant's sales exceed the applicable sales threshold. We amortize any tenant inducements as a
reduction of revenue utilizing the straight-line method over the term of the related lease or occupancy term of the tenant, if shorter.

We
structure our leases to allow us to recover a significant portion of our property operating, real estate taxes, repairs and maintenance, and advertising and promotion expenses from
our tenants. A substantial portion of our leases, other than those for anchor stores, require the tenant to reimburse us for a substantial portion of our operating expenses, including common area
maintenance, or CAM, real estate taxes and insurance. This significantly reduces our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation. Such property operating expenses
typically include utility, insurance, security, janitorial, landscaping, food court and other administrative expenses. As of December 31, 2013 for substantially all of our leases in the U.S.
mall portfolio, we receive a fixed payment from the tenant for the CAM component which is recognized as revenue when earned. When not reimbursed by the fixed-CAM component, CAM expense reimbursements
are based on the tenant's proportionate share of the allocable operating expenses and CAM capital expenditures for the property. We also receive escrow payments for these reimbursements from
substantially all our non-fixed CAM tenants and monthly fixed CAM payments throughout the year. We accrue reimbursements from tenants for recoverable portions of all these expenses as revenue in the
period the applicable expenditures are incurred. We recognize differences between estimated recoveries and the final billed amounts in the subsequent year. These differences were not material in any
period presented. Our advertising and promotional costs are expensed as incurred.

Management Fees and Other Revenues

Management fees and other revenues are generally received from our unconsolidated joint venture properties as well as third parties.
Management fee revenue is earned based on a contractual percentage of joint venture property revenue. Development fee revenue is earned on a contractual percentage of hard costs to develop a property.
Leasing fee revenue is earned on a contractual per square foot charge based on the square footage of current year leasing activity. We recognize revenue for these services provided when earned based
on the underlying activity.

Revenues
from insurance premiums charged to unconsolidated properties are recognized on a pro-rata basis over the terms of the policies. Insurance losses on these policies and our
self-insurance for our consolidated properties are reflected in property operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income and include estimates for
losses incurred but not reported as well as losses pending settlement. Estimates for losses are based on evaluations by third-party actuaries and management's estimates. Total insurance reserves for
our insurance subsidiaries and other self-insurance programs as of December 31, 2013 and 2012

approximated
$103.4 million and $112.8 million, respectively, and are included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Information related to the securities included in
the investment portfolio of our captive insurance subsidiaries is included within the "Marketable and Non-Marketable Securities" section above.

Allowance for Credit Losses

We record a provision for credit losses based on our judgment of a tenant's creditworthiness, ability to pay and probability of
collection. In addition, we also consider the retail sector in which the tenant operates and our historical collection experience in cases of bankruptcy, if applicable. Accounts are written off when
they are deemed to be no longer collectible. Presented below is the activity in the allowance for credit losses during the following years:

Income Taxes

We and certain subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership have elected to be taxed as REITs under Sections 856 through 860 of the
Internal Revenue Code and applicable Treasury regulations relating to REIT qualification. In order to maintain this REIT status, the regulations require the entity to distribute at least 90% of
taxable income to its owners and meet certain other asset and income tests as well as other requirements. We intend to continue to adhere to these requirements and maintain our REIT status and that of
the REIT subsidiaries. As REITs, these entities will generally not be liable for federal corporate income taxes as long as they continue to distribute in excess of 100% of their taxable income. Thus,
we made no provision for federal income taxes for
these entities in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. If we or any of the REIT subsidiaries fail to qualify as a REIT, we or that entity will be subject to tax at regular corporate
rates for the years in which it failed to qualify. If we lose our REIT status we could not elect to be taxed as a REIT for four years unless our failure to qualify was due to reasonable cause and
certain other conditions were satisfied.

We
have also elected taxable REIT subsidiary, or TRS, status for some of our subsidiaries. This enables us to provide services that would otherwise be considered impermissible for REITs
and participate in activities that do not qualify as "rents from real property". For these entities, deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for temporary differences between the financial
reporting basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities at the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse. A valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is
provided if we believe all or some portion of the deferred tax asset may not be realized. An increase or decrease in the valuation allowance that results from the change in circumstances that causes a
change in our judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax asset is included in income.

As
of December 31, 2013 and 2012, we had a net deferred tax asset of $1.1 million and $4.1 million, respectively, related to our TRS subsidiaries. The net deferred
tax asset is included in deferred costs and other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and consists primarily of operating losses and other carryforwards for federal income tax
purposes as well as the timing of the deductibility of losses or reserves from insurance subsidiaries. No valuation allowance has been recorded as we believe these amounts will be realized.



Simon Property Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts

and where indicated as in
millions or billions)

We are also subject to certain other taxes, including state and local taxes, franchise taxes, as well as income-based and withholding taxes on dividends from
certain of our international investments, which are included in income and other taxes in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.

Corporate Expenses

Home and regional office costs primarily include compensation and personnel related costs, travel, building and office costs, and other
expenses for our corporate home office and regional offices. General and administrative expense primarily includes executive compensation, benefits and travel expenses as well as costs of being a
public company including certain legal costs, audit fees, regulatory fees, and certain other professional fees.

4. Real Estate Acquisitions and Dispositions

We acquire interests in properties to generate both current income and long-term appreciation in value. We acquire interests in
individual properties or portfolios of retail real estate companies that meet our investment criteria and sell properties which no longer meet our strategic criteria. Unless otherwise noted below,
gains and losses on these transactions are included in gain upon acquisition of controlling interests, sale or disposal of assets and interests in unconsolidated entities, and impairment charge on
investment in unconsolidated entities, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. We expense acquisition and potential acquisition costs related to
business combinations and disposition related costs as they are incurred. We incurred a minimal amount of transaction expenses during 2013, 2012, and 2011.

Our
consolidated and unconsolidated acquisition and disposition activity for the periods presented are highlighted as follows:

2013 and 2014 Acquisitions

On January 10, 2014, we acquired one of our partner's remaining redeemable interests in a portfolio of ten properties for
approximately $113.3 million subject to a pre-existing contractual arrangement.
The amount paid to acquire the interests in the seven properties which were previously consolidated is included in limited partners' preferred interest in the Operating Partnership and noncontrolling
redeemable interest in properties in the accompanying December 31, 2013 consolidated balance sheet.

During
2013, as further discussed in Note 7, we acquired noncontrolling interests in the property management and development companies of McArthurGlen as well as interests in
five designer outlet properties.

On
May 30, 2013, we acquired a 100% interest in a 390,000 square foot outlet center located near Portland, Oregon for cash consideration of $146.7 million. The fair value
of the acquisition was recorded primarily as investment property and lease related intangibles. As a result of the excess of fair value over amounts paid, we recognized a gain of approximately
$27.3 million.

2012 Acquisitions

On December 31, 2012, as discussed in Note 7, we contributed a wholly-owned property to a newly formed joint venture in
exchange for an interest in a property contributed to the same joint venture by our joint venture partner.

On
December 4, 2012, we acquired the remaining 50% noncontrolling equity interest in two previously consolidated outlet properties located in Grand Prairie, Texas, and Livermore,
California, and, accordingly, we now own 100% of these properties. We paid consideration of $260.9 million for the additional interests in the properties, 90% of which was paid in cash and 10%
of which was satisfied through the issuance of units of the Operating Partnership. In addition, the construction loans we had provided to the properties totaling $162.5 million were
extinguished on a non-cash basis. The transaction was accounted for as an equity transaction, as the properties had been previously consolidated.



Simon Property Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts

and where indicated as in millions or billions)

On
June 4, 2012, we acquired a 50% interest in a 465,000 square foot outlet center located in Destin, Florida for $70.5 million.

On
March 22, 2012, as discussed in Note 7, we acquired additional interests in 26 of our joint venture properties from SPG-FCM Ventures, LLC, or SPG-FCM, in a
transaction valued at approximately $1.5 billion, or the Mills transaction.

On
March 14, 2012, as discussed in Note 7, we acquired a 28.7% equity stake in Klépierre for approximately $2.0 billion.

On
January 6, 2012, we paid $50.0 million to acquire an additional 25% interest in Del Amo Fashion Center, thereby increasing our interest to 50% .

2011 Acquisitions

On December 31, 2011, we and our joint venture partner dissolved a venture in which we had a 50% interest and distributed a
portfolio of properties previously held within the venture to us and our joint venture partner. As a result, we have a 100% interest in and now consolidate the six properties we received in the
distribution. The distribution resulted in a remeasurement of the distributed assets to estimated fair value and a corresponding non-cash gain of $168.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2011
representing the estimated fair value of the net assets received in excess of the carrying value of our interest in the joint venture portfolio. The asset and liability allocations were recorded based
on preliminary portfolio fair value estimates at the date of distribution and were finalized during the third quarter of 2012 resulting in an allocation to investment property of
$585.0 million, lease related intangibles of $59.1 million and mortgage debt of $468.8 million, including debt premiums. We amortize these amounts over the estimated life of the
related depreciable components of investment property, typically no greater than 40 years, the terms of the applicable leases and the applicable debt maturity, respectively. The adjusted
allocations did not have a material impact on the results of operations for the year ended, or on our financial position at December 31, 2012.

On
August 25, 2011, we acquired additional controlling interests of approximately 83.75% in The Plaza at King of Prussia and The Court at King of Prussia, or collectively, King
of Prussia, thereby increasing our ownership interest to 96.1%. At the time of acquisition, the property was subject to a $160.1 million mortgage. The consolidation of this previously
unconsolidated property resulted in a remeasurement of our previously held interest to fair value and a corresponding non-cash gain of $82.9 million in the third quarter of 2011. As a result of
the 2014 acquisition of our partner's interest, we now own 100% of this property.

On
July 19, 2011, we acquired a 100% ownership interest in a lifestyle center located in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Also, during the second quarter of 2011, we purchased an
additional noncontrolling interest in an unconsolidated mall.

During
the third quarter of 2011 we contributed a wholly-owned property to a joint venture which holds our interests in nine unconsolidated properties. The transaction effectively
exchanged a portion of our interest in this previously wholly-owned property for increased ownership interests in the nine unconsolidated properties. This transaction had no material impact on the
consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.

2013 Dispositions

During 2013, we increased our economic interest in three unconsolidated community centers and subsequently disposed of our interests in
those properties. Additionally, we disposed of our interests in eight consolidated retail properties and three unconsolidated retail properties. The aggregate gain recognized on these transactions was
approximately $80.2 million.

On
August 8, 2013, we disposed of our interest in an office property located in the Boston, Massachusetts area. The gain on the sale was $7.9 million and is included in
other income in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.

(Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts

and where indicated as in millions or billions)

2012 Dispositions

During 2012, we disposed of our interests in nine consolidated retail properties and four unconsolidated retail properties. The
aggregate net gain on these disposals was $15.5 million.

On
May 3, 2012, we sold our interests in two residential apartment buildings located at The Domain in Austin, Texas. The gain from the sale was $12.4 million, which is
included in other income in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.

On
January 9, 2012, as discussed in Note 7, we sold our entire ownership interest in GCI.

2011 Dispositions

During 2011, we agreed to dispose of consolidated properties that had an aggregate carrying value of $355.4 million and debt
obligations of $177.0 million for aggregate sales proceeds of $136.0 million resulting in a net loss of $42.4 million.

5. Per Share Data

We determine basic earnings per share based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period and
we consider any participating securities for purposes of applying the two-class method. We determine diluted earnings per share based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock
outstanding combined with the incremental weighted average shares that would have been outstanding assuming all dilutive potential securities were converted into common shares at the earliest date
possible. The following table sets forth the computation of our basic and diluted earnings per share.

7. Investments in Unconsolidated Entities

Joint ventures are common in the real estate industry. We use joint ventures to finance properties, develop new properties, and
diversify our risk in a particular property or portfolio of properties. We held joint venture ownership interests in 73 properties in the United States as of December 31, 2013 and 78 properties
as of December 31, 2012. We held interests in nine joint venture properties in Japan as of December 31, 2013 and eight as of December 31, 2012. We held interests in three joint
venture properties in South Korea as of December 31, 2013 and two as of December 31, 2012. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, we also held interests in one joint venture property in
Mexico and one joint venture property in Malaysia. On August 1, 2013, our first joint venture property in Canada opened. Also in 2013, as discussed below, we acquired noncontrolling interests
in five operating properties in Europe through our joint venture with McArthurGlen. We account for these joint venture properties using the equity method of accounting. As discussed below, on
January 9, 2012, we sold our interest in GCI which at the time owned 45 properties in Italy. Additionally, on March 14, 2012, we purchased a 28.7% equity stake in
Klépierre. On May 21, 2012, Klépierre paid a dividend, which we elected to receive in additional shares, resulting in an increase in our ownership to approximately
28.9%.

Certain
of our joint venture properties are subject to various rights of first refusal, buy-sell provisions, put and call rights, or other sale or marketing rights for partners which
are customary in real estate joint venture agreements and the industry. We and our partners in these joint ventures may initiate these provisions (subject to any applicable
lock up or similar restrictions), which may result in either the sale of our interest or the use of available cash or borrowings, or the use of limited partnership interests in the Operating
Partnership, to acquire the joint venture interest from our partner.



Simon Property Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts

and where indicated as in millions or billions)

We
may provide financing to joint ventures primarily in the form of interest bearing construction loans. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, we had construction loans and other
advances to related parties totaling $140.3 million and $25.4 million, respectively, which are included in deferred costs and other assets.

On
December 31, 2012, we formed a joint venture with Institutional Mall Investors, or IMI, to own and operate The Shops at Mission Viejo in the Los Angeles suburb of Mission
Viejo, California, and Woodfield Mall in the Chicago suburb of Schaumburg, Illinois. We and IMI each own a noncontrolling 50% interest in Woodfield Mall and we own a noncontrolling 51% interest in The
Shops at Mission Viejo and IMI owns the remaining 49%. Prior to the formation of the joint venture, we owned 100% of The Shops at Mission Viejo and IMI owned 100% of Woodfield Mall. No gain was
recorded as the transaction was recorded based on the carryover basis of our previous investment. Woodfield Mall is encumbered by a $425.0 million mortgage loan which matures in March of 2024
and bears interest at 4.5%. In January 2013, the joint venture closed a $295.0 million mortgage on the Shops at Mission Viejo which bears interest at 3.61% and matures in February of 2023. The
proceeds from the financing were distributed to the venture partners and, as a result, we received a distribution of $149.7 million.

On
March 22, 2012, we acquired, through an acquisition of substantially all of the assets of The Mills Limited Partnership, or TMLP, additional interests in 26 properties. The
transaction resulted in additional interests in 16 of the properties which remain unconsolidated, the consolidation of nine previously unconsolidated properties and the purchase of the remaining
noncontrolling interest in a previously consolidated property. The transaction was valued at $1.5 billion, which included repayment of the remaining $562.1 million balance on TMLP's
senior loan facility, and retirement of $100.0 million of TMLP's trust preferred securities. In connection with the transaction, our $558.4 million loan to SPG-FCM was extinguished on a
non-cash basis. We consolidated $2.6 billion in additional property-level mortgage debt in connection with this transaction. This property-level mortgage debt was previously presented as debt
of our unconsolidated entities. We and our joint venture partner had equal ownership in these properties prior to the transaction.

The
consolidation of the previously unconsolidated properties resulted in a remeasurement of our previously held interest in each of these nine newly consolidated properties to fair
value and recognition of a corresponding non-cash gain of $488.7 million. In addition, we recorded an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $22.4 million for the excess of carrying
value of our remaining investment in SPG-FCM over its estimated fair value. The gain on the transaction and impairment charge are included in gain upon acquisition of controlling interests, sale or
disposal of assets and interests in unconsolidated entities, and impairment charge on investment in unconsolidated entities, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and
comprehensive income. The assets and liabilities of the newly consolidated properties acquired in the Mills transaction have been reflected at their estimated fair value at the acquisition date.

We
recorded our acquisition of the interest in these nine newly consolidated properties using the acquisition method of accounting. Tangible and intangible assets and liabilities were
established based on their fair values at the date of acquisition. The results of operations of the newly consolidated properties have been included in our consolidated results from the date of
acquisition. The purchase price allocations were finalized during the first quarter of 2013. No significant adjustments were made to the previously reported purchase price allocations.

On
January 6, 2012, we paid $50.0 million to acquire an additional 25% interest in Del Amo Fashion Center, increasing our interest to 50%.

On
December 31, 2011, as further discussed in Note 4, we and our joint venture partner dissolved a venture in which we had a 50% interest and distributed a portfolio of
properties previously held within the venture to us and our joint venture partner. The results of operations of these properties are now presented as loss from operations of discontinued joint venture
interests and the non-cash gain of $168.3 million recorded upon distribution to the partners is presented within (loss) gain on sale or disposal of discontinued operations, net in the "Summary

European Investments.

At December 31, 2013, we owned 57,634,148 shares, or approximately 28.9%, of
Klépierre, which had a
quoted market price of $46.53 per share. At the date of purchase on March 14, 2012, our excess investment in Klépierre was approximately $1.2 billion which we have
allocated to the underlying investment property, other assets and liabilities based on estimated fair value. Our share of net income, net of amortization of our excess investment, was
$20.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. Our share of net income, net of the amortization of our excess investment, was $0.5 million from the acquisition date through
December 31, 2012. Based on applicable Euro:USD exchange rates and after our conversion of Klépierre's results to GAAP, Klépierre's total assets, total
liabilities, and noncontrolling interests were $17.1 billion, $12.3 billion, and $1.7 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2013 and $17.2 billion,
$12.4 billion, and $1.9 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2012. Klépierre's total revenues, operating income and consolidated net income were approximately
$1.5 billion, $989.6 million and $317.3 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2013 and $1.1 billion, $394.7 million and
$323.6 million, respectively, for the period of our ownership in 2012.

During
the second quarter of 2013, we signed a definitive agreement with McArthurGlen, an owner, developer, and manager of designer outlets, to form one or more joint ventures to invest
in certain of its existing designer outlets, development projects, and its property management and development companies. In conjunction with that agreement, we purchased a noncontrolling interest in
the property management and development companies of McArthurGlen, and a noncontrolling interest in a development property located in Vancouver, British Columbia. On August 2, 2013 we acquired
a noncontrolling interest in Ashford Designer Outlets in Kent, UK. On October 16, 2013 we completed the remaining transactions contemplated by our previously announced definitive agreement with
McArthurGlen by acquiring noncontrolling interests in portions of four existing McArthurGlen Designer Outlets — Parndorf (Vienna, Austria), La Reggia (Naples, Italy), Noventa di
Piave (Venice, Italy), and Roermond (Roermond, Netherlands). Our legal ownership interests in these entities range from 22.5% to 90%. The aggregate consideration for the above transactions, which is
subject to further adjustment based upon contractual obligations and customary purchase price adjustments, was approximately $496.7 million. The carrying amount of our investment in these joint
ventures, including all related components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as well as subsequent capital contributions for development, was $510.7 million as of
December 31, 2013. Substantially all of our investment has been deemed excess investment and has been preliminarily allocated to the underlying investment property based on estimated fair
values. The preliminary allocations are subject to revision within the measurement period, not to exceed one year from the date of the acquisitions.

We
also have a minority interest in Value Retail PLC, which owns and operates nine luxury outlets throughout Europe and a direct minority ownership in three of those outlets.
These investments are accounted for under the cost method. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, the carrying value of these investments was $115.4 million and $95.5 million,
respectively, and is included in deferred costs and other assets.

On
January 9, 2012, we sold our entire ownership interest in GCI to our venture partner, Auchan S.A. The aggregate cash we received was $375.8 million and we
recognized a gain on the sale of $28.8 million. Our investment carrying value included $39.5 million of accumulated losses related to currency translation and net investment hedge
accumulated balances which had been recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

Asian Joint Ventures.

We conduct our international Premium Outlet operations in Japan through a joint
venture with Mitsubishi
Estate Co., Ltd. We have a 40% ownership interest in this joint venture. The carrying amount of our investment in this joint venture was $261.1 million and $314.2 million
as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively; including all related components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). We conduct our international Premium Outlet operations in
South Korea through a joint venture with Shinsegae International Co. We have a 50% ownership interest in this joint venture. The carrying amount of our investment in this joint venture was
$76.4 million and $62.9 million as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively; including all related components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

Summary Financial Information

A summary of our equity method investments and share of income from such investments, excluding Klépierre, follows. The
accompanying joint venture statements of operations include amounts related to our investment GCI which was sold on January 9, 2012. In addition, we acquired additional controlling interests in
King of Prussia on August 25, 2011, and nine properties in the Mills transaction on March 22, 2012. These previously unconsolidated properties became consolidated properties as of their
respective acquisition dates. Additionally, on December 31, 2011, we and our joint venture partner dissolved a venture in which we had a 50% interest and distributed a portfolio of properties
previously held within the venture to us and our joint venture partner. During 2012, we disposed of our interests in one mall and three non-core retail properties. Finally, during 2013, we disposed of
three non-core retail properties. These transactions are reported within discontinued operations in the accompanying joint venture statements of operations.

"Excess
Investment" represents the unamortized difference of our investment over our share of the equity in the underlying net assets of the joint ventures or other investments acquired
and is allocated on a fair value basis primarily to investment property, lease related intangibles, and debt premiums and discounts. We amortize excess investment over the life of the related
depreciable components of investment property, typically no greater than 40 years, the terms of the applicable leases and the applicable debt maturity, respectively. The amortization is
included in the reported amount of income from unconsolidated entities.

General.

Our unsecured debt agreements contain financial covenants and other non-financial covenants. If
we were to fail to comply with these
covenants, after the expiration of the applicable cure periods, the debt maturity could be accelerated or other remedies could be sought by the lender including adjustments to the applicable interest
rate. As of December 31, 2013, we are in compliance with all covenants of our unsecured debt.

At
December 31, 2013, we or our subsidiaries were the borrowers under 80 non-recourse mortgage notes secured by mortgages on 80 properties, including seven separate pools of
cross-defaulted and cross-collateralized mortgages encumbering a total of 27 properties. Under these cross-default provisions, a default under any mortgage included in the cross-defaulted pool may
constitute a default under all mortgages within that pool and may lead to acceleration of the indebtedness due on each property within the pool. Certain of our secured debt instruments contain
financial and other non-financial covenants which are specific to the properties which serve as collateral for that debt. If the borrower fails to comply with these covenants, the lender could
accelerate the debt and enforce its right against their collateral. At December 31, 2013, the applicable borrowers under these non-recourse mortgage notes were in compliance with all covenants
where non-compliance could individually, or giving effect to applicable cross-default provisions in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or
cash flows.

Unsecured Debt

At December 31, 2013, our unsecured debt consisted of $13.9 billion of senior unsecured notes of the Operating
Partnership, net of discounts, $960.1 million outstanding under our $4.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, or Credit



Simon Property Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts

and where indicated as in millions or billions)

Facility,
and $212.2 million outstanding under our $2.0 billion supplemental unsecured revolving credit facility, or Supplemental Facility, and $240.0 million outstanding under an
unsecured term loan. The December 31, 2013 balance on the Credit Facility included $660.1 million (U.S. dollar equivalent) of Euro-denominated borrowings and the entire balance on the
Supplemental Facility on such date consisted of Yen-denominated borrowings, both of which are designated as net investment hedges of a portion of our international investments.

On
December 31, 2013, we had an aggregate available borrowing capacity of $4.8 billion under the two credit facilities. The maximum outstanding balance of the credit
facilities during the year ended December 31, 2013 was $1.6 billion and the weighted average outstanding balance was $1.3 billion. Letters of credit of $41.9 million were
outstanding under the two facilities as of December 31, 2013.

The
Credit Facility's initial borrowing capacity of $4.0 billion can be increased at our sole option to $5.0 billion during its term. The Credit Facility will initially
mature on October 30, 2015 and can be extended for an additional year at our sole option. As of December 31, 2013, the base interest rate on the Credit Facility was LIBOR plus 95 basis
points (reflects a five basis point reduction effective May 16, 2013) with an additional facility fee of 15 basis points. In addition, the Credit Facility provides for a money market
competitive bid option program that allows us to hold auctions to achieve lower pricing for short-term borrowings. The Credit Facility also includes a $2.0 billion multi-currency tranche.

The
Supplemental Facility's borrowing capacity of $2.0 billion can be increased at our sole option to $2.5 billion during its term. The Supplemental Facility will
initially mature on June 30, 2016 and can be extended for an additional year at our sole option. As of December 31, 2013, the base interest rate on the Supplemental Facility was LIBOR
plus 95 basis points (reflects a five basis point reduction effective May 16, 2013) with an additional facility fee of 15 basis points. Like the Credit Facility, the Supplemental Facility
provides for a money market competitive bid option program and allows for multi-currency borrowings.

During
2013, we redeemed at par or repaid at maturity $504.5 million of senior unsecured notes with fixed rates ranging from 5.30% to 7.18% with cash on hand. In addition, we
repaid a $240.0 million mortgage loan with the proceeds from a $240.0 million unsecured term loan. The term loan has a capacity of up to $300.0 million, bears interest at LIBOR
plus 110 basis points and matures on February 28, 2016 with two available one-year extension options.

On
October 2, 2013, the Operating Partnership issued €750.0 million ($1.0 billion USD equivalent) of senior unsecured notes at a fixed interest rate
of 2.375% with a maturity date of October 2, 2020. Proceeds from the unsecured notes offering were used to pay down a portion of Euro-denominated borrowings on the Credit Facility and fund the
acquisition of various assets in the McArthurGlen transactions further discussed in Note 7. These notes are designated as a net investment hedge of our Euro-denominated international
investments.

On
December 30, 2013, we borrowed $300.0 million on our Credit Facility to partially fund the Sawgrass Mills mortgage repayment on January 2, 2014. These Credit
Facility borrowings were repaid in full on January 22, 2014 using unsecured notes proceeds as discussed below.

On
January 21, 2014, the Operating Partnership issued $600.0 million of senior unsecured notes at a fixed interest rate of 2.20% with a maturity date of February 1,
2019 and $600.0 million of senior unsecured notes at a fixed interest rate of 3.75% with a maturity date of February 1, 2024. Proceeds from the unsecured notes offering were used to
repay debt and for general corporate purposes.

Mortgage Debt

Total mortgage indebtedness was $8.2 billion and $8.0 billion at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. During
2013, we added $370.0 million in new mortgage loans on previously unencumbered properties with a weighted average interest rate of 4.04%.

On
January 2, 2014, we repaid the $820.0 million outstanding mortgage at Sawgrass Mills originally maturing July 1, 2014 with cash on hand and a borrowing on our
Credit Facility as discussed above.

Derivative Financial Instruments

Our exposure to market risk due to changes in interest rates primarily relates to our long-term debt obligations. We manage exposure to
interest rate market risk through our risk management strategy by a combination of interest rate protection agreements to effectively fix or cap a portion of variable rate debt. We are also exposed to
foreign currency risk on financings of certain foreign operations. Our intent is to offset gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures, with gains and losses on the derivative contracts
hedging these
exposures. We do not enter into either interest rate protection or foreign currency rate protection agreements for speculative purposes.

We
may enter into treasury lock agreements as part of an anticipated debt issuance. Upon completion of the debt issuance, the fair value of these instruments is recorded as part of
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and is amortized to interest expense over the life of the debt agreement.

The
unamortized loss on our treasury locks and terminated hedges recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) was $67.5 million and $78.0 million as of
December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. As of December 31, 2013, our outstanding LIBOR based derivative contracts consisted of:

•

interest rate cap protection agreements with a notional amount of $248.3 million which mature in June 2014, and

•

fixed rate swap agreements with a notional amount of $491.6 million which have a weighted average fixed pay rate of
3.13% and a weighted average variable receive rate of 2.0%.



Simon Property Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts

and where indicated as in millions or billions)

Within
the next year, we expect to reclassify to earnings approximately $10.4 million of losses related to active and terminated interest rate swaps from the current balance held
in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

Fair Value of Debt

The carrying value of our variable-rate mortgages and other loans approximates their fair values. We estimate the fair values of
consolidated fixed-rate mortgages using cash flows discounted at current borrowing rates and other indebtedness using cash flows discounted at current market rates. We estimate the fair values of
consolidated fixed-rate unsecured notes using quoted market prices, or, if no quoted market prices are available, we use quoted market prices for securities with similar terms and maturities. The book
value of our consolidated fixed-rate mortgages and unsecured indebtedness was $21.8 billion and $21.0 billion as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The fair values of
these financial instruments and the related discount rate assumptions as of December 31 are summarized as follows:

10. Equity

Our Board of Directors is authorized to reclassify excess common stock into one or more additional classes and series of capital stock,
to establish the number of shares in each class or series and to fix the preferences, conversion and other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends, and qualifications and
terms and conditions of redemption of such class or series, without any further vote or action by the stockholders. The issuance of additional classes or series of capital stock may have the effect of
delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us without further action of the stockholders. The ability to issue additional classes or series of capital stock, while providing flexibility
in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes, could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or of discouraging a third party from acquiring,
a majority of our outstanding voting stock.

Holders
of our common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held of record on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders, other than for the election of directors. The
holders of our Class B common stock have the right to elect up to four members of the Board of Directors. All 8,000 outstanding shares of the Class B common stock are subject to two
voting trusts as to which Herbert Simon and David Simon are the trustees. Shares of Class B common stock convert automatically into an equal number of shares of common stock upon the occurrence
of certain events and can be converted into shares of common stock at the option of the holders.

Common Stock Issuances

In 2013, we issued 596,051 shares of common stock to 11 limited partners of the Operating Partnership in exchange for an equal number
of units pursuant to the partnership agreement of the Operating Partnership.

We
issued 1,567 shares of common stock related to employee stock options exercised during 2013. We used the net proceeds from the option exercises to acquire additional units in the
Operating Partnership.

Temporary Equity

We classify as temporary equity those securities for which there is the possibility that we could be required to redeem the security
for cash irrespective of the probability of such a possibility. As a result, we classify one series of preferred units of the Operating Partnership and noncontrolling redeemable interests in
properties in temporary equity. Each of these securities is discussed further below.

Limited Partners' Preferred Interest in the Operating Partnership and Noncontrolling Redeemable Interests in Properties.

The following table
summarizes the preferred units of the Operating Partnership and the amount of the noncontrolling redeemable interests in properties as of December 31. The redemption features of the preferred
units of the Operating Partnership contain provisions which could require us to settle the redemption in cash. As a result, this series of preferred units in the Operating Partnership remains
classified outside permanent equity. The remaining interests in a property or portfolio of properties which are redeemable at the option of the holder or in circumstances that may be outside our
control, are accounted for as temporary equity within limited partners' preferred interest in the Operating Partnership and noncontrolling redeemable interests in properties in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets. The carrying amount of the noncontrolling interest is adjusted to the redemption amount assuming the instrument is redeemable at the balance sheet date. Changes in the
redemption value of the underlying noncontrolling interest are recorded within accumulated deficit. There are no noncontrolling interests redeemable at amounts in excess of fair value.

On
January 10, 2014, we acquired one of our partner's remaining redeemable interests in a portfolio of ten properties for approximately $113.3 million subject to a
pre-existing contractual arrangement. The amount paid to acquire the interests in the seven properties which were previously consolidated is included in limited partners' preferred interest in the
Operating Partnership and noncontrolling redeemable interest in properties in the accompanying December 31, 2013 consolidated balance sheet.

7.50% Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units.

This series of preferred units accrues cumulative quarterly
distributions at a rate of $7.50 annually.
The preferred units are redeemable by the Operating Partnership upon the death of the survivor of the original holders, or the transfer of any units to any person or entity other than the persons or
entities entitled to the benefits of the original holder. The redemption price is the liquidation value ($100.00 per preferred unit) plus accrued and unpaid distributions, payable either in cash or
fully registered shares of our common stock at our election. In the event of the death of a holder of the preferred units, the occurrence of certain tax triggering events applicable to the holder, or
on or after November 10, 2006, the holder may require the Operating Partnership to redeem the preferred units at the same redemption price payable at the option of the Operating Partnership in
either cash or shares of common stock.

Permanent Equity

Preferred Stock.

Dividends on all series of preferred stock are calculated based upon the preferred
stock's preferred return multiplied by the
preferred stock's corresponding liquidation value. The Operating Partnership pays preferred distributions to us equal to the dividends we pay on the preferred stock issued.

issued at a premium of $7.5 million. The
unamortized premium included in the carrying value of the preferred stock at December 31, 2013 and 2012 was $4.5 million and $4.9 million, respectively.

Other Equity Activity

Notes Receivable from Former CPI Stockholders.

Notes receivable of $15.3 million from stockholders
of an entity we acquired in 1998 are
reflected as a deduction from capital in excess of par value in the consolidated statements of equity in the accompanying financial statements. The notes do not bear interest and become due at the
time the underlying shares are sold.

The Simon Property Group 1998 Stock Incentive Plan.

This plan, or the 1998 plan, provides for the grant
of equity-based awards in the form of options
to purchase shares, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock grants and performance-based unit awards. Options may be granted which are qualified as "incentive stock options" within the meaning of
Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code and options which are not so qualified. An aggregate of 17,300,000 shares of common stock have been reserved for issuance under the 1998 plan.
Additionally, the partnership agreement requires us to purchase operating partnership units for cash in an amount equal to the fair market value of such shares.

Administration.

The 1998 plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors,
or the Compensation Committee. The
Compensation Committee determines which eligible individuals may participate and the type, extent and terms of the awards to be granted to them. In addition, the Compensation Committee interprets the
1998 plan and makes all other determinations deemed advisable for its administration. Options granted to employees become exercisable over the period determined by the Compensation Committee. The
exercise price of an employee option may not be less than the fair market value of the shares on the date of grant. Employee options generally vest over a three-year period and expire ten years from
the date of grant.

Awards for Eligible Directors.

Directors who are not also our employees or employees of our affiliates
are eligible to receive awards under the 1998
plan. Currently, each eligible director receives on the first day of the first calendar month following his or her initial election an award of restricted stock with a value of $82,500 (pro-rated for
partial years of service). Thereafter, as of the date of each annual meeting of stockholders, eligible directors who are re-elected receive an award of restricted stock having a value of $82,500. In
addition, eligible directors who serve as chairpersons of the standing committees receive an additional annual award of restricted stock having a value of $10,000 (in the case of the Audit and
Compensation Committees) or $7,500 (in the case of the Governance and Nominating Committees). The Lead Independent Director also receives an annual restricted stock award having a value of $12,500.
The restricted stock vests in full after one year.

Once
vested, the delivery of the shares of restricted stock (including reinvested dividends) is deferred under our Director Deferred Compensation Plan until the director retires, dies
or becomes disabled or otherwise no longer serves as a director. The directors may vote and are entitled to receive dividends on the underlying shares; however, any dividends on the shares of
restricted stock must be reinvested in shares of common stock and held in the deferred compensation plan until the shares of restricted stock are delivered to the former director.

Stock Based Compensation

Awards under our stock based compensation plans primarily take the form of LTIP units and restricted stock grants. Restricted stock and
awards under the LTIP programs are all performance based and are based on various corporate and business unit performance measures as further described below. The expense related to these programs,
net of amounts capitalized, is included within home and regional office costs and general and administrative costs in the accompanying statements of operations and comprehensive income.

LTIP Programs.

Every year since 2010, the Compensation Committee has approved long-term, performance
based incentive compensation programs, or the
LTIP programs, for certain senior executive officers. Awards under the LTIP programs take the form of LTIP units, a form of limited partnership interest issued by the Operating Partnership, and will
be considered earned if, and only to the extent to which, applicable total shareholder return, or TSR, performance measures are achieved during the performance period. Once earned, LTIP units are
subject to a two year vesting period. One-half of the earned LTIP units will vest on January 1 of each of the 2nd and 3rd years following the end of the applicable performance period, subject
to the participant maintaining employment with us through those dates and certain other conditions as described in those agreements. Awarded LTIP units not earned are forfeited. Earned and fully
vested LTIP units are the equivalent of units. During the performance period, participants are entitled to receive distributions on the LTIP units awarded to them equal to 10% of the regular quarterly
distributions paid on a unit of the Operating Partnership. As a result, we account for these LTIP units as participating securities under the two-class method of computing earnings per share.

From
2010 to 2013, the Compensation Committee approved LTIP grants as shown in the table below. Grant date fair values of the LTIP units are estimated using a Monte Carlo model, and the
resulting expense is recorded regardless of whether the TSR performance measures are achieved if the required service is delivered. The grant date fair values are being amortized into expense over the
period from the grant date to the date at which the awards, if any, would become vested. The extent to which LTIP units that were earned and the aggregate grant date fair values adjusted for estimated
forfeitures, are as set forth as follows:

LTIP Program

To be determined in 2015

$35.0 million

2013-2015 LTIP Program

We
recorded compensation expense, net of capitalization, related to these LTIP programs of approximately $25.7 million, $22.0 million, and $16.5 million for the
years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

Restricted Stock.

The 1998 plan also provides for shares of restricted stock to be granted to certain
employees at no cost to those employees,
subject to achievement of individual performance and certain financial and return-based performance measures established by the Compensation Committee related to the most recent year's performance.
Once granted, the shares of restricted stock then vest annually over a three-year period beginning on January 1 of each year. The cost of restricted stock grants, which is based upon the
stock's fair market value on the grant date, is recognized as expense ratably over the vesting period. Through December 31, 2013 a total of 5,447,436 shares of restricted stock,



Simon Property Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts

and where indicated as in millions or billions)

net
of forfeitures, have been awarded under the plan. Information regarding restricted stock awards is summarized in the following table for each of the years presented:

Other Compensation Arrangements.

On July 6, 2011, in connection with the execution of an employment
agreement, the Compensation Committee
granted David Simon, our Chairman and CEO, a retention award in the form of 1,000,000 LTIP units (the "Award") for his continued service as our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer through
July 5, 2019. Effective December 31, 2013, the Award was modified ("Current Award") and as a result the LTIP units will now become earned and eligible to vest based on the attainment of
Company-based performance goals, in addition to the service-based vesting requirement included in the original Award. If the relevant performance criteria are not achieved, all or a portion of the
Current Award will be forfeited. The Current Award does not contain an opportunity for Mr. Simon to receive additional LTIP Units above and beyond the original Award should our performance
exceed the higher end of the performance criteria. The performance criteria of the Current Award are based on the attainment of specific funds from operations ("FFO") per share. If the performance
criteria have been met, a maximum of 360,000 LTIP units ("A Units"), 360,000 LTIP units ("B Units") and 280,000 LTIP units ("C Units") may become earned December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017,
respectively. The earned A Units will vest on January 1, 2018, earned B Units will vest on January 1, 2019 and earned C Units will vest on June 30, 2019, subject to continued
employment through such applicable date. The grant date fair value of the retention award of $120.3 million is being recognized as expense over the eight-year term of his employment agreement
on a straight-line basis based through the applicable vesting periods of the A Units, B Units and C Units.

Since
2001, we have not granted any options to officers, directors or employees, except for a series of reload options we assumed as part of a prior business combination. During the
year ended December 31, 2013, 1,567 options with a weighted average exercise price per share of $50.17 were exercised. As of December 31, 2013, there were no remaining options
outstanding.

We
also maintain a tax-qualified retirement 401(k) savings plan and offer no other post-retirement or post-employment benefits to our employees.

Exchange Rights

Limited partners in the Operating Partnership have the right to exchange all or any portion of their units for shares of common stock
on a one-for-one basis or cash, as determined by the Board of Directors. The amount of cash to be paid if the exchange right is exercised and the cash option is selected will be based on the trading
price of our common stock at that time. At December 31, 2013, we had reserved 57,274,430
shares of common stock for possible issuance upon the exchange of units, stock options and Class B common stock.

11. Commitments and Contingencies

Litigation

We are involved from time-to-time in various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business, including, but not
limited to commercial disputes, environmental matters, and litigation in connection with transactions including acquisitions and divestitures. We believe that such litigation, claims and
administrative proceedings will not have



Simon Property Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts

and where indicated as in millions or billions)

a
material adverse impact on our financial position or our results of operations. We record a liability when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated.

In
May 2010, Opry Mills sustained significant flood damage. Insurance proceeds of $50 million have been funded by the insurers and remediation work has been completed. The
property was re-opened March 29, 2012. The excess insurance carriers (those providing coverage above $50 million) have denied the claim under the policy for additional proceeds (of up to
$150 million) to pay further amounts for restoration costs and business interruption losses. We and our lenders are continuing our efforts through pending litigation to recover our losses under
the excess insurance policies for Opry Mills and we believe recovery is probable, but no assurances can be made that our efforts to recover these funds will be successful.

Lease Commitments

As of December 31, 2013, a total of 28 of the consolidated properties are subject to ground leases. The termination dates of
these ground leases range from 2014 to 2090. These ground leases generally require us to make fixed annual rental payments, or a fixed annual rental plus a percentage rent
component based upon the revenues or total sales of the property. In addition, we have several regional office locations that are subject to leases with termination dates ranging from 2014 to 2028.
These office leases generally require us to make fixed annual rental payments plus pay our share of common area, real estate and utility expenses. Some of our ground and office leases include
escalation clauses and renewal options. We incurred ground lease expense and office lease expense, which are included in other expense and home office and regional expense, respectively, as follows:

Insurance

We maintain insurance coverage with third party carriers who provide a portion of the coverage for specific layers of potential losses
including commercial general liability, fire, flood, extended coverage and rental loss insurance on all of our properties in the United States. The initial portion of coverage not provided by third
party carriers is either insured through our wholly-owned captive insurance companies, Rosewood Indemnity, Ltd. and Bridgewood Insurance Company, Ltd., or other financial arrangements
controlled by us. The third
party carrier has, in turn, agreed to provide evidence of coverage for this layer of losses under the terms and conditions of the carrier's policy. A similar policy written through our captive
insurance entities also provides initial coverage for property insurance and certain windstorm risks at the properties located in coastal windstorm locations.

We
currently maintain insurance coverage against acts of terrorism on all of our properties in the United States on an "all risk" basis in the amount of up to $1 billion. The
current federal laws which provide this coverage are expected to operate through 2014. Despite the existence of this insurance coverage, any threatened or actual terrorist attacks where we operate
could adversely affect our property values, revenues, consumer traffic and tenant sales.

Guarantees of Indebtedness

Joint venture debt is the liability of the joint venture and is typically secured by the joint venture property, which is non-recourse
to us. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, the Operating Partnership guaranteed joint venture related mortgage indebtedness of $190.8 million and $84.9 million, respectively (of
which we have a right of recovery from our venture partners of $83.0 million and $38.6 million, respectively). Mortgages guaranteed by us are secured by the property of the joint venture
which could be sold in order to satisfy the outstanding obligation and which has an estimated fair value in excess of the guaranteed amount.

Concentration of Credit Risk

Our malls, Premium Outlets, The Mills, and community/lifestyle centers rely heavily upon anchor tenants to attract customers; however,
anchor retailers do not contribute materially to our financial results as many anchor retailers own their spaces. All material operations are within the United States and no customer or tenant
accounts for 5% or more of our consolidated revenues.

Limited Life Partnerships

We are the controlling partner in several consolidated partnerships that have a limited life. We estimated the settlement values of
these noncontrolling interests as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 as approximately $125.0 million and $143.0 million, respectively. The settlement values are based on the estimated
fair values upon a hypothetical liquidation of the partnership interests and estimated yield maintenance or prepayment penalties associated with the payment to settle any underlying secured mortgage
debt.

12. Related Party Transactions

Our management company provides management, insurance, and other services to Melvin Simon & Associates, Inc., a related
party, unconsolidated joint ventures, and other non-owned related party properties. Amounts for services provided by our management company and its affiliates to our unconsolidated joint ventures and
other related parties were as follows:

to TMLP and SPG-FCM. The loan to SPG-FCM was extinguished in the Mills transaction in 2012. In addition, during 2013, 2012 and 2011, we recorded development, royalty and
other fee income related to our international investments of $14.0 million, $15.5 million and $12.3 million, respectively. Also during 2013, 2012 and 2011, we received fees
related to financing activities, net of elimination, provided to unconsolidated joint ventures of $15.9 million, $3.0 million and $1.8 million, respectively. The fees related to
our international investments and financing activities are included in other income in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.

Item 9A.    Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rule 13a-15(e) under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act")) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Because of inherent limitations, disclosure
controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of disclosure controls and procedures are met.

Our
management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and
procedures. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures
are effective at a reasonable assurance level.

Depreciation
of our investment in buildings and improvements reflected in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income is calculated over the estimated original
lives of the assets as noted below.

•

Buildings and Improvements — typically 10-35 years for the structure, 15 years for
landscaping and parking lot, and 10 years for HVAC equipment.

•

Tenant Allowances and Improvements — shorter of lease term or useful life.

(3)

Initial cost generally represents net book value at December 20, 1993, except for acquired properties
and new developments after December 20, 1993. Initial cost also includes any new developments that are opened during the current year. Costs of disposals and impairments of property are first
reflected as a reduction to cost capitalized subsequent to acquisition.

(4)

Not developed/constructed by us or our predecessors. The date of construction represents the initial
acquisition date for assets in which we have acquired multiple interests.

(5)

Initial cost for these properties is the cost at the date of consolidation for properties previously accounted
for under the equity method of accounting.

(6)

Encumbrances represent face amount of mortgage debt and exclude any premiums or discounts.

(7)

Property redeveloped and re-opened as of date shown.
