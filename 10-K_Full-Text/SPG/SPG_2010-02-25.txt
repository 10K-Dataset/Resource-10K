Part I

Item 1. Business

Simon Property Group, Inc. is a Delaware corporation that operates as a self-administered and self-managed real
estate investment trust, or REIT, under the Internal Revenue Code. Simon Property Group, L.P., or the Operating Partnership, is our majority-owned partnership subsidiary that owns all of our real
estate properties. In this report, the terms "we", "us" and "our" refer to Simon Property Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries.

We
own, develop and manage retail real estate properties, which consist primarily of regional malls, Premium Outlet® Centers, The Mills®, and community/lifestyle
centers. As of December 31, 2009, we owned or held an interest in 321 income-producing properties in the United States, which consisted of 162 regional malls, 41 Premium Outlet Centers, 67
community/lifestyle centers, 36 properties acquired in the 2007 acquisition of The Mills Corporation, or the Mills acquisition, and 15 other shopping centers or outlet centers in
41 states and Puerto Rico. Of the 36 properties acquired in The Mills portfolio, 16 of these properties are The Mills, 16 are regional malls, and four are community centers. We also own
an interest in one parcel of land held in the United States for future development. Internationally, as of December 31, 2009, we had ownership interests in 51 European shopping centers
(France, Italy and Poland), eight Premium Outlet Centers in Japan, one Premium Outlet Center in Mexico, and one Premium Outlet Center in South Korea. Also, through joint venture arrangements we have a
24% interest in two shopping centers in Italy currently under development. On February 4, 2010, we and our partner entered into a definitive agreement to sell all of the interests in Simon
Ivanhoe S.à.r.l, or Simon Ivanhoe, which owns seven shopping centers located in France and Poland.

For
a description of our operational strategies and developments in our business during 2009, see the "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations" section of the 2009 Annual Report to Shareholders filed as Exhibit 13.1 to this Form 10-K.

Other Policies

The following is a discussion of our investment policies, financing policies, conflict of interest policies and policies with respect
to certain other activities. One or more of these policies may be amended or rescinded from time to time without a stockholder vote.

Investment Policies

While we emphasize equity real estate investments, we may, at our discretion, invest in mortgages and other real estate interests
consistent with our qualification as a REIT. We do not currently intend to invest to a significant extent in mortgages or deeds of trust; however, we hold a mortgage note which results in us receiving
100% of the economics of a property. We may invest in participating or convertible mortgages if we conclude that we may benefit from the cash flow or any appreciation in the value of the property.

We
may invest in securities of other entities engaged in real estate activities or securities of other issuers. However, any of these investments would be subject to the percentage
ownership limitations and gross income tests necessary for REIT qualification. These REIT limitations mean that we cannot make an investment that would cause our real estate assets to be less than 75%
of our total assets. In addition, at least 75% of our gross income must be derived directly or indirectly from investments relating to real property or mortgages on real property, including "rents
from real property," dividends from other REITs and, in certain circumstances, interest from certain types of temporary investments. At least 95% of our income must be derived from such real property
investments, and from dividends, interest and gains from the sale or dispositions of stock or securities or from other combinations of the foregoing.

Subject
to REIT limitations, we may invest in the securities of other issuers in connection with acquisitions of indirect interests in real estate. Such an investment would normally be
in the form of general or limited partnership or membership interests in special purpose partnerships and limited liability companies that own one or more properties. We may, in the future, acquire
all or substantially all of the securities or assets of other REITs, management companies or similar entities where such investments would be consistent with our investment policies.



Financing Policies

We must comply with the covenants contained in our financing agreements that limit our ratio of debt to total assets or market value,
as defined. For example, the Operating Partnership's lines of credit and the indentures for the Operating Partnership's debt securities contain covenants that restrict the total amount of debt of the
Operating Partnership to 65%, or 60% in relation to certain debt, of total assets, as defined under the related arrangement, and secured debt to 50% of total assets. In addition, these agreements
contain other covenants requiring compliance with financial ratios. Furthermore, the amount of debt that we may incur is limited as a practical matter by our desire to maintain acceptable ratings for
our equity securities and the debt securities of the Operating Partnership.

If
our Board of Directors determines to seek additional capital, we may raise such capital through additional equity offerings, debt financing, creating joint ventures with existing
ownership interests in properties, retention of cash flows or a combination of these methods. Our ability to retain cash flows is limited by the requirement for REITs to distribute at least 90% of
their taxable income. We must also take into account taxes that would be imposed on undistributed taxable income. If the Board of Directors determines to raise additional equity capital, it may,
without stockholder approval, issue additional shares of common stock or other capital stock. The Board of Directors may issue a number of shares up to the amount of our authorized capital in any
manner and on such terms and for such consideration as it deems appropriate. Such securities may be senior to the outstanding classes of common stock. Such securities also may include additional
classes of preferred stock, which may be convertible into common stock. Existing stockholders have no preemptive right to purchase shares in any subsequent offering of our securities. Any such
offering could dilute a stockholder's investment in us.

We
expect most future borrowings would be made through the Operating Partnership or its subsidiaries. We might, however, incur borrowings that would be reloaned to the Operating
Partnership. Borrowings may be in the form of bank borrowings, publicly and privately placed debt instruments, or purchase money obligations to the sellers of properties. Any such indebtedness may be
secured or unsecured. Any such indebtedness may also have full or limited recourse to the borrower or cross-collateralized with other debt, or may be fully or partially guaranteed by the Operating
Partnership. Although we may borrow to fund the payment of dividends, we currently have no expectation that we will regularly be required to do so.

On
December 8, 2009, the Operating Partnership entered into a new $3.565 billion unsecured revolving corporate credit facility which replaced its $3.5 billion
unsecured credit facility, or the Credit Facility, which expired on January 11, 2010. The new credit facility contains an accordion feature allowing the maximum borrowing capacity to expand to
$4.0 billion. The new credit facility matures on March 31, 2013. We issue debt securities through the Operating Partnership, but we may issue our debt securities which may be convertible
into capital stock or be accompanied by warrants to purchase capital stock. We also may sell or securitize our lease receivables. The proceeds from any borrowings or financings may be used for one or
more of the following:

•

financing acquisitions;

•

developing or redeveloping properties;

•

refinancing existing indebtedness;

•

working capital or capital improvements; or

•

meeting the income distribution requirements applicable to REITs, if we have income without the receipt of cash sufficient
to enable us to meet such distribution requirements.

We
may also finance acquisitions through the following:

•

issuance of shares of common stock or preferred stock;

•

issuance of additional units of limited partnership interest in the Operating
Partnership;

•

issuance of preferred units of the Operating Partnership;

•

issuance of other securities; or

•

sale or exchange of ownership interests in properties.

The
ability of the Operating Partnership to issue units of limited partnership interest to transferors of properties or other partnership interests may defer gain recognition for tax
purposes by the transferor. It may also be advantageous for us since there are ownership limits that restrict the number of shares of our capital stock that investors may own.



We
do not have a policy limiting the number or amount of mortgages that may be placed on any particular property. Mortgage financing instruments, however, usually limit additional
indebtedness on such properties. We also have covenants on our unsecured debt that limit our total secured debt.

Typically,
we invest in or form special purpose entities to assist us in obtaining permanent financing at attractive terms. Permanent financing may be structured as a mortgage loan on a
single property, or on a group of properties, and generally requires us to provide a mortgage interest on the property in favor of an institutional third party, as a joint venture with a third party,
or as a securitized financing. For securitized financings, we create special purpose entities to own the properties. These special purpose entities are structured so that they would not be
consolidated with us in the event we would ever become subject to a bankruptcy proceeding. We decide upon the structure of the financing based upon the best terms then available to us and whether the
proposed financing is consistent with our other business objectives. For accounting purposes, we include the outstanding securitized debt of special purpose entities owning consolidated properties as
part of our consolidated indebtedness.

Conflict of Interest Policies

We maintain policies and have entered into agreements designed to reduce or eliminate potential conflicts of interest. We have adopted
governance principles governing our affairs and the Board of Directors, as well as written charters for each of the standing Committees of the Board of Directors. In
addition, we have a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which applies to all of our officers, directors, and employees. At least a majority of the members of our Board of Directors must qualify as
independent under the listing standards for New York Stock Exchange companies and cannot be affiliated with the Simon family who are significant stockholders and/or unitholders in the Operating
Partnership. Any transaction between us and the Simons, including property acquisitions, service and property management agreements and retail space leases, must be approved by a majority of our
non-affiliated directors.

The
sale by the Operating Partnership of any property that it owns may have an adverse tax impact on the Simons and the other limited partners of the Operating Partnership. In order to
avoid any conflict of interest between Simon Property and the limited partners of the Operating Partnership, our charter requires that at least six of our independent directors must authorize and
require the Operating Partnership to sell any property it owns. Any such sale is subject to applicable agreements with third parties. Noncompetition agreements executed by each of the Simons contain
covenants limiting the ability of the Simons to participate in certain shopping center activities in North America.

Policies With Respect To Certain Other Activities

We intend to make investments which are consistent with our qualification as a REIT, unless the Board of Directors determines that it
is no longer in our best interests to so qualify as a REIT. The Board of Directors may make such a determination because of changing circumstances or changes in the REIT requirements. We have
authority to offer shares of our capital stock or other securities in exchange for property. We also have authority to repurchase or otherwise reacquire our shares or any other securities. We may
issue shares of our common stock, or cash at our option, to holders of units of limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership in future periods upon exercise of such holders' rights under
the Operating Partnership agreement. Our policy prohibits us from making any loans to our directors or executive officers for any purpose. We may make loans to the joint ventures in which we
participate.

Competition

The retail industry is dynamic and competitive. We compete with numerous merchandise distribution channels including regional malls,
outlet centers, community/lifestyle centers, and other shopping centers in the United States and abroad. Internet retailing sites and catalogs also provide retailers with distribution options beyond
existing brick and mortar retail properties and the numerous projects in development by commercial developers, real estate companies and other owners of retail real estate. The existence of
competitive alternatives could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease space and on the level of rents we can obtain. This results in competition for both the tenants to occupy the
properties that we develop and manage as well as for the acquisition of prime sites (including



land
for development and operating properties). We believe that there are numerous factors that make our properties highly desirable to retailers including:

•

the quality and diversity of our properties;

•

our management and operational expertise;

•

our extensive experience and relationships with retailers and lenders;

•

our mall marketing initiatives and consumer focused strategic corporate alliances; and

•

our ability to reduce the total
 occupancy cost of our tenants.

During the past three years, we have:

•

issued 6,133,556 shares of common stock upon the exchange of units of limited partnership interest of the Operating
Partnership, or units;

•

issued 753,824 restricted shares of common stock, net of forfeitures, under The Simon Property Group 1998 Stock Incentive

Item 1A. Risk Factors

The following factors, among others, could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in
forward-looking statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and presented elsewhere by our management from time to time. These factors, among others, may have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows, and you should carefully consider them. It is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. You should
not consider this list to be a complete statement of all potential risks or uncertainties and we may update them in our future periodic reports.

Risks Relating to Debt and the Financial Markets

We have a substantial debt burden that could affect our future operations.

As of December 31, 2009, our consolidated mortgages and other indebtedness, excluding the related premium and discount, totaled
$18.6 billion. We are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow from operations will be insufficient to meet required debt service. Our
debt service costs generally will not be reduced if developments at the property, such as the entry of new competitors or the loss of major tenants, cause a reduction in the income from the property.
Should such events occur, our operations may be adversely affected. If a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and income from this is insufficient to pay that indebtedness, the
property could be foreclosed upon by the mortgagee resulting in a loss of income and a decline in our total asset value.

Disruption in the credit markets or downgrades in our credit ratings may adversely affect our ability to access external financings for our growth and ongoing debt service
requirements.

We depend primarily on external financings, principally debt financings, to fund the growth of our business and to ensure that we can
meet ongoing maturities of our outstanding debt. Our access to financing depends on our credit rating, the willingness of banks to lend to us and conditions in the capital markets. We cannot assure
you that we will be able to obtain the financing we need for future growth or to meet our debt service as obligations mature, or that the financing available to us will be on acceptable terms.

Adverse changes in our credit rating could affect our borrowing capacity and borrowing terms.

Our outstanding senior unsecured notes and preferred stock are periodically rated by nationally recognized credit rating agencies. The
credit ratings are based on our operating performance, liquidity and leverage ratios, overall financial position, and other factors viewed by the credit rating agencies as relevant to our industry and
the economic outlook in general. Our credit rating can affect the amount of capital we can access, as well as the terms of any financing we obtain. Since we depend primarily on debt financing to fund
our growth, adverse changes in our credit rating could have a negative effect on our future growth.

Our hedging interest rate protection arrangements may not effectively limit our interest rate risk.

We manage our exposure to interest rate risk by a combination of interest rate protection agreements to effectively fix or cap a
portion of our variable rate debt. In addition, we refinance fixed rate debt at times when we believe rates and terms are appropriate. Our efforts to manage these exposures may not be successful.

Our
use of interest rate hedging arrangements to manage risk associated with interest rate volatility may expose us to additional risks, including a risk that a counterparty to a
hedging arrangement may fail to honor its obligations. Developing an effective interest rate risk strategy is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest
rate fluctuations. There can be no assurance that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition. Termination of these hedging
agreements typically involves costs, such as transaction fees or breakage costs.

Factors Affecting Real Estate Investments and Operations

We face risks associated with the acquisition, development and expansion of properties.

We regularly acquire and develop new properties and expand and redevelop existing properties, and these activities are subject to
various risks. We may not be successful in pursuing acquisition, development or redevelopment/expansion opportunities. In addition, newly acquired, developed or redeveloped/expanded properties may not
perform



as
well as expected. We are subject to other risks in connection with any acquisition, development and redevelopment/expansion activities, including the following:

•

construction costs of a project may be higher than projected, potentially making the project unfeasible or unprofitable;

•

we may not be
able to obtain financing or to refinance construction loans on favorable terms, if at all;

•

we may be unable to obtain zoning, occupancy or other governmental approvals;

•

occupancy rates and rents may not meet our projections and the project may not be profitable; and

•

we may need the consent of third parties such as anchor tenants, mortgage
lenders and joint venture partners, and those
consents may be withheld.

If
a development or redevelopment/expansion project is unsuccessful, either because it is not meeting our expectations when operational or was not completed according to the project
planning, we could lose our investment in the project. Further, if we guarantee the property's financing, our loss could exceed our investment in the project.

Real estate investments are relatively illiquid.

Our properties represent a substantial portion of our total consolidated assets. These investments are relatively illiquid. As a
result, our ability to sell one or more of our properties or investments in real estate in response to any changes in economic or other conditions is limited. If we want to sell a property, we cannot
assure you that we will be able to dispose of it in the desired time period or that the sales price of a property will exceed the cost of our investment.

Environmental Risks

As owners of real estate, we can face liabilities for environmental contamination.

Federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require us, as a current or previous
owner or operator of real property, to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at a property or at impacted neighboring properties. These laws often impose
liability regardless of whether the property owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances. These laws and regulations may require the abatement or
removal of asbestos containing materials in the event of damage, demolition or renovation, reconstruction or expansion of a property and also govern emissions of and exposure to asbestos fibers in the
air. Those laws and regulations also govern the installation, maintenance and removal of underground storage tanks used to store waste oils or other petroleum products. Many of our properties contain,
or at one time contained, asbestos containing materials or underground storage tanks (primarily related to auto service center establishments or emergency electrical generation equipment). The costs
of investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances may be substantial and could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition but is not estimable. The
presence of contamination, or the failure to remediate contamination, may also adversely affect our ability to sell, lease or redevelop a property or to borrow using a property as collateral.

Our efforts to identify environmental liabilities may not be successful.

Although we believe that our portfolio is in substantial compliance with Federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and
regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances, this belief is based on limited testing. Nearly all of our properties have been subjected to Phase I or similar environmental audits. These
environmental audits have not revealed, nor are we aware of, any environmental liability that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.
However, we cannot assure you that:

•

existing environmental studies with respect to the portfolio reveal all potential environmental liabilities;

•

any previous owner,
occupant or tenant of a property did not create any material environmental condition not known to us;

•

the current environmental condition of the portfolio will not be affected by tenants and occupants, by the condition of
nearby properties, or by other unrelated third parties; or

•

future uses or conditions (including, without limitation, changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations or the
interpretation thereof) will not result in environmental liabilities.



Retail Operations Risks

Ongoing economic conditions are adversely affecting the general retail environment.

Our concentration in the retail real estate market means that we are subject to the risks that affect the retail environment generally,
including the levels of consumer spending, seasonality, the willingness of retailers to lease space in our shopping centers, tenant bankruptcies, changes in economic conditions, consumer confidence
and terrorist activities. The economy appears to be recovering from the recent recession during which consumer spending in the United States declined significantly. The unemployment rate remains
relatively high and consumer confidence remains relatively depressed. We derive our cash flow from operations primarily from retail tenants, many of whom are currently under considerable economic
stress. A significant deterioration in our cash flow from operations could require us to curtail planned capital expenditures or seek alternative sources of financing.

We may not be able to lease newly developed properties and renew leases and relet space at existing properties.

We may not be able to lease new properties to an appropriate mix of tenants or for rents that are consistent with our projections.
Also, when leases for our existing properties expire, the premises may not be relet or the terms of reletting, including the cost of allowances and concessions to tenants, may be less favorable than
the current lease terms. To the extent that our leasing plans are not achieved, our cash generated before debt repayments and capital expenditures could be adversely affected.

Some of our properties depend on anchor stores or major tenants to attract shoppers and could be adversely affected by the loss of or a store closure by one or more of these
tenants.

Regional malls are typically anchored by department stores and other large nationally recognized tenants. The value of some of our
properties could be adversely affected if these tenants fail to comply with their contractual obligations, seek concessions in order to continue operations, or cease their operations. Department store
and larger store, also referred to as "big box", consolidations typically result in the closure of existing stores or duplicate or geographically overlapping store locations. We do not control the
disposition of those department stores or larger stores that we do not own. We also may not control the vacant space that is not re-leased in those stores we do own. Other tenants may be
entitled to modify the terms of their existing leases in the event of such closures. The modification could be unfavorable to us as the lessor and could decrease rents or expense recovery charges.
Additionally, major tenant closures may result in decreased customer traffic which could lead to decreased sales at other stores. If the sales of stores operating in our properties were to decline
significantly due to closing of anchors, economic conditions, or other reasons, tenants may be unable to pay their minimum rents or expense recovery charges. In the event of default by a tenant or
anchor store, we may experience delays and costs in enforcing our rights as landlord to recover amounts due to us under the terms of our agreements with those parties.

We face potential adverse effects from the increasing number of tenant bankruptcies.

Although bankruptcy filings by retailers occur regularly in the course of our operations, the number of tenant bankruptcies has
increased in the past two years. We continually seek to re-lease vacant spaces resulting from tenant terminations. The bankruptcy of a tenant, particularly an anchor tenant, may make it
more difficult to lease the remainder of the affected properties. Future tenant bankruptcies could adversely affect our properties or impact our ability to successfully execute our
re-leasing strategy.

Risks Relating to Joint Venture Properties

We have limited control with respect to some properties that are partially owned or managed by third parties, which may adversely affect our ability to sell or refinance
them.

As of December 31, 2009, we owned interests in 182 income-producing properties with other parties. Of those,
18 properties are included in our consolidated financial statements. We account for the other 164 properties under the equity method of accounting, which we refer to as joint venture
properties. We serve as general partner or property manager for 93 of these 164 properties; however, certain major decisions, such as selling or refinancing these properties, require the
consent of the other owners. Of the properties for which we do not serve as general partner or property manager, 61 are in our international joint ventures. The other owners also have other
participating rights that we consider substantive for purposes of determining control over the properties' assets. The remaining joint venture



properties
are managed by third parties. These limitations may adversely affect our ability to sell, refinance, or otherwise operate these properties.

The Operating Partnership guarantees debt or otherwise provides support for a number of joint venture properties.

Joint venture debt is the liability of the joint venture and is typically secured by a mortgage on the joint venture property. As of
December 31, 2009, the Operating Partnership has loan guarantees to support $47.2 million of our total $6.5 billion share of joint venture mortgage and other indebtedness. A
default by a joint venture under its debt obligations may expose us to liability under a guaranty or letter of credit.

Other Factors Affecting Our Business

Our Common Area Maintenance (CAM) contributions may not allow us to recover the majority of our operating expenses from tenants.

CAM costs typically include allocable energy costs, repairs, maintenance and capital improvements to common areas, janitorial services,
administrative, property and liability insurance costs, and
security costs. We historically have used leases with variable CAM provisions that adjust to reflect inflationary increases. We have made a concerted effort to convert our leases to a fixed payment
methodology which fixes our tenants' CAM contributions and should in turn reduce the volatility of and limitations on the recoveries we collect from our tenants for the reimbursement of our property
operating expenses. However, with respect to both variable and fixed payment methodologies, the amount of CAM charges we bill to our tenants may not allow us to recover all of these operating costs.

We face a wide range of competition that could affect our ability to operate profitably.

Our properties compete with other retail properties and other forms of retailing such as catalogs and e-commerce websites.
Competition may come from regional malls, outlet centers, community/lifestyle centers, and other shopping centers, both existing as well as future development projects. The presence of competitive
alternatives affects our ability to lease space and the level of rents we can obtain. Renovations and expansions at competing sites could also negatively affect our properties.

We
also compete with other retail property developers to acquire prime development sites. In addition, we compete with other retail property companies for tenants and qualified
management.

Our international expansion may subject us to different or greater risk from those associated with our domestic operations.

We hold interests in joint venture properties that operate in Italy, France, Poland, Japan, Korea, and Mexico, and we have a minority
investment in common shares of a U.K. retail real estate company. We may pursue additional expansion opportunities outside the United States. International development and ownership activities carry
risks that are different from those we face with our domestic properties and operations. These risks include:

•

adverse effects of changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies;

•

changes in foreign political and economic environments,
regionally, nationally, and locally;

•

challenges of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws including corporate governance, operations, taxes, and
litigation;

•

differing lending practices;

•

differences in cultures;

•

changes in applicable laws and regulations in the United States that affect foreign operations;

•

difficulties in managing international
operations; and

•

obstacles to the repatriation of earnings and cash.

Although
our international activities currently are a relatively small portion of our business (international properties represented approximately 6.3% of the GLA of all of our
properties at December 31, 2009), to the extent that we expand our international activities, these risks could increase in significance which in turn could adversely affect our results of
operations and financial condition.



Some of our potential losses may not be covered by insurance.

We maintain commercial general liability, fire, flood, extended coverage and rental loss insurance on all of our properties in the
United States through wholly-owned captive insurance entities and other self-insurance mechanisms. Rosewood Indemnity, Ltd. and Bridgewood Insurance Company,
Ltd. are our wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiaries, and have agreed to indemnify our general liability carrier for a specific layer of losses for the properties that are covered under these
arrangements. The carrier has, in turn, agreed to provide evidence of coverage for this layer of losses under the terms and conditions of the carrier's policy. A similar policy written through these
captive insurance entities also provides initial coverage for property insurance and certain windstorm risks at the properties located in coastal windstorm locations.

There
are some types of losses, including lease and other contract claims that generally are not insured. If an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs, we could
lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property. If this happens, we may still remain obligated for any mortgage debt
or other financial obligations related to the property.

We
currently maintain insurance coverage against acts of terrorism on all of our properties in the United States on an "all risk" basis in the amount of up to $1 billion per
occurrence for certified foreign acts of terrorism and $500 million per occurrence for non-certified domestic acts of terrorism. The current federal laws which provide this coverage
are expected to operate through 2014. Despite the existence of this insurance coverage, any threatened or actual terrorist attacks in high profile markets could adversely affect our property values,
revenues, consumer traffic and tenant sales.

Risks Relating to Federal Income Taxes

We have elected to be taxed as a REIT.

We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the
Internal Revenue Code. We believe we have been organized and operated in a manner which allows us to qualify for taxation as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code. We intend to continue to operate in
this manner. However, our qualification and taxation as a REIT depend upon our ability to meet, through actual annual operating results, asset diversification, distribution levels and diversity of
stock ownership, the various qualification tests imposed under the Internal Revenue Code. REIT qualification is governed by highly technical and complex provisions for which there are only limited
judicial or administrative interpretations. Accordingly, there is no assurance that we have operated or will continue to operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT.

If
we fail to comply with those provisions, we may be subject to monetary penalties or ultimately to possible disqualification as a REIT. If such events occurs, and if available relief
provisions do not apply:

•

we will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income;

•

we will be subject to corporate
level income tax, including any applicable alternative minimum tax, on our taxable income
at regular corporate rates; and

•

unless entitled to relief under relevant statutory provisions, we will also be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for
the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost.

Item 2. Properties

United States Properties

Our U.S. properties primarily consist of regional malls, Premium Outlet Centers, The Mills, community/lifestyle centers, and other
properties. These properties contain an aggregate of approximately 244.8 million square feet of gross leasable area, or GLA, of which we own approximately 152.3 million square feet.
Total estimated retail sales at the properties in 2009 were approximately $58 billion.

Regional
malls typically contain at least one traditional department store anchor or a combination of anchors and big box retailers with a wide variety of smaller stores connecting the
anchors. Additional stores are usually located along the perimeter of the parking area. Our 162 regional malls are generally enclosed centers and range in size from



approximately
400,000 to 2.3 million square feet of GLA. Our regional malls contain in the aggregate more than 18,600 occupied stores, including approximately 710 anchors, which are mostly
national retailers. For comparative purposes, we separate the information in this section on the 16 regional malls acquired from The Mills Corporation in 2007, or the Mills Regional Malls, from the
information on our other regional malls.

Premium
Outlet Centers generally contain a wide variety of designer and manufacturer stores located in an open-air center. Our 41 Premium Outlet Centers range in size from
approximately 200,000 to 850,000 square feet of GLA. The Premium Outlet Centers are generally located near major metropolitan areas and tourist destinations including New York City, Los Angeles,
Boston, Palm Springs, Orlando, Las Vegas, and Honolulu.

The
Mills generally range in size from 1.0 million to 2.3 million square feet of GLA and are located in major metropolitan areas. They have a combination of traditional
mall, outlet center, and big box retailers and entertainment uses. The Mills Regional Malls typically range in size from 700,000 to 1.3 million square feet of GLA and contain a wide variety of
national retailers.

Community/lifestyle
centers are generally unenclosed and smaller than our regional malls. Our 67 community/lifestyle centers generally range in size from approximately 100,000 to
900,000 square feet of GLA. Community/lifestyle centers are designed to serve a larger trade area and typically contain anchor stores and other national retail tenants, which occupy a significant
portion of the GLA of the center. We also own traditional community shopping centers that focus primarily on value-oriented and convenience goods and services. These centers are usually anchored by a
supermarket, discount retailer, or drugstore and are designed to service a neighborhood area. Finally, we own open-air centers adjacent to our regional malls designed to take advantage of
the drawing power of the mall.

We
also have interests in 15 other shopping centers or outlet centers. These properties range in size from approximately 85,000 to 1.0 million square feet of GLA, are considered
non-core to our business model, and in total represent less than 1% of our total operating income before depreciation.

As
of December 31, 2009, approximately 92.1% of the owned GLA in regional malls and the retail space of the other properties was leased, approximately 97.9% of owned GLA in the
Premium Outlet Centers was leased, approximately 93.9% of the owned GLA for The Mills and 89.3% of owned GLA for the Mills Regional Malls was leased, and approximately 90.7% of owned GLA in the
community/lifestyle centers was leased.

We
hold a 100% interest in 200 of our properties, effectively control 18 properties in which we have a joint venture interest, and hold the remaining 103 properties
through unconsolidated joint venture interests. We are the managing or co-managing general partner or member of 311 properties. Substantially all of our joint venture properties are
subject to rights of first refusal, buy-sell provisions, or other sale rights for all partners which are customary in real estate partnership agreements and the industry. Our partners in
our joint ventures may initiate these provisions at any time, which will result in either the use of available cash or borrowings to acquire their partnership interest or the disposal of our
partnership interest.

The
following property table summarizes certain data for our regional malls, Premium Outlet Centers, The Mills, the Mills Regional Malls and community/lifestyle centers located in the
United States, including Puerto Rico, as of December 31, 2009.

International Properties

Our ownership interests in properties outside the United States are primarily owned through joint venture arrangements. However, we
have a direct minority investment in Liberty International, PLC, or Liberty, as further described below.

operate real estate properties as of December 31, 2009:

In
addition, we jointly hold with a third party an interest in one parcel of land for development near Paris, France outside of these two joint ventures. Simon Ivanhoe and GCI are fully
integrated European retail real estate developers, owners and managers.

Our
properties in Europe consist primarily of hypermarket-anchored shopping centers. Substantially all of our European properties are anchored by either the hypermarket retailer Auchan,
primarily in Italy, who is also our partner in GCI, or are anchored by the hypermarket Carrefour in France and Poland. Certain of the properties in Italy are subject to leaseholds whereby GCI leases
all or a portion of the premises from a third party who is entitled to receive substantially all the economic benefits of that portion of the properties. Auchan and Carrefour
are the two largest hypermarket operators in Europe. These centers comprise over 13.4 million square feet of GLA and were 95.9% leased as of December 31, 2009.

On
February 4, 2010, we and our partner in Simon Ivanhoe, Ivanhoe Cambridge Inc., or Ivanhoe Cambridge, entered into a definitive agreement to sell all of the interests in Simon
Ivanhoe which owns seven shopping centers located in France and Poland to Unibail-Rodamco. The joint venture partners will receive consideration of €715 million for their
interests, subject to certain post-closing adjustments. We expect our share of the gain on sale of our interests in Simon Ivanhoe to be approximately $300 million. The transaction
is scheduled to close during the first half of 2010, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals.

We
and Ivanhoe Cambridge have the right to participate with Unibail-Rodamco in the potential development of up to five new retail projects in the Simon Ivanhoe pipeline, subject to
customary approval rights. We will own a 25% interest in any of these projects in which we agree to participate.

Other International Investments

We also hold real estate interests in eight joint venture properties in Japan, one joint venture property in Mexico, and one joint
venture property in Korea. The eight Japanese Premium Outlet Centers operate in various cities throughout Japan and are held in a joint venture with Mitsubishi Estate Co., Ltd. These centers comprise
over 2.4 million square feet of GLA and were 99.6% leased as of December 31, 2009.

In
2009, we completed construction and opened Ami Premium Outlets, a 224,500 square foot center located outside Tokyo, Japan. We have a 40% interest in this property consistent with the
ownership structure of our other Japanese investments. We also completed construction and opened a 171,800 square foot expansion at Kobe-Sanda Premium Outlets in Hyougo-ken,
Japan. Also in December 2009, we recognized a loss on our joint venture interests in



our
shopping centers in China. We sold our interests to affiliates of our Chinese partner for approximately $29 million, resulting in a loss of approximately $20 million.

We
hold a minority interest in Liberty which is a U.K. Real Estate Investment Trust that operates regional shopping centers and owns other prime retail assets throughout the U.K.
Liberty is a U.K. FTSE 100 listed company, with shareholders' funds of £3.2 billion and property investments of £6.1 billion, of which its U.K. regional
shopping centers comprise 70%. Assets of the group under control or joint control amount to £9.3 billion. Our interest in Liberty is less than 6% of its outstanding shares. We
adjust the carrying value of this investment quarterly using quoted market prices, including a related foreign exchange component.

Land

We have direct or indirect ownership interests in approximately 700 acres of land held in the United States for future development.

Sustainability and Energy Efficiency

Due to the size of our portfolio, we focus on energy efficiency as a core sustainability strategy. Through the continued use of energy
conservation practices, energy efficiency projects, and continuous monitoring and reporting, we have reduced our energy consumption at comparable properties every year since 2003. As a result,
excluding new developments and expansions, we reduced the electricity usage over which we have direct control by 238 million kWhs since 2003. This represents a 17% percent reduction in
electricity usage across a portfolio of comparable properties and reflects an annual value of over $27.5 million in avoided operating
costs. Our documented reduction in greenhouse gas emissions resulting from our energy management efforts is 140,000 metric tons CO2e.

We
were awarded

can be reasonably estimated.

There
is no established public trading market for Simon Property's Class B common stock. Distributions per share of the Class B common stock are identical to the common
stock.

Holders

The number of holders of record of common stock outstanding was 2,061 as of December 31, 2009. The Class B common stock
is held entirely by a voting trust to which the Estate of Melvin Simon, Herbert Simon, David Simon and certain of their affiliates are parties and is exchangeable on a
one-for-one basis into shares of common stock.

Dividends

We are required to pay a minimum level of dividends to maintain our status as a REIT. Our dividends typically exceed our net income
generated in any given year primarily because of depreciation, which is a "non-cash" expense. Our future dividends will be determined by the Board of Directors based on actual results of
operations, cash available for dividends and limited partner distributions, and what may be required to maintain our status as a REIT.

Dividends
during 2009 aggregated $2.70 per share and were paid part in stock and part in cash, subject to stockholder election. Dividends during 2008 aggregated $3.60 and were paid
entirely in cash. On February 2, 2010, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.60 per share, payable all in cash.

We
offer an Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan that allows stockholders to acquire additional shares by automatically reinvesting cash dividends. Shares are acquired pursuant to the
plan at a price equal to the prevailing market price of such shares, without payment of any brokerage commission or service charge.

Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities

During the fourth quarter of 2009, we issued 416,265 shares of common stock to limited partners in exchange for an equal number
of units. The issuance of the shares of common stock was made pursuant to the terms of the Partnership Agreement of the Operating Partnership and was exempt from registration under the Securities Act
of 1933 as amended, in reliance upon Section 4(2).

Issuances Under Equity Compensation Plans

For information regarding the securities authorized for issuance under our equity compensation plans, see Item 12 of this
report.



Temporary Equity

During 2009, holders of our Series I preferred stock were not eligible to convert their shares into shares of our common stock
as the triggering price of $75.34 was not met. As of December 31, 2009, the conversion trigger price of $74.18 had been met and each share of Series I preferred stock is convertible into
0.847495 of a share of common stock through March 31, 2010.

Depreciation
of our investment in buildings and improvements reflected in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income is calculated over the estimated original
lives of the assets as follows:

•

Buildings and Improvements — typically 10-40 years for the structure, 15 years
for landscaping and parking lot, and 10 years for HVAC equipment.

•

Tenant Allowances and Improvements — shorter of lease term or useful life.

(3)

Initial
cost generally represents net book value at December 20, 1993, except for acquired properties and new developments after December 20,
1993. Initial cost also includes any new developments that are opened during the current year. Costs of disposals and impairments of property are first reflected as a reduction to cost capitalized
subsequent to acquisition.

(4)

Not
developed/constructed by us or our predecessors. The date of construction represents the acquisition date.

(5)

Property
initial cost for these properties is the cost at the date of consolidation for properties previously accounted for under the equity method of
accounting. Accumulated depreciation amounts for properties consolidated which were previously accounted for under the equity method of accounting include the minority interest holders' portion of
accumulated depreciation.

(6)

Secured
by a $260,000 cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted mortgage loan facility.

For
purposes of calculating the ratio of earnings to fixed charges, "earnings" have been computed by adding fixed charges, excluding capitalized interest, to pre-tax income
from consolidated continuing operations including income from noncontrolling interests and our share of pre-tax (loss) income from 50%, or greater than 50%, owned unconsolidated affiliates
which have fixed charges, and including our share of distributed operating income from less than 50% owned unconsolidated affiliates instead of income from the less than 50% owned unconsolidated
affiliates. There are generally no restrictions on our ability to receive distributions from our unconsolidated joint ventures where no preference in favor of the other owners of the joint venture
exists. "Fixed charges" consist of interest costs, whether expensed or capitalized, the interest component of rental expenses, preferred distributions, losses on extinguishment of debt, and
amortization of debt issue costs.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Simon Property Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto that are included in this Annual Report to
Stockholders.

Overview

Simon Property Group, Inc., or Simon Property, is a Delaware corporation that operates as a
self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust, or REIT, under the Internal Revenue Code. To qualify as a REIT, among other things, a company must distribute
at least 90 percent of its taxable income to its stockholders annually. Taxes are paid by stockholders on dividends received and any capital gains distributed. Most states also follow this
federal treatment and do not require REITs to pay state income tax. Simon Property Group, L.P., or the Operating Partnership, is our majority-owned partnership subsidiary that owns all of our real
estate properties. In this discussion, the terms "we", "us" and "our" refer to Simon Property Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries.

We
own, develop and manage retail real estate properties, which consist primarily of regional malls, Premium Outlet® centers, The Mills®, and community/lifestyle
centers. As of December 31, 2009, we owned or held an interest in 321 income-producing properties in the United States, which consisted of 162 regional malls, 41 Premium Outlet centers, 67
community/lifestyle centers, 36 properties acquired in the 2007 acquisition of The Mills Corporation, or the Mills acquisition, and 15 other shopping centers or outlet centers in
41 states and Puerto Rico. Of the 36 properties acquired in the Mills portfolio, 16 of these properties are The Mills, 16 are regional malls, and four are community centers.
Internationally, as of December 31, 2009, we had ownership interests in 51 European shopping centers (France, Italy and Poland), eight Premium Outlet centers in Japan, one Premium Outlet
center in Mexico, and one Premium Outlet center in South Korea. Also, through joint venture arrangements we have a 24% interest in two shopping centers in Italy currently under development. During
2009, we recognized a loss on the sale of four of our U.S. properties and all of our shopping centers in operation or under development in China. We also agreed to purchase a portfolio of 22 outlet
shopping centers. The purchase is expected to close in the first half of 2010. In early 2010, we and our joint venture partner agreed to sell our interests in seven shopping centers in France and
Poland.

We
generate the majority of our revenues from leases with retail tenants including:

•

Base minimum rents,

•

Overage and percentage rents based on tenants' sales volume, and

•

Recoveries of substantially all of our recoverable expenditures, which consist of property operating, real estate taxes,
repair and maintenance, and advertising and promotional expenditures.

Revenues
of our management company, after intercompany eliminations, consist primarily of management fees that are typically based upon the revenues of the property being managed.

We
seek growth in earnings, funds from operations, or FFO, and cash flows by enhancing the profitability and operation of our properties and investments. We seek to accomplish this
growth through the following:

•

Focusing on leasing to increase revenues and utilizing economies of scale to reduce operating expenses,

•

Expanding and re-tenanting existing franchise locations at competitive market rates,

•

Adding mixed-use elements to properties,

•

Selectively acquiring high quality real estate assets or portfolios of assets, and

•

Selling non-core assets.

We
also grow by generating supplemental revenue from the following activities:

•

Establishing our malls as leading market resource providers for retailers and other businesses and consumer-focused
corporate alliances, including: payment systems (such as handling fees relating to the sales of bank-issued prepaid cards), national marketing alliances, static and digital media
initiatives, business development, sponsorship, and events,


Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Simon Property Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries

•

Offering property operating services to our tenants and others, including waste handling and facility services, and the
sale of energy,

•

Selling or leasing land adjacent to our shopping center properties, commonly referred to as "outlots" or "outparcels," and

•

Generating interest income on cash deposits and loans made to related entities.

We
focus on high quality real estate across the retail real estate spectrum. We expand or renovate to enhance existing assets' profitability and market share when we believe the
investment of our capital meets our risk-reward criteria. We selectively develop new properties in metropolitan areas that exhibit strong population and economic growth.

We
routinely review and evaluate acquisition opportunities based on their ability to complement our portfolio. Our international strategy includes partnering with established real
estate companies and financing international investments with local currency to minimize foreign exchange risk.

To
support our growth, we employ a three-fold capital strategy:

•

Provide the capital necessary to fund growth,

•

Maintain sufficient flexibility to access capital in many forms, both public and private, and

•

Manage our overall financial structure in a fashion that preserves our investment grade credit ratings.

Results Overview

Diluted earnings per common share decreased $0.82 during 2009, or 43.9%, to $1.05 from $1.87 for 2008. The decrease in
diluted earnings per share was due primarily to losses on asset sales and impairment charges. These included a $140.5 million, or $0.44 per diluted share,
other-than-temporary impairment charge related to our investment in Liberty International, PLC, or Liberty, a U.K. REIT. We recorded the
other-than-temporary charge in the second quarter of 2009 due to the significance and duration of the decline in quoted fair value, including the related currency exchange
component, below the carrying value of the securities. In the fourth quarter of 2009, we also recorded adjustments in the carrying values of three underperforming assets, including one consolidated
operating property and two joint venture assets, the write-off of certain predevelopment costs related to projects that we no longer plan to pursue due to economic conditions, and
adjustments to carrying values for certain parcels of land, amounting to $88.1 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, net of related tax benefit and noncontrolling interest share. We also
recorded net losses related to the sale of assets and interests in unconsolidated entities of $30.1 million, or $0.09 per diluted share. For 2009, earnings per share were diluted by
approximately $0.21 per share as a result of two equity offerings and the shares we issued in the quarterly dividends. For 2008, we recorded a $20.3 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, loss on
extinguishment of debt related to our redemption of the 7% MandatOry Par Put Remarked Securities, or MOPPRS. In addition, we recorded impairment charges of $21.2 million, or $0.07 per diluted
share, during 2008.

In
the United States, our business fundamentals were relatively stable, except for tenant sales psf which were down across the portfolio, and were dependent upon asset type, geographic
location, and mix of specialty and luxury tenants. Average base rents for the regional mall and domestic Premium Outlet portfolios were relatively stable for 2009. The regional malls average base rent
ended the year at $40.04 psf, or an increase of 1.4% over 2008. The domestic Premium Outlets average base rent ended the year at $33.45 psf, or an increase of 21.0%. The stability of the occupancy,
rent psf, and releasing rental spread fundamentals contributed to the growth in our operating results despite the adverse economic conditions affecting our tenants and retail consumers.

Internationally,
in 2009, we and our joint venture partners opened one additional center and expanded one existing Premium Outlet Center in Japan which added an aggregate 396,300 square
feet of retail space to the international portfolio. Also in December 2009, we recognized a loss on our joint venture interests in our shopping centers in China. We sold our interests to affiliates of
our Chinese partner for approximately $29 million, resulting in a loss of approximately $20 million.


Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Simon Property Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries

On
February 4, 2010, we and our partner in Simon Ivanhoe S.à.r.l, or Simon Ivanhoe, Ivanhoe Cambridge Inc., or Ivanhoe Cambridge, entered into a definitive
agreement to sell all of the interests in Simon Ivanhoe which owns seven shopping centers located in France and Poland to Unibail-Rodamco. The joint venture partners will receive consideration of
€715 million for their interests, subject to certain post-closing adjustments. We expect our share of the gain on sale of our interests in Simon Ivanhoe to be
approximately $300 million. The transaction is scheduled to close during the first half of 2010, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals.

We
and Ivanhoe Cambridge have the right to participate with Unibail-Rodamco in the potential development of up to five new retail projects in the Simon Ivanhoe pipeline, subject to
customary approval rights. We will own a 25% interest in any of these projects in which we agree to participate.

Our
effective overall borrowing rate at December 31, 2009 increased 50 basis points to 5.62% as compared to 5.12% at December 31, 2008. This increase was primarily due to
a $1.4 billion increase in our portfolio of relatively higher rate fixed rate debt. Our financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2009, included:

•

decreasing borrowings on the Operating Partnership's $3.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, or the Credit
Facility, to approximately $446.1 million as of December 31, 2009. The ending balance on this facility is entirely comprised of the U.S. dollar equivalent of Euro and
Yen-denominated borrowings. On December 8, 2009, the Operating Partnership entered into a new unsecured revolving corporate credit facility providing an initial borrowing capacity
of $3.565 billion. The new credit facility contains an accordion feature allowing the maximum borrowing capacity to expand to $4.0 billion. The new credit facility matures on
March 31, 2013 Borrowings on the new facility were not drawn until January 5, 2010 when the Euro and Yen-denominated borrowings on the Credit Facility were transitioned to
the new credit facility.

•

issuing $650.0 million in 10.35% senior unsecured notes due 2019. We used the proceeds of the offering to reduce
borrowings on the Credit Facility.

•

issuing $1.1 billion in 6.75% senior unsecured notes due 2014. We used the proceeds of the offering for general
corporate purposes.

•

redeeming five series of maturing unsecured notes totaling $900.0 million which had fixed rates ranging from 3.50%
to 8.63%.

•

borrowing $400.0 million on a loan which matures on August 1, 2016 and bears interest at a fixed rate of
8.00%. This loan is secured by cross-collateralized, cross-defaulted mortgages on Greenwood Park Mall, South Park Mall, and Walt Whitman Mall.

On
January 12, 2010, the Operating Partnership commenced a cash tender offer for any and all senior unsecured notes of ten outstanding series with maturity dates ranging from
2011 to March 2013. The total principal amount of the notes accepted for purchase on January 26, 2010 was approximately $2.3 billion, with a weighted average duration of 2.0 years
and a weighted coupon of 5.76%. The Operating Partnership purchased the tendered notes with cash on hand and the proceeds from an offering of $2.25 billion of senior unsecured notes that closed
on January 25, 2010. The senior notes offering was comprised of $400.0 million of 4.20% notes due 2015, $1.25 billion of 5.65% notes due 2020 and $600.0 million of 6.75%
notes due 2040. We will report a $165.6 million charge to earnings in the first quarter of 2010 as a result of the tender offer.

United States Portfolio Data

The portfolio data discussed in this overview includes the following key operating statistics: occupancy; average base rent per square
foot; and comparable sales per square foot for our four domestic platforms. We include acquired properties in this data beginning in the year of acquisition and remove properties sold in the year
disposed. For comparative purposes, we separate the information in this section on the 16 regional malls we acquired from The Mills Corporation in 2007, or the Mills Regional Malls, from the
information on our other regional malls. We do not include any properties located outside of the United States in this section. The following table sets forth these key operating statistics
for:

•

properties that are consolidated in our consolidated financial statements,

•

properties we account for under the equity method of accounting as joint ventures, and

•

the foregoing two categories of properties on a total portfolio basis.

Occupancy Levels and Average Base Rent Per Square Foot.

Occupancy and average base rent are based on
mall and freestanding Gross Leasable Area, or
GLA, owned by us in the regional malls, and all tenants at The Mills, Premium Outlet Centers, and community/lifestyle centers. Our portfolio has maintained relatively stable occupancy and increased
the aggregate average base rents despite continuing economic difficulties.

Comparable Sales Per Square Foot.

Comparable sales include total reported retail tenant sales at owned
GLA (for mall and freestanding stores with
less than 10,000 square feet) in the regional malls and all reporting tenants at The Mills and the Premium Outlet Centers and community/lifestyle centers. Retail sales at owned GLA affect revenue and
profitability levels because sales determine the amount of minimum rent that can be charged, the percentage rent realized, and the recoverable expenses (common area maintenance, real estate taxes,
etc.) that tenants can afford to pay.

Critical Accounting Policies

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or
GAAP, requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other
assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue, and expenses during the reporting periods. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various
transactions had been different, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements. From time to time, we
evaluate our estimates and assumptions. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information.
Below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.
For a summary of our significant accounting policies, see Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

•

We, as a lessor, retain substantially all of the risks and benefits of ownership of the investment properties and account
for our leases as operating leases. We accrue minimum rents on a straight-line basis over the terms of their respective leases. Substantially all of our retail tenants are also required to
pay overage rents based on sales over a stated base amount during the lease year. We recognize overage rents only when each tenant's sales exceed its sales threshold.

•

We review investment properties for impairment on a property-by-property basis whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of investment properties may not be recoverable. These circumstances include, but are not limited to, declines in cash flows, occupancy and
comparable sales per square foot at the property. We measure any impairment of investment property when the estimated undiscounted operating income before depreciation and amortization plus its
residual value is less than the carrying value of the property. To the extent impairment has occurred, we charge to income the excess of carrying value of the property over its estimated fair value.
We may decide to sell properties that are held for use and the sale prices of these properties may differ from their carrying values. We also review our investments including investments in
unconsolidated entities if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of our investments may not be recoverable. We will record an impairment charge if we determine that a
decline in the fair value of the investments below carrying value is other-than-temporary.

•

To maintain our status as a REIT, we must distribute at least 90% of our taxable income in any given year and meet certain
asset and income tests. We monitor our business and transactions that may potentially impact


Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Simon Property Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries

our
REIT status. In the unlikely event that we fail to maintain our REIT status, and available relief provisions do not apply, then we would be required to pay federal income taxes at regular
corporate income tax rates during the period we did not qualify as a REIT. If we lost our REIT status, we could not elect to be taxed as a REIT for four years unless our failure was due to reasonable
cause and certain other conditions were met. As a result, failing to maintain REIT status would result in a significant increase in the income tax expense recorded during those periods.

•

We make estimates as part of our allocation of the purchase price of acquisitions to the various components of the
acquisition based upon the fair value of each component. The most significant components of our allocations are typically the allocation of fair value to the buildings
as-if-vacant, land and market value of in-place leases. In the case of the fair value of buildings and the allocation of value to land and other intangibles, our
estimates of the values of these components will affect the amount of depreciation we record over the estimated useful life of the property acquired or the remaining lease term. In the case of the
market value of in-place leases, we make our best estimates of the tenants' ability to pay rents based upon the tenants' operating performance at the property, including the competitive
position of the property in its market as well as sales psf, rents psf, and overall occupancy cost for the tenants in place at the acquisition date. Our assumptions affect the amount of future revenue
that we will recognize over the remaining lease term for the acquired in-place leases.

•

A variety of costs are incurred in the development and leasing of properties. After determination is made to capitalize a
cost, it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited. Determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease involves a degree of
judgment. The costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs. The capitalized costs include pre-construction costs essential to the development of
the property, development costs, construction costs, interest costs, real estate taxes, salaries and related costs and other costs incurred during the period of development. We consider a construction
project as substantially completed and held available for occupancy and cease capitalization of costs upon opening.

On February 16, 2007, SPG-FCM Ventures, LLC, or SPG-FCM, an entity in which a subsidiary of
the Operating Partnership holds a 50% interest, entered into a definitive agreement to acquire The Mills Corporation, or Mills. The Mills acquisition added 36 properties and over
42 million square feet of gross leasable area to our portfolio. The properties are generally located in major metropolitan areas and consist of a combination of traditional anchor tenants,
local and national retailers, and a number of larger "big box" tenants. We made an equity investment of $650.0 million and provided loans to SPG-FCM and Mills in various amounts
throughout 2007 to acquire Mills' remaining common and preferred equity, and to pay various costs of the transaction. We serve as manager of the properties acquired in this transaction, which is more
fully discussed in the "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section.

For
the purposes of the following comparisons between the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 and the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, the above transactions are
referred to as the property transactions. In the following discussions of our results of operations, "comparable" refers to properties open and operating throughout both the current and prior year.

During
2009, we sold four consolidated properties that had an aggregate book value of $13.7 million for aggregate sales proceeds of $3.9 million, resulting in a net loss
on sale of $9.8 million. The loss on sale of these assets recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and the operating results of the properties that we sold or disposed of during
2009 were not significant to our consolidated results of operations. The following is a list of the consolidated properties we sold and the date of disposition:

During
2007, we disposed of five consolidated properties that had an aggregate book value of $91.6 million for aggregate sales proceeds of $56.4 million, resulting in a
net loss on sale of approximately $35.3 million. The loss on sale of these assets has been reported as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations. The operating
results of the properties that we sold or disposed of during 2007 were not significant to our consolidated results of operations. The following is a list of consolidated property dispositions and the

Year Ended December 31, 2009 vs. Year Ended December 31, 2008

Minimum rents increased $24.9 million in 2009, of which the property transactions accounted for $27.3 million of the
increase, offset by a decrease in comparable minimum rents of $2.4 million, or 0.1%. The decrease in comparable minimum rents was primarily attributable to a $15.4 million decline in the
fair market value of in-place lease amortization and a $12.6 million decrease in straight-line rents, offset by an increase in minimum rents of $22.8 million and
an increase in comparable rents from carts, kiosks, and other temporary tenants of $2.8 million. Overage rents decreased $15.3 million or 15.3%, as a result of a reduction in tenant
sales for the period as compared to the prior year.


Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Simon Property Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Tenant
reimbursements decreased $3.7 million, due to a $14.8 million, or 1.4%, decrease in the comparable properties as a result of a decrease in expenditures allocable to
tenants paying common area maintenance on a proportionate basis, offset by an $11.1 million increase attributable to the property transactions.

Management
fees and other revenues decreased $8.4 million principally as a result of decreased earned premiums of our wholly-owned captive insurance entities and lower fee
revenue due to the reduction in development, leasing and joint venture property refinancing activity.

Total
other income decreased $5.4 million, and was principally the result of the following:

•

a $15.4 million decrease in interest income primarily due to lower reinvestment rates and the lower rate applicable
to our variable rate loan facility with SPG-FCM,

•

a $2.3 million decrease in net other activity, and

These
decreases were offset in part by a $6.5 million increase in land sale activity primarily related to a land sale in the fourth quarter of 2009 and a $5.8 million increase in lease
settlement income.

Property
operating expenses decreased $30.2 million, or 6.6%, primarily related to lower utility costs resulting from our cost control and cost reduction initiatives.

Depreciation
and amortization expense increased $28.1 million due to the impact of prior year openings and expansion activity and acceleration of depreciation for certain
properties scheduled for redevelopment.

Repairs
and maintenance decreased $16.1 million due to our cost savings efforts.

Home
and regional office expense decreased $34.8 million primarily due to decreased personnel costs attributable to our cost control initiatives and lower incentive compensation
levels.

During
2009, we recognized a non-cash charge of $140.5 million representing an other-than-temporary impairment in the fair value below the
carrying value of our minority investment in Liberty. We recorded the charge to earnings due to the significance and duration of the decline in the total share price, including currency revaluations.
In addition, we recorded impairment charges in 2009 of $56.9 million related to one regional mall, certain parcels of land and certain predevelopment costs related to projects no longer being
pursued. In 2008, we recognized an impairment of $16.5 million primarily representing the write-down of a mall property to its estimated net realizable value and the
write-off of predevelopment costs for various development opportunities which we no longer plan to pursue.

During
2009, we recorded $5.7 million in transaction expenses related to costs associated with significant acquisition related activities. In accordance with the required
adoption of a new accounting pronouncement effective January 1, 2009, all transaction costs are expensed as incurred and are no longer capitalized as a component of acquisition cost as prior
accounting guidance permitted.

Interest
expense increased $44.9 million primarily related to the Operating Partnership's issuance of $500 million of senior unsecured notes on August 11, 2009,
$600 million senior unsecured notes on May 15, 2009 and $650 million senior unsecured notes on March 25, 2009, offset by decreased interest expense on our prior Credit
Facility due to the payoff of the U.S. tranche and other property debt refinancings.

The
2008 period included a loss on extinguishment of debt of $20.3 million in the second quarter of 2008 related to the redemption of $200 million in remarketable debt
securities. We extinguished the debt because the remarketing reset base rate was above the rate for 30-year U.S. Treasury securities at the date of redemption.

Income
tax expense of taxable REIT subsidiaries decreased $8.8 million due to the recognition of a $5.8 million tax benefit in 2009 related to the adjustment of the
carrying value of our investment in an unconsolidated non-retail real estate entity.

Income
from unconsolidated entities increased $8.0 million as a result of our 2008 joint venture openings and expansion activity, interest rate savings from favorable interest
rates and debt refinancings, and additional depreciation provisions related to the finalization of purchase accounting on asset basis step-ups in the 2008 period associated with

the
acquisition of Mills, offset by the gain recognized in 2008 from our disposition of an investment holding of non-retail real estate adjacent to one of our regional mall operating
properties.

In
2009, we recognized a $42.7 million impairment charge representing our share of impairment charges recorded by unconsolidated entities and also impairment charges on our
investment in certain unconsolidated entities for which we deemed the declines in value below our carrying amount other-than-temporary.

The
loss on sale of assets and interests in unconsolidated entities of $30.1 million in 2009 was the result of the sale of one regional mall, three community centers, and our
32.5% joint venture interests in our shopping centers operating or under development in China.

Net
income attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased $58.0 million primarily due to a decrease in the income of the Operating Partnership.

Preferred
dividends decreased $14.8 million as a result of the conversion of 6.4 million Series I preferred shares into common shares during 2008.

Year Ended December 31, 2008 vs. Year Ended December 31, 2007

Minimum rents increased $137.2 million in 2008, of which the property transactions accounted for $64.6 million of the
increase. Comparable rents increased $72.6 million, or 3.6%. This was primarily due to an increase in minimum rents of $82.1 million and an $8.5 million increase in
straight-line rents, offset by a $16.4 million decrease in comparable property activity, primarily attributable to lower amounts of fair market value of in-place lease
amortization. Overage rents decreased $9.8 million or 8.9%, as a result of a reduction in tenant sales for the period as compared to the prior year.

Tenant
reimbursements increased $42.8 million, due to a $26.9 million increase attributable to the property transactions and a $15.9 million, or 1.6%, increase in
the comparable properties due to our ongoing initiative to convert leases to a fixed reimbursement methodology for common area maintenance costs.

Management
fees and other revenues increased $18.7 million principally as a result of the full year of additional management fees derived from managing the properties acquired in
the Mills acquisition, and additional leasing and development fees as a result of incremental joint venture property activity.

Total
other income decreased $56.6 million principally as a result of the following:

•

a $26.7 million decrease in interest income primarily due to the repayment of loans made to SPG-FCM and
Mills, and lower interest rates attributable to this loan facility, combined with decreased interest earnings on investments due to lower excess cash balances and interest rates earned in 2008 as
compared to 2007,

•

an $18.7 million decrease in lease settlement income as a result of significant lease settlements received from two
department stores in 2007, and

•

a $14.3 million decrease in loan financing fees related to Mills-related loan activity during 2007 which did not
recur in 2008.

These
decreases were offset in part by a $3.1 million increase in net other activity.

Depreciation
and amortization expense increased $63.8 million in 2008 primarily due to our acquisition, expansion and renovation activity and the accelerated depreciation of
tenant improvements for tenant leases terminated during the period and for properties scheduled for redevelopment.

Real
estate taxes increased $21.3 million from the prior period, $9.0 million of which is related to the property transactions, and $12.3 million from our
comparable properties due to the effect of increases resulting from reassessments, higher tax rates, and the effect of expansion and renovation activities.

Repairs
and maintenance decreased $12.3 million due to our cost savings efforts.


Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Simon Property Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Provision
for credit losses increased $14.5 million primarily due to an increase in tenant bankruptcies and tenant delinquencies. This was reflected in total square footage lost
to tenant bankruptcies of 1,104,000 during 2008 as compared to only 69,000 square feet in 2007.

Home
and regional office expense increased $8.3 million primarily due to increased personnel costs, primarily the result of the Mills acquisition, and the increased expense from
certain incentive compensation plans.

Other
expenses increased $6.1 million due to increased consulting and professional fees, including legal fees and related costs.

In
2008, we recognized impairment charges of $16.5 million primarily representing the write-down of a mall property to its estimated net realizable value and the
write-off of predevelopment costs for various development opportunities that we no longer plan to pursue.

Interest
expense increased marginally by $1.3 million despite an $823.9 million increase in consolidated borrowings to fund our development and redevelopment activities,
and the full year impact of our borrowings to fund the Mills-related loans, due to a 55 basis point decline in our weighted average borrowing rates. This decrease in weighted average borrowing rates
was driven primarily by a decline in the applicable LIBOR rate for a majority of our consolidated floating rate debt instruments, including the Credit Facility.

We
recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $20.3 million in the second quarter of 2008 related to the redemption of $200 million in remarketable debt securities. We
extinguished the debt because the remarketing reset base rate was above the rate for 30-year U.S. Treasury securities at the date of redemption.

Income
tax expense of taxable REIT subsidiaries increased $14.9 million due primarily to a $19.5 million tax benefit recognized in 2007 related to the impairment charge
resulting from of the write-off of our investment in a land joint venture in Phoenix, Arizona.

Income
from unconsolidated entities decreased $5.9 million, due primarily to the impact of the Mills acquisition (net of eliminations). On a net basis, our share of loss from
SPG-FCM increased $4.7 million from the prior period due to a full year of SPG-FCM activity in 2008 as compared to only nine months of activity in 2007. The loss was
driven by depreciation and amortization expense on asset basis step-ups in purchase accounting.

In
2007, we recognized an impairment charge of $55.1 million related to a land joint venture in Phoenix, Arizona.

The
gain on sale of assets and interests in unconsolidated entities of $92.0 million in 2007 was primarily the result of Simon Ivanhoe selling its interest in certain assets
located in Poland.

In
2007, the loss on sale of discontinued operations of $35.3 million represents the net loss upon disposition of five non-core properties consisting of three
regional malls and two community/lifestyle centers.

Net
income attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased $12.1 million primarily due to a decrease in the income of the Operating Partnership.

Preferred
dividends decreased $14.0 million as a result of the conversion of 6.4 million Series I preferred shares into common shares and the redemption of the
Series G preferred stock in the fourth quarter of 2007.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Because we generate revenues primarily from long-term leases, our financing strategy relies primarily on
long-term fixed rate debt. We manage our floating rate debt to be at or below 15-25% of total outstanding indebtedness by negotiating interest rates for each financing or
refinancing based on current market conditions. Floating rate debt currently comprises approximately
12% of our total consolidated debt at December 31, 2009. We also enter into interest rate protection agreements as appropriate to assist in managing our interest rate risk. We derive most of
our liquidity from leases that generate positive net cash flow from operations and distributions of capital from unconsolidated entities that totaled $1.9 billion during 2009. In addition, the
new credit facility provides an alternative source of liquidity as our cash needs vary from time to time.

Our
balance of cash and cash equivalents increased $3.2 billion during 2009 to $4.0 billion as of December 31, 2009. December 31, 2009 and 2008 balances
include $38.1 million and $29.8 million, respectively, related to our co-branded gift card programs, which we do not consider available for general working capital purposes.

On
December 31, 2009, we had available borrowing capacity of approximately $3.1 billion under the Credit Facility, net of outstanding borrowings of $446.1 million
and letters of credit of $5.7 million. During 2009, the maximum amount outstanding under the Credit Facility was $1.6 billion and the weighted average amount outstanding was
$669.8 million. The weighted average interest rate was 0.94% for the year ended December 31, 2009. On December 8, 2009, the Operating Partnership entered into a new unsecured
revolving corporate credit facility providing an initial borrowing capacity of $3.565 billion. The new credit facility contains an accordion feature allowing the maximum borrowing capacity to
expand to $4.0 billion. The new credit facility matures on March 31, 2013. Borrowings on the new facility were not drawn until January 5, 2010 when the Euro and
Yen-denominated borrowings on the Credit Facility were transitioned to the new credit facility.

We
and the Operating Partnership have historically had access to public equity and long term unsecured debt markets and access to private equity from institutional investors at the
property level.

Our
business model requires us to regularly access the debt and equity capital markets to raise funds for acquisition and development activity, redevelopment capital, and to refinance
maturing debt. The turmoil in the capital markets that began in 2008 and which now shows signs of abating had an impact on many businesses', including ours, ability to access debt and equity capital.
We raised approximately $3.4 billion in the public capital markets in 2009; however, there is no assurance we will be able to continue to do so in future periods or on similar terms or
conditions. We believe we have sufficient cash on hand and availability under the new credit facility to address our debt maturities and capital needs through 2010.

As
discussed further in Financing and Debt below, on January 12, 2010, we commenced a tender offer to purchase ten outstanding series of notes. We subsequently purchased
$2.285 billion of notes on January 26, 2010. The purchase of the notes was primarily funded with proceeds from the sale of $2.25 billion of senior unsecured notes issued on
January 25, 2010.

On
February 16, 2010, we announced that we had made a written offer in early February to acquire General Growth Properties, Inc. (or General Growth) in a transaction valued at
more than $10 billion, including approximately $9 billion in cash. Of this consideration, approximately $7 billion will be paid to unsecured creditors, representing par value plus
accrued and unpaid dividends and interest. The transaction would not be subject to a financing condition and would be financed through cash on hand, asset sales and through equity co-investments in
acquired properties by strategic institutional investors, with the balance coming from our existing credit facility. We indicated our willingness to discuss consideration consisting in whole or in
part of our common equity in lieu of the cash portion of the consideration to General Growth's stockholders, and perhaps certain of its unsecured creditors, for those who would prefer to receive
equity. The offer is subject to confirmatory due diligence and the
negotiation and execution of a definitive transaction agreement, as well as required bankruptcy court and creditor approvals. As of the filing of this report, no transaction has occurred.

Acquisition of The Mills Corporation by SPG-FCM

On February 16, 2007, SPG-FCM, a 50/50 joint venture between an affiliate of the Operating Partnership and funds
managed by Farallon Capital Management, L.L.C., or Farallon, entered into a definitive merger agreement to acquire all of the outstanding common stock of Mills for $25.25 per common share in cash. The
acquisition of Mills and its interests in the 36 properties that remain at December 31, 2009 was completed in April 2007. As of December 31, 2009, we and Farallon had each funded
$650.0 million into SPG-FCM to acquire all of the common stock of Mills. As part of the transaction, the Operating Partnership also made loans to SPG-FCM and Mills
primarily at rates of LIBOR plus 270-275 basis points. These funds were used by SPG-FCM and Mills to repay loans and other obligations of Mills, including the redemption of
preferred stock, during 2007. As of December 31, 2009, the outstanding balance of our loan to SPG-FCM was $632.0 million, and the average outstanding balance during the
twelve month period ended December 31, 2009 of all loans made to SPG-FCM and Mills was approximately $589.5 million. During 2009, 2008 and 2007, we recorded approximately
$9.3 million, $15.3 million and $39.1 million in interest income (net of inter-entity eliminations) related to these loans, respectively. We also recorded fee income, including
fee income amortization related to up-front fees on loans made to SPG-FCM and Mills, during 2009, 2008 and 2007 of approximately $3.7 million, $3.1 million and
$17.4 million (net of inter-entity eliminations), respectively, for providing refinancing services to Mills' properties and SPG-FCM. The existing loan facility to
SPG-FCM bears a rate of LIBOR plus 275 basis points and matures on June 7, 2010, with two available one-year extensions. Fees charged on loans made to
SPG-FCM and Mills are amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the loan.

The
Mills acquisition involved the purchase of all Mills' outstanding shares of common stock and common units for approximately $1.7 billion (at $25.25 per share or unit), the
assumption of $954.9 million of preferred stock, the assumption of a proportionate share of property-level mortgage debt, of which SPG-FCM's share approximated $3.8 billion,
the assumption of $1.2 billion in unsecured loans provided by us, costs to effect the acquisition, and certain liabilities and contingencies, including an ongoing investigation by the
Securities and Exchange Commission, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $8 billion. SPG-FCM has completed its purchase price allocations for the Mills acquisition using
valuations developed with the assistance of a third-party professional appraisal firm.

In
conjunction with the Mills acquisition, we acquired a majority interest in two properties in which we previously held a 50% ownership interest (Town Center at Cobb and Gwinnett
Place) and as a result we have consolidated these two properties at the date of acquisition.

In
addition to the loans provided to SPG-FCM, we also provide management services to substantially all of the properties in which SPG-FCM holds an interest.

Cash Flows

Our net cash flow from operating activities and distributions of capital from unconsolidated entities totaled $1.9 billion
during 2009. In addition, we received net proceeds from our debt financing and repayment activities in 2009 of $542.1 million. These activities are further discussed below in "Financing and
Debt". Also during 2009, we:

•

sold 40,250,000 shares of common stock resulting in total proceeds of $1.6 billion,

•

paid stock dividends and unitholder distributions of $147.8 million in cash and $754.2 million in common
stock and units,

•

paid preferred stock dividends and preferred unit distributions totaling $38.2 million,

•

redeemed our 7.75%/8% cumulative redeemable preferred units for $85.1 million,

•

funded consolidated capital expenditures of $376.3 million (includes development and other costs of
$160.4 million, renovation and expansion costs of $159.0 million, and tenant costs and other operational capital expenditures of $56.9 million) and

•

funded investments in unconsolidated entities of $107.2 million.

In
general, we anticipate that cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet operating expenses, monthly debt service, recurring capital expenditures, and distributions to
stockholders necessary to maintain our REIT

qualification
on a long-term basis. In addition, we expect to be able to obtain capital for nonrecurring capital expenditures, such as acquisitions, major building renovations and
expansions, as well as for scheduled principal maturities on outstanding indebtedness, from:

•

excess cash generated from operating performance and working capital reserves,

•

borrowings on our new credit facility,

•

additional secured or unsecured debt financing, or

•

additional equity raised in the public or private markets.

We
expect to generate positive cash flow from operations in 2010, and we consider these projected cash flows in our sources and uses of cash. These cash flows are principally derived
from retail tenants, many of whom continue to experience considerable financial distress. A significant deterioration in projected cash flows from operations could cause us to increase our reliance on
available funds from the new credit facility, curtail planned capital expenditures, or seek other additional sources of financing as discussed above.

Our unsecured debt at December 31, 2009 consisted of approximately $11.6 billion of senior unsecured notes of the
Operating Partnership and $446.1 million outstanding under our prior Credit Facility. The total outstanding balance of the Credit Facility as of December 31, 2009 was comprised of the
U.S. dollar equivalent of Euro and Yen-denominated borrowings which expired on January 11, 2010. The balance as of December 31, 2009 reflects interest at LIBOR plus 37.5
basis points and an additional facility fee of 12.5 basis points as these borrowings were made under our prior Credit Facility. On December 8, 2009, the Operating Partnership entered into a new
unsecured revolving corporate credit facility providing an initial borrowing capacity of $3.565 billion. The new credit facility contains an accordion feature allowing the maximum borrowing
capacity to expand to $4.0 billion. The new credit facility matures on March 31, 2013. The base interest on the new credit facility is LIBOR plus 210 basis points and includes a facility
fee of 40 basis points. Borrowings on the new facility were not drawn until January 5, 2010 when the Euro and Yen-denominated borrowings on the Credit Facility were transitioned to
the new credit facility.

During
the year ended December 31, 2009, we drew amounts from the prior Credit Facility to fund the redemption of $600.0 million of maturing senior unsecured notes. We
repaid a total of $1.2 billion on our Credit Facility during the year ended December 31, 2009. The maximum outstanding balance during the year ended December 31, 2009 was
approximately $1.6 billion. During the year ended December 31, 2009, the weighted average outstanding balance of the prior Credit Facility was approximately $669.8 million.

On
March 25, 2009 the Operating Partnership issued $650.0 million of senior unsecured notes at a fixed interest rate of 10.35%. The proceeds from the offering were used to
reduce borrowings on the prior Credit Facility and for general business purposes.

On
May 15, 2009, the Operating Partnership issued $600.0 million of senior unsecured notes at a fixed interest rate of 6.75%. The proceeds from the offering were used for
general business purposes. The notes were re-opened on August 11, 2009, and an additional $500.0 million of senior unsecured notes were issued. We used the proceeds from the
offering for general business purposes.

On
January 12, 2010, the Operating Partnership commenced a cash tender offer for any and all senior unsecured notes of ten outstanding series with maturity dates ranging from
2011 to March 2013. The total principal amount of the notes accepted for purchase on January 26, 2010 was approximately $2.3 billion, with a weighted average duration of 2.0 years
and a weighted coupon of 5.76%. The Operating Partnership purchased the tendered notes with cash on hand and the proceeds from an offering of $2.25 billion of senior unsecured notes that closed
on January 25, 2010. The senior notes offering was comprised of $400.0 million of 4.20% notes due 2015, $1.25 billion of 5.65% notes due 2020 and $600.0 million of 6.75%
notes due 2040. We will report a $165.6 million charge to earnings in the first quarter of 2010 as a result of the tender offer.

Secured Debt

Total secured indebtedness was $6.6 billion and $6.3 billion at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

On
July 30, 2009, we borrowed $400.0 million on a mortgage that is secured by Greenwood Park Mall, Southpark Mall, and Walt Whitman Mall, which matures on August 1,
2016 and bears interest at a fixed rate of 8.00%. This is a cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted loan as it pertains to these properties.

Summary of Financing

Our consolidated debt, adjusted to reflect outstanding derivative instruments, and the effective weighted average interest rates as of
December 31, 2009, and 2008, consisted of the following (dollars in thousands):

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Simon Property Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Our
off-balance sheet arrangements consist primarily of our investments in real estate joint ventures which are common in the real estate industry and are described in
Note 7 of the notes to the accompanying financial statements. Joint venture debt is the liability of the joint venture, is typically secured by the joint venture property, and is
non-recourse to us. As of December 31, 2009, the Operating Partnership had loan guarantee obligations to support $47.2 million to support our total $6.5 billion share
of joint venture mortgage and other indebtedness presented in the table above.

Preferred Stock Activity

During 2009, we issued a total of 500,891 shares of Series I 6% Preferred Stock upon conversion of an equal number of
Series I preferred units.

Acquisitions and Dispositions

Buy-sell provisions are common in real estate partnership agreements. Most of our partners are institutional investors who
have a history of direct investment in retail real estate. Our partners in our joint venture properties may initiate these provisions at any time. If we determine it is in our stockholders' best
interests for us to purchase the joint venture interest and we believe we have adequate liquidity to execute the purchase without hindering our cash flows, then we may initiate these provisions or
elect to buy. If we decide to sell any of our joint venture interests, we expect to use the net proceeds to reduce outstanding indebtedness or to reinvest in development, redevelopment, or expansion
opportunities.

Acquisitions.

Although the acquisition of high quality individual properties or portfolios of properties
remains an integral component of our growth
strategies, we did not acquire any properties during 2009.

We
entered into a definitive agreement in December 2009 to acquire all of the outlet shopping centers currently owned by Prime Outlets Acquisition Company and certain of its affiliated
entities, or the Prime Outlets, subject to Prime Outlets' existing fixed rate indebtedness and preferred stock. The Prime Outlets consist of 22 high quality outlet centers located in major
metropolitan markets. We will pay consideration (consisting of cash and units of the Operating Partnership) of approximately $0.7 billion for the owners' interests in the Prime Outlets. The
acquisition is subject to several closing conditions relating to certain financing arrangements of the Prime Outlets. Assuming all closing conditions are satisfied on a timely basis, we expect the
transaction will close in the second quarter of 2010.

Dispositions.

We continue to pursue the sale of properties that no longer meet our strategic criteria or
that are not the primary retail venue within
their trade area. In 2009, we sold the following wholly-owned properties: Raleigh Springs, a regional mall located in Memphis, Tennessee; Eastland Plaza, a community center located in Tulsa, Oklahoma;
Knoxville Commons, a community center located in Knoxville, Tennessee; and Park Plaza, a community center located in Hopkinsville, Kentucky. We received net proceeds of $3.9 million on the U.S.
property dispositions and recorded a net loss on these dispositions of $9.8 million. Also in December 2009, we recognized a loss on our joint venture interests in our shopping centers operating
and under development in China. We sold our interests to affiliates of our Chinese partner for approximately $29 million, resulting in a loss of approximately $20 million. The loss on
sales of these wholly owned entities and our joint venture interests in China is included in "(Loss) gain on sale of assets and interests in unconsolidated entities" in the 2009 consolidated
statements of operations and comprehensive income.

On
February 4, 2010, we and our partner in Simon Ivanhoe, Ivanhoe Cambridge, entered into a definitive agreement to sell all of the interests in Simon Ivanhoe which owns seven
shopping centers located in France and Poland to Unibail-Rodamco. The joint venture partners will receive consideration of €715 million for the assets, subject to certain
post-closing adjustments. We expect our share of the gain on sale of our interests in Simon Ivanhoe to be approximately $300 million. The transaction is scheduled to close during
the first half of 2010, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals.

We
do not believe the sale of these properties and joint venture interests will have a material impact on our future results of operations or cash flows. We believe the disposition of
these assets will enhance the average overall quality of our portfolio.

Development Activity

New Domestic Developments.

Given the significant downturn in the economy, we have substantially reduced
our development spending. On August 6,
2009, we opened Cincinnati Premium Outlets, a 400,000 square foot upscale manufacturers' outlet center located in Monroe, OH. The total cost to complete this project was approximately
$93.0 million, which was funded with available cash from operations. Also included in development projects is a 600,000 square foot Phase II expansion at The Domain, which is expected to
open in the first half of 2010. Other than these projects, our share of other 2009 new developments was not significant.

Strategic Domestic Expansions and Renovations.

In addition to new development, we incur costs related to
construction for significant renovation and
expansion projects at our properties. On April 23, 2009, we opened The Promenade at Camarillo Premium Outlets, a 220,000 square foot expansion of an existing center. The total cost to complete
this project was approximately $73.0 million and was funded with available cash from operations. Included in our renovation and expansion projects is the addition of Nordstrom at South Shore
Plaza, which is expected to open in the first half of 2010. We expect to fund this capital project with cash flow from operations. Our share of the cost of renovation or expansion projects that we
expect to initiate or complete in 2010 is approximately $40.0 million.

Capital Expenditures on Consolidated Properties.

International Development Activity.

We typically reinvest net cash flow from our international
investments to fund future international development
activity. We believe this strategy mitigates some of the risk of our initial investment and our exposure to changes in foreign currencies. We have also funded our European investments with
Euro-denominated borrowings that act as a natural hedge against local currency fluctuations. This has also been the case with our Premium Outlet Centers in Japan and Mexico where we use
Yen and Peso denominated financing, respectively. Currently, our consolidated net income exposure to changes in the volatility of the Euro, Yen, Peso and other foreign currencies is not material. We
expect our share of international development costs for 2010 will be approximately $65.0 million.

The
carrying amount of our total combined investment in Simon Ivanhoe and GCI, as of December 31, 2009, including all related components of other comprehensive income, was
$298.8 million. On December 14, 2009, we made an additional capital contribution to GCI of $79.4 million which was used to fund certain liabilities of the joint venture. The
contribution increased our investment in GCI but did not impact our ownership percentage of the venture. Our investments in Simon Ivanhoe and GCI are accounted for using the equity method of
accounting. Currently, two European developments are under construction which will add approximately 942,000 square feet of GLA for a total net cost of approximately
€221 million, of which our share is approximately €53 million, or $76.0 million based on current Euro:USD exchange rates. Although we agreed to
sell our joint venture interest in Simon Ivanhoe in 2010, we and Ivanhoe Cambridge have the right to participate with Unibail-Rodamco in the potential development of up to five new retail projects in
the Simon Ivanhoe pipeline, subject to customary approval rights. We will own a 25% interest in any of these projects in which we agree to participate.

As
of December 31, 2009, the carrying amount of our 40% joint venture investment in the eight Japanese Premium Outlet Centers including all related components of other
comprehensive income was $302.2 million. In 2009, we completed construction and opened Ami Premium Outlets, a 224,500 square foot center located outside Tokyo, Japan. The project's total
projected net cost is JPY 15.4 billion, of which our share is approximately JPY 6.2 billion, or $66.8 million based on applicable Yen:USD exchange rates. We also completed
construction and opened a 171,800


Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Simon Property Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries

square
foot expansion at Kobe-Sanda Premium Outlets in Hyougo-ken, Japan. The project's total projected net cost is JPY 7.6 billion, of which our share is approximately
JPY 3.0 billion, or $33.0 million based on applicable Yen:USD exchange rates. Currently, Toki Premium Outlets Phase III and Tosu Premium Outlets Phase III are under
construction in Japan. Toki Premium Outlets Phase III is a 62,000 square foot expansion to the Toki Premium Outlet Center located in Toki, Japan. The project's total projected net cost is JPY
2.2 billion, of which our share is approximately JPY 864 million, or $9.4 million based on applicable Yen:USD exchange rates. Tosu Premium Outlets Phase III is a 52,000
square foot expansion to the Tosu Premium Outlet Center located in Fukuoka, Japan. The project's total projected net cost is JPY 3.2 billion, of which our share is approximately JPY
1.3 billion, or $13.7 million based on applicable Yen:USD exchange rates.

We
hold a minority interest in Liberty which is a U.K. Real Estate Investment Trust that operates regional shopping centers and owns other prime retail assets throughout the U.K.
Liberty is a U.K. FTSE 100 listed company, with shareholders' funds of £3.2 billion and property investments of £6.1 billion, of which its U.K. regional
shopping centers comprise 70%. Assets of the group under control or joint control amount to £9.3 billion. Our interest in Liberty is less than 6% of its outstanding shares. We
adjust the carrying value of this investment quarterly using quoted market prices, including a related foreign exchange component.

Dividends and Stock Repurchase Program

Dividends during 2009 aggregated $2.70 per share and were paid in a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, subject to
stockholder election. Dividends during 2008 aggregated $3.60 per share and were paid entirely in cash. We must pay a minimum amount of dividends to maintain our status as a REIT. Our dividends
typically exceed our consolidated net income generated in any given year primarily because of depreciation, which is a "non-cash" expense. Our future dividends and future distributions of
the Operating Partnership will be determined by the Board of Directors based on actual results of operations, cash available for dividends and limited partner distributions, and what may be required
to maintain our status as a REIT.

Our
Board had authorized the repurchase of up to $1.0 billion of common stock through July 2009. No purchases were made as part of this program in 2009. The program was not
renewed and has now expired.

Forward-Looking Statements

Certain statements made in this section or elsewhere in this report may be deemed "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of
the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Although we believe the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance
that our expectations will be attained, and it is possible that our actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks,
uncertainties and other factors. Such factors include, but are not limited to: the impact of a prolonged recession, our ability to meet debt service requirements, the availability and terms of
financing, changes in our credit rating, changes in market rates of interest and foreign exchange rates for foreign currencies, the ability to hedge interest rate risk, risks associated with the
acquisition, development and expansion of properties, general risks related to retail real estate, the liquidity of real estate investments, environmental liabilities, changes in market rental rates,
trends in the retail industry, relationships with anchor tenants, the inability to collect rent due to the bankruptcy or insolvency of tenants or otherwise, risks relating to joint venture properties,
competitive market forces, risks related to international activities, insurance costs and coverage, terrorist activities, and maintenance of our status as a real
estate investment trust. We discuss these and other risks and uncertainties under the heading "Risk Factors" in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. We may update that
discussion in subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, but otherwise we undertake no duty or obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements, whether as a result
of new information, future developments, or otherwise.

Non-GAAP Financial Measure — Funds from Operations

Industry practice is to evaluate real estate properties in part based on funds from operations, or FFO. We consider FFO to be a key
measure of our operating performance that is not specifically defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. We believe that FFO is helpful to investors because it
is a widely recognized measure of the performance of REITs and provides a relevant basis
for comparison among REITs. We also use this measure internally to measure the operating performance of our portfolio.

We
determine FFO based on the definition set forth by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, as consolidated net income computed in accordance with
GAAP:

•

excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization,

•

excluding gains and losses from extraordinary items and cumulative
effects of accounting changes,

•

excluding gains and losses from the sales of previously depreciated operating properties,

•

plus the allocable portion of FFO of unconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method of accounting based upon
economic ownership interest, and

•

all determined on a consistent basis in accordance with GAAP.

We
have adopted NAREIT's clarification of the definition of FFO that requires us to include the effects of nonrecurring items not classified as extraordinary, cumulative effect of
accounting changes, or a gain or loss resulting from the sale of previously depreciated operating properties. We include in FFO gains and losses realized from the sale of land, outlot buildings,
marketable and non-marketable securities, and investment holdings of non-retail real estate. However, you should understand that our computation of FFO might not be comparable
to FFO reported by other REITs and that FFO:

•

does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP,

•

should not be considered as an alternative to consolidated net
income determined in accordance with GAAP as a measure of
operating performance, and

•

is not an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity.


Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Simon Property Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries

The
following schedule sets forth total FFO before allocation to the limited partners of the Operating Partnership and FFO allocable to us. This schedule also reconciles FFO to
consolidated net income, which we believe is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for the periods presented.

Management's Report On Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal
control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by, or under the
supervision of, our principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures
that:

•

Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and
disposition of assets;

•

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and

•

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of
our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

We
assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework.

Based
on that assessment, we believe that, as of December 31, 2009, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.

Our
independent registered public accounting firm has issued an audit report on their assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. Their report appears on page 89
of this Annual Report.


Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The
Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Simon Property Group, Inc.:

We
have audited Simon Property Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009 based on criteria established in Internal
Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Simon Property Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries'
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the
accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our
audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
our opinion, Simon Property Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009,
based on the COSO criteria.

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Simon Property Group, Inc.
and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2009 of Simon Property Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries, and our report dated February 25, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We

In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Simon Property Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Simon Property Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts and where indicated as in millions or billions)

1.    Organization

Simon Property Group, Inc. is a Delaware corporation that operates as a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust, or REIT, under
the Internal Revenue Code. Simon Property Group, L.P., or the Operating Partnership, is our majority-owned partnership subsidiary that owns all of our real estate properties. In these notes to
consolidated financial statements, the terms "we", "us" and "our" refer to Simon Property, the Operating Partnership, and their subsidiaries.

We
own, develop and manage retail real estate properties, which consist primarily of regional malls, Premium Outlet® centers, The Mills®, and community/lifestyle
centers. As of December 31, 2009, we owned or held an interest in 321 income-producing properties in the United States, which consisted of 162 regional malls, 41 Premium Outlet
centers, 67 community/lifestyle centers, 36 properties acquired in the 2007 acquisition of The Mills Corporation, or the Mills acquisition, and 15 other shopping centers or outlet
centers in 41 states and Puerto Rico. Of the 36 properties acquired in the Mills portfolio, 16 of these properties are The Mills, 16 are regional malls, and four are community
centers. We also own an interest in one parcel of land held in the United States for future development. Internationally, as of December 31, 2009, we had ownership interests in
51 European shopping centers (France, Italy and Poland), eight Premium Outlet centers in Japan, one Premium Outlet center in Mexico, and one Premium Outlet center in South Korea. Also,
through joint venture arrangements we have a 24% interest in two shopping centers in Italy currently under development.

We
generate the majority of our revenues from leases with retail tenants including:

•

Base minimum rents,

•

Overage and percentage rents based on tenants' sales volume, and

•

Recoveries of substantially all of our recoverable expenditures, which consist of property operating, real estate tax,
repairs and maintenance, and advertising and promotional expenditures.

Revenues
of our management company, after intercompany eliminations, consist primarily of management fees that are typically based upon the revenues of the property being managed.

We
also generate supplemental revenue from the following activities:

2.    Basis of Presentation and Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all majority-owned subsidiaries, and all significant intercompany amounts have been eliminated.

We
consolidate properties that are wholly owned or properties that we own less than 100% but we control. Control of a property is demonstrated by, among other factors, our ability
to:

•

manage day-to-day operations,

•

refinance debt and sell the property without the consent of any other partner or owner, and

•

the inability of any other partner or owner to replace us.

We
also consolidate a variable interest entity, or VIE, when we are determined to be the primary beneficiary. Our determination of the primary beneficiary of a VIE considers all
relationships between us and the VIE, including management agreements and other contractual arrangements, when determining the party obligated to absorb the

(Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts and where indicated as in millions or billions)

majority
of the expected losses, as defined, by accounting standards. There have been no changes during 2009 in conclusions about whether an entity qualifies as a VIE or whether we are the primary
beneficiary of any previously identified VIE. During 2009, we did not provide financial or other support to a previously identified VIE that we were not previously contractually obligated to provide.

Investments
in partnerships and joint ventures represent our noncontrolling ownership interests in properties. We account for these investments using the equity method of accounting. We
initially record these investments at cost and we subsequently adjust for net equity in income or loss, which we allocate in accordance with the provisions of the applicable partnership or joint
venture agreement, and cash contributions and distributions. The allocation provisions in the partnership or joint venture agreements are not always consistent with the legal ownership interests held
by each general or limited partner or joint venture investee primarily due to partner preferences. We separately report investments in joint ventures for which accumulated distributions have exceeded
investments in and our share of net income of the joint ventures within "Cash distributions and losses in partnerships and joint ventures, at equity" in the consolidated balance sheets. The net equity
of certain joint ventures is less than zero because of financing or operating distributions that are usually greater than net income, as net income includes non-cash charges for
depreciation and amortization.

As
of December 31, 2009, we consolidated 200 wholly-owned properties and 18 additional properties that are less than wholly-owned, but which we control or for which we are the
primary beneficiary. We account for the remaining 164 properties using the equity method of accounting (joint venture properties). We manage the day-to-day operations of
93 of the 164 joint venture properties but have determined that our partner or partners have substantive participating rights in regards to the assets and operations of these joint venture properties.
Our investments in joint ventures in Europe, Japan, Mexico and Korea comprise 61 of the remaining 71 properties. The international properties are managed by joint ventures in which we share
oversight responsibility with our partner. Additionally, we account for our investment in SPG-FCM Ventures, LLC, or SPG-FCM, which acquired The Mills Corporation and its
majority-owned subsidiary, The Mills Limited Partnership, or collectively Mills, in April 2007, using the equity method of accounting. We have determined that SPG-FCM is not a VIE
and that Farallon Capital Management, L.L.C., or Farallon, our joint venture partner, has substantive participating rights with respect to the assets and operations of SPG-FCM
pursuant to the applicable partnership agreements.

We
allocate net operating results of the Operating Partnership after preferred distributions to third parties and to us based on the partners' respective weighted average ownership
interests in the Operating Partnership. Net operating results of the Operating Partnership attributable to third parties are reflected in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests.

Our
weighted average ownership interest in the Operating Partnership was as follows:

For the Year Ended December 31,

79.8

%

79.4

%

As
of December 31, 2009 and 2008, our ownership interest in the Operating Partnership was 83.2% and 80.4%, respectively. We adjust the limited partners' interest in the Operating
Partnership at the end of each period to reflect their interest in the Operating Partnership.

Reclassifications

We made certain reclassifications of prior period amounts in the consolidated financial statements to conform to the 2009 presentation.
These reclassifications had no impact on previously reported net income available to common stockholders or earnings per share.

Subsequent Events

We have evaluated the financial statements for subsequent events through the time of the filing of this Form 10-K.

Investment Properties

We record investment properties at cost. Investment properties include costs of acquisitions; development, predevelopment, and
construction (including allocable salaries and related benefits); tenant allowances and improvements; and interest and real estate taxes incurred during construction. We capitalize improvements and
replacements from repair and maintenance when the repair and maintenance extends the useful life, increases capacity, or improves the efficiency of the asset. All other repair and maintenance items
are expensed as incurred. We capitalize interest on projects during periods of construction until the projects are ready for their intended purpose based on interest rates in place during the
construction period. The amount of interest capitalized during each year is as follows:

For the Year Ended December 31,




Capitalized interest

$

14,502

$

27,847

$

35,793

We
record depreciation on buildings and improvements utilizing the straight-line method over an estimated original useful life, which is generally 10 to 40 years. We
review depreciable lives of investment properties periodically and we make adjustments when necessary to reflect a shorter economic life. We amortize tenant allowances, tenant inducements and tenant
improvements utilizing the straight-line method over the term of the related lease or occupancy term of the tenant, if shorter. We record depreciation on equipment and fixtures utilizing
the straight-line method over seven to ten years.

We
review investment properties for impairment on a property-by-property basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of
investment properties may not be recoverable. These circumstances include, but are not limited to, declines in cash flows, occupancy and comparable sales per square foot at the property. We measure
any impairment of investment property when the estimated undiscounted operating income before depreciation and amortization plus its residual value is less than the carrying value of the property. To
the extent impairment has occurred, we charge to income the excess of carrying value of the property over its estimated fair value. We estimate fair value using unobservable market data such as
operating income, estimated capitalization rates, or multiples, leasing prospects and local market information. We may decide to sell properties that are held for use and the sale prices of these
properties may differ from their
carrying values. We also review our investments including investments in unconsolidated entities if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of our investments may not be
recoverable. We will record an impairment charge if we determine that a decline in the fair value of the investments is other-than-temporary.

Certain
of our real estate assets contain asbestos. The asbestos is appropriately contained, in accordance with current environmental regulations, and we have no current plans to remove
the asbestos. If these properties were demolished, certain environmental regulations are in place which specify the manner in which the asbestos must be handled and disposed. Because the obligation to
remove the asbestos has an indeterminable settlement date, we are not able to reasonably estimate the fair value of this obligation.

Purchase Accounting Allocation

We allocate the purchase price of acquisitions to the various components of the acquisition based upon the fair value of each component
which may be derived from various observable or unobservable inputs and assumptions. Also, we may utilize third party valuation specialists. These components typically include buildings, land and
intangibles related to in-place leases and we estimate:

•

the fair value of land and related improvements and buildings on an as-if-vacant basis.


Simon Property Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

(Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts and where indicated as in millions or billions)

3.    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

•

the market value of in-place leases based upon our best estimate of current market rents and amortize the
resulting market rent adjustment into revenues.

•

the value of costs to obtain tenants, including tenant allowances and improvements and leasing commissions.

•

the value of revenue and recovery of costs foregone during a reasonable lease-up period, as if the space was
vacant.

Amounts
allocated to building are depreciated over the estimated remaining life of the acquired building or related improvements. We amortize amounts allocated to tenant improvements,
in-place lease assets and other lease-related intangibles over the remaining life of the underlying leases. We also estimate the value of other acquired intangible assets, if any, which
are amortized over the remaining life of the underlying related leases or intangibles.

Discontinued Operations

We reclassify any material operations and gains or losses on disposal related to consolidated properties sold during the period to
discontinued operations. During 2007, we reported the net loss upon sale on five consolidated assets sold in "Loss on sale of discontinued operations" in the consolidated statements of operations and
comprehensive income. The operating results of the assets disposed of in 2007 were not significant to our consolidated results of operations. There were no consolidated assets sold during 2008. During
2009, we reported the net loss of approximately $9.8 million upon the sale of four consolidated assets in "(Loss) gain on sales of assets and interests in unconsolidated entities" in the
consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. The loss on these assets and the operating results were not significant to our consolidated results of operations.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

We consider all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash and cash
equivalents. Cash equivalents are carried at cost, which approximates fair value. Cash equivalents generally consist of commercial paper, bankers acceptances, Eurodollars, repurchase agreements, and
money markets. Our gift card programs are administered by banks. We collect gift card funds at the point of sale and then remit those funds to the banks for further processing. As a result, cash and
cash equivalents, as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, includes a balance of $38.1 million and $29.8 million, respectively, related to these gift card programs which we do not
consider available for general working capital purposes. Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk include our cash and cash equivalents and our trade accounts
receivable. We place our cash and cash equivalents with institutions with high credit quality. However, at certain times, such cash and cash equivalents may be in excess of FDIC and SIPC insurance
limits. See Notes 4, 8, and 10 for disclosures about non-cash investing and financing transactions.

Marketable and Non-Marketable Securities

Marketable securities consist primarily of the investments of our captive insurance subsidiaries, our investment in shares of stock of
Liberty International PLC, or Liberty, our deferred compensation plan investments, and certain investments held to fund the debt service requirements of debt previously secured by investment
properties that have been sold.

The
types of securities included in the investment portfolio of our captive insurance subsidiaries typically include U.S. Treasury or other U.S. government securities as
well as corporate debt securities with maturities ranging from less than 1 to 10 years. These securities are classified as available-for-sale and are valued based upon
quoted market prices or other observable inputs when quoted market prices are not available. The amortized cost of debt securities, which approximates fair value, held by our captive insurance
subsidiaries is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity. Our investment in Liberty is also accounted for as an available-for-sale security.
Liberty operates regional shopping centers and is the owner of other retail assets


Simon Property Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

(Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts and where indicated as in millions or billions)

3.    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

throughout
the United Kingdom, as well as certain real estate assets in the U.S. Our interest in Liberty is adjusted to their quoted market price, including a related foreign exchange component.
Changes in the values of these securities are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the gain or loss is realized or until any unrealized loss is deemed to be
other-than-temporary. We review any declines in value of these securities for other-than-temporary impairment and consider the severity and duration of
any decline in value. To the extent an other-than-temporary impairment is deemed to have occurred, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis is established.
Subsequent changes are then recognized through other comprehensive income unless another other-than-temporary impairment is deemed to have occurred.

During
2009, we recognized a non-cash charge of $140.5 million, or $0.44 per diluted share, representing an other-than-temporary impairment in
fair value below the carrying value of our investment in Liberty. At June 30 and December 31, 2009, we owned 35.4 million shares at a weighted average original cost per share of
£5.74. As of June 30 and December 31, 2009, Liberty's quoted market price was £3.97 and £5.15 per share, respectively. As a result of the significance
and duration of the decline in the total share price at June 30, 2009, including currency revaluations, we deemed the decline in value as other-than-temporary impairment
establishing a new cost basis of our investment in Liberty. As a result, changes in available-for-sale securities and other in the 2009 consolidated statement of operations and
comprehensive income include the reclassification of $140.5 million from accumulated other comprehensive loss to earnings related to this non-cash charge. Prior to the quarter
ending June 30, 2009, the changes in value of our Liberty investment were reflected in other comprehensive income. Effective July 1, 2009, we resumed marking to market our Liberty
investment through other comprehensive income. The resulting mark-to-market adjustment at December 31, 2009 was an increase in the carrying value of Liberty of
$58.2 million with a corresponding adjustment in other comprehensive income.

Our
insurance subsidiaries are required to maintain statutory minimum capital and surplus as well as maintain a minimum liquidity ratio. Therefore, our access to these securities may be
limited. Our deferred compensation plan
investments are classified as trading securities and are valued based upon quoted market prices. The investments have a matching liability recorded as the amounts are fully payable to the employees
that earned the compensation. Changes in the values of these securities and changes to the matching liability to employees are both recognized in earnings and as a result the impact to consolidated
net income is zero. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, we have investments of $51.7 million and $53.4 million, respectively, which must be used to fund the debt service
requirements of debt related to investment properties sold. These investments are classified as held-to-maturity and are recorded at amortized cost as we have the ability and
intent to hold these investments to maturity.

During
2008, we made an investment of $70 million in a non-marketable security that we account for under the cost method. To the extent an
other-than-temporary decline in fair value is deemed to have occurred, we would adjust this investment to its estimated fair value.

Net
unrealized gains as of December 31, 2009 were approximately $59.4 million and represented the valuation and related currency adjustments for our marketable securities.
As of December 31, 2009, other than the adjustment related to our investment in Liberty recorded during the second quarter, we do not consider any decline in value of any of our other
marketable and non-marketable securities to be an other-than-temporary impairment, as these market value declines, if any, are not significant, have existed for a
short period of time, and, in the case of debt securities, we have the ability and intent to hold these securities to maturity.

Fair Value Measurements

We hold marketable securities that total $464.1 million at December 31, 2009, and are considered to have Level 1
fair value inputs. In addition, we have derivative instruments which are classified as having Level 2 inputs which consist primarily of interest rate swap agreements with a gross liability
balance of $13.0 million and a gross asset balance of $0.3 million and interest rate cap agreements with a minimal asset value. Level 1 fair value inputs are quoted prices for
identical items in active, liquid and visible markets such as stock exchanges. Level 2 fair value inputs

are
observable information for similar items in active or inactive markets, and appropriately consider counterparty creditworthiness in the valuations. Level 3 fair value inputs reflect our
best estimate of inputs and assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability at the measurement date. The inputs are unobservable in the market and significant to the
valuation estimate. Certain wholly owned assets and equity method investments in real estate were determined to be impaired in 2009. We used Level 3 inputs in estimating the fair value of these
assets to measure our impairment. Note 8 includes discussion of the fair value of debt.

Use of Estimates

We prepared the accompanying consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States, or GAAP. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements, and revenues and expenses during the reported period. Our actual results could differ from these estimates.

Segment Disclosure

Our primary business is the ownership, development, and management of retail real estate. We have aggregated our retail operations,
including regional malls, Premium Outlet Centers, The Mills, and community/lifestyle centers, into one reportable segment because they have similar economic characteristics and we provide similar
products and services to similar types of tenants. Further, all material operations are within the United States and no customer or tenant comprises more than 10% of consolidated revenues.

in order to obtain long-term
financing and internal and external leasing commissions and related costs. We record amortization of deferred financing costs on a straight-line basis over the terms of the respective
loans or agreements. Our deferred leasing costs consist primarily of capitalized salaries and related benefits in connection with lease originations. We record amortization of deferred leasing costs
on a straight-line basis over the terms of the related leases. Details of these deferred costs as of December 31 are as follows:

We
report amortization of deferred financing costs, amortization of premiums, and accretion of discounts as part of interest expense. Amortization of deferred leasing costs is a
component of depreciation and amortization expense. We amortize debt premiums and discounts, which are included in mortgages and other indebtedness, over the remaining terms of the related debt
instruments. These debt premiums or discounts arise either at the debt issuance or as part of the purchase price allocation of the fair value of debt assumed in acquisitions. The accompanying
statements of operations and comprehensive income include amortization as follows:

Intangible Assets

The average life of in-place lease intangibles is approximately 5.5 years and is amortized over the remaining life
of the leases of the related property on the straight-line basis and is included with depreciation and amortization in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.
The fair market value of above and below market leases is amortized into revenue over the remaining lease life as a component of reported minimum rents. The weighted average remaining life of these
intangibles is approximately 1.2 years. The unamortized amount of below market leases is included in "Accounts payable, accrued expenses, intangibles and deferred revenues" in the consolidated
balance sheets and was $60.9 million and $94.3 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The amount of amortization of above and below market leases, net for the
years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007 was $20.0 million, $35.4 million, and $44.6 million, respectively. If a lease is terminated prior to the original lease
termination, any remaining unamortized intangible is charged to earnings.

Derivative Financial Instruments

On January 1, 2009, we adopted newly issued accounting guidance on disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging
activities which amends and expands previous disclosure requirements. The guidance requires qualitative disclosures about objectives and strategies for using derivatives and quantitative disclosures
about the fair value of and gains and losses on derivative instruments. We record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives
depends on the intended use
of the derivative, whether we have elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to
apply hedge accounting. We use a variety of derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business to manage or hedge the risks associated with our indebtedness and interest payments. Our
objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish this objective, we primarily use interest
rate swaps and caps. We require that hedging derivative instruments be highly effective in reducing the risk exposure that they are designated to hedge. As a result, there was no significant
ineffectiveness from any of our derivative activities during the period. We formally designate any instrument that meets these hedging criteria as a hedge at the inception of the derivative contract.

As
of December 31, 2009, we had the following outstanding interest rate derivatives related to interest rate risk:

Interest Rate Derivative

Number of Instruments

Notional Amount

Interest Rate Swaps


$

694.2 million

Interest Rate Caps


$

388.4 million

The
carrying value of our interest rate swap agreements, at fair value, is a net liability of $12.7 million as of December 31, 2009, of which $13.0 million is
included with other liabilities and $0.3 million is included with deferred costs and other assets. The interest rate cap agreements were of no net value at December 31, 2009 and we
generally do not apply hedge accounting to these arrangements. The total gross accumulated other comprehensive loss related to our derivative activities, including our share of the other comprehensive
loss from joint venture properties, was approximately $52.3 million as of December 31, 2009.

We
are also exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on investments denominated in a foreign currency that we hold, primarily in Japan and Europe. We use currency forward
agreements to manage our exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates on certain Yen-denominated receivables. Currency forward agreements involve fixing the USD-Yen exchange
rate for delivery of a specified amount of foreign currency on a specified date. The currency forward agreements are typically cash settled in US dollars for their fair value at or close to their
settlement date. We entered into USD-Yen forwards during 2009 for approximately ¥3 billion that we expect to receive through April 2011 at an average exchange rate of
97.1 USD:Yen, of which approximately ¥1.6 billion remains as of December 31, 2009.


Simon Property Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

(Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts and where indicated as in millions or billions)

3.    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

The
December 31, 2009 liability balance related to these forwards was $0.7 million and is included in other liabilities. We have reflected the changes in fair value for these forward
contracts in earnings. The underlying currency adjustments on the foreign-denominated receivables are also reflected in income and generally offset the amounts in earnings for these forward contracts.

We
have no credit-risk-related hedging or derivative activities.

Noncontrolling Interests and Temporary Equity

Effective January 1, 2009, we adopted a newly issued accounting standard for noncontrolling interests, which requires a
noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary to be reported as equity and the amount of net income specifically attributable to the noncontrolling interest to be included within consolidated net income.
This standard also requires consistency in the manner of reporting changes in the parent's ownership interest and requires fair value measurement of any noncontrolling equity investment retained in a
deconsolidation. In connection with our adoption which was fully reflected in our December 31, 2008 Form 10-K/A,
we also reviewed and retrospectively adopted the measurement and classification provisions for redeemable securities as further discussed below. As a result, we adjust the carrying amounts of
noncontrolling redeemable interests held by third parties in certain of our properties to redemption values at each reporting date. Because holders of the noncontrolling redeemable interests in
properties can require us to redeem these interests for cash, we classify these noncontrolling redeemable interests outside of permanent equity. These adjustments increased accumulated deficit in
consolidated equity. Adjustments to the carrying amounts of these noncontrolling redeemable interests in properties, to reflect the change in redemption value at the end of each reporting period, are
recorded to accumulated deficit. Additionally, due to certain cash redemption features that may be deemed outside of our control, certain preferred units are also classified as temporary equity.

We
classify our Series I 6% Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock (or Series I preferred stock) in temporary equity due to the possibility that we could be required to
redeem the security for cash upon the occurrence of a change in control event, which would include a change in the majority of our directors that occurs over a two year period. The carrying amount of
the Series I preferred stock is equal to its liquidation value, which is the amount payable upon the occurrence of such event. The limited partners' interests in the Operating Partnership and
nonredeemable noncontrolling interests in properties are classified in equity as noncontrolling nonredeemable interests.

Details
of the carrying amount of our noncontrolling interests that are reflected in permanent equity are as follows as of December 31:

December 31, 2009 of $59.4 million represents the valuation and related currency adjustments for our marketable securities, primarily related to our investment in Liberty. In the second
quarter of 2009 we reclassified $140.5 million

from
accumulated other comprehensive loss to earnings related to our investment in Liberty as a result of our assessment that the decline in value was deemed an
other-than-temporary impairment.

Revenue Recognition

We, as a lessor, retain substantially all of the risks and benefits of ownership of the investment properties and account for our
leases as operating leases. We accrue minimum rents on a straight-line basis over the terms of their respective leases. Substantially all of our retail tenants are also required to pay
overage rents based on sales over a stated base amount during the lease year. We recognize overage rents only when each tenant's sales exceed the applicable sales threshold.

We
structure our leases to allow us to recover a significant portion of our property operating, real estate taxes, repairs and maintenance, and advertising and promotion expenses from
our tenants. A substantial portion of our leases, other than those for anchor stores, require the tenant to reimburse us for a substantial portion of our operating expenses, including common area
maintenance, or CAM, real estate taxes and insurance. This significantly reduces our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation. Such property operating expenses
typically include utility, insurance, security, janitorial, landscaping, food court and other administrative expenses. We accrue reimbursements from tenants for recoverable portions of all these
expenses as revenue in the period the applicable expenditures are incurred. For approximately 80% of our leases in the U.S. regional mall portfolio, we receive a fixed payment from the tenant for the
CAM component. Without the fixed-CAM component, CAM expense reimbursements are based on the tenant's proportionate share of the allocable operating expenses and CAM capital expenditures
for the property. We also receive escrow payments for these reimbursements from substantially all our non-fixed CAM tenants and monthly fixed CAM payments throughout the year. We recognize
differences between estimated recoveries and the final billed amounts in the subsequent year. These differences were not material in any period presented. Our advertising and promotional costs are
expensed as incurred.

Management Fees and Other Revenues

Management fees and other revenues are generally received from our unconsolidated joint venture properties as well as third parties.
Management fee revenue is earned based on a contractual percentage of joint venture property revenue. Development fee revenue is earned on a contractual percentage of hard costs to develop a property.
Leasing fee revenue is earned on a contractual per square foot charge based on the square footage of current year leasing activity. We recognize revenue for these services provided when earned based
on the underlying activity.

Insurance
premiums written and ceded are recognized on a pro-rata basis over the terms of the policies. Insurance losses are reflected in property operating expenses in the
accompanying statements of operations and comprehensive income and include estimates for losses incurred but not reported as well as losses pending settlement. Estimates for losses are based on
evaluations by third-party actuaries and management's best estimates. Total insurance reserves for our insurance subsidiaries and other self-insurance programs as of December 31,
2009 and 2008 approximated $117.2 million and $116.5 million, respectively, and are included in "Other liabilities and accrued dividends" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

We
recognize fee revenues from our co-branded gift card programs when the fees are earned under the related arrangements with the card issuer. Generally, these revenues are
recorded at the issuance of the gift card for handling fees.

Allowance for Credit Losses

We record a provision for credit losses based on our judgment of a tenant's creditworthiness, ability to pay and probability of
collection. In addition, we also consider the retail sector in which the tenant operates and our historical collection experience in cases of bankruptcy, if applicable. Accounts are written off when
they are deemed to be no

Income Taxes

We and certain subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership have elected to be taxed as REITs under Sections 856 through 860 of the
Internal Revenue Code and applicable Treasury regulations relating to REIT qualification. In order to maintain this REIT status, the regulations require us to distribute at least 90% of our taxable
income to stockholders and meet certain other asset and income tests as well as other requirements. We intend to continue to adhere to these requirements and maintain our REIT status and that of the
REIT subsidiaries. As REITs, these entities will generally not be liable for federal corporate income taxes as long as they continue to distribute in excess of 100% of their taxable income. Thus, we
made no provision for federal income taxes for these entities in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. If Simon Property or the REIT subsidiaries fail to qualify as a REIT, we or that
entity will be subject to tax at regular corporate rates for the years in which it failed to qualify. If we lose our REIT status we could not elect to be taxed as a REIT for four years unless our
failure to qualify was due to reasonable cause and certain other conditions were satisfied.

We
have also elected taxable REIT subsidiary, or TRS, status for some of our subsidiaries. This enables us to provide services that would otherwise be considered impermissible for REITs
and participate in activities that do not qualify as "rents from real property". For these entities, deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for temporary differences between the financial
reporting basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities at the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse. A valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is
provided if we believe all or some portion of the deferred tax asset may not be realized. An increase or decrease in the valuation allowance that results from the change in circumstances that causes a
change in our judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax asset is included in income.

As
of December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had a net deferred tax asset of $8.7 million and $8.9 million, respectively, related to our TRS subsidiaries. The net deferred
tax asset is included in deferred costs and other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and consists primarily of operating losses and other carryforwards for federal income tax
purposes as well as the timing of the deductibility of losses or reserves from insurance subsidiaries. No valuation allowance has been recorded as we believe these amounts will be realized. State
income, franchise or other taxes were not significant in any of the periods presented.

4.    Real Estate Acquisitions, Disposals, and Impairment

We acquire properties to generate both current income and long-term appreciation in value. We acquire individual properties or portfolios of other retail real estate
companies that meet our investment criteria and sell properties which no longer meet our strategic criteria. Our consolidated acquisition and disposal activity for the periods presented are
highlighted as follows:

2009 Acquisitions

We had no consolidated property acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2009.

2008 Acquisitions

Effective January 1, 2008, we acquired additional interests in three existing consolidated properties of between 1.8% and 5%,
for an aggregate $6.2 million in cash. Two of the properties continue to have a noncontrolling interest holder. We now own 100% of the third property.

2007 Acquisitions

As a result of the Mills acquisition which is more fully discussed in Note 7, we consolidated two regional mall properties, Town
Center at Cobb and Gwinnett Place. In addition to the Mills acquisition, on March 1, 2007, we acquired the remaining 40% interest in both University Park Mall and University Center located in
Mishawaka, Indiana from our partner and as a result, we now own 100% of these properties. On March 28, 2007, we acquired The Maine Outlet, a 112,000 square foot outlet center located in
Kittery, Maine, adjacent to our Kittery Premium Outlets property. On August 23, 2007, we acquired Las Americas Premium Outlets, a 560,000 square foot upscale outlet center located in
San Diego, California. We also purchased an additional 1% interest in Bangor Mall on July 13, 2007, and an additional 6.5% interest in Montgomery Mall on November 1, 2007. The
aggregate purchase price of the consolidated assets acquired during 2007, excluding Town Center at Cobb and Gwinnett Place, was approximately $394.2 million, including the assumption of our
share of debt of the properties acquired.

2009 Dispositions

During the year ended December 31, 2009, we sold four consolidated properties for which we received net proceeds of
$3.9 million. The loss on disposal (net) totaled $9.8 million and is included in "(Loss) gain on sale of assets and interests in unconsolidated entities" in the consolidated statements
of operations and comprehensive income.

2008 Dispositions

We had no consolidated property dispositions during the year ended December 31, 2008.

2007 Dispositions

During the year ended December 31, 2007, we sold five consolidated properties for which we received net proceeds of
$56.4 million. The loss on disposal (net) totaled $35.2 million and is included in "Loss on sale of discontinued operations" in the consolidated statements of operations and
comprehensive income.

2009 Impairment

In 2009, we recorded non-cash impairment charges of $240.1 million ($228.6 million, net of a tax benefit of
$5.8 million and noncontrolling interest holders' share of $5.7 million). As discussed in Note 3, this non-cash charge includes a $140.5 million
other-than-temporary impairment of our investment in Liberty. In addition, the total charge includes adjustments recorded in the fourth quarter in the carrying value of one
wholly-owned and one joint venture regional mall, a write-down of five land parcels and two joint venture non-retail real estate assets, and certain predevelopment costs
related to projects no longer being pursued.

4.    Real Estate Acquisitions, Disposals, and Impairment (Continued)

2008 Impairment

In 2008, we recorded impairment charges of $21.2 million ($19.4 million, net of tax benefit), which resulted primarily
from a $10.5 million reduction in the carrying value of a regional mall to its estimated net realizable value and the write-off of predevelopment costs related to various projects
that we no longer plan to pursue.

5.    Per Share Data

We determine basic earnings per share based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. We determine diluted earnings per share based
on the
weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding combined with the incremental weighted average shares that would have been outstanding assuming all dilutive potential common shares were
converted into shares at the earliest date possible. The following table sets forth the computation of our basic and diluted earnings per share.

units that are exchangeable for common stock and preferred units that are convertible into units or exchangeable for our preferred stock. The only securities that had a dilutive effect for the year
ended December 31, 2009 were stock options and contingently issuable shares from stock dividends. The only security that had a dilutive effect for the years ended December 31, 2008 and
2007 were stock options.

We
accrue dividends when they are declared. The taxable nature of the dividends declared for each of the years ended as indicated is summarized as follows:

7.    Investments in Unconsolidated Entities

Joint ventures are common in the real estate industry. We use joint ventures to finance properties, develop new properties, and diversify our risk in a particular property or
portfolio.
We held joint venture ownership interests in 103 properties in the U.S. as of December 31, 2009. We also held interests in two joint ventures which owned 51 European shopping
centers as of December 31, 2009 and 52 as of December 31, 2008. We also held interests in eight joint venture properties under operation in Japan, one joint venture property in
Mexico, and one joint venture property in Korea. We account for these joint venture properties using the equity method of accounting.

Substantially
all of our joint venture properties are subject to rights of first refusal, buy-sell provisions, or other sale or marketing rights for partners which are
customary in real estate joint venture agreements and the industry. Our partners in these joint ventures may initiate these provisions at any time (subject to any applicable lock up or similar
restrictions), which could result in either the sale of our interest or the use of available cash or borrowings to acquire the joint venture interest from our partner.

Acquisition of The Mills Corporation by SPG-FCM

On February 16, 2007, SPG-FCM, a 50/50 joint venture between an affiliate of the Operating Partnership and funds
managed by Farallon Capital Management, L.L.C., or Farallon, entered into a definitive merger agreement to acquire all of the outstanding common stock of Mills for $25.25 per common share in
cash. The acquisition of Mills and its interests in the 36 properties that remain at December 31, 2009 was completed in April 2007. As of December 31, 2009, we and Farallon
had each funded $650.0 million into SPG-FCM to acquire all of the common stock of Mills. As part of the transaction, the Operating Partnership also made loans to SPG-FCM
and Mills at rates of LIBOR plus 270-275 basis points. These funds were used by SPG-FCM and Mills to repay loans and other obligations of Mills, including the redemption of
preferred stock, during 2007. As of December 31, 2009, the outstanding balance of our loan to SPG-FCM was $632.0 million, and the average outstanding balance during the year
ended December 31, 2009 of all loans made to SPG-FCM and Mills was approximately $589.5 million. During 2009, 2008 and 2007, we recorded approximately $9.3 million,
$15.3 million and $39.1 million in interest income (net of inter-entity eliminations) related to these loans, respectively. We also recorded fee income, including fee income amortization
related to up-front fees on loans made to SPG-FCM and Mills, during 2009, 2008 and 2007 of approximately $3.7 million, $3.1 million and $17.4 million (net
of inter-entity eliminations), respectively, for providing refinancing services to Mills' properties and SPG-FCM. The existing loan facility to SPG-FCM bears a rate of LIBOR
plus 275 basis points and matures on June 7, 2010, with two available one-year extensions. Fees charged on loans made to SPG-FCM and Mills are amortized on a
straight-line basis over the life of the loan.

7.    Investments in Unconsolidated Entities (Continued)

As
a result of the change in control of Mills, holders of Mills' Series F convertible cumulative redeemable preferred stock had the right to require the repurchase of their
shares for cash equal to the liquidation preference per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends. During the second quarter of 2007, all of the holders of Mills' Series F preferred stock
exercised this right, and Mills redeemed this series of preferred stock for approximately $333.2 million, including accrued dividends. Further, as of August 1, 2007, The Mills
Corporation was liquidated and the holders of the remaining series' of Mills preferred stock were paid a liquidation preference of approximately $693.0 million, including accrued dividends.

During
the third quarter of 2007, the holders of less than 5,000 common units in the Mills' operating partnership, or Mills units, received $25.25 in cash, and those holding 5,000 or
more Mills units had the option to exchange for cash of $25.25, or Units of the Operating Partnership based on a fixed exchange ratio of 0.211 Operating Partnership units for each Mills unit. That
option expired on August 1, 2007. Holders electing to exchange received 66,036 units in the Operating Partnership for their Mills units. The remaining Mills units were exchanged for cash.

Effective
July 1, 2007, we or an affiliate of ours began serving as the manager for substantially all of the properties in which SPG-FCM holds an interest. In
conjunction with the Mills acquisition, we acquired a majority interest in two properties in which we previously held a 50% ownership interest (Town Center at Cobb and Gwinnett Place) and as a result
we have consolidated these two properties at the date of acquisition. We have
reclassified the results of these properties in the Joint Venture Statements of Operations into "Income from consolidated joint venture interests."

The
Mills acquisition involved the purchase of all of Mills' outstanding shares of common stock and common units for approximately $1.7 billion (at $25.25 per share or unit), the
assumption of $954.9 million of preferred stock, the assumption of a proportionate share of property-level mortgage debt, of which SPG-FCM's share approximated $3.8 billion,
the assumption of $1.2 billion in unsecured loans provided by us, costs to effect the acquisition, and certain liabilities and contingencies, including an ongoing investigation by the
Securities and Exchange Commission, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $8 billion. The valuations were developed with the assistance of a third-party professional appraisal firm.

We
subsequently sold our interest in Cincinnati Mills and Broward and Westland Malls, which we acquired through the Mills acquisition, and recognized no gain or loss on these
dispositions.

Summary Financial Information

A summary of our investments in joint ventures and share of income from such joint ventures follows. We condensed into separate line
items major captions of the statements of operations for joint venture interests sold or consolidated. Consolidation occurs when we acquire an additional interest in the joint venture and as a result,
gain control of the property or become the primary beneficiary of a VIE. We reclassified these line items into "Income from discontinued joint venture interests" and "Income from consolidated joint
venture interests" so that we may present

2009 Impairment

In December 2009 we recognized non-cash impairment charges of $7.6 million representing our share of impairment
charges on joint venture properties. This charge represents adjustments to the carrying value of certain parcels of land and the write-off of predevelopment costs related to certain
projects no longer being pursued. In addition, in December 2009 we recognized $35.1 million of impairment charges for investments in certain

entities including one regional mall and two non-retail real estate assets for which declines in value below our carrying amount were deemed
other-than-temporary.

2007 Impairment

During the fourth quarter of 2007, we recorded an impairment charge of $55.1 million, $36.5 million net of tax benefit,
representing our entire equity investment in a joint venture, including interest capitalized on our invested equity, which had invested in a parcel of land.

International Joint Venture Investments

European Joint Ventures.

We conduct our international operations in Europe through our two European
joint venture investment entities; Simon Ivanhoe
S.à.r.l., or Simon Ivanhoe, and Gallerie Commerciali Italia, or GCI. The carrying amount of our total combined investment in these two joint venture investments is $298.8 million
and $224.2 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, including all related components of other comprehensive income. The Operating Partnership has a 50% ownership in Simon
Ivanhoe and a 49% ownership in GCI as of December 31, 2009. On December 14, 2009, we made an additional capital contribution to GCI of $79.4 million which was used to fund certain
liabilities of the joint venture. The contribution increased our investment in GCI but did not impact our ownership percentage of the venture.

On
July 5, 2007, Simon Ivanhoe completed the sale of five non-core assets in Poland and we presented our share of the gain upon this disposition in "(Loss) gain on
sale of assets and interests in unconsolidated entities" in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income.

Asian Joint Ventures.

We conduct our international Premium Outlet operations in Japan through joint
ventures with Mitsubishi Estate Co., Ltd. The
carrying amount of our investment in these Premium Outlet joint ventures in Japan is $302.2 million and $312.6 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, including
all related components of other comprehensive income. We have a 40% ownership in these Japan Premium Outlet Centers through a joint venture arrangement. During 2007, we completed construction and
opened our first Premium Outlet in Korea. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008 respectively, our investment in our Premium Outlet in Korea, for which we hold a 50% ownership interest, approximated
$26.1 million and $18.0 million including all related components of other comprehensive income.

In
December 2009, we recognized a loss on our 32.5% interests in our shopping centers operating or under development in China. The interests were sold to affiliates of our Chinese
partner for approximately $29 million, resulting in a loss of approximately $20 million which is included in "(Loss) gain on sale of assets and interests in unconsolidated entities" in
the 2009 consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income.

General.

At December 31, 2009, we have pledged 80 properties as collateral to secure related
mortgage notes including 8 pools of
cross-defaulted and cross-collateralized mortgages encumbering a total of 34 properties. Under these cross-default provisions, a default under any mortgage included in the cross-defaulted
package may constitute a default under all such mortgages and may lead to acceleration of the indebtedness due on each property within the collateral package. Of our 80 encumbered properties,
indebtedness on 24 of these encumbered properties and our unsecured debt are subject to various financial performance covenants relating to leverage ratios, annual real property appraisal
requirements, debt service coverage ratios, minimum net worth ratios, debt-to-market capitalization, and/or minimum equity values. Our mortgages and other indebtedness may be
prepaid but are generally subject to payment of a yield-maintenance premium or defeasance.

Some
of the limited partners guarantee a portion of our consolidated debt through foreclosure guarantees. In total, 54 limited partners provide guarantees of foreclosure of
$291.1 million of our consolidated debt at three consolidated properties. In each case, the loans were made by unrelated third party institutional lenders and the guarantees are for the benefit
of each lender. In the event of foreclosure of the mortgaged property, the proceeds from the sale of the property are first applied against the amount of the guarantee and also reduce the amount
payable under the guarantee. To the extent the sale proceeds from the disposal of the property do not cover the amount of the guarantee, then the limited partner is liable to pay the difference
between the sale proceeds and the amount of the guarantee so that the entire amount guaranteed to the lender is satisfied. The debt is non-recourse to us and our affiliates.

Unsecured Debt

Our unsecured debt consists of approximately $11.6 billion of senior unsecured notes of the Operating Partnership and
$446.1 million outstanding under our $3.5 billion unsecured credit facility, or the Credit Facility, at December 31, 2009. The total outstanding balance of the Credit Facility as
of December 31, 2009 was comprised of the U.S. dollar equivalent of Euro and Yen-denominated borrowings. The balance as of December 31, 2009 reflects interest at LIBOR
plus 37.5 basis points and an additional facility fee of 12.5 basis points as these borrowings were made under our prior Credit Facility. On December 8, 2009, the Operating Partnership entered
into a new unsecured revolving corporate credit facility to replace the previous Credit Facility providing an initial borrowing capacity of


Simon Property Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

(Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts and where indicated as in millions or billions)

8.    Indebtedness and Derivative Financial Instruments (Continued)

$3.565 billion.
The new credit facility contains an accordion feature allowing the maximum borrowing capacity to expand to $4.0 billion. The new credit facility matures on
March 31, 2013. The base interest on the new credit facility is LIBOR plus 210 basis points and includes a facility fee of 40 basis points. Borrowings on the new facility were not
drawn until January 5, 2010 when the Euro and Yen-denominated borrowings on the Credit Facility were transitioned to the new credit facility. As of December 31, 2009, we are
in compliance with all of the covenants of our unsecured debt.

During
the year ended December 31, 2009, we drew amounts from our prior Credit Facility to fund the redemption of $600.0 million of maturing senior unsecured notes. We
repaid a total of $1.2 billion on our prior Credit Facility during the year ended December 31, 2009. The maximum outstanding balance during the year ended December 31, 2009 was
approximately $1.6 billion. During the year ended December 31, 2009, the weighted average outstanding balance on the prior Credit Facility was approximately $669.8 million.

On
March 25, 2009, the Operating Partnership issued $650.0 million of senior unsecured notes at a fixed interest rate of 10.35%. We used proceeds from the offering to
reduce borrowings on the prior Credit Facility.

On
May 15, 2009, the Operating Partnership issued $600.0 million of senior unsecured notes at a fixed interest rate of 6.75%. We used the proceeds from the offering for
general business purposes. The offering of these notes was re-opened on August 11, 2009, and an additional $500.0 million of senior unsecured notes were issued. We used the
proceeds from the offering for general business purposes.

Secured Debt

The balance of fixed and variable rate mortgage notes was $6.6 billion and $6.3 billion as of December 31, 2009
and 2008, respectively. Of the 2009 amount, $5.6 billion is nonrecourse to us. The fixed-rate mortgages generally require monthly payments of principal and/or interest. The interest
rates of variable-rate mortgages are typically based on LIBOR.

On
July 30, 2009, we borrowed $400.0 million on a mortgage that is secured by Greenwood Park Mall, Southpark Mall, and Walt Whitman Mall, which matures on August 1,
2016 and bears interest at a fixed rate of 8.00%. This loan is cross-collateralized and contains cross default provisions as it pertains to these properties.

8.    Indebtedness and Derivative Financial Instruments (Continued)

Derivative Financial Instruments

Our exposure to market risk due to changes in interest rates primarily relates to our long-term debt obligations. We manage
exposure to interest rate market risk through our risk management strategy by a combination of interest rate protection agreements to effectively fix or cap a portion of variable rate debt. We are
also exposed to foreign currency risk on financings of certain foreign operations. Our
intent is to offset gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures, with gains and losses on the derivative contracts hedging these exposures. We do not enter into either interest rate
protection or foreign currency rate protection agreements for speculative purposes.

We
may enter into treasury lock agreements as part of an anticipated debt issuance. If the anticipated transaction does not occur, the cost is charged to consolidated net income. Upon
completion of the debt issuance, the cost of these instruments is recorded as part of accumulated other comprehensive income and is amortized to interest expense over the life of the debt agreement.

As
of December 31, 2009, the fair value of our outstanding consolidated derivatives is a net liability of $12.7 million, of which $13.0 million is included with
other liabilities and $0.3 million is included with deferred costs and other assets. In addition, we recorded the benefits from our treasury lock and interest rate hedge agreements in
accumulated other comprehensive loss and the unamortized balance of these agreements is $2.8 million as of December 31, 2009. The net deficit from terminated swap agreements is also
recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss and the unamortized balance is $2.0 million as of December 31, 2009. As of December 31, 2009, our outstanding LIBOR based
derivative contracts consisted of:

•

interest rate cap protection agreements with a notional amount of $388.4 million which mature in July 2010
and June 2014, and

•

fixed rate swap agreements with a notional amount of $694.2 million which have a weighted average fixed pay rate of
2.79% and a weighted average variable receive rate of 0.60%.

Within
the next year, we expect to reclassify to earnings approximately $14.0 million of losses from the current balance held in accumulated other comprehensive loss. The amount
of ineffectiveness relating to cash flow hedges recognized in income during the periods presented was not material.

Our
joint ventures may also enter into interest rate swaps or caps, which are recorded at fair value on the joint venture balance sheets. Included in our accumulated other comprehensive
loss as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 is our share of the joint ventures' accumulated derivative losses of $30.1 million and $19.6 million, respectively.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying value of our variable-rate mortgages and other loans approximates their fair values. We estimate the fair
values of consolidated fixed-rate mortgages using cash flows discounted at current borrowing rates and other indebtedness using cash flows discounted at
current market rates. We estimate the fair values of consolidated fixed-rate unsecured notes using quoted market prices, or, if no quoted market prices are available, we use quoted market
prices for securities with similar terms and maturities. The fair values of financial instruments and our related discount rate assumptions used in the estimation of fair value for our consolidated
fixed-rate mortgages and other indebtedness as of December 31 is summarized as follows:

Approximately

10.    Equity

Our Board of Directors is authorized to reclassify excess common stock into one or more additional classes and series of capital stock, to establish the number of shares in each
class
or series and to fix the preferences, conversion and other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends, and qualifications and terms and conditions of redemption of such class or
series, without any further vote or action by the stockholders. The issuance of additional classes or series of capital stock may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in
control of Simon Property without further action of the stockholders. The ability to issue additional classes or series of capital stock, while providing flexibility in connection with possible
acquisitions and other corporate purposes, could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or of discouraging a third party from acquiring, a majority of our
outstanding voting stock.

Holders
of our common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held of record on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders, other than for the election of directors. At the
time of the initial public offering of our predecessor in 1993, the charter of the predecessor gave Melvin Simon, Herbert Simon, David Simon and certain of their affiliates, or the Simons, the right
to elect four of the members of the Board of Directors, conditioned upon the Simons, or entities they control, maintaining specified levels of equity ownership in our predecessor, the Operating
Partnership and all subsidiaries. In addition, at that time, Melvin Simon & Associates, Inc., or MSA, acquired 3,200,000 shares of our Class B common stock. MSA placed the
Class B common stock into a voting trust under which the Simons were the sole trustees. These voting trustees had the authority to elect up to four members of the Board of Directors. These same
arrangements were incorporated into our Charter in 1998 during the combination of our predecessor and Corporate Property Investors, Inc. Shares of Class B common stock convert
automatically into an equal number of shares of common stock upon the sale or transfer thereof to a person not affiliated with the estate of Melvin Simon, Herbert Simon or
David Simon. The Class B shares can be converted into shares of common stock at the option of the holders. At the initial offering we reserved 3,200,000 shares of common stock for
the possible conversion of the outstanding Class B shares. During 2008, all outstanding Class C shares were converted to 4,000 shares of common stock.

Common Stock Issuances and Repurchases

In 2009, we issued 1,866,474 shares of common stock to 62 limited partners in exchange for an equal number of Units.


Simon Property Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

(Dollars in thousands, except share and per share amounts and where indicated as in millions or billions)

10.    Equity (Continued)

We
issued 181,850 shares of common stock related to employee and director stock options exercised during 2009. We used the net proceeds from the option exercises of approximately
$4.6 million to acquire additional units. The Operating Partnership used the net proceeds for general business purposes.

On
December 18, 2009, we issued 1,802,063 shares of common stock as part of the quarterly dividend to common stockholders at an average closing price of $77.78 per share.
The Operating Partnership also issued 365,981 units to limited partners related to its distribution.

On
September 18, 2009, we issued 2,029,044 shares of common stock as part of the quarterly dividend to common stockholders at an average closing price of $73.97 per share.
The Operating Partnership also issued 411,489 units to limited partners related to its distribution.

On
June 19, 2009, we issued 2,525,204 shares of common stock as part of the quarterly dividend to common stockholders at an average closing price of $52.92 per share. The
Operating Partnership also issued 514,720 units to limited partners related to its distribution.

On
May 12, 2009, we issued 23,000,000 shares of common stock in a public offering at a public offering price of $50.00 per share. Proceeds from the offering were used for
general business purposes.

On
March 25, 2009, we issued 17,250,000 shares of common stock in a public offering at a public offering price of $31.50 per share. Proceeds from the offering were used to
repay amounts drawn on the Credit Facility and for general business purposes.

On
March 18, 2009, we issued 5,519,765 shares of common stock as part of the quarterly dividend to common stockholders at an average closing price of $35.38 per share. The
Operating Partnership also issued 1,345,151 units to limited partners related to its distribution.

Our
Board had authorized the repurchase of up to $1.0 billion of common stock through July 2009. No purchases were made as part of this program in 2009. The program was not
renewed and has now expired.

Temporary Equity

As discussed in Note 3, as a result of the retrospective adoption of an accounting standard for noncontrolling interests, we
classify as temporary equity those securities for which there is the possibility that we could be required to redeem the security for cash irrespective of the probability of such a possibility. As a
result, we reclassified one series of preferred stock from permanent equity, and we maintained in temporary equity several series of preferred units of the Operating Partnership. Each of these
securities that are classified in temporary equity is discussed below.

Series I 6% Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock.

This series of preferred stock was issued in
connection with our acquisition of Chelsea
Property Group in 2004. The terms of this series of preferred stock are substantially identical to those of the related series of 6% Series I Convertible Perpetual Preferred Units, or the
Series I preferred units, described below. During 2009, holders exchanged 500,891 preferred units for an equal number of shares of preferred stock. In prior years, 1,115,442 preferred units had
been exchanged for an equal number of shares of preferred stock. Dividends accrue quarterly at an annual rate of 6% per share. However, if the redemption date falls between the record date and the
preferred stock dividend payment date, the redemption price will be the liquidation preference only. The redemption may occur only if, for 20 trading days within a period of
30 consecutive trading days ending on the trading day before notice of redemption is issued, the closing price per share of the common stock exceeds 130% of the applicable redemption price.
This series of preferred stock is also convertible into common stock by the holder upon the occurrence of a conversion triggering event. A conversion triggering event includes the following:
(a) if we call the preferred stock for redemption; or, (b) if we are a party to a consolidation, merger, share exchange, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets; or,
(c) if during any fiscal quarter after the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2004, the closing sale price of the common stock for at least 20 trading days in a period of
30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding fiscal quarter exceeds 125% of the applicable conversion price. If the

closing
trigger price condition is not met at the end of any quarter, then conversions are not permitted in the following quarter. This series of preferred stock can also be put to us for cash upon
the occurrence of a change of control event, which would include a change in the majority of our directors that occurs over a two year period. As a result, this series of preferred stock is classified
outside permanent equity because such change in composition could be deemed outside our control. The carrying amount of the Series I Preferred Stock of $404,558 and $379,513 as of
December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, is equal to its liquidation value, which is the amount payable upon the occurrence of such event.

As
of December 31, 2009, the conversion trigger price of $74.18 had been met and each share of Series I preferred stock is now convertible into 0.847495 of a share of
common stock through March 31, 2010. During 2009, the conversion trigger price was met and accordingly holders of the Series I preferred stock did not have the right to convert their
shares to common stock during the year.

Limited Partners' Preferred Interests in the Operating Partnership and Other Noncontrolling Redeemable Interests in Properties.

The following table
summarizes each series of preferred units of the Operating Partnership and the
amount of the noncontrolling redeemable interests in properties as of December 31. The noncontrolling redeemable interests in properties are more fully discussed in Note 3. The
redemption features of each of these series of preferred units of the Operating Partnership contain provisions which could require us to settle the redemption in cash. As a result, these series of
preferred units in the Operating Partnership, along with the noncontrolling redeemable interests in properties, remain classified outside permanent equity.

6% Series I Convertible Perpetual Preferred Units.

This series of preferred units accrues
cumulative quarterly distributions at $3.00 per
unit. The preferred units are exchangeable for shares of Series I preferred stock on a one for one basis or, at Simon's option, may be settled in cash. In 2009, holders exchanged 500,891
preferred units of this series for an equal number of shares of Series I preferred stock. The preferred units have terms that are substantially identical to the Series I preferred stock.

7.75%/8.00% Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units.

This series of preferred units was redeemable on or
after January 1, 2011, or earlier upon
the occurrence of certain tax triggering events, at a redemption price equal to the liquidation value ($100.00 per unit), accrued and unpaid distributions. On June 30, 2009, upon the occurrence
of a tax triggering event, the Operating Partnership redeemed all outstanding units for cash.

7.50% Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units.

This series of preferred units accrues cumulative quarterly
distributions at a rate of $7.50 annually.
The Operating Partnership may redeem the preferred units on or after November 10, 2013, unless there is the occurrence of certain tax triggering events such as death of the initial holder, or
the transfer of any units to any person or entity other than the persons or entities entitled to the benefits of the original

holder.
The redemption price is the liquidation value ($100.00 per preferred unit) plus accrued and unpaid distributions, payable either in cash or fully registered shares of our common stock at our
election. In the event of the death of a holder of the preferred units, the occurrence of certain tax triggering events applicable to the holder, or on or after November 10, 2006, the holder
may require the Operating Partnership to redeem the preferred units at the same redemption price payable at the option of the Operating Partnership in either cash or shares of common stock.

8.00% Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units.

This series of preferred units was redeemed on
August 27, 2009, at liquidation value ($30.00 per
unit), and $0.3867 in accrued and unpaid distributions and was paid in the form of 614,055 units of the Operating Partnership.

Permanent Equity

Preferred Stock.

Dividends on all series of preferred stock are calculated based upon the preferred
stock's preferred return multiplied by the
preferred stock's corresponding liquidation value. The Operating Partnership pays preferred distributions to us equal to the dividends we pay on the preferred stock issued.

Series C 7.00% Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock and Series D 8.00% Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock.

We issued these two
series of preferred stock in 1999 to facilitate the possible conversion of two related series of preferred units: 7.00% Cumulative Convertible Preferred Units (classified as noncontrolling interests)
and the 8.00% Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units (classified as temporary equity). Each of these series of preferred stock has terms that are substantially identical to the related series of
preferred units. There are no shares of either series currently outstanding.

Series J 8


/


% Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock.

We issued this
series of preferred stock in 2004 to replace a series of
Chelsea preferred stock. Dividends accrue quarterly at an annual rate of 8


/


% per share. We can redeem this series, in whole or in part, on or after October 15, 2027 at a
redemption price of $50.00 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends. This preferred stock was issued at a premium of $7.5 million as of the date of our acquisition of Chelsea. The
unamortized premium included in the carrying value of the preferred stock at December 2009 and 2008 was $5.9 million and $6.2 million, respectively.

Noncontrolling Interests

The following series of preferred units is included in noncontrolling interests due to the ability for the Operating Partnership to
settle the redemption in either cash or units at its election. The noncontrolling interests in the consolidated balance sheets also include the third parties' nonredeemable minority holdings in
properties that we consolidate but do not wholly-own and the limited partners' common interest in the Operating Partnership due to our ability to settle any redemption in cash or common
stock at our election. These noncontrolling interests are classified as permanent equity in connection with our accounting for noncontrolling interests as discussed in Note 3.

7.00% Cumulative Convertible Preferred Units.

This series of preferred units was redeemed on
August 27, 2009, at
liquidation value ($28.00 per unit), and $0.3158 in accrued and unpaid distributions and was paid in the form of 30,234 units of the Operating Partnership.

Other Equity Activity

Notes Receivable from Former CPI Stockholders.

Notes receivable of $17.2 million from stockholders
of an entity we acquired in 1998 are
reflected as a deduction from capital in excess of par value in the consolidated statements of equity in the accompanying financial statements. The notes do not bear interest and become due at the
time the underlying shares are sold.

unit awards. Options may be granted which are qualified as "incentive stock options" within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code and options which are not so qualified. An
aggregate of 11,300,000 shares of common stock have been reserved for issuance under the 1998 plan. Additionally, the partnership agreement requires us to sell shares of common stock to the
Operating Partnership, at fair value, sufficient to satisfy the exercising of any stock options, and for us to purchase units for cash in an amount equal to the fair market value of such shares.

Administration.

The 1998 plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.
The committee determines which eligible
individuals may participate and the type, extent and terms of the awards to be granted to them. In addition, the committee interprets the 1998 plan and makes all other determinations deemed advisable
for its administration. Options granted to employees become exercisable over the period determined by the committee. The exercise price of an employee option may not be less than the fair market value
of the shares on the date of grant. Employee options generally vest over a three-year period and expire ten years from the date of grant. Since 2001, we have not granted any options to
employees, except for a series of reload options we assumed as part of a prior business combination.

Automatic Awards For Eligible Directors.

Directors who are not also our employees or employees of our
affiliates receive automatic awards under the
1998 plan. Until 2003, these awards took the form of stock options. Since then,
the awards have been shares of restricted stock. Currently, each eligible director receives on the first day of the first calendar month following his or her initial election an award of restricted
stock with a value of $82,500 (pro-rated for partial years of service). Thereafter, as of the date of each annual meeting of stockholders, eligible directors who are re-elected
receive an award of restricted stock having a value of $82,500. In addition, eligible directors who serve as chairpersons of the standing committees (excluding the Executive Committee) receive an
additional annual award of restricted stock having a value of $10,000 (in the case of the Audit Committee) or $7,500 (in the case of all other standing committees). The Lead Director also receives an
annual restricted stock award having a value of $12,500. The restricted stock vests in full after one year.

Once
vested, the delivery of the shares of restricted stock (including reinvested dividends) is deferred under our Director Deferred Compensation Plan until the director retires, dies
or becomes disabled or otherwise no longer serves as a director. The directors may vote and are entitled to receive dividends on the underlying shares; however, any dividends on the shares of
restricted stock must be reinvested in shares of common stock and held in the deferred compensation plan until the shares of restricted stock are delivered to the former director. The committee
successively approved annual stock incentive programs each year from 2001 until 2009 when no program was established.

In
addition to automatic awards, eligible directors may be granted discretionary awards under the 1998 plan.

Restricted Stock.

The 1998 plan also provides for shares of restricted stock to be granted to certain
employees at no cost to those employees,
subject to achievement of certain financial and return-based performance measures established by the committee related to the most recent year's performance. Once granted, the shares of restricted
stock then vest annually over a four-year period (25% each year) beginning on January 1 of each year. The cost of restricted stock grants, which is based upon the stock's fair
market value on the grant date, is charged to earnings ratably over the vesting period. Through December 31, 2009 a total of 4,992,636 shares of restricted stock, net of forfeitures,
have been awarded under the plan. Information regarding restricted stock awards is summarized in the following table for each of the years presented:

Exchange Rights

Limited partners in the Operating Partnership have the right to exchange all or any portion of their units for shares of common stock
on a one-for-one basis or cash, as determined by the Board of Directors. The amount of cash to be paid if the exchange right is exercised and the cash option is selected will
be based on the trading price of our common stock at that time. At December 31, 2009, we had reserved 69,501,466 shares of common stock for possible issuance upon the exchange of units,
stock options, and Class B common stock and certain convertible preferred stock.

11.    Commitments and Contingencies

Litigation

We are involved in various other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business. We believe that such litigation,
claims and administrative proceedings will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position or our results of operations. We record a liability when a loss is considered probable and the
amount can be reasonably estimated.

Lease Commitments

As of December 31, 2009, a total of 29 of the consolidated properties are subject to ground leases. The termination dates of
these ground leases range from 2012 to 2090. These ground leases generally require us to make fixed annual rental payments, or a fixed annual rental plus a percentage rent component based upon the
revenues or total sales of the property. Some of these leases also include escalation clauses and renewal options. We incurred ground lease expense included in other expense as follows:

Insurance

We maintain commercial general liability, fire, flood, extended coverage and rental loss insurance on all of our properties in the
United States through wholly-owned captive insurance entities and other self-insurance mechanisms. Rosewood Indemnity, Ltd. and Bridgewood Insurance Company, Ltd. are our
wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiaries, and have agreed to indemnify our general liability carrier for a specific layer of losses for the properties that are covered under these arrangements. The
carrier has, in turn, agreed to provide evidence of coverage for this layer of losses under the terms and conditions of the carrier's policy. A similar policy written through these captive insurance
entities also provides initial coverage for property insurance and certain windstorm risks at the properties located in coastal windstorm locations.

We
currently maintain insurance coverage against acts of terrorism on all of our properties in the United States on an "all risk" basis in the amount of up to $1 billion per
occurrence for certified foreign acts of terrorism and $500 million per occurrence for non-certified domestic acts of terrorism. The current federal laws which provide this coverage
are expected to operate through 2014. Despite the existence of this insurance coverage, any threatened or actual terrorist attacks in high profile markets could adversely affect our property values,
revenues, consumer traffic and tenant sales.

11.    Commitments and Contingencies (Continued)

Guarantees of Indebtedness

Joint venture debt is the liability of the joint venture and is typically secured by the joint venture property, which is
non-recourse to us. As of December 31, 2009, the Operating Partnership has loan guarantees of $47.2 million underlying joint venture related mortgage or other indebtedness.
Mortgages which are guaranteed by us are secured by the property of the joint venture and that property could be sold in order to satisfy the outstanding obligation.

Concentration of Credit Risk

We are subject to risks incidental to the ownership and operation of commercial real estate. These risks include, among others, the
risks normally associated with changes in the general economic climate, trends in the retail industry, creditworthiness of tenants, competition for tenants and customers, changes in tax laws, interest
rate and foreign currency levels, the availability of financing, and potential liability under environmental and other laws. Our regional malls, Premium Outlet Centers, The Mills, and
community/lifestyle centers rely heavily upon anchor tenants like most retail properties. Four retailers occupied 535 of the approximately 1,325 anchor stores in the properties as of
December 31, 2009. An affiliate of one of these retailers is a limited partner in the Operating Partnership.

Limited Life Partnerships

We are the controlling partner in several consolidated partnerships that have a limited life. We estimated the settlement values of
these noncontrolling interests as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 as approximately $115 million and $130 million, respectively. The settlement values are based on the estimated fair
values upon a hypothetical liquidation of the partnership interests and estimated yield maintenance or prepayment penalties associated with the payment to settle any underlying secured mortgage debt.

12.    Related Party Transactions

Our management company provides management, insurance, and other services to Melvin Simon & Associates, Inc., a related party, and other non-owned properties.

13.    Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued new accounting guidance on business combinations and noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial
statements which requires an acquirer to measure the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their fair values on the acquisition date,
with goodwill being the excess value over the net identifiable assets acquired. The guidance also requires acquisition related costs to be expensed as incurred. The guidance is effective
for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. On January 1, 2009, we adopted the guidance which did not have a significant impact on our financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.

In
February 2008, the FASB issued a staff position which permitted a one-year deferral for the implementation of previously issued guidance related to fair value
measurements with regard to nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are not recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually). On
January 1, 2009, we adopted the fair value measurement guidance as it relates to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are not recognized or disclosed at fair value in the
financial statements on at least an annual basis. The adoption had no impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The provisions of the guidance are applied at such time as
a fair value measurement of a nonfinancial asset or nonfinancial liability is required, which may result in a fair value that is materially different than would have been calculated prior to adoption.

In
June 2008, the FASB ratified guidance which provides an entity use a two step approach to evaluate whether an equity-linked financial instrument (or embedded feature) is indexed to
its own stock, including evaluating the instrument's contingent exercise and settlement provisions. We adopted the guidance on January 1, 2009 which had no impact on our financial position,
results of operations or cash flows.

On
January 1, 2009, we adopted guidance on determining whether instruments granted in share-based payment transactions are participating securities. Under this guidance, unvested
share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and are included in the computation of earnings
per share pursuant to the two-class method. The adoption of the guidance did not have a significant impact on reported earnings per share.

In
May 2009, the FASB issued guidance which established general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial
statements are issued or are available to be issued. The statement introduces new terminology but is based on the same principles that previously existed in the accounting standards. The guidance
requires disclosure of the date through which management has evaluated subsequent events and whether that date represents the date the financial statements were issued or the date the financial
statements were available to be issued. The guidance was effective for interim and annual periods ending after June 15, 2009. The adoption of this statement did not have any impact on our
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In
June 2009, the FASB issued the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (Codification) which is effective for interim and annual periods ending after September 15, 2009. The
Codification defines a new hierarchy for U.S. GAAP and establishes the Codification as the sole source for authoritative guidance to be applied by nongovernmental entities. The adoption of the
Codification changed the manner in which U.S. GAAP guidance is referenced, but did not have any impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In
June 2009, the FASB also issued an amendment to the accounting and disclosure requirements for the consolidation of variable interest entities (VIEs). This amendment requires an
enterprise to perform a qualitative analysis when determining whether or not it must consolidate a VIE. The amendment also requires an enterprise to continuously reassess whether it must consolidate a
VIE. Additionally, the amendment requires enhanced disclosures about an enterprise's involvement with VIEs and any significant change in risk exposure due to that involvement, as well as how its
involvement with VIEs impacts the enterprise's financial statements. Finally, an enterprise will be required to disclose significant judgments and assumptions used to determine whether or not to
consolidate a VIE. This amendment is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2009. Management is in the process of determining the impact of
adopting this amendment.

15.    Subsequent Events

We entered into a definitive agreement in December 2009 to acquire all of the outlet shopping centers currently owned by Prime Outlets Acquisition Company and certain of its
affiliated
entities, or the Prime Outlets, subject to Prime Outlets' existing fixed rate indebtedness and preferred stock. The Prime Outlets consist of 22 outlet centers located in major metropolitan
markets. We will pay consideration (consisting of cash and units of the Operating Partnership) of approximately $0.7 billion for the owners' interests in the Prime Outlets. The acquisition is
subject to several closing conditions relating to certain financing arrangements of the Prime Outlets. Assuming all closing conditions are satisfied on a timely basis, we expect the transaction will
close in the second quarter of 2010.

On
January 12, 2010, the Operating Partnership commenced a cash tender offer for any and all senior unsecured notes of ten outstanding series with maturity dates ranging from
2011 to March 2013. The total principal amount of the notes accepted for purchase on January 26, 2010 was approximately $2.3 billion, with a weighted average duration of 2.0 years
and a weighted coupon of 5.76%. The Operating Partnership purchased the tendered notes with cash on hand and the proceeds from an offering of $2.25 billion of senior unsecured notes that closed
on January 25, 2010. The senior notes offering was comprised of $400.0 million of 4.20% notes due 2015, $1.25 billion of

notes due 2020 and $600.0 million of 6.75% notes due 2040. We will report a $165.6 million charge to earnings in the first quarter of 2010 as a result of the tender offer.

On
February 4, 2010, we and our partner in Simon Ivanhoe, Ivanhoe Cambridge Inc., or Ivanhoe Cambridge, entered into a definitive agreement to sell all of the interests in Simon
Ivanhoe which owns seven shopping centers located in France and Poland to Unibail-Rodamco. The joint venture partners will receive consideration of €715 million for the
interests, subject to certain post-closing adjustments. We expect our share of the gain on sale of our interests in Simon Ivanhoe to be approximately $300 million. The transaction
is scheduled to close during the first half of 2010, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals.

On
February 16, 2010, we announced that we had made a written offer in early February to acquire General Growth Properties, Inc. (or General Growth) in a transaction valued at more than
$10 billion, including approximately $9 billion in cash. Of this consideration, approximately $7 billion will be paid to unsecured creditors, representing par value plus accrued and unpaid dividends
and interest. The transaction would not be subject to a financing condition and would be financed through cash on hand, asset sales and through equity co-investments in acquired properties by
strategic institutional investors, with the balance coming from our existing credit facility. We indicated our willingness to discuss consideration consisting in whole or in part of our common equity
in lieu of the cash portion of the consideration to General Growth's stockholders, and perhaps certain of its unsecured creditors, for those who would prefer to receive equity. The offer is subject to
confirmatory due diligence and the negotiation and execution of a definitive transaction agreement, as well as required bankruptcy court and creditor approvals. As of the filing of this report, no
transaction has occurred.
