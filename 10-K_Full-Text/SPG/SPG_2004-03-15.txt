Item 1. Business

Background

Simon Property Group, Inc. ("Simon Property") is a Delaware corporation that operates as a self-administered and self-managed real
estate investment trust ("REIT"). Simon Property Group, L.P. (the "Operating Partnership") is a majority-owned partnership subsidiary of Simon Property that owns all but one of our real estate
properties. In this report, the terms "we", "us" and "our" refer to Simon Property, the Operating Partnership and their subsidiaries.

We
are engaged primarily in the ownership, operation, leasing, management, acquisition, expansion and development of real estate properties. Our real estate properties consist primarily
of regional malls and community shopping centers. As of December 31, 2003, we owned or held an interest in 246 income-producing properties in North America, which consisted of 175 regional
malls, 67 community shopping centers, and four office and mixed-use properties in 37 states and Canada (collectively, the "Properties", and individually, a "Property").
Mixed-use properties are properties that include a combination of retail space, office space, and/or hotel components. In addition, we also own interests in three parcels of land held for
future development (together with the Properties, the "Portfolio"). Finally, we have ownership interests in 47 assets in Europe (France, Italy, Poland and Portugal).

Mergers and Acquisitions

Mergers and acquisitions have been a significant component of the growth and development of our business. In 2003, we completed a series of acquisitions that
added to our overall portfolio:

•

On
March 14, 2003, we purchased the remaining minority interest in The Forum Shops at Caesars in Las Vegas, NV for $174.0 million in cash and assumed our
$74.2 million share of debt from the minority limited partner.

•

On
August 20, 2003, we purchased a 100% leasehold stake in Stanford Shopping Center in Palo Alto, California from Stanford University for $333.0 million.
Stanford University holds, as lessor, a long-term ground lease underlying the asset.

•

In
the fourth quarter 2003, through a series of transactions, we increased our ownership interest in Kravco Investments L.P., a Philadelphia, PA based owner of regional
malls, and acquired additional interests in Kravco's affiliated management company, for approximately $293 million. The portfolio consists of six regional malls, five of which are in the
Philadelphia metropolitan area, and four community centers.

•

Finally,
in December 2003, we increased our presence in Europe through the formation of Gallerie Commerciali Italia S.p.A ("GCI") with The Rinascente Group, an
Italian retailer company. The Rinascente Group contributed 38 shopping centers as well as development opportunities to GCI and then sold 49% of GCI to one of our affiliates. The initial gross value of
GCI was approximately €860 million or over $1.0 billion and our initial equity investment was approximately €187 million, or $232 million.

On
October 8, 2003, we and Westfield America, Inc. ("Westfield"), the U.S. subsidiary of Westfield America Trust, withdrew our tender offer for all of the outstanding
common shares of Taubman Centers, Inc. The withdrawal of the tender offer followed the enactment of a law amending the Michigan Control Share Acquisitions Act and which allowed the Taubman
family group to effectively block our ability to conclude the tender offer. As a result we expensed deferred acquisition costs of $10.6 million, net, related to this acquisition during 2003.

Structural Simplification

On January 1, 2003, the Operating Partnership acquired all of the remaining equity interests of M.S. Management Associates, Inc. (the "Management
Company"). The interests acquired consist of 95% of the voting common stock and 1.25% of the non-voting stock of the Management Company and approximately 2% of the economic interests of
the Management Company. The interests were acquired from Melvin Simon, Herbert Simon, and David Simon (the "Simons"), for a total purchase price of $425,000, which was equal to the appraised value of
the interests as determined by an independent third party. The acquisition was unanimously approved by our independent directors. As a result, the Management Company is now a wholly owned consolidated
taxable REIT subsidiary ("TRS") of the Operating Partnership.


Dispositions

As part of our strategic plan to own quality retail real estate, we continually evaluate our properties and sell those which no longer meet our strategic
criteria. We may use the capital generated from these dispositions to invest in higher-quality, higher-growth properties. We believe that the sale of these non-core Properties will not
have a material impact on our future results of operations or cash flows nor will their sale materially affect our ongoing operations. In addition, we expect any earnings dilution from the sales on
our results of operations from these dispositions will be offset by the positive impact of our acquisitions and development and redevelopment activities.

During
2003, we sold 13 non-core Properties, consisting of seven regional malls, five community centers and one mixed-use property. The Properties and their
dates of sale were:

•

Richmond Square, Mounds Mall, Mounds Mall

•

Eastern Hills Mall on July 1, 2003

Cinema and Memorial Mall on January 9, 2003

•

New Orleans Center on October 1, 2003

•

Forest Village Park Mall on April 29, 2003

•

Mainland Crossing on October 28, 2003

•

North Riverside Park Plaza on May 8, 2003

•

SouthPark Mall on November 3, 2003

•

Memorial Plaza on May 21, 2003

•

Bergen Mall on December 12, 2003

•

Fox River Plaza on May 22, 2003

Operating Policies and Strategies

The following is a discussion of our investment policies, financing policies, conflict of interest policies and policies with respect to certain
other activities. Our Board of Directors may amend or rescind these policies from time to time at its discretion without a stockholder vote.

Investment Policies

We conduct our investment activities, except for one Property that we own directly, through the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries. Our primary business
objectives are to increase Funds From Operations ("FFO") per share, operating results and the value of our Properties while maintaining a stable balance sheet consistent with our financing policies.
We intend to achieve these objectives by:

•

pursuing
a leasing strategy that capitalizes on the desirable location of our Properties;

•

improving
the performance of our Properties by using the economies of scale that result from our size to help control operating costs and by generating additional revenues
through merchandising, marketing and promotional activities;

•

renovating
and/or expanding our Properties where appropriate;

•

developing
new shopping centers which meet our economic criteria; and

•

acquiring
additional shopping centers and the portfolios of other retail real estate companies that meet our investment criteria.

We
cannot assure you, however, that we will achieve our business objectives.

We
develop and acquire properties to generate both current income and long-term appreciation in value. We do not have a policy limiting the amount or percentage of assets
that may be invested in any particular property or type of property or in any geographic area. We may purchase or lease properties for long-term investment or develop, redevelop, and/or
sell our Properties, in whole or in part, when circumstances warrant. We participate with other entities in property ownership, through joint ventures or other types of co-ownership. These
equity investments may be subject to existing mortgage financing and other indebtedness that have priority over our equity interest.

While
we emphasize equity real estate investments, we may, in our discretion, invest in mortgages and other real estate interests consistent with our qualification as a REIT under the
Internal Revenue Code ("Code"). Mortgages in which we invest may or may not be insured by a governmental agency. We do not intend to invest to a significant extent in mortgages or deeds of trust,
however, we hold an interest in one Property through a mortgage note which results in us receiving 100% of the economics of the Property. We may invest in participating or convertible mortgages,
however, if we conclude that we may benefit from the cash flow or any appreciation in the value of the property.


We
may also invest in securities of other entities engaged in real estate activities or securities of other issuers. However, any of these investments would be subject to the percentage
ownership limitations and gross income tests necessary for REIT qualification under the Code. These REIT limitations mean that we cannot make an investment that would cause our real estate assets to
be less than 75% of our total assets. In addition, we must derive at least 75% of our gross income from "rents from real estate" and at least 95% must be derived from rents from real estate, interest,
dividends and gains from the sale or disposition of stock or securities.

Subject
to these REIT limitations, we may invest in the securities of other issuers in connection with acquisitions of indirect interests in real estate. Such an investment would
normally be in the form of general or limited partnership or membership interests in special purpose partnerships and limited liability companies that own one or more properties. We may, in the
future, acquire all or substantially all of the securities or assets of other REITs, management companies or similar entities where such investments would be consistent with our investment policies.
We do not intend to invest in securities of other issuers for the purpose of exercising control other than the Operating Partnership and certain wholly-owned subsidiaries and to acquire interests in
real estate. We do not intend that our investments in securities will require us to register as an "investment company" under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. We intend to divest securities before any such registration would be required.

Financing Policies

We must comply with the covenant restrictions of debt agreements of the Operating Partnership that limit our ratio of debt to total market valuation. For example,
the Operating Partnership's lines of credit and the indentures for the Operating Partnership's debt securities contain covenants that restrict the total amount of debt of the Operating Partnership to
60% of adjusted total assets, as defined, and secured debt to 55% of adjusted total assets. In addition, these agreements contain other covenants requiring compliance with financial ratios.
Furthermore, the amount of debt that we may incur is limited as a practical matter by our desire to maintain acceptable ratings for our equity securities and the debt securities of the Operating
Partnership.

If
the Board of Directors determines to seek additional capital, we may raise such capital through additional equity offerings, debt financing, creation of joint ventures with existing
ownership interests in Properties, retention of cash flows or a combination of these methods. Our ability to retain cash flows is subject to Internal Revenue Code provisions requiring REITs to
distribute a certain percentage of their taxable income. We must also take into account taxes that would be imposed on undistributed taxable income. If the Board of Directors determines to raise
additional equity capital, it may, without stockholder approval, issue additional shares of common stock or other capital stock. The Board of Directors may issue a number of shares up to the amount of
our authorized capital in any manner and on such terms and for such consideration as it deems appropriate. This may include issuing stock in exchange for property. Such securities may be senior to the
outstanding classes of common stock. Such securities also may include additional classes of preferred stock which may be convertible into common stock. Existing stockholders will have no preemptive
right to purchase shares in any subsequent offering of our securities. Any such offering could dilute a stockholder's investment in us.

We
anticipate that any additional borrowings would be made through the Operating Partnership or its subsidiaries. We might, however, incur borrowings that would be reloaned to the
Operating Partnership. Borrowings may be in the form of bank borrowings, publicly and privately placed debt instruments, or purchase money obligations to the sellers of properties. Any of such
indebtedness may be unsecured or may be secured by any or all of our assets, the Operating Partnership or any existing or new property-owning partnership. Any such indebtedness may also have full or
limited recourse to all or any portion of the assets of any of the foregoing. Although we may borrow to fund the payment of dividends, we currently have no expectation that we will regularly be
required to do so.


We
may obtain unsecured or secured lines of credit. We also may determine to issue debt securities. Any such debt securities may be convertible into capital stock or be accompanied by
warrants to purchase capital stock. We also may sell or securitize our lease receivables. The proceeds from any borrowings or financings may be used for the following:

•

financing
acquisitions;

•

developing
or redeveloping properties;

•

refinancing
existing indebtedness;

•

working
capital or capital improvements; or

•

meeting
the income distribution requirements applicable to REITs if we have income without the receipt of cash sufficient to enable us to meet such distribution
requirements.

We
also may determine to finance acquisitions through the following:

•

issuance
of additional units of limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership;

•

issuance
of shares of common stock;

•

sale
or exchange of ownership interests in Properties;

•

issuance
of shares of preferred stock;

•

issuance
of preferred units of the Operating Partnership; or

•

issuance
of other securities.

The
ability to offer units of limited partnership interest to transferors may result in beneficial tax treatment for the transferors. This is because the exchange of units for
properties may defer the recognition of gain for tax purposes
by the transferor. It may also be an advantage for us since certain investors may be limited in the number of shares of our capital stock that they may purchase.

If
the Board of Directors determines to obtain additional debt financing, we intend to do so generally through mortgages on Properties, drawings against revolving lines of credit or
term loan facilities, or the issuance of unsecured debt through the Operating Partnership. We may do this directly or through an entity owned or controlled by us. The mortgages may be
non-recourse, recourse, or cross-collateralized. We do not have a policy limiting the number or amount of mortgages that may be placed on any particular property. Mortgage financing
instruments, however, usually limit additional indebtedness on such properties.

We
only invest in or form special purpose entities to obtain permanent financing for properties on attractive terms. Permanent financing for properties is typically structured as a
mortgage loan on one or a group of properties in favor of an institutional third party or as a joint venture with a third party or as a securitized financing. For securitized financings, we are
required to create special purpose entities to own the properties. These special purpose entities are structured so that they would not be consolidated with us in the event we would ever become
subject to a bankruptcy proceeding. We decide upon the structure of the financing based upon the best terms then available to us and whether the proposed financing is consistent with our other
business objectives. For accounting purposes, we include the outstanding securitized debt of special purpose entities owning consolidated properties as part of our consolidated indebtedness.

Conflict of Interest Policies

We maintain policies and have entered into agreements designed to reduce or eliminate potential conflicts of interest. In 2003, we adopted governance principles
governing our affairs and the Board of Directors, as well as written charters for each of the standing Committees of the Board of Directors. In addition, in 2003, the Board adopted a Code of Business
Conduct and Ethics which apply to all of our officers, directors, and employees. At least a majority of the members of our Board of Directors must qualify as independent under the listing standards
for New York Stock Exchange companies and cannot be affiliated with the Simon and DeBartolo families. Any transaction between us and the Simons or the DeBartolos, including property acquisitions,
service and property management agreements and retail space leases, must be approved by a majority of non-affiliated directors.

The
sale by the Operating Partnership of any property that it owns may have an adverse tax impact on the Simons or the DeBartolos and the other limited partners of the Operating
Partnership. In order to avoid any conflict of interest between Simon Property and the limited partners of the Operating Partnership, our charter requires that at least six of our independent
directors must authorize and require the Operating Partnership to sell any property it owns. Any such sale is subject to applicable agreements with third parties. Noncompetition agreements executed by


each
of the Simons contain covenants limiting the ability of the Simons to participate in certain shopping center activities in North America.

Policies With Respect To Certain Other Activities

We do not intend to make investments other than as previously described. We intend to make investments which are consistent with the REIT requirements of the
Code, unless the Board of Directors determines that it is no longer in our best interests to qualify as a REIT. The Board of Directors may make such a determination because of changing circumstances
or changes in the REIT requirements. We have authority to offer shares of our capital stock or other securities in exchange for property. We also have authority to repurchase or otherwise reacquire
our shares or any other securities. We may engage in such activities in the future. We may in the future issue shares of our common stock to holders of units of limited partnership interest in the
Operating Partnership upon exercise of such holders' rights under the Operating Partnership agreement. We have not made loans to other entities or persons, including our officers and directors. It is
now our policy to not make any loans to our directors and executive officers for any purpose and all loans previously made to current executive officers have been repaid in full. We may in the future
make loans to the Management Company and to joint ventures in which we participate. We do not intend to engage in the following:

•

trading,
underwriting or agency distribution or sale of securities of other issuers; or

•

the
active trade of loans and investments.

Operating Strategies

We plan to achieve our primary business objectives through a variety of methods discussed below, although we cannot assure you that we will achieve such
objectives.

Leasing.

We pursue a leasing strategy that includes:

•

marketing
available space to maintain or increase occupancy levels;

•

renewing
existing leases and originating new leases at higher base rents per square foot;

•

negotiating
leases that allow us to recover from our tenants for the majority of our property operating, real estate tax, repairs and maintenance, and advertising and
promotion expenditures; and

•

executing
leases that provide for percentage or overage rents and/or regular or periodic fixed contractual increases in base rents.

Management.

We draw upon our expertise gained through management of a geographically diverse Portfolio,
nationally recognized
as comprising high quality retail and mixed-use Properties. In doing so, we seek to maximize cash flow through a combination of:

•

an
active merchandising program to maintain our shopping centers as inviting shopping destinations;

•

efforts
to minimize overhead and operating costs which not only benefits our operations but also reduces the costs reimbursed to us from our tenants. A tenant's ability to
pay rent is affected by the percentage of its sales represented by occupancy costs, which consist of rent and expense recoveries. As sales levels increase, if expenses subject to recovery are
controlled, the tenant can afford to pay higher base rent.

•

coordinated
marketing and promotional activities that establish and maintain customer loyalty; and

•

systematic
planning and monitoring of results.

We
believe that if we are successful in our efforts to increase sales while controlling operating expenses we will be able to continue to increase base rents at the Properties.

We
manage substantially all our Properties held as joint venture Properties and as a result we derive revenues from management fees and other fee revenues.

Other Revenues.

Due to our size, tenant and vendor relationships, we also generate revenues from other sources,
including:

•

Simon
Brand Venture ("Simon Brand") which obtains revenues from establishing our malls as leading market resource providers for retailers and other businesses and
consumer-focused corporate alliances. Simon Brand revenues include payment services, national media contracts, a national beverage contract and other contracts with national companies.


•

Simon
Brand also pursues mall marketing initiatives, including the sale of gift cards. We tested a Simon Visa Gift Card in some of our regional malls in the fall of 2001 and
completed the roll-out of our Simon Gift Card program to substantially all our regional malls during 2002 and 2003. The gift card program has replaced our existing paper certificates.

•

Simon
Business Network ("Simon Business") obtains revenues from offering products and property operating services, resulting from its relationships with vendors, to our
tenants and others. These services include such items as energy services, facility services, waste handling, vertical transportation, as well as major capital expenditures such as roofing, parking
lots and energy systems. The tenant services provided through Simon Business include a national waste management services program, a national total facility service program which includes operational
and maintenance services, a national automatic teller machine program, a national security services program, and parking service programs.

We
also generate other revenues through the sale of land adjacent to our Properties commonly referred to as "outlots" or "outparcels." We create value in these outparcels through the
operating performance of our Properties and replenish the inventory of these parcels by the development of new Properties and the redevelopment of existing or acquired Properties.

International Expansion.

Our investments in Europe are currently conducted through two joint ventures, GCI and
European Retail
Enterprises, B.V. ("ERE"). We do not derive any significant consolidated revenues from European activities since our investments are held through joint ventures and therefore are accounted for under
the equity method as defined by accounting policies generally accepted in the United States.

We
believe that the expertise we have gained through the development, leasing, management, and marketing of our domestic Properties can be utilized in retail properties abroad. We may
pursue additional international opportunities to enhance shareholder value under the right circumstances. There are risks inherent in international operations that may be beyond our control. These
include the following risks that may have a negative impact on our results of operations:

•

changes
in foreign currency exchange rates;

•

declines
in economic conditions abroad;

•

changes
in foreign political environments; and

•

changes
in foreign laws.

Competition

We consider our principal competitors to be seven other major United States or internationally publicly-held, companies that own or operate regional
malls in the United States. We also compete with many commercial developers, real estate companies and other owners of retail real estate that operate in our trade areas. Some of our Properties are of
the same type and are within the same market area as other competitive properties. The existence of competitive properties could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease space and on the
level of rents we can obtain. This results in competition for both the acquisition of prime sites (including land for development and operating properties) and for tenants to occupy the space that we
and our competitors develop and manage. In addition, our malls compete against non-physical based forms of retailing such as catalog companies and e-commerce websites that
offer similar retail products.

We
believe that our Portfolio is the largest, as measured by gross leasable area ("GLA"), of any publicly-traded retail REIT. In addition, we own more regional malls than any other
publicly-traded REIT. We believe that we have a competitive advantage in the retail real estate business as a result of:

•

the
size, quality and diversity of our Properties

•

our
management and operational expertise

•

our
extensive experience and relationships with retailers and lenders

•

our
mall marketing initiatives and consumer focused strategic corporate alliances including those developed by Simon Brand and Simon Business, and

•

our
ability to use our size to reduce the total occupancy cost of our tenants.

Our
size has allowed us to reduce dependence upon individual retail tenants. More than 3,800 different retailers occupy more than 20,800 stores in our Properties and no retail tenant
represents more than 4.6% of our Properties' total minimum rents.


Environmental Matters

General Compliance.

We believe that the Portfolio is in compliance, in all material respects, with all Federal,
state and
local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances. Nearly all of the Portfolio has been subjected to Phase I or similar environmental audits (which generally
involve only a review of records and visual inspection of the property without soil sampling or ground water analysis) by independent environmental consultants. Phase I environmental audits are
intended to discover information regarding, and to evaluate the environmental condition of, the surveyed properties and surrounding properties. These environmental audits have not revealed, nor are we
aware of, any environmental liability that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We cannot assure you that:

•

existing
environmental studies with respect to the Portfolio reveal all potential environmental liabilities;

•

any
previous owner, occupant or tenant of a Property did not create any material environmental condition not known to us;

•

the
current environmental condition of the Portfolio will not be affected by tenants and occupants, by the condition of nearby properties, or by other unrelated third
parties; or

•

future
uses or conditions (including, without limitation, changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations or the interpretation thereof) will not result in
environmental liabilities.

Asbestos-Containing Materials.

Asbestos-containing materials are present in most of the Properties, primarily in
the form of
vinyl asbestos tile, mastics and roofing materials, which we believe are generally in good condition. Fireproofing and insulation containing asbestos is also present in certain Properties in limited
concentrations or in limited areas. The presence of such asbestos-containing materials does not violate currently applicable laws. Generally, we remove asbestos-containing materials as required in the
ordinary course of any renovation, reconstruction, or expansion, and in connection with the retenanting of space.

Underground Storage Tanks.

Several of the Properties contain, or at one time contained, underground storage
tanks used to
store waste oils or other petroleum products primarily related to auto service center establishments or emergency electrical generation equipment. We believe that regulated tanks have been removed,
upgraded or abandoned in accordance with applicable environmental laws. Site assessments have revealed certain soil and groundwater contamination associated with such tanks at some of these
Properties. Subsurface investigations (Phase II assessments) and remediation activities are either completed, ongoing, or scheduled to be conducted at such Properties. The costs of remediation with
respect to such matters has not been material and we do not expect these costs will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

Properties to be Developed or Acquired.

Land held for mall development or that may be acquired for development
may contain
residues or debris associated with the use of the land by prior owners or third parties. In certain instances, such residues or debris could be or contain hazardous wastes or hazardous substances.
Prior to exercising any option to acquire properties, we typically conduct environmental due diligence consistent with acceptable industry standards.

Item 2. Properties

North American Properties

Our Properties primarily consist of regional malls and community shopping centers. Our Properties contain an aggregate of approximately 190.3 million
square feet of GLA, of which we own 108.4 million square feet ("Owned GLA"). Total estimated retail sales at the Properties in 2003 were approximately $40 billion.

Regional
malls generally contain two or more anchors and a wide variety of smaller stores ("Mall" stores) located in enclosed malls connecting the anchors. Additional stores
("Freestanding" stores) are usually located along the perimeter of the parking area. Our 175 regional malls range in size from approximately 200,000 to 2.9 million square feet of GLA, with all
but four regional malls over 400,000 square feet. Our regional malls contain in the aggregate more than 18,500 occupied stores, including over 700 anchors, which are mostly national retailers.

Community
shopping centers are generally unenclosed and smaller than regional malls. Our 67 community shopping centers generally range in size from approximately 50,000 to 950,000
square feet of GLA. Community shopping centers generally are of three types. First, we own "power centers" that are designed to serve a larger trade area and contain at least two anchors, and usually
as many as 5 to 7, that are usually national retailers among the leaders in their markets and occupy more than 70% of the GLA in the center. Second, we own traditional community centers that focus
primarily on value-oriented and convenience goods and services. These centers are usually anchored by a supermarket, discount retailer, or drugstore and are designed to service a neighborhood area.
Finally, we also own open air centers adjacent to our regional malls designed to take advantage of the drawing power of the mall.

We
also own lifestyle centers that are included in regional malls, community centers, and properties under development. These centers are typically open air centers and contain at least
50,000 square feet of GLA of specialty retail regional mall type tenants as well as restaurants.

We
also have interests in four office and mixed-use Properties. The four office and mixed-use Properties range in size from approximately 496,000 to 1,214,000
square feet of GLA.
Two of these Properties are regional malls with connected office buildings, and two are located in mixed-use developments and contain primarily office space.

As

was leased, and approximately 90.2% of Owned GLA in the community shopping centers was leased.

We
own 100% of 156 of our 246 Properties, control 14 Properties in which we have a joint venture interest, and hold the remaining 76 Properties through unconsolidated joint venture
interests. We are the managing or co-managing general partner or member of 235 of our Properties. Substantially all of our joint venture Properties are subject to rights of first refusal,
buy-sell provisions, or other sale rights for all partners which are customary in real estate partnership agreements and the industry. Our partners in our joint ventures may initiate these
provisions at any time, which will result in either the use of available cash or borrowings to acquire their partnership interest or the disposal of our partnership interest.

In
addition, we jointly hold with a third party an interest in one parcel of land for development near Paris, France outside of these two joint ventures. ERE also
operates through a wholly-owned subsidiary Groupe BEG, S.A. ("BEG"). ERE and BEG are fully integrated European retail real estate developers, lessors and managers.

Our
properties in Europe consist primarily of hypermarket anchored shopping centers. Substantially all of our European properties are anchored by either the hypermarket retailer Auchan,
primarily in Italy, who is affiliated with our partner in GCI, The Rinascente Group, or are anchored by the hypermarket Carrefour in France, Poland, and Portugal. Certain of these properties are
subject to leaseholds that entitle the lessor to receive substantially all the economic benefits of the portion of the property subject to the leasehold.

As
of December 31, 2003, our European properties were approximately 99.3% occupied. These properties contain an aggregate of approximately 8.9 million square feet of GLA,
of which approximately 3.8 million square feet is Owned GLA.

Item 3.    Legal Proceedings

Triple Five of Minnesota, Inc., a Minnesota corporation, v. Melvin Simon, et. al.

On or about
November 9, 1999, Triple Five of Minnesota, Inc. commenced an action in the District Court for the State of Minnesota, Fourth Judicial District, against, among others, Mall of America,
certain members of the Simon family and entities allegedly controlled by such individuals, and us. The action was later removed to federal court. Two transactions form the basis of the complaint:
(i) the sale by Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America of one-half of its partnership interest in Mall of America Company and Minntertainment Company to the Operating
Partnership and related entities; and (ii) a financing transaction involving a loan in the amount of $312.0 million obtained from The Chase Manhattan Bank that is secured by a mortgage
placed on Mall of America's assets. The complaint, which contains twelve counts, seeks remedies of unspecified damages, rescission, constructive trust, accounting, and specific performance. Although
the complaint names all defendants in several counts, we are specifically identified as a defendant in connection with the sale by Teachers. On August 12, 2002, the court granted in part and
denied in part motions for partial summary judgment filed by the parties.

Trial
on all of the equitable claims in this matter began June 2, 2003. On September 10, 2003, the court issued its decision in a Memorandum and Order (the "Order"). In
the Order, the court found that certain entities and individuals, breached their fiduciary duties to Triple Five. The court did not award Triple Five damages but instead awarded Triple Five equitable
and other relief and imposed a constructive trust on that portion of the Mall of America owned by us. Specifically, as it relates to us, the court ordered that Triple Five was entitled to purchase
from us the one-half partnership interest that we purchased from Teachers in October 1999, provided Triple Five remits to us the sum of $81.38 million within nine months of
the Order. The court further held that we must disgorge all net profits that we received as a result of our ownership interest in the Mall from October 1999 to the present. The court has
appointed a Special Master to determine net profits. The court also held that the current day-to-day management of the Mall remains unchanged unless and until Triple Five
purchases our interest in the Mall.

We
disagree with many aspects of the Order and have appealed the Order to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. We are currently working with the Special Master
appointed by the court. It is not possible to provide an assurance of the ultimate outcome of the litigation.

As
a result of the Order, we recorded a $6.0 million loss that is included in "Gain (loss) on sales of assets and other, net" in the accompanying statements of operations and
comprehensive income, reflecting our estimate of the financial impact to us from complying with the Order and we have ceased recording any contribution to either net income or Funds from Operations
("FFO") from Mall of America.

We
are currently not subject to any other material litigation other than routine litigation, claims and administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. We believe
that such routine litigation, claims and administrative proceedings will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position or our results of operations.

Distributions

Simon Property qualifies as a REIT under the Code. To maintain our status as a REIT, we are required each year to distribute to our shareholders at least 90% of
our taxable income after certain adjustments. Future distributions are determined in the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on our actual cash flow, financial condition, capital
requirements, the annual REIT distribution requirements and such other factors as our Board of Directors deem relevant.

Simon

reinvesting cash dividends. Shares are acquired pursuant to the plan at a price equal to the prevailing market price of such shares, without payment of any brokerage commission or service charge.

Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities

We issued 3,328,540 shares of Series H Variable Rate Preferred Stock on December 15, 2003 to a single institutional investor for cash proceeds in

private transactions.
