Item 1. Business

Background

Simon Property Group, Inc. ("Simon Property") is a Delaware corporation that operates as a self-administered and self-managed real
estate investment trust ("REIT"). Simon Property Group, L.P. (the "Operating Partnership") is a majority-owned partnership subsidiary of Simon Property that owns all but one of our real estate
properties. In this report, the terms "we", "us" and "our" refer to Simon Property, the Operating Partnership and their subsidiaries.

We
are engaged primarily in the ownership, operation, leasing, management, acquisition, expansion and development of real estate properties. Our real estate properties consist primarily
of regional malls and community shopping centers. As of December 31, 2002, we owned or held an interest in 246 income-producing properties in the United States, which consisted of 173 regional
malls, 68 community shopping centers, and five office and mixed-use properties in 36 states (collectively, the "Properties", and individually, a "Property"). Mixed-use
properties are properties that include a combination of retail space, office space, and/or hotel components. We also own interests in four parcels of land held for future development (together with
the Properties, the "Portfolio"). In addition, we have ownership interests in other real estate assets and ownership interests in eight retail real estate properties operating in Europe and Canada.

We
believe that our Portfolio is the largest, as measured by gross leasable area ("GLA"), of any publicly-traded retail REIT. In addition, we own more regional malls than any other
publicly-traded REIT.

Mergers and Acquisitions

Mergers and acquisitions have been a significant component of the growth and development of our business. Beginning with the merger with DeBartolo Realty
Corporation in August of 1996, we have completed several mergers or acquisitions that have helped shape our current organization. These include the merger with Corporate Property
Investors, Inc., in 1998 and the acquisition of the assets of New England Development Company in 1999.

On
May 3, 2002, we purchased, jointly with Westfield America Trust and The Rouse Company, the partnership interests of Rodamco North America N.V. ("Rodamco") and its affiliates.
Our portion of the acquisition included the purchase of the remaining partnership interests in four of our existing joint venture Properties, partnership interests in nine additional Properties, and
other partnership interests and assets. The purchase price was €2.5 billion for the 45.1 million outstanding shares of Rodamco stock, or €55 per share,
and the assumption of certain Rodamco obligations. Our share of the total purchase price was approximately $1.6 billion, including €795.0 million or $720.7 million
to acquire Rodamco shares, the assumption of $579 million of debt and preferred units, and cash of $268.8 million to pay off our share of corporate level debt and unwind interest rate
swap agreements.

Tender Offer for Taubman Centers, Inc.

In October 2002, we sent letters to the Chief Executive Officer and the Board of Directors of Taubman Centers, Inc. ("Taubman Centers") expressing
our interest in pursuing a business combination with Taubman Centers and offering to acquire the company at $17.50 per share in cash. On December 5, 2002, Simon Property
Acquisitions, Inc. ("Simon Property Acquisitions"), our wholly owned subsidiary, commenced a tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Taubman Centers at a price of $18.00 per
share in cash. On January 15, 2003, Westfield America Inc., the U.S. subsidiary of Westfield America Trust, joined our tender offer and we jointly increased the offer price to $20.00 per share
in cash. The Board of Directors of Taubman Centers has recommended that Taubman Centers' shareholders not tender their shares into the tender offer, despite the fact that the current $20.00 per share
offer price represents a premium of approximately 50% over the price of Taubman Centers shares on the date we made our first written proposal and is above the highest level that Taubman Centers shares
have ever traded. Complete terms and conditions of the tender offer are set forth in the Offer to Purchase, the Supplement thereto and the related revised Letter of Transmittal, each of which has been
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") as an exhibit to our Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO.

On
December 5, 2002, we also filed preliminary proxy materials with the Commission relating to a potential meeting of shareholders of Taubman Centers. The purpose of the meeting
would be to allow the shareholders of Taubman Centers to approve, pursuant to Chapter 7B of the Michigan Business Corporation Act, voting rights for


shares that we anticipate acquiring in the tender offer. On December 11, 2002, Taubman Centers filed a Schedule 14D-9 in which it disclosed that it had amended its by-laws on
December 10, 2002 to opt out of Section 7B of the Michigan Business Corporation Act. We currently do not plan on requesting this meeting of shareholders of Taubman Centers as contemplated by
this preliminary proxy statement unless Taubman Centers again becomes subject to Section 7B of the Michigan Business Corporation Act.

On
December 11, 2002, Taubman Centers filed a Schedule 14D-9 with the Commission recommending that Taubman Centers' common shareholders reject our tender offer.

On
December 16, 2002, we filed separate preliminary proxy materials with the Commission requesting agent designations from the holders of outstanding voting securities of Taubman
Centers in order to permit us to call a special meeting of Taubman Centers' shareholders. The purpose of the special meeting would be to permit the holders of these voting securities to vote on the
removal of certain impediments to our tender offer, including the applicability of the "excess share" provisions contained in Taubman Centers' articles of incorporation. On February 21, 2003,
we filed an amendment to these preliminary proxy materials, which includes updated information regarding our tender offer and litigation.

On
January 15, 2003, Westfield America Inc., the U.S. subsidiary of Westfield America Trust, joined our tender offer pursuant to the terms of an Offer Agreement and we jointly
increased the offer price to $20.00 per share net to the seller in cash and extended the expiration date of the tender offer to February 14, 2003.

On
January 21, 2003, Taubman Centers filed an amendment to its Schedule 14D-9 with the Commission recommending that Taubman Centers' common shareholders reject our amended
tender offer.

On
January 22, 2003, the Court issued an opinion and order denying in part, and granting in part, Taubman Centers' and the other defendants' motion to dismiss Count I of
our complaint, as amended. The Court held that while the

issuance

in 1998 of the Series B Preferred Stock by Taubman Centers to the Taubman family
did not violate Michigan law, the Taubman family's purported blocking position in Taubman Centers may be challenged by us. We have filed a motion for preliminary injunction and the Court has scheduled
a hearing for March 21, 2003. At that hearing, we intend to argue that, among other things, the Taubman family's "group" voting power was obtained in violation of Michigan law, that the Taubman
family's Series B Preferred Stock was improperly acquired in breach of fiduciary duties owed to Taubman Centers' public shareholders and that the Taubman Centers' Board of Directors has
breached, and is continuing to breach, its fiduciary duties to the Taubman Centers' public shareholders. Both parties have filed legal briefs on their issues. If the Court rules in our favor at
the March 21, 2003 hearing, the entire voting position the Taubman family purports to wield is subject to being legally invalidated.

On
February 17, 2003, we announced, jointly with Westfield America Inc., that as of February 14, 2003, 44,135,107 common shares, or approximately 85% of the outstanding
common shares, of Taubman Centers had been tendered into our offer and that the expiration date of the tender offer was extended to March 28, 2003.

On
March 4, 2003, Taubman Centers' Board of Directors sent a letter to David Simon, our Chief Executive Officer, and Peter Lowy, the Chief Executive Officer of Westfield
America, Inc., in which they reiterated their unanimous rejection of our tender offer as not in the best interests of Taubman Centers' shareholders.

Structural Simplification

Effective December 31, 2002, SPG Realty Consultants, Inc. ("SPG Realty") was merged into Simon Property, ending the "paired share" REIT structure
resulting from our combination with Corporate Property Investors, Inc. All of the outstanding stock of SPG Realty was previously held in trust for the benefit of the holders of common stock of
Simon Property. As a result of the merger, our stockholders who were previously the beneficial owners of the SPG Realty stock are now, by virtue of their ownership of our common stock, the owners of
the assets and operations formerly owned or conducted by SPG Realty. SPG Realty Consultants, L.P., the former majority-owned subsidiary partnership of SPG Realty, is now a subsidiary partnership of
Simon Property.

M.S.
Management Associates, Inc. (the "Management Company") provides leasing, management and development services as well as project management, accounting, legal, marketing and
management information systems services to most of the Properties. In addition, insurance subsidiaries of the Management Company reinsure the self-insured retention portion of our general
liability and workers' compensation programs. Third party providers provide coverage above the insurance subsidiaries' limits.


On
January 1, 2003, the Operating Partnership acquired all of the remaining equity interests of the Management Company. The interests acquired consist of 95% of the voting common
stock and 1.25% of the non-voting common stock of the Management Company and approximately 2% of the economic interests of the Management Company. The interests were acquired from Melvin Simon,
Herbert Simon and David Simon (the "Simons"), for a total purchase price of $425,000, which was equal to the appraised value of the interests as determined by an independent third party. The
acquisition was unanimously approved by our independent directors. As a result, the Management Company is now a wholly owned consolidated taxable REIT subsidiary ("TRS") of the Operating Partnership.

Dispositions

As part of our strategic plan to own quality retail real estate, we continue to pursue the sale, under the right circumstances, of Properties that no longer meet
our strategic criteria. We believe that the sale of these non-core Properties will not have a material impact on our future results of operations or cash flows nor will their sale
materially affect our ongoing operations.

During
2002, we sold our interests in 15 of the 252 Properties we owned as of December 31, 2001 summarized as follows:

•

We
sold our interest in Orlando Premium Outlets.

•

We
sold our interests in five Mills Properties.

•

We
disposed of seven of our nine assets held for sale as of December 31, 2001 and two other non-core Properties.

In
addition, in January 2003, we continued our disposition activities with the sale of a portfolio of four non-core Properties. We believe that any earnings dilution
on our results of operations from these dispositions will be more than offset by the positive impact of the Rodamco acquisition.

Operating Policies and Strategies

The following is a discussion of our investment policies, financing policies, conflicts of interest policies and policies with respect to certain other
activities. Our Board of Directors may amend or rescind these policies from time to time at its discretion without a stockholder vote.

Investment Policies

We conduct all of our investment activities, except for one Property that we own directly, through the Operating Partnership and will continue to do so for as
long as the Operating Partnership exists. Our primary business objectives are to increase Funds From Operations ("FFO") per share and the value of our Properties and operations while maintaining a
stable balance sheet consistent with our financing policies. We intend to achieve these objectives by:

•

pursuing
a leasing strategy that takes advantage of the unique nature of many of our Properties;

•

continuing
to improve the performance of our Properties through management techniques such as using economies of our scale to help control operating costs
and generating additional revenues through merchandising, marketing and promotional activities;

•

renovating
and/or expanding our Properties where appropriate;

•

developing
new shopping centers when such development meets our economic criteria; and

•

acquiring
additional shopping centers and the portfolios of other retail real estate companies that meet our investment criteria.

We
cannot assure you, however, that we will achieve our business objectives.

It
is our policy to develop and acquire properties to generate both current income and long-term appreciation in value. We do not have a policy limiting the amount or
percentage of assets that may be invested in any particular property or
type of property or in any geographic area. We may purchase or lease properties for long-term investment or develop, redevelop, and/or sell our Properties, in whole or in part, when
circumstances warrant. We currently participate and may continue to participate with other entities in property ownership, through joint ventures or other types of co-ownership. These
equity investments may be subject to existing mortgage financing and other indebtedness that have priority over our equity interest.


While
we emphasize equity real estate investments, we may, in our discretion, invest in mortgages and other real estate interests consistent with our qualification as a REIT. Mortgages
in which we invest may or may not be insured by a governmental agency. We do not intend to invest to a significant extent in mortgages or deeds of trust. We may invest in participating or convertible
mortgages, however, if we conclude that we may benefit from the cash flow or any appreciation in the value of the property.

We
may also invest in securities of other entities engaged in real estate activities or securities of other issuers. However, any such investments would be subject to the percentage
ownership limitations and gross income tests necessary for REIT qualification under the Internal Revenue Code. The REIT limitations mean that we cannot make an investment that would cause our real
estate assets to be less than 75% of our total assets. In addition, we must derive at least 75% of our gross income from "rents from real estate" and at least 95% must be derived from rents from real
estate, interest, dividends and gains from the sales or disposition of stock or securities.

Subject
to these REIT limitations, we may invest in the securities of other issuers in connection with acquisitions of indirect interests in real estate. Such an investment would
normally be in the form of general or limited partnership interests in special purpose partnerships that own one or more properties. We may, in the future, acquire all or substantially all of the
securities or assets of other REITs, management companies or similar entities where such investments would be consistent with our investment policies. We do not intend to invest in securities of other
issuers for the purpose of exercising control other than the Operating Partnership and certain wholly-owned subsidiaries and to acquire interests in real estate. We do not intend that our investments
in securities will require us to register as an "investment company" under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. We intend to divest securities before any such registration would be
required.

Financing Policies

We finance our business to maintain compliance with the covenant restrictions of certain agreements relating to the indebtedness of the Operating Partnership that
limit our ratio of debt to total market capitalization. For example, the agreements relating to the Operating Partnership's lines of credit and the indentures for the Operating Partnership's debt
securities contain convenants that restrict the total amount of debt of the Operating Partnership to 60% of adjusted total assets and secured debt to 55% of adjusted total assets. In addition, these
agreements contain covenants requiring compliance with financial ratios. Furthermore, the amount of debt that we may incur is limited as a practical matter by our desire to maintain acceptable ratings
for our securities and the debt securities of the Operating Partnership.

If
the Board of Directors determines to seek additional capital, we may raise such capital through additional equity offerings, debt financing, creation of joint ventures with existing
ownership interests in Properties, retention of cash
flows or a combination of these methods. Our ability to retain cash flows is subject to Internal Revenue Code provisions requiring REITs to distribute a certain percentage of taxable income. We must
also take into account taxes that would be imposed on undistributed taxable income. If the Board of Directors determines to raise additional equity capital, it may, without stockholder approval, issue
additional shares of common stock or other capital stock. The Board of Directors may issue a number of shares up to the amount of our authorized capital in any manner and on such terms and for such
consideration as it deems appropriate. This may include issuing stock in exchange for property. Such securities may be senior to the outstanding classes of common stock. Such securities also may
include additional classes of preferred stock which may be convertible into common stock. Existing stockholders will have no preemptive right to purchase shares in any subsequent offering of our
securities. Any such offering could cause a dilution of a stockholder's investment in us.

We
anticipate that any additional borrowings would be made through the Operating Partnership. We might, however, incur borrowings that would be reloaned to the Operating Partnership.
Borrowings may be in the form of bank borrowings, publicly and privately placed debt instruments, or purchase money obligations to the sellers of properties. Any of such indebtedness may be unsecured
or may be secured by any or all of our assets, the Operating Partnership or any existing or new property-owning partnership. Any such indebtedness may also have full or limited recourse to all or any
portion of the assets of any of the foregoing. Although we may borrow to fund the payment of dividends, we currently have expectation that we will be regularly required to do so.


We
may seek to obtain unsecured or secured lines of credit. We also may determine to issue debt securities. Any such debt securities may be convertible into capital stock or be
accompanied by warrants to purchase capital stock. We also may sell or securitize our lease receivables. The proceeds from any borrowings may be used for the following:

•

financing
acquisitions;

•

developing
or redeveloping properties;

•

refinancing
existing indebtedness;

•

working
capital or capital improvements; or

•

meeting
the income distribution requirements applicable to REITs if we have income without the receipt of cash sufficient to enable us to meet such
distribution requirements.

We
also may determine to finance acquisitions through the following:

•

issuance
of additional units of limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership;

•

issuance
of shares of common stock;

•

sale
or exchange of ownership interests in Properties;

•

issuance
of shares of preferred stock; or

•

issuance
of other securities.

The
ability to offer units of limited partnership interest to transferors may result in beneficial tax treatment for the transferors. This is because the exchange of units for
properties may defer the recognition of gain for tax purposes by the transferor. It may also be an advantage for us since certain investors may be limited in the number of shares of our capital stock
that they may purchase.

If
the Board of Directors determines to obtain additional debt financing, we intend to do so generally through mortgages on Properties, drawings against revolving lines of credit, or
the issuance of unsecured debt. We may do this directly or through an entity owned or controlled by us. The mortgages may be non-recourse, recourse, or cross-collateralized. We do not have
a policy limiting the number or amount of mortgages that may be placed on any particular property. Mortgage financing instruments, however, usually limit additional indebtedness on such properties.

We
only invest in or form special purpose entities to obtain permanent financing for properties on attractive terms. Permanent financing for properties is typically structured as a
mortgage loan on one or a group of properties in favor of an institutional third party or as a joint venture with a third party or as a securitized financing. For securitized financings, we are
required to create special purpose entities to own the properties. These special purpose entities are structured so that they would not be consolidated with us in the event we would ever become
subject to a bankruptcy proceeding. We decide upon the structure of the financing based upon the best terms then available to us and whether the proposed financing is consistent with our other
business objectives. For accounting purposes, we include the outstanding securitized debt of special purpose entities owning consolidated properties as part of our consolidated indebtedness.

Conflicts of Interest Policies

We maintain policies and have entered into agreements designed to reduce or eliminate potential conflicts of interest. At least a majority of the members of our
Board of Directors must be independent directors. Any transaction between us and the Simons or the DeBartolos, including property acquisitions, service and property management agreements and retail
space leases, must be approved by a majority of our independent directors.

The
sale by the Operating Partnership of any property that it owns may have an adverse tax impact on the Simons or the DeBartolos and the other limited partners of the Operating
Partnership. In order to avoid any conflict of interest between Simon Property and the limited partners of the Operating Partnership, our charter requires that at least six of our independent
directors may authorize and require the Operating Partnership to sell any property it owns. Any such sale is subject to applicable agreements with third parties. Noncompetition agreements executed
by each of the Simons contain covenants limiting the ability of the Simons to participate in certain shopping center activities in North America.

Policies With Respect To Certain Other Activities

We do not intend to make investments other than as previously described. We intend to make investments in such a manner as to be consistent with the REIT
requirements of the Internal Revenue Code, unless the Board of


Directors determines that it is no longer in our best interests to qualify as a REIT. The Board of Directors may make such a determination because of changing circumstances or changes in the REIT
requirements. We have authority to offer shares of our capital stock or other securities in exchange for property. We also have authority to repurchase or otherwise reacquire our shares or any other
securities. We may engage in such activities in the future. We may in the future issue shares of our common stock to holders of units of limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership upon
exercise of such holders' rights under the Operating Partnership agreement. We have not made loans to other entities or persons, including our officers and directors, other than to the Management
Company and to officers to pay taxes on the vesting of restricted stock. However, it is now our policy to not make any loans to our directors and executive officers for any purpose and all loans
previously made to current executive officers have been repaid in full. We may in the future make loans to the Management Company and to joint ventures in which we participate. We do not intend to
engage in the following:

•

trading,
underwriting or agency distribution or sale of securities of other issuers; or

•

the
active trade of loans and investments.

Operating Strategies

We plan to achieve our primary business objectives through a variety of methods discussed below, although we cannot assure you that that we will achieve such
objectives.

Leasing.

We pursue a leasing strategy that includes:

•

marketing
available space to maintain or increase occupancy levels;

•

renewing
existing leases and originating new leases at higher base rents per square foot;

•

negotiating
leases that allow us to be reimbursed from our tenants for the majority of our property operating, real estate tax, repairs and maintenance, and
advertising and promotion expenditures, and

•

executing
leases that provide for percentage or overage rents and/or regular or periodic fixed contractual increases in base rents.

Management.

We draw upon our expertise gained through management of a geographically diverse Portfolio,
nationally recognized
as comprising high quality retail and mixed-use Properties. In doing so, we seek to maximize cash flow through a combination of:

•

an
active merchandising program to maintain our shopping centers as inviting shopping destinations;

•

efforts
to minimize overhead and operating costs which not only benefits our operations but also reduces the costs reimbursed to us from our tenants. A
tenant's ability to pay rent is affected by the percentage of its sales represented by occupancy costs, which consist of rent and expense recoveries. As sales levels increase, if expenses subject to
recovery are controlled, the tenant can afford to pay higher base rent.

•

coordinated
marketing and promotional activities that establish and maintain customer loyalty; and

•

systematic
planning and monitoring of results.

We
believe we are one of the lowest-cost providers of retail space, which has permitted the rents in both regional malls and community shopping centers to increase without
raising a tenant's total occupancy cost beyond its ability to pay. We also believe that if we are successful in our efforts to increase sales while controlling operating expenses we will be able to
continue to increase base rents at the Properties.

International Expansion.

We believe that the expertise we have gained through the development and management of
our domestic
Properties can be utilized in retail properties abroad. We intend to continue the pursuit of international opportunities on a selective basis to enhance shareholder value. There are risks inherent in
international operations that may be beyond our control. These include the following risks that may have a negative impact on our results of operations:

•

changes
in foreign currency exchange rates;

•

declines
in economic conditions abroad;

•

changes
in foreign political environments; and

•

changes
in foreign laws.


Other Revenues.

Due to our size and tenant relationships we also generate revenues from the following sources:

•

Simon
Brand Venture's ("Simon Brand") revenues are derived from establishing our malls as leading market resource providers for retailers and other
businesses and consumer-focused corporate alliances. Simon Brand types of revenue include payment services, national media contracts, a national beverage contract and other contracts with national
companies.

•

Simon
Brand also pursues mall marketing initiatives, including the sale of gift certificates and gift cards. We launched a Simon Visa Gift Card test at four
regional malls in the fall of 2001 and extended the program to 43 additional malls in August 2002. We plan to complete the rollout to other regional malls in 2003. The gift card program will
eventually replace our existing paper certificates.

•

Simon
Business Network ("Simon Business") offers a competitively valued, broad-based array of products and property operating services, resulting from its
relationships with vendors, to our tenants and others. The tenant services provided through Simon Business include a national waste management services program, a national total facility service
program which includes operational and maintenance services, a national automatic teller machine program, a national security services program, and parking service programs.

Competition

We consider our direct competitors to be seven other major publicly-held regional mall companies as well as the numerous other commercial developers,
real estate companies and other owners of retail real estate that compete with us in our trade areas. In addition, our Properties compete against non-physical based forms of retailing such as catalog
companies and e-commerce websites that offer similar retail products. Some of our Properties are of the same type and are within the same market area as other competitive properties. The existence of
competitive properties could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease space and on the level of rents we can obtain. This results in competition for both acquisition of prime sites
(including land for development and operating properties) and for tenants to occupy the space that we and our competitors develop and manage. We believe that we have a competitive advantage in the
retail real estate business as a result of:

•

the
size, quality and diversity of our Properties

•

our
management and operational expertise

•

our
use of innovative retailing concepts

•

our
extensive experience and relationships with retailers and lenders

•

our
mall marketing initiatives and consumer focused strategic corporate alliances, and

•

our
ability to use our size to reduce the total occupancy cost of our tenants.

Environmental Matters

General Compliance.

We believe that the Portfolio is in compliance, in all material respects, with all Federal,
state and
local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances. Nearly all of the Portfolio has been subjected to Phase I or similar environmental audits (which generally
involve only a review of records and visual inspection of the property without soil sampling or ground water analysis) by independent environmental consultants. Phase I environmental audits are
intended to discover information regarding, and to evaluate the environmental condition of, the surveyed properties and surrounding properties. These environmental audits have not revealed, nor are we
aware of, any environmental liability that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We cannot assure you that:

•

existing
environmental studies with respect to the Portfolio reveal all potential environmental liabilities;

•

any
previous owner, occupant or tenant of a Property created any material environmental condition not known to us;

•

the
current environmental condition of the Portfolio will not be affected by tenants and occupants, by the condition of nearby properties, or by unrelated
third parties; or

•

future
uses or condition (including, without limitation, changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations or the interpretation thereof) will not
result in environmental liabilities.

Asbestos-Containing Materials.

Asbestos-containing materials are present in most of the Properties, primarily in
the form of
vinyl asbestos tile, mastics and roofing materials, which we believe are generally in good condition. Fireproofing and insulation containing asbestos is also present in certain Properties in limited
concentrations or in


limited areas. The presence of such asbestos-containing materials does not violate currently applicable laws. Generally, we remove asbestos-containing materials as required in the ordinary course of
any renovation, reconstruction, or expansion, and in connection with the retenanting of space.

Underground Storage Tanks.

Several of the Properties contain, or at one time contained, underground storage
tanks used to
store waste oils or other petroleum products primarily related to auto services center establishments or emergency electrical generation equipment. We believe that regulated tanks have been removed,
upgraded or abandoned in place in accordance with applicable environmental laws. Site assessments have revealed certain soil and groundwater contamination associated with such tanks at some of these
Properties. Subsurface investigations (Phase II assessments) and remediation activities are either completed, ongoing, or scheduled to be conducted at such Properties. The cost of remediation with
respect to such matters has not been material and we do not expect these costs will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

Properties to be Developed or Acquired.

Land held for mall development or that may be acquired for development
may contain
residues or debris associated with the use of the land by prior owners or third parties. In certain instances, such residues or debris could be or contain hazardous wastes or hazardous substances.
Prior to exercising any option to acquire properties, we typically conduct environmental due diligence consistent with acceptable industry standards.

Item 2. Properties

Properties

Our Properties primarily consist of regional malls and community shopping centers. Our Properties contain an aggregate of approximately 184.5 million
square feet of GLA, of which we own 105.9 million square feet ("Owned
GLA"). Our size has allowed us to eliminate significant dependence upon one retail tenant. More than 3,900 different retailers occupy more than 20,000 stores in our Properties and no retail tenant
represents more than 5.3% of our Properties' total minimum rents. Total estimated retail sales at the Properties in 2002 were approximately $40 billion.

Regional
malls generally contain two or more anchors and a wide variety of smaller stores ("Mall" stores) located in enclosed malls connecting the anchors. Additional stores
("Freestanding" stores) are usually located along the perimeter of the parking area. Our 173 regional malls range in size from approximately 200,000 to 2.8 million square feet of GLA, with all
but six regional malls over 400,000 square feet. Our regional malls contain in the aggregate more than 17,500 occupied stores, including over 650 anchors, which are mostly national retailers.

Community
shopping centers are generally unenclosed and smaller than regional malls. Our 68 community shopping centers generally range in size from approximately 50,000 to 600,000
square feet of GLA. Community shopping centers generally are of two types. First, we own traditional community centers that focus primarily on value-oriented and convenience goods and services. These
centers are usually anchored by a supermarket, drugstore or discount retailer and are designed to service a neighborhood area. Second, we own "power centers" that are designed to serve a larger trade
area and contain at least two anchors that are usually national retailers among the leaders in their markets and occupy more than 70% of the GLA in the center.

We
also have interests in five office and mixed-use Properties. The five office and mixed-use Properties range in size from approximately 496,000 to 1,214,000
square feet of GLA. Three of these Properties are regional malls with connected office buildings, and two are located in mixed-use developments and contain primarily office space.

As

was leased, and approximately 86.9% of Owned GLA in the community shopping centers was leased.

We
own 100% of 164 of our 246 Properties, control 14 Properties in which we have a joint venture interest, and hold the remaining 68 Properties through unconsolidated joint venture
interests. We are the managing or co-managing general partner or member of 237 of our Properties. Substantially all of our joint venture Properties are subject to rights of first refusal,
buy-sell provisions, or other sale rights for all partners which are customary in real estate partnership agreements and the industry. Our partner in our joint ventures may initiate these
provisions at any time, which will result in either the use of available cash or borrowings to acquire their partnership interest or the disposal of our partnership interest.

Item 3.    Legal Proceedings

Triple Five of Minnesota, Inc., a Minnesota corporation, v. Melvin Simon, et. al.

On or about
November 9, 1999, Triple Five of Minnesota, Inc. commenced an action in the District Court for the State of Minnesota, Fourth Judicial District, against, among others, Mall of America,
certain members of the Simon family and entities allegedly controlled by such individuals, and us. The action was later removed to federal court. Two transactions form the basis of the complaint:
(i) the sale by Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America of one-half of its partnership interest in Mall of America Company and Minntertainment Company to the Operating
Partnership and related entities; and (ii) a financing transaction involving a loan in the amount of $312.0 million obtained from The Chase Manhattan Bank that is secured by a mortgage
placed on Mall of America's assets. The complaint, which contains twelve counts, seeks remedies of unspecified damages, rescission, constructive trust, accounting, and specific performance. Although
the complaint names all defendants in several counts, we are specifically identified as a defendant only in connection with the sale to Teachers. Although the Complaint seeks unspecified damages,
Triple Five has submitted a report of a purported expert witness that attempts to quantify its damages at between approximately $80 million and $160 million. On August 12, 2002,
the court granted in part and denied in part motions for partial summary judgment filed by the parties. The parties are currently filing pretrial motions and no trial date has been set. Given that the
case is still in the pre-trial stage, it is not possible to provide an assurance of the ultimate outcome of the litigation or an estimate of the amount or range of potential loss, if any.
We believe that the Triple Five litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.

On
December 5, 2002, we commenced litigation in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan (the "Court") against Taubman Centers, its Board of
Directors and certain members of the Taubman family. In that action, we broadly allege that the Board of Directors has breached, and continues to breach, its fiduciary duties by failing to consider
our offer on the merits, and that the Taubman family should be prevented from voting its Series B Preferred Stock which we contend was wrongfully obtained by the Taubman family without a
shareholder vote and in violation of Michigan law. We filed a first amended complaint and a second amended complaint on December 30, 2002 and February 5, 2003, respectively. The initial
complaint and each amended complaint has been filed with the Commission as an exhibit to our Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO. On January 22, 2003, the Court issued an opinion and
order denying in part, and granting in part, Taubman Centers' and the other defendants' motion to dismiss Count I of our complaint, as amended. The Court held that while the

issuance

in 1998 of the
Series B Preferred Stock by Taubman Centers to the Taubman family did not violate Michigan law, the Taubman family's
purported blocking position in Taubman Centers may be challenged by us. We have filed a motion for preliminary injunction and the Court has scheduled a hearing for March 21, 2003. At that
hearing, we intend to argue that, among other things, the Taubman family's "group" voting power was obtained in violation of Michigan law, that the Taubman family's Series B Preferred Stock was
improperly acquired in breach of fiduciary duties owed to Taubman Centers' public shareholders and that the Taubman Centers' Board of Directors has breached, and is continuing to breach, its fiduciary
duties to the Taubman Centers' public shareholders. Both parties have filed legal briefs on their issues. If the Court rules in our favor at the March 21, 2003 hearing, the entire voting
position the Taubman family purports to wield is subject to being legally invalidated.

We
are also subject to routine litigation, claims and administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, none of which are expected to have a material adverse effect
on our financial position or results of operations.

There is no established public trading market for Simon Property's Class B common stock or Class C common stock. Distributions per
share of the Class B and Class C common stock are identical to the common stock.

Holders

The number of holders of record of common stock outstanding was 2,173 as of February 14, 2003. The Class B common stock is held entirely by a voting
trust to which Melvin Simon, Herbert Simon, David Simon and certain of their affiliates are parties and is exchangeable on a one-for-one basis into shares of common stock, and
the Class C common stock is held entirely by NID Corporation, the successor corporation of Edward J. DeBartolo Corporation, and is also exchangeable on a one-for-one
basis into shares of common stock.

Distributions

Simon Property qualifies as a REIT under the Code. To maintain our status as a REIT, we are required each year to distribute to our shareholders at least 90% of
our taxable income after certain adjustments. Future distributions are determined in the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on our actual cash flow, financial condition, capital
requirements, the annual REIT distribution requirements and such other factors as our Board of Directors deem relevant.

Simon
Property offers an Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan for its common shares that allows shareholders, at their election, to acquire additional shares by automatically
reinvesting cash dividends. Shares are acquired pursuant to the plan at a price equal to the prevailing market price of such shares, without payment of any brokerage commission or service charge.

Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities

We did not issue any equity securities that were not required to be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended during the fourth quarter of 2002.
