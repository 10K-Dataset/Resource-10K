Part I

Item 1.    Business

Simon Property Group, Inc. is a Delaware corporation that operates as a self-administered and
self-managed real estate investment trust, or REIT, under the Internal Revenue Code. Simon Property Group, L.P., or the Operating Partnership, is our majority-owned partnership
subsidiary that owns all of our real estate properties. In this report, the terms "we", "us" and "our" refer to Simon Property Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries.

We
own, develop and manage retail real estate properties, which consist primarily of regional malls, Premium Outlets®, The Mills®, and community/lifestyle
centers. As of December 31, 2010, we owned or held an interest in 338 income-producing properties in the United States, which consisted of 161 regional malls, 58 Premium Outlets, 66
community/lifestyle centers, 36 properties acquired in the 2007 acquisition of The Mills Corporation and 17 other shopping centers or outlet centers in 41 states and Puerto Rico. Of the
36 properties in The Mills portfolio, 16 of these properties are The Mills, 16 are regional malls, and four are community centers. Internationally, as of December 31, 2010, we had ownership
interests in 45 European shopping centers in Italy, eight Premium Outlets in Japan, one Premium Outlet in Mexico, and one Premium Outlet in South Korea. On July 15, 2010, we and
our joint venture partner sold our collective interests in Simon Ivanhoe S.à.r.l., or Simon Ivanhoe, which owned seven shopping centers located in France and Poland.

For
a description of our operational strategies and developments in our business during 2010, see the "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations" section of the 2010 Annual Report to Shareholders filed as Exhibit 13.1 to this Form 10-K.

Other Policies

The following is a discussion of our investment policies, financing policies, conflict of interest policies and policies with respect
to certain other activities. One or more of these policies may be amended or rescinded from time to time without a stockholder vote.

Investment Policies

While we emphasize equity real estate investments, we may invest in equity or debt securities of other entities engaged in real estate
activities or securities of other issuers. However, any of these investments would be subject to the percentage ownership limitations and gross income tests necessary for REIT qualification. These
REIT limitations mean that we cannot make an investment that would cause our real estate assets to be less than 75% of our total assets. In addition, at least 75% of our gross income must be derived
directly or indirectly from investments relating to real property or mortgages on real property, including "rents from real property," dividends from other REITs and, in certain circumstances,
interest from certain types of temporary investments. At least 95% of our income must be derived from such real property investments, and from dividends, interest and gains from the sale or
dispositions of stock or securities or from other combinations of the foregoing.

Subject
to REIT limitations, we may invest in the securities of other issuers in connection with acquisitions of indirect interests in real estate. Such an investment would normally be
in the form of general or limited partnership or membership interests in special purpose partnerships and limited liability companies that own one or more properties. We may, in the future, acquire
all or substantially all of the securities or assets of other REITs, management companies or similar entities where such investments would be consistent with our investment policies.

Financing Policies

We must comply with the covenants contained in our financing agreements that limit our ratio of debt to total assets or market value,
as defined. For example, the Operating Partnership's line of credit and the indentures for the Operating Partnership's debt securities contain covenants that restrict the total amount of debt of the
Operating Partnership to 65%, or 60% in relation to certain debt, of total assets, as defined under the related arrangement, and secured debt to 50% of total assets. In addition, these agreements
contain other covenants requiring compliance with financial ratios. Furthermore, the amount of debt that we may incur is limited as a practical matter by our desire to maintain acceptable ratings for
our equity securities and the debt securities of the Operating Partnership. We strive to maintain investment grade ratings at all times, but we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so.



If
our Board of Directors determines to seek additional capital, we may raise such capital by offering equity or debt securities, creating joint ventures with existing ownership
interests in properties, retaining cash flows or a combination of these methods. Our ability to retain cash flows is limited by the requirement for REITs to distribute at least 90% of their taxable
income. We must also take into account taxes that would be imposed on undistributed taxable income. If the Board of Directors determines to raise additional equity capital, it may, without stockholder
approval, issue additional shares of common stock or other capital stock. The Board of Directors may issue a number of shares up to the amount of our authorized capital in any manner and on such terms
and for such consideration as it deems appropriate. Such securities may be senior to the outstanding classes of common stock. Such securities also may include additional classes of preferred stock,
which may be convertible into common stock. Existing stockholders have no preemptive right to purchase shares in any subsequent offering of our securities. Any such offering could dilute a
stockholder's investment in us.

We
expect most future borrowings would be made through the Operating Partnership or its subsidiaries. We might, however, incur borrowings that would be reloaned to the Operating
Partnership. Borrowings may be in the form of bank borrowings, publicly and privately placed debt instruments, or purchase money obligations to the sellers of properties. Any such indebtedness may be
secured or unsecured. Any such indebtedness may also have full or limited recourse to the borrower or cross-collateralized with other debt, or may be fully or partially guaranteed by the Operating
Partnership. Although we may borrow to fund the payment of dividends, we currently have no expectation that we will regularly be required to do so.

The
Operating Partnership has a $3.9 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, or the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility has an accordion feature allowing the maximum
borrowing capacity to expand to $4.0 billion. We issue debt securities through the Operating Partnership, but we may issue our debt securities which may be convertible into capital stock or be
accompanied by warrants to purchase capital stock. We also may sell or securitize our lease receivables. The proceeds from any borrowings or financings may be used for one or more of the
following:

•

financing acquisitions;

•

developing or redeveloping properties;

•

refinancing existing indebtedness;

•

working capital or capital improvements; or

•

meeting the taxable income distribution requirements applicable to REITs, if we have taxable income without the receipt of
cash sufficient to enable us to meet such distribution requirements.

We
may also finance acquisitions through the following:

•

issuance of shares of common stock or preferred stock;

•

issuance of additional units of limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership, or units;

•

issuance of preferred units of the Operating Partnership;

•

issuance of other securities; or

•

sale or exchange of ownership interests in properties.

The
ability of the Operating Partnership to issue units to transferors of properties or other partnership interests may permit the transferor to defer gain recognition for tax purposes.
It may also be advantageous for us since there are ownership limits that restrict the number of shares of our capital stock that investors may own.

We
do not have a policy limiting the number or amount of mortgages that may be placed on any particular property. Mortgage financing instruments, however, usually limit additional
indebtedness on such properties. We also have covenants on our unsecured debt that limit our total secured debt.

Typically,
we invest in or form special purpose entities to assist us in obtaining permanent financing at attractive terms. Permanent financing may be structured as a mortgage loan on a
single property, or on a group of properties, and generally requires us to provide a mortgage interest on the property in favor of an institutional third party, as a joint venture with a third party,
or as a securitized financing. For securitized financings, we create special purpose entities to own the properties. These special purpose entities, which are common in the real estate industry, are
structured so that they would not be consolidated in a bankruptcy proceeding involving a parent company. We decide



upon
the structure of the financing based upon the best terms then available to us and whether the proposed financing is consistent with our other business objectives. For accounting purposes, we
include the outstanding securitized debt of special purpose entities owning consolidated properties as part of our consolidated indebtedness.

Conflict of Interest Policies

We maintain policies and have entered into agreements designed to reduce or eliminate potential conflicts of interest. We have adopted
governance principles governing the function, conduct, selection, orientation and duties of our Board of Directors and the Company, as well as written charters for each of the standing Committees of
the Board of Directors. In addition, we have a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which applies to all of our officers, directors, and employees. At least a majority of the members of our Board of
Directors must qualify as independent under the listing standards for New York Stock Exchange companies and cannot be affiliated with the Simon family who are significant stockholders and/or
unitholders in the Operating Partnership. Any transaction between us and the Simons, including property acquisitions, service and property management agreements and retail space leases, must be
approved by a majority of our non-affiliated directors.

The
sale by the Operating Partnership of any property that it owns may have an adverse tax impact on the Simons and/or other limited partners of the Operating Partnership. In order to
avoid any conflict of interest between Simon Property and the Simons, our charter requires that at least six of our independent directors must authorize and require the Operating Partnership to sell
any property it owns. Any such sale is subject to applicable agreements with third parties. Noncompetition agreements executed by each of the Simons contain covenants limiting the ability of the
Simons to participate in certain shopping center activities in North America.

Policies With Respect To Certain Other Activities

We intend to make investments which are consistent with our qualification as a REIT, unless the Board of Directors determines that it
is no longer in our best interests to so qualify as a REIT. The Board of Directors may make such a determination because of changing circumstances or changes in the REIT requirements. We have
authority to offer shares of our capital stock or other securities in exchange for property. We also have authority to repurchase or otherwise reacquire our shares or any other securities. We may
issue shares of our common stock, or cash at our option, to holders of units in future periods upon exercise of such holders' rights under the Operating Partnership agreement. Our policy prohibits us
from making any loans to our directors or executive officers for any purpose. We may make loans to the joint ventures in which we participate.

Competition

The retail industry is dynamic and competitive. We compete with numerous merchandise distribution channels including regional malls,
outlet centers, community/lifestyle centers, and other shopping centers in the United States and abroad. Internet retailing sites and catalogs also provide retailers with distribution options beyond
existing brick and mortar retail properties. The existence of competitive alternatives could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease space and on the level of rents we can obtain. This
results in competition for both the tenants to occupy the properties that we develop and manage as well as for the acquisition of prime sites (including land for development and operating properties).
We believe that there are numerous factors that make our properties highly desirable to retailers including:

•

the quality, location and diversity of our properties;

•

our management and operational expertise;

•

our extensive experience and relationships with retailers and lenders;

•

our mall marketing initiatives and consumer focused strategic corporate alliances; and

Item 1A.    Risk Factors

The following factors, among others, could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in
forward-looking statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and presented elsewhere by our management from time to time. These factors, among others, may have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows, and you should carefully consider them. It is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. You should
not consider this list to be a complete statement of all potential risks or uncertainties and we may update them in our future periodic reports.

Risks Relating to Debt and the Financial Markets

We have a substantial debt burden that could affect our future operations.

As of December 31, 2010, our consolidated mortgages and other indebtedness, excluding the related premium and discount, totaled
$17.5 billion. We are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow from operations will be insufficient to meet required debt service. Our
debt service costs generally will not be reduced if developments at the property, such as the entry of new competitors or the loss of major tenants, cause a reduction in the income from the property.
Should such events occur, our operations may be adversely affected. If a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and income from this is insufficient to pay that indebtedness, the
property could be foreclosed upon by the mortgagee resulting in a loss of income and a decline in our total asset value.

Disruption in the credit markets or downgrades in our credit ratings may adversely affect our ability to access external financings for our growth and ongoing debt service
requirements.

We depend primarily on external financings, principally debt financings, to fund the growth of our business and to ensure that we can
meet ongoing maturities of our outstanding debt. Our access to financing depends on our credit rating, the willingness of banks to lend to us and conditions in the capital markets. We cannot assure
you that we will be able to obtain the financing we need for future growth or to meet our debt service as obligations mature, or that the financing available to us will be on acceptable terms.

Adverse changes in our credit rating could affect our borrowing capacity and borrowing terms.

Our outstanding senior unsecured notes and preferred stock are periodically rated by nationally recognized credit rating agencies. The
credit ratings are based on our operating performance, liquidity and leverage ratios, overall financial position, and other factors viewed by the credit rating agencies as relevant to our industry and
the economic outlook in general. Our credit rating can affect the amount of capital we can access, as well as the terms of any financing we obtain. Since we depend primarily on debt financing to fund
our growth, adverse changes in our credit rating could have a negative effect on our future growth.

Our hedging interest rate protection arrangements may not effectively limit our interest rate risk.

We manage our exposure to interest rate risk by a combination of interest rate protection agreements to effectively fix or cap a
portion of our variable rate debt. In addition, we refinance fixed rate debt at times when we believe rates and terms are appropriate. Our efforts to manage these exposures may not be successful.

Our
use of interest rate hedging arrangements to manage risk associated with interest rate volatility may expose us to additional risks, including a risk that a counterparty to a
hedging arrangement may fail to honor its obligations. Developing an effective interest rate risk strategy is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest
rate fluctuations. There can be no assurance that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition. Termination of these hedging
agreements typically involves costs, such as transaction fees or breakage costs.

Factors Affecting Real Estate Investments and Operations

We face risks associated with the acquisition, development and expansion of properties.

We regularly acquire and develop new properties and expand and redevelop existing properties, and these activities are subject to
various risks. We may not be successful in pursuing acquisition, development or redevelopment/expansion opportunities. In addition, newly acquired, developed or redeveloped/expanded properties may not
perform



as
well as expected. We are subject to other risks in connection with any acquisition, development and redevelopment/expansion activities, including the following:

•

construction costs of a project may be higher than projected, potentially making the project unfeasible or unprofitable;

•

we may not be able to obtain financing or to refinance construction loans on favorable terms, if at all;

•

we may be unable to obtain zoning, occupancy or other governmental approvals;

•

occupancy rates and rents may not meet our projections and the project may not be profitable; and

•

we may need the consent of third parties such as anchor tenants, mortgage lenders and joint venture partners, and those
consents may be withheld.

If
a development or redevelopment/expansion project is unsuccessful, either because it is not meeting our expectations when operational or was not completed according to the project
planning, we could lose our investment in the project. Further, if we guarantee the property's financing, our loss could exceed our investment in the project.

Real estate investments are relatively illiquid.

Our properties represent a substantial portion of our total consolidated assets. These investments are relatively illiquid. As a
result, our ability to sell one or more of our properties or investments in real estate in response to any changes in economic or other conditions is limited. If we want to sell a property, we cannot
assure you that we will be able to dispose of it in the desired time period or that the sales price of a property will exceed the cost of our investment.

Environmental Risks

As owners of real estate, we can face liabilities for environmental contamination.

Federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require us, as a current or previous
owner or operator of real property, to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at a property or at impacted neighboring properties. These laws often impose
liability regardless of whether the property owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances. These laws and regulations may require the abatement or
removal of asbestos containing materials in the event of damage, demolition or renovation, reconstruction or expansion of a property and also govern emissions of and exposure to asbestos fibers in the
air. Those laws and regulations also govern the installation, maintenance and removal of underground storage tanks used to store waste oils or other petroleum products. Many of our properties contain,
or at one time contained, asbestos containing materials or underground storage tanks (primarily related to auto service center establishments or emergency electrical generation equipment). The costs
of investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances may be substantial and could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition but is not estimable. The
presence of contamination, or the failure to remediate contamination, may also adversely affect our ability to sell, lease or redevelop a property or to borrow using a property as collateral.

Our efforts to identify environmental liabilities may not be successful.

Although we believe that our portfolio is in substantial compliance with Federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and
regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances, this belief is based on limited testing. Nearly all of our properties have been subjected to Phase I or similar environmental audits. These
environmental audits have not revealed, nor are we aware of, any environmental liability that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.
However, we cannot assure you that:

•

existing environmental studies with respect to the portfolio reveal all potential environmental liabilities;

•

any previous owner, occupant or tenant of a property did not create any material environmental condition not known to us;

•

the current environmental condition of the portfolio will not be affected by tenants and occupants, by the condition of
nearby properties, or by other unrelated third parties; or



•

future uses or conditions (including, without limitation, changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations or the
interpretation thereof) will not result in environmental liabilities.

Retail Operations Risks

Overall economic conditions may adversely affect the general retail environment.

Our concentration in the retail real estate market means that we are subject to the risks that affect the retail environment generally,
including the levels of consumer spending, seasonality, the willingness of retailers to lease space in our shopping centers, tenant bankruptcies, changes in economic conditions, consumer confidence,
casualties and other natural disasters, and the potential for terrorist activities. The economy and consumer spending appear to be recovering from the effects of the recent recession. We derive our
cash flow from operations primarily from retail tenants, many of whom have been and continue to be under some degree of economic stress. A significant deterioration in our cash flow from operations
could require us to curtail planned capital expenditures or seek alternative sources of financing.

We may not be able to lease newly developed properties and renew leases and relet space at existing properties.

We may not be able to lease new properties to an appropriate mix of tenants or for rents that are consistent with our projections.
Also, when leases for our existing properties expire, the premises may not be relet or the terms of reletting, including the cost of allowances and concessions to tenants, may be less favorable than
the current lease terms. To the extent that our leasing plans are not achieved, our cash generated before debt repayments and capital expenditures could be adversely affected.

Some of our properties depend on anchor stores or major tenants to attract shoppers and could be adversely affected by the loss of or a store closure by one or more of these
tenants.

Regional malls are typically anchored by department stores and other large nationally recognized tenants. The value of some of our
properties could be adversely affected if these tenants fail to comply with their contractual obligations, seek concessions in order to continue operations, or cease their operations. Department store
and larger store, also referred to as "big box", consolidations typically result in the closure of existing stores or duplicate or geographically overlapping store locations. We do not control the
disposition of those department stores or larger stores that we do not own. We also may not control the vacant space that is not re-leased in those stores we do own. Other tenants may be
entitled to modify the terms of their existing leases in the event of such closures. The modification could be unfavorable to us as the lessor and could decrease rents or expense recovery charges.
Additionally, major tenant closures may result in decreased customer traffic which could lead to decreased sales at other stores. If the sales of stores operating in our properties were to decline
significantly due to closing of anchors, economic conditions, or other reasons, tenants may be unable to pay their minimum rents or expense recovery charges. In the event of default by a tenant or
anchor store, we may experience delays and costs in enforcing our rights as landlord to recover amounts due to us under the terms of our agreements with those parties.

We face potential adverse effects from tenant bankruptcies.

Bankruptcy filings by retailers occur regularly in the course of our operations. We continually seek to re-lease vacant
spaces resulting from tenant terminations. The bankruptcy of a tenant, particularly an anchor tenant, may make it more difficult to lease the remainder of the affected properties. Future tenant
bankruptcies could adversely affect our properties or impact our ability to successfully execute our re-leasing strategy.

Risks Relating to Joint Venture Properties

We have limited control with respect to some properties that are partially owned or managed by third parties, which may adversely affect our ability to sell or refinance
them.

As of December 31, 2010, we owned interests in 175 income-producing properties with other parties. Of those, 19 properties are
included in our consolidated financial statements. We account for the other 156 properties under the equity method of accounting, which we refer to as joint venture properties. We serve as general
partner or property manager for 92 of these 156 properties; however, certain major decisions, such as selling or refinancing these properties, require the consent of the other owners. Of the
properties for which we do not serve as general partner or property manager, 55 are in our international joint ventures. The other owners also have other participating rights that



we
consider substantive for purposes of determining control over the properties' assets. The remaining joint venture properties are managed by third parties. These limitations may adversely affect our
ability to sell, refinance, or otherwise operate these properties.

The Operating Partnership guarantees debt or otherwise provides support for a number of joint venture properties.

Joint venture debt is the liability of the joint venture and is typically secured by a mortgage on the joint venture property. As of
December 31, 2010, the Operating Partnership has loan guarantees to support $60.7 million of our total $6.6 billion share of joint venture mortgage and other indebtedness. A
default by a joint venture under its debt obligations may expose us to liability under a guaranty or letter of credit.

Other Factors Affecting Our Business

Our Common Area Maintenance (CAM) contributions may not allow us to recover the majority of our operating expenses from tenants.

CAM costs typically include allocable energy costs, repairs, maintenance and capital improvements to common areas, janitorial services,
administrative, property and liability insurance costs, and
security costs. We historically have used leases with variable CAM provisions that adjust to reflect inflationary increases. We have made a concerted effort to convert our leases to a fixed payment
methodology which fixes our tenants' CAM contributions and should in turn reduce the volatility of and limitations on the recoveries we collect from our tenants for the reimbursement of our property
operating expenses. However, with respect to both variable and fixed payment methodologies, the amount of CAM charges we bill to our tenants may not allow us to recover all of these operating costs.

We face a wide range of competition that could affect our ability to operate profitably.

Our properties compete with other retail properties and other forms of retailing such as catalogs and e-commerce websites.
Competition may come from regional malls, outlet centers, community/lifestyle centers, and other shopping centers, both existing as well as future development projects. The presence of competitive
alternatives affects our ability to lease space and the level of rents we can obtain. New construction, renovations and expansions at competing sites could also negatively affect our properties.

We
also compete with other retail property developers to acquire prime development sites. In addition, we compete with other retail property companies for tenants and qualified
management.

Our international expansion may subject us to different or greater risk from those associated with our domestic operations.

We hold interests in joint venture properties that operate in Italy, Japan, Korea, and Mexico, and an interest in a joint venture
property under development in Malaysia. We have a minority investment in two U.K. real estate companies. We may pursue additional expansion opportunities outside the United States. International
development and ownership activities carry risks that are different from those we face with our domestic properties and operations. These risks include:

•

adverse effects of changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies;

•

changes in foreign political and economic environments, regionally, nationally, and locally;

•

challenges of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws including corporate governance, operations, taxes, and
litigation;

•

differing lending practices;

•

differences in cultures;

•

changes in applicable laws and regulations in the United States that affect foreign operations;

•

difficulties in managing international operations; and

•

obstacles to the repatriation of earnings and cash.

Although
our international activities currently are a relatively small portion of our business (international properties represented approximately 5.0% of the GLA of all of our
properties at December 31, 2010), to the extent



that
we expand our international activities, these risks could increase in significance which in turn could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

Some of our potential losses may not be covered by insurance.

We maintain insurance coverage with third party carriers who provide a portion of the coverage for specific layers of potential losses
including commercial general liability, fire, flood, extended coverage and rental loss insurance on all of our properties in the United States. The initial portion of coverage not provided by third
party carriers is either insured through our wholly-owned captive insurance companies, Rosewood Indemnity, Ltd. and Bridgewood Insurance Company, Ltd., and other financial arrangements
controlled
by us. The third party carrier has, in turn, agreed to provide evidence of coverage for this layer of losses under the terms and conditions of the carrier's policy. A similar policy written through
our captive insurance entities also provides initial coverage for property insurance and certain windstorm risks at the properties located in coastal windstorm locations.

There
are some types of losses, including lease and other contract claims, which generally are not insured. If an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs, we could
lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenue it could generate.

We
currently maintain insurance coverage against acts of terrorism on all of our properties in the United States on an "all risk" basis in the amount of up to $1 billion. The
current federal laws which provide this coverage are expected to operate through 2014. Despite the existence of this insurance coverage, any threatened or actual terrorist attacks where we operate
could adversely affect our property values, revenues, consumer traffic and tenant sales.

Risks Relating to Federal Income Taxes

We have elected to be taxed as a REIT.

We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the
Internal Revenue Code. We believe we have been organized and operated in a manner which allows us to qualify for taxation as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code. We intend to continue to operate in
this manner. However, our qualification and taxation as a REIT depend upon our ability to meet, through actual annual operating results, asset diversification, distribution levels and diversity of
stock ownership, the various qualification tests imposed under the Internal Revenue Code. REIT qualification is governed by highly technical and complex provisions for which there are only limited
judicial or administrative interpretations. Accordingly, there is no assurance that we have operated or will continue to operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT.

If
we fail to comply with those provisions, we may be subject to monetary penalties or ultimately to possible disqualification as a REIT. If such events occurs, and if available relief
provisions do not apply:

•

we will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income;

•

we will be subject to corporate level income tax, including any applicable alternative minimum tax, on our taxable income
at regular corporate rates; and

•

unless entitled to relief under relevant statutory provisions, we will also be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for
the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost.

Item 2.    Properties

United States Properties

Our U.S. properties primarily consist of regional malls, Premium Outlets, The Mills, community/lifestyle centers, and other properties.
These properties contain an aggregate of approximately 250.5 million square feet of gross leasable area, or GLA, of which we own approximately 159.5 million square feet. Total estimated
retail sales at the properties in 2010 were approximately $62 billion.

Regional
malls typically contain at least one traditional department store anchor or a combination of anchors and big box retailers with a wide variety of smaller stores connecting the
anchors. Additional stores are usually located along the perimeter of the parking area. Our 161 regional malls are generally enclosed centers and range in size from approximately 400,000 to
2.4 million square feet of GLA. Our regional malls contain in the aggregate more than 18,300 occupied stores, including approximately 709 anchors, which are mostly national retailers. For
comparative purposes, we separate the information in this section on the 16 regional malls acquired from The Mills Corporation in 2007, or the Mills Regional Malls, from the information on our other
regional malls.

Premium
Outlets generally contain a wide variety of designer and manufacturer stores located in open-air centers. Our 58 Premium Outlets range in size from approximately
150,000 to 850,000 square feet of GLA. The Premium Outlets are generally located near major metropolitan areas and tourist destinations including New York City, Los Angeles, Boston, Palm Springs,
Orlando, Las Vegas, and Honolulu.

The
Mills generally range in size from 1.0 million to 2.3 million square feet of GLA and are located in major metropolitan areas. They have a combination of traditional
mall, outlet center, and big box retailers and entertainment uses. The Mills Regional Malls typically range in size from 800,000 to 1.3 million square feet of GLA and contain a wide variety of
national retailers.

Community/lifestyle
centers are generally unenclosed and smaller than our regional malls. Our 66 community/lifestyle centers generally range in size from approximately 100,000 to
950,000 square feet of GLA. Community/lifestyle centers are designed to serve a larger trade area and typically contain anchor stores and other national retail tenants, which occupy a significant
portion of the GLA of the center. We also own traditional community shopping centers that focus primarily on value-oriented and convenience goods and services. These centers are usually anchored by a
supermarket, discount retailer, or drugstore and are designed to service a neighborhood area. Finally, we own open-air centers adjacent to our regional malls designed to take advantage of
the drawing power of the mall.

We
also have interests in 17 other shopping centers or outlet centers. These properties range in size from approximately 85,000 to 1.0 million square feet of GLA, are considered
non-core to our business model, and in total represent less than 1% of our total operating income before depreciation and amortization.

As
of December 31, 2010, approximately 94.2% of the owned GLA in regional malls and Premium Outlets and the retail space of the other properties was leased, approximately 93.7%
of the owned GLA for The Mills and 90.4% of owned GLA for the Mills Regional Malls was leased, and approximately 91.6% of owned GLA in the community/lifestyle centers was leased.

We
hold a 100% interest in 218 of our properties, effectively control 19 properties in which we have a joint venture interest, and hold the remaining 101 properties through
unconsolidated joint venture interests. We are the managing or co-managing general partner or member of 329 properties. Substantially all of our joint venture properties are subject to
rights of first refusal, buy-sell provisions, or other sale rights for all partners which are customary in real estate partnership agreements and the industry. Our partners in our joint
ventures may initiate these provisions (subject to any applicable lock up or similar restrictions) which will result in either the use of available cash or borrowings to acquire their partnership
interest or the disposal of our partnership interest.

The
following property table summarizes certain data for our regional malls and Premium Outlets, The Mills, the Mills Regional Malls and community/lifestyle centers located in the
United States, including Puerto Rico, as of December 31, 2010.

International Properties

Our ownership interests in properties outside the United States are primarily owned through joint venture arrangements. However, we
have direct minority investments in certain real estate companies within the U.K. as further described below.



European Investments

Gallerie Commerciali Italia, S.p.A., or GCI, is a fully integrated European retail real estate developer, owner and manager of
45 properties in Italy. At December 31, 2010, we had a 49.0% ownership interest in GCI. Our properties in Italy consist primarily of hypermarket-anchored shopping centers. Substantially all of
these properties are anchored by the hypermarket retailer Auchan, who is also our partner in GCI. Certain of the properties in Italy are subject to leaseholds whereby GCI leases all or a portion of
the premises from a third party who is entitled to receive substantially all the economic benefits of that portion of the properties. Auchan is one of the two largest hypermarket operators in Europe.
These centers comprise over 10.1 million square feet of GLA and were 97.2% leased as of December 31, 2010.

On
July 15, 2010, we and our partner in Simon Ivanhoe, Ivanhoe Cambridge Inc., or Ivanhoe Cambridge, sold our collective interests in Simon Ivanhoe which owned seven
shopping centers located in France and Poland to Unibail-Rodamco. The joint venture partners received net consideration of €422.5 million for their interests after the repayment
of all joint venture debt, subject to certain post-closing adjustments. Our share of the gain on sale of our interests in Simon Ivanhoe was approximately $281 million. A portion of
the proceeds was used to repay the €167.4 million (approximately $215 million) principal balance on the Euro-denominated tranche of our Credit Facility.

We
and Ivanhoe Cambridge have the right to participate with Unibail-Rodamco in the potential development of up to five new retail projects in the Simon Ivanhoe pipeline, subject to
customary approval rights. We will own a 25% interest in any of these projects in which we agree to participate.

Other International Investments

We also hold real estate interests in eight operating joint venture properties in Japan, one operating joint venture property in
Mexico, one operating joint venture property and two joint venture properties under development in South Korea, and one joint venture property under development in Malaysia. The eight Japanese Premium
Outlets operate in various cities throughout Japan and are held in a joint venture with Mitsubishi Estate Co., Ltd. These centers comprise over 2.5 million square feet of GLA and
were 99.8% leased as of December 31, 2010.

The
following summarizes our holdings in these international joint ventures and the underlying countries in which these joint ventures own and operate real estate properties as of
December 31, 2010:

In
July 2010, we completed construction and opened a 62,000 square foot expansion at Toki Premium Outlets in Toki, Japan.

Prior
to May 7, 2010 we held a minority interest in Liberty International, PLC, or Liberty, a U.K. Real Estate Investment Trust that operated regional shopping centers and
owned other prime retail assets throughout the U.K. Effective May 7, 2010, Liberty completed a demerger in which it was separated into two companies, Capital Shopping Centres Group PLC,
or CSCG, and Capital & Counties Properties PLC, or CAPC. Liberty shareholders acquired the same number of shares of CSCG and CAPC as they owned in Liberty. CSCG operates regional
shopping centers and is the owner of other retail assets primarily located in the United Kingdom. CAPC is predominantly focused on property investment and development in central London. Our interest
in CSCG and CAPC is adjusted to their quoted market price, including a related foreign exchange component. Our interests in CSCG and CAPC are less than 6% of their outstanding shares respectively.

following property table summarizes certain data for our properties located in Europe, Japan, Mexico, and Korea at December 31, 2010.

Land

We have direct or indirect ownership interests in approximately 550 acres of land held in the United States for future development.

Sustainability and Energy Efficiency

Due to the size of our portfolio, we focus on energy efficiency as a core sustainability strategy. Through the continued use of energy
conservation practices, energy efficiency projects, and continuous monitoring and reporting, we have reduced our energy consumption at comparable properties every year since 2003. As a result,
excluding new developments and expansions, we reduced the electricity usage over which we have direct control by 295 million kWhs since 2003. This represents a 22% percent reduction in
electricity usage across a portfolio of comparable properties and reflects an annual value of over $34 million in avoided operating
costs. Our documented reduction in greenhouse gas emissions resulting from our energy management efforts is 182,000 metric tons CO2e.

In
2010, we were awarded

NAREIT's Leader in the Light Award

for the sixth year in a row. We are the only company to have achieved the
Leader in the Light distinction every single year since NAREIT launched the program in 2005. We were included in the 2009 Carbon Disclosure Project's Global 500 Carbon Disclosure Leadership Index. The
2009 Carbon Disclosure Leadership Index highlights 50 companies worldwide that have displayed the most professional approach to corporate governance with respect to climate change disclosure
practices. We were the only real estate company to be recognized.

Mortgage Financing on Properties

The following table sets forth certain information regarding the mortgages and other indebtedness encumbering our properties, and the
properties held by our domestic and international joint venture arrangements, and also our unsecured corporate debt. Substantially all of the mortgage and property related debt is nonrecourse to us.

There
is no established public trading market for Simon Property's Class B common stock. Dividends on the Class B common stock are identical to the common
stock.

Holders

The number of holders of record of common stock outstanding was 1,996 as of December 31, 2010. The Class B common stock
is held entirely by a voting trust to which the Estate of Melvin Simon, Herbert Simon, David Simon and certain of their affiliates are parties and is exchangeable on a
one-for-one basis into shares of common stock.

Dividends

We are required to pay a minimum level of dividends to maintain our status as a REIT. Our dividends typically exceed our net income
generated in any given year primarily because of depreciation, which is a "non-cash" expense. Our future dividends will be determined by the Board of Directors based on actual results of
operations, cash available for dividends and limited partner distributions, and what may be required to maintain our status as a REIT.

Dividends
during 2010 aggregated $2.60 per share and were paid entirely in cash. Dividends during 2009 aggregated $2.70 and were paid part in stock and part in cash, subject to
stockholder election. On February 3, 2011, our Board of Directors approved a cash common stock dividend of $0.80 per share for the first quarter of 2011.

We
offer an Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan that allows stockholders to acquire additional shares by automatically reinvesting cash dividends. Shares are acquired pursuant to the
plan at a price equal to the prevailing market price of such shares, without payment of any brokerage commission or service charge.

Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities

During the fourth quarter of 2010, we issued 55,518 shares of common stock to limited partners in exchange for an equal number of
units. The issuance of the shares of common stock was made pursuant to the terms of the Partnership Agreement of the Operating Partnership and was exempt from registration under the Securities Act of
1933 as amended, in reliance upon Section 4(2).

Issuances Under Equity Compensation Plans

For information regarding the securities authorized for issuance under our equity compensation plans, see Item 12 of this
report.

Temporary Equity

As of the end of the first quarter of 2010 and through April 14, 2010, holders of our Series I preferred stock and
holders of the Operating Partnership's Series I Convertible preferred units could elect to convert their Series I



preferred
stock into shares of our common stock or Series I preferred units into units of the Operating Partnership or Series I preferred stock. The optional conversion election resulted
from the closing sale price of our common stock exceeding the applicable trigger price per share for a period of 20 trading days in the last 30 trading days of the prior quarter. Each share of
Series I preferred stock and Series I preferred unit was convertible into common stock or units at a conversion ratio of .847495.

On
March 17, 2010, we announced that we would redeem all of the outstanding shares of our Series I preferred stock and the Operating Partnership's Series I
Preferred Units on April 16, 2010. The redemption price was equal to the liquidation value per share plus accumulated and unpaid dividends through the redemption date or $50.4917 per share or
unit.

Through
the redemption date of April 16, 2010, holders of Series I preferred stock converted 7,871,276 shares of Series I preferred stock into 6,670,589 shares of
our common stock and holders of Series I preferred units converted 1,017,480 Series I preferred units into 862,292 units of the Operating Partnership at a conversion ratio of .847495. We
redeemed the remaining 219,879 shares of Series I preferred stock for $50.4917 per share for an aggregate cash redemption payment of $11.1 million including accrued dividends.

Depreciation
of our investment in buildings and improvements reflected in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income is calculated over the estimated original
lives of the assets as follows:

•

Buildings and Improvements — typically 10-40 years for the structure, 15 years
for landscaping and parking lot, and 10 years for HVAC equipment.

•

Tenant Allowances and Improvements — shorter of lease term or useful life.

(3)

Initial cost generally represents net book value at December 20, 1993, except for acquired properties and new developments after December 20, 1993. Initial cost also includes any new developments that are opened
during the current year. Costs of disposals and impairments of property are first reflected as a reduction to cost capitalized subsequent to acquisition.

(4)

Not developed/constructed by us or our predecessors. The date of construction represents the acquisition date.

(5)

Initial cost for these properties is the cost at the date of consolidation for properties previously accounted for under the equity method of accounting.

(6)

Secured by a $260,000 cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted mortgage loan facility.
