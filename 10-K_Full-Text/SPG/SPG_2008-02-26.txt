Part I

Item 1. Business

Simon Property Group, Inc., or Simon Property, is a Delaware corporation that operates as a self-administered and self-managed real
estate investment trust, or REIT, under the Internal Revenue Code. Simon Property Group, L.P., or the Operating Partnership, is our majority-owned partnership subsidiary that owns all of our
real estate properties. In this report, the terms "we", "us" and "our" refer to Simon Property Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries.

We
own, develop, and manage retail real estate properties, which consist primarily of regional malls, Premium Outlet® centers, The Mills®, and
community/lifestyle centers. As of December 31, 2007, we owned or held an interest in 320 income-producing properties in the United States, which consisted of 168 regional malls, 38 Premium
Outlet centers, 67 community/lifestyle centers, 37 properties acquired in the Mills acquisition, and 10 other shopping centers or outlet centers in 41 states and Puerto Rico. Of the 37 Mills
properties acquired, 17 of these are The Mills, 16 are regional malls, and four are community centers. We also own interests in four parcels of land held for future development. In the United States,
we have four new properties currently under development aggregating approximately 2.75 million square feet which will open during 2008. Internationally, we have ownership interests in
51 European shopping centers (in France, Italy and Poland), six Premium Outlet centers in Japan, one Premium Outlet center in Mexico, and one Premium Outlet center in South Korea. Also, through
a joint venture arrangement, we have a 32.5% interest in five shopping centers under development in China.

For
a description of our operational strategies and developments in our business during 2007, see the "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations" section of the 2007 Annual Report to Shareholders filed as Exhibit 13.1 to this Form 10-K.

Other Policies

The following is a discussion of our investment policies, financing policies, conflict of interest policies and policies with respect to certain other activities.
One or more of these policies may be amended or rescinded from time to time without a stockholder vote.

Investment Policies

While we emphasize equity real estate investments, we may, at our discretion, invest in mortgages and other real estate interests consistent with our
qualification as a REIT. We do not currently intend to invest to a significant extent in mortgages or deeds of trust; however, we hold an interest in one property through a mortgage note which results
in us receiving 100% of the economics of the property. We may invest in participating or convertible mortgages if we conclude that we may benefit from the cash flow or any appreciation in the value of
the property.

We
may invest in securities of other entities engaged in real estate activities or securities of other issuers. However, any of these investments would be subject to the percentage
ownership limitations and gross income tests necessary for REIT qualification. These REIT limitations mean that we cannot make an investment that would cause our real estate assets to be less than 75%
of our total assets. In addition, at least 75% of our gross income must be derived directly or indirectly from investments relating to real property or mortgages on real property, including "rents
from real property," dividends from other REIT's and, in certain circumstances, interest from certain types of temporary investments. At least 95% of our income must be derived from such real property
investments, and from dividends, interest and gains from the sale or dispositions of stock or securities or from other combinations of the foregoing.

Subject
to REIT limitations, we may invest in the securities of other issuers in connection with acquisitions of indirect interests in real estate. Such an investment would normally be
in the form of general or limited partnership or membership interests in special purpose partnerships and limited liability companies that own one or more properties. We may, in the future, acquire
all or substantially all of the securities or assets of other REITs, management companies or similar entities where such investments would be consistent with our investment policies.

Financing Policies

We must comply with the covenants contained in our financing agreements that limit our ratio of debt to total asset or market value, as defined. For example, the
Operating Partnership's lines of credit and the indentures for the


Operating
Partnership's debt securities contain covenants that restrict the total amount of debt of the Operating Partnership to 65%, or 60% in relation to certain debt, of total assets, as defined
under the related arrangement, and secured debt to 50% of total assets. In addition, these agreements contain other covenants requiring compliance with financial ratios. Furthermore, the amount of
debt that we may incur is limited as a practical matter by our desire to maintain acceptable ratings for our equity securities and the debt securities of the Operating Partnership.

If
our Board of Directors determines to seek additional capital, we may raise such capital through additional equity offerings, debt financing, creating joint ventures with existing
ownership interests in properties, retention of cash flows or a combination of these methods. Our ability to retain cash flows is limited by the requirement for REITs to distribute at least 90% of
their taxable income. We must also take into account taxes that would be imposed on undistributed taxable income. If the Board of Directors determines to raise additional equity capital, it may,
without stockholder approval, issue additional shares of common stock or other capital stock. The Board of Directors may issue a number of shares up to the amount of our authorized capital in any
manner and on such terms and for such consideration as it deems appropriate. This may include issuing stock in exchange for property. Such securities may be senior to the outstanding classes of common
stock. Such securities also may include additional classes of preferred stock, which may be convertible into common stock. Existing stockholders have no preemptive right to purchase shares in any
subsequent offering of our securities. Any such offering could dilute a stockholder's investment in us.

We
expect most additional borrowings would be made through the Operating Partnership or its subsidiaries. We might, however, incur borrowings that would be reloaned to the Operating
Partnership. Borrowings may be in the form of bank borrowings, publicly and privately placed debt instruments, or purchase money obligations to the sellers of properties. Any such indebtedness may be
secured or unsecured. Any such indebtedness may also have full or limited recourse to the borrower or cross-collateralized with other debt, or may be fully or partially guaranteed by the Operating
Partnership. Although we may borrow to fund the payment of dividends, we currently have no expectation that we will regularly be required to do so.

We
have a $3.5 billion revolving unsecured credit facility. We issue debt securities through the Operating Partnership, but we may issue our debt securities which may be
convertible into capital stock or be accompanied by warrants to purchase capital stock. We also may sell or securitize our lease receivables. The proceeds from any borrowings or financings may be used
for one or more of the following:

•

financing
acquisitions;

•

developing
or redeveloping properties;

•

refinancing
existing indebtedness;

•

working
capital or capital improvements; or

•

meeting
the income distribution requirements applicable to REITs, if we have income without the receipt of cash sufficient to enable us to meet such distribution
requirements.

We
may also finance acquisitions through the following:

•

issuance
of shares of common stock or preferred stock;

•

issuance
of additional units of limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership;

•

issuance
of preferred units of the Operating Partnership;

•

issuance
of other securities; or

•

sale
or exchange of ownership interests in properties.

The
ability of the Operating Partnership to issue units of limited partnership interest to transferors of properties or other partnership interests may defer gain recognition for tax
purposes by the transferor. It may also be advantageous for us since there are ownership limits that restrict the number of shares of our capital stock that investors may own.

We
do not have a policy limiting the number or amount of mortgages that may be placed on any particular property. Mortgage financing instruments, however, usually limit additional
indebtedness on such properties. We also have covenants on our unsecured debt that limit our total secured debt.

Typically,
we invest in or form special purpose entities to assist us in obtaining permanent financing on attractive terms. Permanent financing may be structured as a mortgage loan on a
single property, or on a group of properties, and generally requires us to provide a mortgage interest on the property in favor of an institutional third party, as a joint venture with a third party,
or as a securitized financing. For securitized financings, we create special purpose entities to own the properties. These special purpose entities are structured so that they would not be


consolidated
with us in the event we would ever become subject to a bankruptcy proceeding. We decide upon the structure of the financing based upon the best terms then available to us and whether the
proposed financing is consistent with our other business objectives. For accounting purposes, we include the outstanding securitized debt of special purpose entities owning consolidated properties as
part of our consolidated indebtedness.

Conflict of Interest Policies

We maintain policies and have entered into agreements designed to reduce or eliminate potential conflicts of interest. We have adopted governance principles
governing our affairs and the Board of Directors, as well as written charters for each of the standing Committees of the Board of Directors. In addition, we have a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics,
which applies to all of our officers, directors, and employees. At least a majority of the members of our Board of Directors must qualify as independent under the listing standards for New York Stock
Exchange companies and cannot be affiliated with the Simon or DeBartolo families who are significant stockholders. Any transaction between us and the Simons or the DeBartolos, including property
acquisitions, service and property management agreements and retail space leases, must be approved by a majority of our non-affiliated directors.

The
sale by the Operating Partnership of any property that it owns may have an adverse tax impact on the Simons or the DeBartolos and the other limited partners of the Operating
Partnership. In order to avoid any conflict of interest between Simon Property and the limited partners of the Operating Partnership, our charter requires that at least six of our independent
directors must authorize and require the Operating Partnership to sell any property it owns. Any such sale is subject to applicable agreements with third parties. Noncompetition agreements executed by
each of the Simons contain covenants limiting the ability of the Simons to participate in certain shopping center activities in North America.

Policies With Respect To Certain Other Activities

We intend to make investments which are consistent with our qualification as a REIT, unless the Board of Directors determines that it is no longer in our best
interests to so qualify as a REIT. The Board of Directors may make such a determination because of changing circumstances or changes in the REIT requirements. We have authority to offer shares of our
capital stock or other securities in exchange for property. We also have authority to repurchase or otherwise reacquire our shares or any other securities. We may issue shares of our common stock, or
cash at our option, to holders of units of limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership in future periods
upon exercise of such holders' rights under the Operating Partnership agreement. Our policy prohibits us from making any loans to our directors or executive officers for any purpose. We may make loans
to the joint ventures in which we participate.

Competition

Our principal competitors are nine other major United States or internationally publicly-held companies that own or operate regional malls, outlet
centers, and other shopping centers in the United States and abroad. We also compete with many commercial developers, real estate companies and other owners of retail real estate that operate in our
trade areas. Some of our properties and investments are of the same type and are within the same market area as competitor properties. The existence of competitive properties could have a material
adverse effect on our ability to lease space and on the level of rents we can obtain. This results in competition for both the acquisition of prime sites (including land for development and operating
properties) and for tenants to occupy the space that we and our competitors develop and manage. In addition, our properties compete against other forms of retailing, such as catalog and
e-commerce websites, that offer retail products and services.

We
believe that we have a competitive advantage in the retail real estate business as a result of:

•

the
size, quality and diversity of our properties;

•

our
management and operational expertise;

•

our
extensive experience and relationships with retailers and lenders;

•

our
mall marketing initiatives and consumer focused strategic corporate alliances; and

•

our
ability to use our size to reduce the total occupancy cost of our tenants.

Our
size reduces our dependence upon individual retail tenants. Approximately 5,100 different retailers occupy more than 28,600 stores in our properties and no retail tenant represents
more than 2.1% of our properties' total minimum rents.

4,060,755 shares of common stock upon the conversion of common units of limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership;

Item 1A. Risk Factors

The following factors, among others, could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements
made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and presented elsewhere by our management from time to time. These factors, among others, may have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, operating results and cash flows, and you should carefully consider them. It is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. You should not consider this list to be a
complete statement of all potential risks or uncertainties and we may update them in our future periodic reports.

Risks Relating to Debt and the Financial Markets

We have a substantial debt burden that could affect our future operations.

As of December 31, 2007, our consolidated mortgages and other indebtedness, excluding the related premium and discount, totaled $17.2 billion, of
which approximately $751 million matures during 2008, including recurring principal amortization on mortgages maturing during 2007. We are subject to the risks normally associated with debt
financing, including the risk that our cash flow from operations will be insufficient to meet required debt service. Our debt service costs generally will not be reduced if developments at the
property, such as the entry of new competitors or the loss of major tenants, cause a reduction in the income from the property. Should such events occur, our operations may be adversely affected. If a
property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and income from the is insufficient to pay that indebtedness, the property could be foreclosed upon by the mortgagee resulting in a loss of
income and a decline in our total asset value.

We depend on external financings for our growth and ongoing debt service requirements.

We depend primarily on external financings, principally debt financings, to fund the growth of our business and to ensure that we can meet ongoing maturities of
our outstanding debt. Our access to financing depends on our credit rating, the willingness of banks to lend to us and conditions in the capital markets which have experienced increasing volatility in
recent months. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain the financing we need for future growth or to meet our debt service as obligations mature, or that the financing available to us will
be on acceptable terms.

Adverse changes in our credit rating could affect our borrowing capacity and borrowing terms.

Our outstanding senior unsecured notes and preferred stock are periodically rated by nationally recognized credit rating agencies. The credit ratings are based on
our operating performance, liquidity and leverage ratios, overall financial position, and other factors viewed by the credit rating agencies as relevant to our industry and the economic outlook in
general. Our credit rating can affect the amount of capital we can access, as well as the terms of any financing we obtain. Since we depend primarily on debt financing to fund our growth, adverse
changes in our credit rating could have a negative effect on our future growth.

Our hedging interest rate protection arrangements may not effectively limit our interest rate risk.

We manage our exposure to interest rate risk by a combination of interest rate protection agreements to effectively fix or cap a portion of our variable rate
debt, or in the case of a fair value hedge, effectively convert fixed rate debt to variable rate debt. In addition, we refinance fixed rate debt at times when we believe rates and terms are
appropriate. Our efforts to manage these exposures may not be successful.

Our
use of interest rate hedging arrangements to manage risk associated with interest rate volatility may expose us to additional risks, including a risk that a counterparty to a
hedging arrangement may fail to honor its obligations. Developing an effective interest rate risk strategy is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest
rate fluctuations. There can be no assurance that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition. Termination of these hedging
agreements typically involves costs, such as transaction fees or breakage costs.


Factors Affecting Real Estate Investments and Operations

We face risks associated with the acquisition, development and expansion of properties.

We regularly acquire and develop new properties and expand and redevelop existing properties, and these activities are subject to various risks. We may not be
successful in pursuing acquisition, development or redevelopment/expansion opportunities. In addition, newly acquired, developed or redeveloped/expanded properties may not perform as well as expected.
We are subject to other risks in connection with any acquisition, development and redevelopment/expansion activities, including the following:

•

construction
costs of a project may be higher than projected, potentially making the project unfeasible or unprofitable;

•

we
may not be able to obtain financing or to refinance construction loans on favorable terms, if at all;

•

we
may be unable to obtain zoning, occupancy or other governmental approvals;

•

occupancy
rates and rents may not meet our projections and the project may not be profitable; and

•

we
may need the consent of third parties such as anchor tenants, mortgage lenders and joint venture partners, and those consents may be withheld.

If
a development or redevelopment/expansion project is unsuccessful, either because it is not meeting our expectations when operational or was not completed according to the project
planning, we could lose our investment in the project. Further, if we guarantee the property's financing, our loss could exceed our investment in the project.

Real estate investments are relatively illiquid.

Our properties represent a substantial portion of our total consolidated assets. These investments are relatively illiquid. As a result, our ability to sell one
or more of our properties or investments in real estate in response to any changes in economic or other conditions is limited. If we want to sell a property, we cannot assure you that we will be able
to dispose of it in the desired time period or that the sales price of a property will exceed the cost of our investment.

Environmental Risks

As owners of real estate, we can face liabilities for environmental contamination.

Federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require us, as a current or previous owner or operator of real
property, to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at a property or at impacted neighboring properties. These laws often impose liability regardless of
whether the property owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances. These laws and regulations may require the abatement or removal of asbestos
containing materials in the event of damage, demolition or renovation, reconstruction or expansion of a property and also govern emissions of and exposure to asbestos fibers in the air. Those laws and
regulations also govern the installation, maintenance and removal of underground storage tanks used to store waste oils or other petroleum products. Many of our properties contain, or at one time
contained, asbestos containing materials or underground storage tanks (primarily related to auto service center establishments or emergency electrical generation equipment). The costs of
investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances may be substantial and could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition but is not estimable. The presence
of contamination, or the failure to remediate contamination, may also adversely affect our ability to sell, lease or redevelop a property or to borrow using a property as collateral.

Our efforts to identify environmental liabilities may not be successful.

Although we believe that our portfolio is in substantial compliance with Federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations regarding
hazardous or toxic substances, this belief is based on limited testing. Nearly all of our properties have been subjected to Phase I or similar environmental audits. These environmental audits
have not revealed, nor are we aware of, any environmental liability that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. However, we cannot assure
you that:

•

existing
environmental studies with respect to the portfolio reveal all potential environmental liabilities;

•

any
previous owner, occupant or tenant of a property did not create any material environmental condition not known to us;


•

the
current environmental condition of the portfolio will not be affected by tenants and occupants, by the condition of nearby properties, or by other unrelated third
parties; or

•

future
uses or conditions (including, without limitation, changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations or the interpretation thereof) will not result in
environmental liabilities.

Retail Operations Risks

We are subject to risks that affect the general retail environment.

Our concentration in the retail real estate market means that we are subject to the risks that affect the retail environment generally, including the levels of
consumer spending, seasonality, the willingness of retailers to lease space in our shopping centers, tenant bankruptcies, changes in economic conditions, consumer confidence and terrorist activities.
The possibility that the United States may currently be experiencing a recession could adversely affect consumer spending. Any one or more of these factors could adversely affect our results of
operations or financial condition.

We may not be able to lease newly developed properties and renew leases and relet space at existing properties.

We may not be able to lease new properties to an appropriate mix of tenants or for rents that are consistent with our projections. Also, when leases for our
existing properties expire, the premises may not be relet or the terms of reletting, including the cost of allowances and concessions to tenants, may be less favorable than the current lease terms. To
the extent that our leasing plans are not achieved, our cash generated before debt repayments and capital expenditures could be adversely affected.

Some of our properties depend on anchor stores or major tenants to attract shoppers and could be adversely affected by the loss of or a store closure by one or more of these tenants.

Regional malls are typically anchored by department stores and other large nationally recognized tenants. The value of some of our properties could be adversely
affected if these tenants fail to comply with their contractual obligations, seek concessions in order to continue operations, or cease their operations. Department store and larger store, also
referred to as "big box", consolidations typically result in the closure of existing stores or duplicate or geographically overlapping store locations. We do not control the disposition of those
department stores or larger stores that we do not own. We also may not control the vacant space that is not re-leased in those stores we do own. Other tenants may be entitled to modify the
terms of their existing leases in the event of such closures. The modification could be unfavorable to us as the lessor and could decrease rents or expense recovery charges. Additionally, major tenant
closures may result in decreased customer traffic which could lead to decreased sales at other stores. If the sales of stores operating in our properties were to decline significantly due to closing
of anchors, economic conditions, or other reasons, tenants may be unable to pay their minimum rents or expense recovery charges. In the event of default by a tenant or anchor store, we may experience
delays and costs in enforcing our rights as landlord to recover amounts due to us under the terms of our agreements with those parties.

We face potential adverse effects from tenant bankruptcies.

Bankruptcy filings by retailers occur frequently in the course of our operations. We are continually re-leasing vacant spaces resulting from tenant
terminations. The bankruptcy of a tenant, particularly an anchor tenant, may make it more difficult to lease the remainder of the affected properties. Future tenant bankruptcies could adversely affect
our properties or impact our ability to successfully execute our re-leasing strategy.

Risks Relating to Joint Venture Properties

We have limited control with respect to some properties that are partially owned or managed by third parties, which may adversely affect our ability to sell or refinance them.

As of December 31, 2007, we owned interests in 181 income-producing properties with other parties. Of those, 19 properties are included in our consolidated
financial statements. We account for the other 162 properties under the equity method of accounting, which we refer to as joint venture properties. We serve as general partner or property manager for
93 of these 162 properties; however, certain major decisions, such as selling or refinancing these properties, require the consent of the other owners. Of the properties for which we do not serve as
general partner or


property
manager, 59 are in our international joint ventures. The other owners also have other participating rights that we consider substantive for purposes of determining control over the
properties' assets. The remaining joint venture properties are managed by third parties. These limitations may adversely affect our ability to sell, refinance, or otherwise operate these properties.

The Operating Partnership guarantees debt or otherwise provides support for a number of joint venture properties.

Joint venture debt is the liability of the joint venture and is typically secured by a mortgage on the joint venture property. As of December 31, 2007, the
Operating Partnership has loan guarantees and other guarantee obligations to support $132.5 million and $60.6 million, respectively, of our total $6.6 billion share of joint
venture mortgage and other indebtedness. A default by a joint venture under its debt obligations may expose us to liability under a guaranty or letter of credit.

Other Factors Affecting Our Business

Our Common Area Maintenance (CAM) contributions may not allow us to recover the majority of our operating expenses from tenants.

CAM costs typically include allocable energy costs, repairs, maintenance and capital improvements to common areas, janitorial services, administrative, property
and liability insurance costs, and security costs. We historically have used leases with variable CAM provisions that adjust to reflect inflationary increases. However, we are making a concerted
effort to shift from variable to fixed CAM contributions for our cost recoveries which will fix
our tenants' CAM contributions to us. As a result, our CAM contributions may not allow us to recover a substantial portion of these operating costs.

We face a wide range of competition that could affect our ability to operate profitably.

Our properties compete with other retail properties for tenants on the basis of the rent charged and location. The principal competition may come from existing or
future developments in the same market areas and from discount shopping centers, outlet malls, catalogues, discount shopping clubs and electronic commerce. The presence of competitive properties also
affects our ability to lease space and the level of rents we can obtain. Renovations and expansions at competing malls could also negatively affect our properties.

We
also compete with other retail property developers to acquire prime development sites. In addition, we compete with other retail property companies for attractive tenants and
qualified management.

Our international expansion may subject us to different or greater risk from those associated with our domestic operations.

We hold interests in joint venture properties that are under operation in Europe, Japan, South Korea, and Mexico. We have also established arrangements to develop
joint venture properties in China, and expect to pursue additional expansion opportunities outside the United States. International development and ownership activities carry risks that are different
from those we face with our domestic properties and operations. These risks include:

•

adverse
effects of changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies;

•

changes
in foreign political and economic environments, regionally, nationally, and locally;

•

challenges
of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws including corporate governance, operations, taxes, and litigation;

•

differing
lending practices;

•

differences
in cultures;

•

changes
in applicable laws and regulations in the United States that affect foreign operations;

•

difficulties
in managing international operations; and

•

obstacles
to the repatriation of earnings and cash.

Although
our international activities currently are a relatively small portion of our business (international properties represented less than 6% of the GLA of all of our properties at
December 31, 2007), to the extent that we expand our international activities, these risks could increase in significance which in turn could adversely affect our results of operations and
financial condition.


Some of our potential losses may not be covered by insurance.

We maintain commercial general liability "all risk" property coverage including fire, flood, extended coverage and rental loss insurance on our properties. Our
captive insurance company subsidiaries indemnify our general liability carrier for a specific layer of losses. A similar policy written through our subsidiary also provides a portion of our initial
coverage for property insurance and certain windstorm risks at the properties located in coastal windstorm locations. Even insured losses could result in a serious disruption to our business and delay
our receipt of revenue.

There
are some types of losses, including lease and other contract claims that generally are not insured. If an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs, we could
lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property. If this happens, we may still remain obligated for any mortgage debt
or other financial obligations related to the property.

We
currently maintain insurance coverage against acts of terrorism on all of our properties on an "all risk" basis in the amount of up to $1 billion per occurrence for certified
foreign acts of terrorism and $500 million per occurrence for non-certified domestic acts of terrorism. The current federal laws which provide this coverage are expected to operate
through 2014. Despite the existence of this insurance coverage, any threatened or actual terrorist attacks in high profile markets could adversely affect our property values, revenues, consumer
traffic and tenant sales.

Inflation may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Although inflation has not materially impacted our operations in the recent past, increased inflation could have a more pronounced negative impact on our mortgage
and debt interest and general and administrative expenses, as these costs could increase at a rate higher than our rents. Also, inflation may adversely affect tenant leases with stated rent increases,
which could be lower than the increase in inflation at any given time. Inflation could also have an adverse effect on consumer spending which could impact our tenants' sales and, in turn, our overage
rents, where applicable.

Risks Relating to Federal Income Taxes

Our failure to qualify as a REIT would have adverse tax consequences to us and our stockholders.

We cannot assure you that we will remain qualified as a REIT. Qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes is governed by highly technical and complex
provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations. If we fail to comply with those provisions, we may be subject to monetary penalties or ultimately to possible
disqualification as a REIT. If such events occurs, and if available relief provisions do not apply:

•

we
will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income;

•

we
will be subject to corporate level income tax, including any applicable alternative minimum tax, on our taxable income at regular corporate rates; and

•

unless
entitled to relief under relevant statutory provisions, we will also be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during
which qualification was lost.

As
a result, net income and funds available for distribution to our stockholders will be reduced for those years in which we fail to qualify as a REIT. Also, we would no longer be
required to distribute money to our stockholders. Although we currently intend to operate so as to qualify as a REIT, future economic, market, legal, tax or other considerations might cause us to
revoke our REIT election.

Item 2. Properties

United States Properties

Our U.S. properties primarily consist of regional malls, Premium Outlet centers, The Mills ®, community/lifestyle centers, and other properties. These
properties contain an aggregate of approximately 242 million square feet of gross leasable area, or GLA, of which we own approximately 150.8 million square feet. Total estimated retail
sales at the properties in 2007 were approximately $60 billion.

Regional
malls typically contain at least one traditional department store anchor or a combination of anchors and big box retailers with a wide variety of smaller stores connecting the
anchors. Additional stores are usually located along the perimeter of the parking area. Our 168 regional malls are generally enclosed centers and range in size from approximately 400,000 to
2.3 million square feet of GLA. Our regional malls contain in the aggregate more than 18,300 occupied stores, including approximately 675 anchors, which are mostly national retailers.

Premium
Outlet centers generally contain a wide variety of retailers located in open-air manufacturers' outlet centers. Our 38 Premium Outlet centers range in size from
approximately 200,000 to 850,000 square feet of GLA. The Premium Outlet centers are generally located near metropolitan areas including New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Boston, Washington, D.C.,
and San Francisco; or within 20 miles of major tourist destinations including Palm Springs, Napa Valley, Orlando, Las Vegas, and Honolulu.

The
Mills portfolio consists of Mills centers, regional malls, and community centers. The 17 Mills centers generally range in size from 1.0 million to 2.3 million square
feet of GLA. The Mills centers are located in major metropolitan areas and have a combination of traditional mall, outlet center, and big box retailers and entertainment uses. The 16 regional malls
typically range in size from 700,000 to 1.3 million square feet of GLA and contain a wide variety of national retailers. The four community centers are adjacent to Mills centers, and contain a
mix of big box and other local and national retail tenants.

Community/lifestyle
centers are generally unenclosed and smaller than our regional malls. Our 67 community/lifestyle centers generally range in size from approximately 100,000 to
900,000 square feet of GLA. Community/lifestyle centers are designed to serve a larger trade area and typically contain anchor stores and other tenants that are usually national retailers among the
leaders in their markets. These tenants generally occupy a significant portion of the GLA of the center. We also own traditional community shopping centers that focus primarily on value-oriented and
convenience goods and services. These centers are usually anchored by a supermarket, discount retailer, or drugstore and are designed to service a neighborhood area. Finally, we own
open-air centers adjacent to our regional malls designed to take advantage of the drawing power of the mall.

We
also have interests in 10 other shopping centers or outlet centers. These properties range in size from approximately 85,000 to 300,000 square feet of GLA and in total represent less
than 1% of our total operating income before depreciation.

As
of December 31, 2007, approximately 93.5% of the owned GLA in regional malls and the retail space of the other properties was leased, approximately 99.7% of owned GLA in the
Premium Outlet centers was leased, approximately 94.1% of the owned GLA for the Mills and 89.5% of owned GLA for the Mills regional malls was leased, and approximately 94.1% of owned GLA in the
community/lifestyle centers was leased.


We
own 100% of 198 of our properties, effectively control 19 properties in which we have a joint venture interest, and hold the remaining 103 properties through unconsolidated joint
venture interests. We are the managing or co-managing general partner or member of 310 properties. Substantially all of our joint venture properties are subject to rights of first refusal,
buy-sell provisions, or other sale rights for all partners which are customary in real estate partnership agreements and the industry. Our partners in our joint ventures may initiate these
provisions at any time, which will result in either the use of available cash or borrowings to acquire their partnership interest or the disposal of our partnership interest.

The
following property table summarizes certain data on our regional malls, Premium Outlet centers, the properties acquired in the Mills acquisition, and community/lifestyle centers
located in the United States, including Puerto Rico, as of December 31, 2007.

International Properties

Our interests in properties outside the United States are all owned through international joint venture arrangements.

European Investments

The following summarizes our joint venture investments in Europe and the underlying countries in which these joint ventures own and operate real estate properties
as of December 31, 2007:

In
addition, we jointly hold with a third party an interest in one parcel of land for development near Paris, France outside of these two joint ventures. Simon Ivanhoe and its
wholly-owned subsidiary are fully integrated European retail real estate developers, owners and managers.

Our
properties in Europe consist primarily of hypermarket-anchored shopping centers. Substantially all of our European properties are anchored by either the hypermarket retailer Auchan,
primarily in Italy, who is also our partner in GCI, or are anchored by the hypermarket Carrefour in France and Poland. Certain of the properties in Italy are subject to leaseholds whereby GCI leases
all or a portion of the premises from a third party who is entitled to receive substantially all the economic benefits of that portion of the properties. Auchan and Carrefour are the two largest
hypermarket operators in Europe.

Other International Investments

We also hold real estate interests in six joint ventures in Japan, one in Mexico, and one in South Korea. The six joint ventures in Japan operate Premium Outlet
centers in various cities in Japan and are held in joint ventures with Mitsubishi Estate Co., Ltd. and Sojitz Corporation (formerly known as Nissho Iwai Corporation). These centers have
over 1.6 million square feet of GLA and were all 100% leased as of December 31, 2007. They contain 600 stores with approximately 300 different tenants. The Premium Outlet center in
Mexico is 88% leased as of December 31, 2007, and the Premium Outlet center in South Korea is 100% leased as of December 31, 2007.

On
April 4, 2007, Gallerie Commerciali Italia (the Italian joint venture in which the Company owns a 49% interest) acquired the remaining 60% interest in the shopping gallery
at this center, which consists of 177,600 square feet of leasable area. The Company owns a 19.6% interest in the retail parks at this center, which consist of 446,900 square feet of leasable area.


Land Held for Development

We have direct or indirect ownership interests in four parcels of land held in the United States for future development, containing an aggregate of approximately
300 acres located in three states.

Also,
on December 28, 2005, we invested $50.0 million of equity for a 40% interest in a joint venture with Toll Brothers, Inc. and Meritage Homes Corp. to purchase
a 5,485-acre land parcel in northwest Phoenix from DaimlerChrysler Corporation for $312 million. The principal use of the land upon attaining entitled status is the development of
single-family homesites by our partners. As a result of the recent downturn in the residential market, during the fourth quarter of 2007 we recorded an impairment charge of $55.1 million,
$35.6 million net of tax benefit, representing our entire investment in this joint venture entity, including interest capitalized on our invested equity.

Sustainability and Energy Efficiency

Due to the size of our portfolio, we focus on energy efficiency as a core sustainability strategy. Through the continued use of energy conservation practices,
energy efficiency projects, and continuous monitoring and reporting, have reduced our energy consumption at comparable properties every year since 2003. As a result, the absolute corporate energy use
for operations under our control (which excludes electricity consumed by our tenants) has decreased by 9.7% from 2003 to 2007. The 102 million kilowatt-hours decrease in energy use for this
four-year period reduced related annual CO


emissions by over 67,932 tons. This is equivalent to the amount of carbon sequestered annually by 15,439 acres of pine
or fir forests and to approximately $11.0 million in avoided annual operating costs.

We
were awarded

NAREIT's Leader in the Light Gold Award

for the second year in a row and have been named 2008

"Energy Partner of the Year

" by the United
States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). We were the first real estate company in the S&P 500 and
the first retail property REIT to win this award.

Mortgage Financing on Properties

The following table sets forth certain information regarding the mortgages and other debt encumbering our properties and the properties held by our international
joint venture arrangements. Substantially all of the mortgage and property related debt is nonrecourse to us.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

In November of 2004, the Attorneys General of Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Connecticut filed complaints in their respective state courts against us and our
affiliate, SPGGC, Inc., alleging that the sale of co-branded, bank-issued gift cards sold in certain of our properties violated gift certificate statutes and consumer protection laws in those states.
We filed our own actions for declaratory relief in Federal district courts in each of the three states. We have also been named as a defendant in two other state court proceedings in New York which
have been brought by private parties as purported class actions. They allege violation of state consumer protection and contract laws and seek a variety of remedies, including unspecified damages and
injunctive relief.

In
2006, we received a judgment in our favor in the Federal district court in New Hampshire. The First Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed that ruling on May 30, 2007, holding that
the current gift card program is a banking product and state law regulation is preempted by federal banking laws. The First Circuit Court of Appeals did not, however, rule on the question of whether
the gift card program as it existed prior to January 1, 2005, was similarly exempt from state regulation. In February 2007, we entered into a voluntary, no-fault settlement with the
New Hampshire Attorney General relating to the gift card program in New Hampshire as it existed prior to January 1, 2005. The New Hampshire litigation was dismissed at that time.

In
October 2007, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals issued a ruling in the case brought by the Connecticut Attorney General holding that the Connecticut gift card statute could be
applied to the gift card program as it existed prior to January 1, 2005, and could prohibit the charging of administrative fees but could not prohibit the use of expiration dates on gift cards.

We
believe we have viable defenses under both state and federal laws to the pending gift card actions in Massachusetts, Connecticut and New York. Although it is not possible to provide
any assurance of the ultimate outcome of any of these pending actions, management does not believe they will have any material adverse affect on our financial position, results of operations or cash
flow.

We
are involved in various other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business. We believe that such litigation, claims and administrative proceedings will not
have a material adverse impact on our financial position or our results of operations. We record a liability when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated.

There is no established public trading market for Simon Property's Class B common stock or Class C common stock. Distributions per
share of the Class B and Class C common stock are identical to the common stock.

Holders

The number of holders of record of common stock outstanding was 2,165 as of December 31, 2007. The Class B common stock is held entirely by a voting
trust to which Melvin Simon, Herbert Simon, David Simon and certain
of their affiliates are parties and is exchangeable on a one-for-one basis into shares of common stock, and the Class C common stock is held entirely by NID Corporation,
the successor corporation of Edward J. DeBartolo Corporation, and is also exchangeable on a one-for-one basis into shares of common stock.

Dividends

We are required to pay a minimum level of dividends to maintain our status as a REIT. Our dividends and distributions of the Operating Partnership typically
exceed our net income generated in any given year primarily because of depreciation, which is a "non-cash" expense. Our future dividends and the distributions of the Operating Partnership
will be determined by the Board of Directors based on actual results of operations, cash available for dividends and limited partner distributions, and what may be required to maintain our status as a
REIT. We paid a common stock dividend of $0.84 per share in the fourth quarter of 2007.

We
offer an Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan that allows stockholders to acquire additional shares by automatically reinvesting cash dividends. Shares are acquired pursuant to the
plan at a price equal to the prevailing market price of such shares, without payment of any brokerage commission or service charge.

Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities

During the fourth quarter of 2007, we sold 6,000,000 shares of Series L Variable Rate Redeemable Preferred Stock to a single institutional investor for
$150.0 million. We used the proceeds to fund the redemption of the Series G Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock. The Series L preferred stock was not registered under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, in reliance upon the exemption contained in Section 4(2) regarding private transactions. We redeemed the series L preferred stock in the fourth
quarter of 2007 for a price equal to its liquidation value plus accrued dividends.


Issuances Under Equity Compensation Plans

For information regarding the securities authorized for issuance under our equity compensation plans, see Item 12 of this report.

Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

On July 26, 2007, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1.0 billion of our common stock over the next twenty-four

$

3,694,807

Depreciation
of Simon Property's investment in buildings and improvements reflected in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income is calculated over the
estimated original lives of the assets as follows:

•

Buildings
and Improvements — typically 10-40 years for the structure, 15 years for landscaping and parking lot, and 10 years for
HVAC equipment.

•

Tenant
Allowances and Improvements — shorter of lease term or useful life.

(3)

Initial
cost generally represents net book value at December 20, 1993, except for acquired properties and new developments after December 20, 1993. Initial cost also
includes any new developments that are opened during the current year. Costs of disposals of property are first reflected as a reduction to cost capitalized subsequent to acquisition.

(4)

Not
developed/constructed by Simon Property or its predecessors. The date of construction represents acquisition date.

(5)

Property
initial cost for these properties is the cost at the date of consolidation for properties previously accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Accumulated
depreciation amounts for properties consolidated which were previously accounted for under the equity method of accounting include the minority interest holders' portion of accumulated depreciation.
