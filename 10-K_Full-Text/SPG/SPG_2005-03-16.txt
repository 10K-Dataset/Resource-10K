Item 1. Business

Background

Simon Property Group, Inc. ("Simon Property") is a Delaware corporation that operates as a self-administered and self-managed real
estate investment trust ("REIT"). Simon Property Group, L.P. (the "Operating Partnership") is our majority-owned partnership subsidiary that owns all but one of our real estate properties. In this
report, the terms "we", "us" and "our" refer to Simon Property, the Operating Partnership and their subsidiaries.

We
are engaged primarily in the ownership, operation, leasing, management, acquisition, expansion and development of real estate properties. Our real estate properties consist primarily
of regional malls, Premium Outlet® centers and community shopping centers. As of December 31, 2004, we owned or held an interest in 297 income-producing properties in the United
States, which consisted of 172 regional malls, 71 community shopping centers, 31 Premium Outlet centers and 23 other properties in 40 states plus Puerto Rico (collectively, the "Properties", and
individually, a "Property"). Our other Properties include retail space, office space, and/or hotel components. In addition, we also own interests in twelve parcels of land held in the United States
for future development (together with the Properties, the "Portfolio"). Finally, we have ownership interests in 51 European shopping centers (located in France, Italy, Poland and Portugal); four
Premium Outlet centers in Japan; one Premium Outlet center in Mexico; and one shopping center in Canada.

The
Operating Partnership's wholly-owned subsidiary, M.S. Management Associates, Inc. (the "Management Company") provides leasing, management, and development services to most of
the Properties. In addition, insurance subsidiaries of the Management Company insure: the self-insured retention portion of our general liability program; the deductible associated with
our workers' compensation programs; and provide reinsurance for the primary layer of general liability coverage to our third party maintenance providers while performing services under contract with
us. Third party insurers provide coverage above the insurance subsidiaries' limits.

Mergers and Acquisitions

Mergers and acquisitions have been a significant component of the growth and development of our business. In 2004, we completed a series of acquisitions that
added to our overall Portfolio:

•

On
February 5, 2004 we purchased a 95% interest in Gateway Shopping Center in Austin, Texas for approximately $107.0 million.

•

On
April 1, 2004, we increased our ownership interest in Mall of Georgia Crossing from 50% to 100% for approximately $26.3 million, including the assumption of
$16.5 million of debt.

•

On
April 27, 2004, we increased our ownership interest in Bangor Mall and Montgomery Mall to approximately 67.6% and 54.4%, respectively, for approximately
$67.0 million, including the assumption of our $16.8 million share of debt.

•

On
May 4, 2004, we purchased a 100% interest in Plaza Carolina in San Juan, Puerto Rico for approximately $309.0 million.

•

On
October 14, 2004 we completed our acquisition of Chelsea Property Group, Inc. (Chelsea). The acquisition included 32 Premium Outlets in the United States, 4
Premium Outlets in Japan, 3 community centers, 21 other retail centers, and its development portfolio. The purchase price was approximately $5.2 billion including the assumption of our
$1.5 billion share of debt.

•

On
November 19, 2004 we increased our ownership interest in Lehigh Valley, located in Whitehall, Pennsylvania, to 37.6% for approximately $42.3 million,
including the assumption of our $25.9 million share of debt.

•

Finally,
on December 15, 2004, we increased our ownership interest in Woodland Hills, located in Tulsa, Oklahoma, to approximately 94.5% for approximately
$119.5 million, including the assumption of our $39.7 million share of debt.


Dispositions

As part of our strategic plan to own quality retail real estate, we continually evaluate our properties and sell those which no longer meet our strategic
criteria. We may use the capital generated from these dispositions to invest in higher-quality, higher-growth properties. We believe that the sale of these non-core Properties will not
have a material impact on our future results of operations or cash flows nor will their sale materially affect our ongoing operations. Generally, any earnings dilution from the sales on our results of
operations from these dispositions will be offset by the positive impact of our acquisitions and development and redevelopment activities.

During
2004, we sold five non-core Properties, consisting of three regional malls, one community center and one Premium Outlet. The Properties and their dates of sale were:

•

Hutchinson Mall on June 15, 2004

•

Santa Fe Premium Outlets on December 28, 2004

•

Bridgeview Court on July 22, 2004

•

Heritage Park Mall on December 29, 2004

•

Woodville Mall on September 1, 2004

In
addition, on April 7, 2004, we sold a joint venture interest in a hotel property held by the Management Company. On April 8, 2004, we sold our joint venture interest in
Yards Plaza, in Chicago, Illinois, and on August 6, 2004, we completed the court ordered sale of our joint venture interest in Mall of America, in Minneapolis, Minnesota (see Item 3).

The
sales of these properties did not result in any significant gain or loss.

Operating Policies and Strategies

The following is a discussion of our investment policies, financing policies, conflict of interest policies and policies with respect to certain
other activities. One or more of these policies may be amended or rescinded from time to time without a stockholder vote.

Investment Policies

We conduct our investment activities, except for one Property that we own directly, through the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries. Our primary business
objectives are to increase Funds From Operations ("FFO") per share, operating results and the value of our Properties while maintaining a stable balance sheet consistent with our financing policies.
We intend to achieve these objectives by:

•

pursuing
a leasing strategy that capitalizes on the desirable location of our Properties;

•

improving
the performance of our Properties by using the economies of scale that result from our size to help control operating costs and by generating additional revenues
through merchandising, marketing and promotional activities;

•

renovating
and/or expanding our Properties where appropriate;

•

developing
new shopping centers which meet our economic criteria; and

•

acquiring
additional shopping centers and the portfolios of other retail real estate companies that meet our investment criteria.

We
cannot assure you that we will achieve our business objectives.

We
develop and acquire properties to generate both current income and long-term appreciation in value. We do not limit the amount or percentage of assets that may be
invested in any particular property or type of property or in any geographic area. We may purchase or lease properties for long-term investment or develop, redevelop, and/or sell our
Properties, in whole or in part, when circumstances warrant. We participate with other entities in property ownership, through joint ventures or other types of co-ownership. These equity
investments may be subject to existing mortgage financing and other indebtedness that have priority over our equity interest.

While
we emphasize equity real estate investments, we may, at our discretion, invest in mortgages and other real estate interests consistent with our qualification as a REIT under the
Internal Revenue Code ("Code"). We do not currently intend to invest to a significant extent in mortgages or deeds of trust, however, we hold an interest in one Property through a mortgage note which
results in us receiving 100% of the economics of the Property. We may invest in participating or convertible mortgages if we conclude that we may benefit from the cash flow or any appreciation in the
value of the property.


We
may also invest in securities of other entities engaged in real estate activities or securities of other issuers. However, any of these investments would be subject to the percentage
ownership limitations and gross income tests necessary for REIT qualification under the Code. These REIT limitations mean that we cannot make an investment that would cause our real estate assets to
be less than 75% of our total assets. In addition, at least 75% of our gross income must be derived directly or indirectly from investments relating to real property or mortgages on real property,
including "rents from real property," dividends from other REIT's and, in certain circumstances, interest from certain types of temporary investments. At least 95% of our income must be derived from
such real property investments, and from dividends, interest and gains from the sale or dispositions of stock or securities or from other combinations of the foregoing.

Subject
to these REIT limitations, we may invest in the securities of other issuers in connection with acquisitions of indirect interests in real estate. Such an investment would
normally be in the form of general or limited partnership or membership interests in special purpose partnerships and limited liability companies that own one or more properties. We may, in the
future, acquire all or substantially all of the securities or assets of other REITs, management companies or similar entities where such investments would be consistent with our investment policies.

Financing Policies

We must comply with the covenant restrictions of debt agreements of the Operating Partnership that limit our ratio of debt to total market valuation. For example,
the Operating Partnership's lines of credit and the indentures for the Operating Partnership's debt securities contain covenants that restrict the total amount of debt of the Operating Partnership to
60% of adjusted total assets, as defined, and secured debt to 55% of adjusted total assets. In addition, these agreements contain other covenants requiring compliance with financial ratios.
Furthermore, the amount of debt that we may incur is limited as a practical matter by our desire to maintain acceptable ratings for our equity securities and the debt securities of the Operating
Partnership.

If
the Board of Directors determines to seek additional capital, we may raise such capital through additional equity offerings, debt financing, creation of joint ventures with existing
ownership interests in Properties, retention of cash flows or a combination of these methods. Our ability to retain cash flows is subject to Code provisions requiring REITs to distribute a certain
percentage of their taxable income. We must also take into account taxes that would be imposed on undistributed taxable income. If the Board of Directors determines to raise additional equity capital,
it may, without stockholder approval, issue additional shares of common stock or other capital stock. The Board of Directors may issue a number of shares up to the amount of our authorized capital in
any manner and on such terms and for such consideration as it deems appropriate. This may include issuing stock in exchange for property. Such securities may be senior to the outstanding classes of
common stock. Such securities also may include additional classes of preferred stock which may be convertible into common stock. Existing stockholders will have no preemptive right to purchase shares
in any subsequent offering of our securities. Any such offering could dilute a stockholder's investment in us.

We
anticipate that any additional borrowings would be made through the Operating Partnership or its subsidiaries. We might, however, incur borrowings that would be reloaned to the
Operating Partnership. Borrowings may be in the form of bank borrowings, publicly and privately placed debt instruments, or purchase money obligations to the sellers of properties. Any of such
indebtedness may be unsecured or may be secured by any or all of our assets, the Operating Partnership or any existing or new property-owning partnership. Any such indebtedness may also have full or
limited recourse to all or any portion of the assets of any of the foregoing. Although we may borrow to fund the payment of dividends, we currently have no expectation that we will regularly be
required to do so.

We
may obtain unsecured or secured lines of credit. We also may determine to issue debt securities. Any such debt securities may be convertible into capital stock or be accompanied by
warrants to purchase capital stock. We also may sell or securitize our lease receivables. The proceeds from any borrowings or financings may be used for the following:

•

financing
acquisitions;

•

developing
or redeveloping properties;

•

refinancing
existing indebtedness;

•

working
capital or capital improvements; or

•

meeting
the income distribution requirements applicable to REITs if we have income without the receipt of cash sufficient to enable us to meet such distribution
requirements.


We
also may determine to finance acquisitions through the following:

•

issuance
of shares of common stock;

•

issuance
of shares of preferred stock;

•

issuance
of additional units of limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership;

•

issuance
of preferred units of the Operating Partnership;

•

issuance
of other securities; or

•

sale
or exchange of ownership interests in Properties.

The
ability to offer units of limited partnership interest to transferors may result in beneficial tax treatment for the transferors. This is because the exchange of units for
properties may defer the recognition of gain for tax purposes by the transferor. It may also be an advantage for us since certain investors may be limited in the number of shares of our capital stock
that they may purchase.

If
the Board of Directors determines to obtain additional debt financing, we intend to do so generally through mortgages on Properties, drawings against revolving lines of credit or
term loan facilities, or the issuance of unsecured debt through the Operating Partnership. We may do this directly or through an entity owned or controlled by us. The mortgages may be
non-recourse, recourse, or cross-collateralized. We do not have a policy limiting the number or amount of mortgages that may be placed on any particular property. Mortgage financing
instruments, however, usually limit additional indebtedness on such properties.

Typically,
we invest in or form special purpose entities only to obtain permanent financing for Properties on attractive terms. Permanent financing for Properties is typically
structured as a mortgage loan on one or a group of Properties in favor of an institutional third party or as a joint venture with a third party or as a securitized financing. For securitized
financings, we are required to create special purpose entities to own the Properties. These special purpose entities are structured so that they would not be consolidated with us in the event we would
ever become subject to a bankruptcy proceeding. We decide upon the structure of the financing based upon the best terms then available to us and whether the proposed financing is consistent with our
other business objectives. For accounting purposes, we include the outstanding securitized debt of special purpose entities owning consolidated Properties as part of our consolidated indebtedness.

Conflict of Interest Policies

We maintain policies and have entered into agreements designed to reduce or eliminate potential conflicts of interest. We have adopted governance principles
governing our affairs and the Board of Directors (the Board), as well as written charters for each of the standing Committees of the Board of Directors. In addition, we have a Code of Business Conduct
and Ethics which applies to all of our officers, directors, and employees. At least a majority of the members of our Board of Directors must qualify as independent under the listing standards for New
York Stock Exchange companies and cannot be affiliated with the Simon and DeBartolo families. Any transaction between us and the Simons or the DeBartolos, including property acquisitions, service and
property management agreements and retail space leases, must be approved by a majority of non-affiliated directors.

The
sale by the Operating Partnership of any property that it owns may have an adverse tax impact on the Simons or the DeBartolos and the other limited partners of the Operating
Partnership. In order to avoid any conflict of interest between Simon Property and the limited partners of the Operating Partnership, our charter requires that at least six of our independent
directors must authorize and require the Operating Partnership to sell any property it owns. Any such sale is subject to applicable agreements with third parties. Noncompetition agreements executed by
each of the Simons contain covenants limiting the ability of the Simons to participate in certain shopping center activities in North America.

Policies With Respect To Certain Other Activities

We intend to make investments which are consistent with the REIT requirements of the Code, unless the Board of Directors determines that it is no longer in our
best interests to qualify as a REIT. The Board of Directors may make such a determination because of changing circumstances or changes in the REIT requirements. We have authority to offer shares of
our capital stock or other securities in exchange for property. We also have authority to repurchase or otherwise reacquire our shares or any other securities. We may engage in such activities in the
future. We may issue shares of our common stock to holders of units of limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership in future periods upon exercise of such holders' rights under the
Operating Partnership agreement. We


may
also repurchase shares of our common stock subject to Board approval. We have not made loans to persons, including our officers and directors. It is our policy to not make any loans to our
directors and executive officers for any purpose and all loans previously made to current executive officers have been repaid in full. We may make loans to the Management Company and to joint ventures
in which we participate.

Operating Strategies

We plan to achieve our primary business objectives through a variety of methods discussed below, although we cannot assure you that we will achieve such
objectives.

Leasing.

We pursue a leasing strategy that includes:

•

marketing
available space to maintain or increase occupancy levels;

•

renewing
existing leases and originating new leases at higher base rents per square foot;

•

negotiating
leases that allow us to recover from our tenants the majority of our property operating, real estate tax, repairs and maintenance, and advertising and promotion
expenditures; and

•

executing
leases that provide for percentage or overage rents and/or regular or periodic fixed contractual increases in base rents.

Management.

We draw upon our expertise gained through management of a
geographically diverse Portfolio,
nationally recognized as comprising high quality retail and other Properties. In doing so, we seek to maximize cash flow through a combination of:

•

an
active merchandising program to maintain our shopping centers as inviting shopping destinations;

•

efforts
to minimize overhead and operating costs which not only benefits our operations but also reduces the costs reimbursed to us from our tenants. A tenant's ability to
pay rent is affected by the percentage of its sales represented by occupancy costs, which consist of rent and expense recoveries. As sales levels increase, if expenses subject to recovery are
controlled, the tenant can afford to pay higher base rent.

•

coordinated
marketing and promotional activities that establish and maintain customer loyalty; and

•

systematic
planning and monitoring of results.

We
believe that if we are successful in our efforts to increase sales while controlling operating expenses we will be able to continue to increase base rents at the Properties.

We
manage substantially all our Properties held as joint venture Properties and as a result we derive revenues from management fees and other services.

Other Revenues.

Due to our size, tenant and vendor relationships, we also
generate revenues from other
sources, including:

•

Simon
Brand Venture ("Simon Brand") obtains revenues from establishing our malls as leading market resource providers for retailers and other businesses and consumer-focused
corporate alliances. Simon Brand revenues include payment services, national media contracts, a national beverage contract and other contracts with national companies as well as the sale of
bank-issued gift cards under the Simon brand.

•

Simon
Business Network ("Simon Business") revenues are derived from the offering of products and property operating services, resulting from its relationships with vendors,
to our tenants and others. These services include such items as waste handling, facility services, and energy services, as well as major capital expenditures such as roofing, parking lots and energy
systems.

We
also generate other revenues through the sale or lease of land adjacent to our Properties commonly referred to as "outlots" or "outparcels."

International Expansion.

Our investments in Europe, Japan, Mexico, and Canada
are currently conducted
through joint ventures. In Europe, we have investments in partnerships with LaRinacante/Auchan and Argo/Peabody (known as Gallerie Commercialai Italia ("GCI") and European Retail Enterprises, B.V.
("ERE")). In Japan, our investments are in partnerships with Mitsubishi Estate Co., Ltd. and Sojitz Corporation (formerly known as Nissho Iwai Corporation). Our Mexico investment is a joint
venture with Sordo Madaleno y Asociados

.

We account for our European and international joint venture activities under the equity method of accounting as
defined by accounting policies generally accepted in the United States.


We
believe that the expertise we have gained through the development, leasing, management, and marketing of our domestic Properties can be utilized in retail properties abroad. There
are risks inherent in international operations that may be beyond our control including:

•

changes
in foreign currency exchange rates;

•

declines
in economic conditions abroad;

•

changes
in foreign political environments; and

•

changes
in applicable laws and regulations in the United States that affect foreign operations.

Competition

We consider our principal competitors to be seven other major United States or internationally publicly-held companies that own or operate regional
malls, outlet centers, and other shopping centers in the United States and abroad. We also compete with many commercial developers, real estate companies and other owners of retail real estate that
operate in our trade areas. Some of our Properties are of the same type and are within the same market area as other competitive properties. The existence of competitive properties could have a
material adverse effect on our ability to lease space and on the level of rents we can obtain. This results in competition for both the acquisition of prime sites (including land for development and
operating properties) and for tenants to occupy the space that we and our competitors develop and manage. In addition, our Properties compete against non-physical based forms of retailing
such as catalog companies and e-commerce websites that offer retail products.

We
believe that our Portfolio is the largest, as measured by gross leasable area ("GLA"), of any publicly-traded retail REIT. In addition, we own or have an interest in more regional
malls than any other publicly-traded REIT. We believe that we have a competitive advantage in the retail real estate business as a result of:

•

the
size, quality and diversity of our Properties;

•

our
management and operational expertise;

•

our
extensive experience and relationships with retailers and lenders;

•

our
mall marketing initiatives and consumer focused strategic corporate alliances; including those developed by Simon Brand and Simon Business; and

•

our
ability to use our size to reduce the total occupancy cost of our tenants.

Our
size reduces our dependence upon individual retail tenants. Approximately 3,800 different retailers occupy more than 24,400 stores in our Properties and no retail tenant represents
more than 4.0% of our Properties' total minimum rents.

Environmental Matters

General Compliance.

We believe that the Portfolio is in compliance, in all material respects, with all Federal,
state and
local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances. Nearly all of the Portfolio have been subjected to Phase I or similar environmental audits (which
generally involve only a review of records and visual inspection of the property without soil sampling or ground water analysis) by independent environmental consultants. Phase I environmental audits
are intended to discover information regarding, and to evaluate the environmental condition of, the surveyed properties and surrounding properties. These environmental audits have not revealed, nor
are we aware of, any environmental liability that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We cannot assure you that:

•

existing
environmental studies with respect to the Portfolio reveal all potential environmental liabilities;

•

any
previous owner, occupant or tenant of a Property did not create any material environmental condition not known to us;

•

the
current environmental condition of the Portfolio will not be affected by tenants and occupants, by the condition of nearby properties, or by other unrelated third
parties; or

•

future
uses or conditions (including, without limitation, changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations or the interpretation thereof) will not result in
environmental liabilities.

Asbestos-Containing Materials.

Asbestos-containing materials are present in most of the Properties, primarily in
the form of
vinyl asbestos tile, mastics and roofing materials, which we believe are generally in good condition. Fireproofing and insulation containing asbestos is also present in certain Properties in limited
concentrations or in limited areas. The presence of such asbestos-containing materials does not violate currently applicable laws. Generally,


we
remove asbestos-containing materials as required in the ordinary course of any renovation, reconstruction, or expansion, and in connection with the retenanting of space.

Mold Management.

From time to time, during normal maintenance activities, increased levels of moisture may be
found in
building materials and mechanical systems. When this occurs, the source of the moisture (typically, due to a plumbing system malfunction or weather related damage) is corrected and the impact to
building operations is assessed. When active mold growth is reasonably suspected or identified, the services of environmental professionals are utilized to evaluate and address the situation
appropriately.

Underground Storage Tanks.

Several of the Properties contain, or at one time contained, underground storage
tanks used to
store waste oils or other petroleum products primarily related to auto service center establishments or emergency electrical generation equipment. We believe that regulated tanks have been removed,
upgraded or abandoned in accordance with applicable environmental laws. Site assessments have revealed certain soil and groundwater contamination associated with such tanks at some of these
Properties. Subsurface investigations (Phase II assessments) and remediation activities are either completed, ongoing, or scheduled to be conducted at such Properties. The costs of remediation with
respect to such matters has not been material and we do not expect these costs will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

Properties to be Developed or Acquired.

Land held for mall development or that may be acquired for development
may contain
residues or debris associated with the use of the land by prior owners or third parties. In certain instances, such residues or debris could be or could contain hazardous wastes or hazardous
substances. Prior to exercising any option to acquire properties, we typically conduct environmental due diligence consistent with acceptable industry standards.

Item 2. Properties

United States Properties

Our Properties primarily consist of regional malls, Premium Outlets, community shopping centers, and other properties. Our Properties contain an aggregate of
approximately 203 million square feet of GLA, of which we own approximately 121.7 million square feet ("Owned GLA"). Total estimated retail sales at the Properties in 2004 were
approximately $48 billion.

Regional
malls generally contain two or more anchors and a wide variety of smaller stores ("Mall" stores) located in enclosed malls connecting the anchors. Additional stores
("Freestanding" stores) are usually located along the perimeter of the parking area. Our 172 regional malls range in size from approximately 200,000 to 2.6 million square feet of GLA, with all
but four regional malls over 400,000 square feet. Our regional malls contain in the aggregate more than 18,300 occupied stores, including approximately 700 anchors, which are mostly national
retailers. Our regional mall totals include certain life-style centers when the center contains a traditional department store anchor.

Community
shopping centers are generally unenclosed and smaller than regional malls. Our 71 community shopping centers generally range in size from approximately 50,000 to 950,000
square feet of GLA. Community shopping centers generally are of three types. First, we own "power centers" that are designed to serve a larger trade area and contain at least two anchors, and usually
as many as 5 to 7 other tenants, that are usually national retailers among the leaders in their markets and occupy more than 70% of the GLA in the center. Second, we own traditional community centers
that focus primarily on value-oriented and convenience goods and services. These centers are usually anchored by a supermarket, discount retailer, or drugstore and are designed to service a
neighborhood area. Finally, we also own open air centers adjacent to our regional malls designed to take advantage of the drawing power of the mall. Our community center totals also include
life-style centers when the center does not contain a traditional department store anchor.

Premium
Outlets generally contain a wide variety of retailers located in open-air manufacturer's outlet centers. Our 31 Premium Outlets range in size from approximately
75,000 to 840,000 square feet of GLA. The Premium Outlets are generally located near metropolitan areas including New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Boston, Washington, D.C., San Francisco,
Sacramento, Atlanta, and Dallas; or within 20 miles of major tourist destinations including Palm Springs, Napa Valley, Orlando, Las Vegas and Honolulu.

We
also have interests in 23 other Properties, which are comprised of retail and office Properties. The other Properties range in size from approximately 60,000 to 819,000 square feet
of GLA. Two of these Properties contain primarily office space. The combined office and other Properties total less than 3.5% of our total GLA and no more than 2% of our total operating income before
depreciation.

approximately 99.3% of Owned GLA in the Premium Outlets was leased and approximately 91.9% of Owned GLA in the community shopping centers was leased.

We
own 100% of 210 of our 297 Properties, control 20 Properties in which we have a joint venture interest, and hold the remaining 67 Properties through unconsolidated joint venture
interests. We are the managing or co-managing general partner or member of 288 of our Properties. Substantially all of our joint venture Properties are subject to rights of first refusal,
buy-sell provisions, or other sale rights for all partners which are customary in real estate partnership agreements and the industry. Our partners in our joint ventures may initiate these
provisions at any time, which will result in either the use of available cash or borrowings to acquire their partnership interest or the disposal of our partnership interest.

In
addition, we jointly hold with a third party an interest in one parcel of land for development near Paris, France outside of these two joint ventures. ERE also
operates through a wholly-owned subsidiary, Groupe BEG, S.A. ("BEG"). ERE and BEG are fully integrated European retail real estate developers, owners and managers.

Our
properties in Europe consist primarily of hypermarket-anchored shopping centers. Substantially all of our European properties are anchored by either the hypermarket retailer Auchan,
primarily in Italy, who is our partner
in GCI, or are anchored by the hypermarket Carrefour in France, Poland, and Portugal. Certain of these properties are subject to leaseholds that entitle the lessor to receive substantially all the
economic benefits of the leased portion of the property. Auchan and Carrefour are the two largest hypermarket operators in Europe.

Other International Properties

We also hold real estate interests in four joint ventures in Japan, one in Mexico, and one in Canada. The four centers in Japan are Premium Outlets that have over
1.1 million square feet of GLA and were 100% leased as of December 31, 2004. These four Premium Outlets contained 524 stores with approximately 270 different tenants. The Mexico Premium
Outlet center opened in December of 2004 and our shopping center in Canada was opened in 2001.

Commerciali Italia, in which we have a 49% joint venture interest, has been notified by an Italian appellate court that the center which opened in February 2004, though
properly permitted, was not in accordance with the Modugno master plan. The joint venture is appealing the decision of the appellate court and is otherwise working to resolve the issue. The center
remains open. The joint venture partner has indemnified us for the amount of our allocated investment in the project.

Item 3.    Legal Proceedings

On November 15, 2004, the Attorneys General of Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Connecticut filed complaints in their respective state Superior Courts
against us and our affiliate, SPGGC, Inc., alleging that the sale of co-branded, bank-issued gift cards sold in certain of its Portfolio Properties violated gift
certificate statutes and consumer protection laws in those states. Each of these suits seeks injunctive relief, unspecified civil penalties and disgorgement of any fees determined to be improperly
charged to consumers.

In
addition, we are a defendant in three other proceedings relating to the gift card program:

Lisa Corbiles and Dana Walicky vs. Simon Property Group, Inc. d/b/a
Simon Malls, Superior Court of New Jersey, County of Essex, Docket No: ESX-L-224-04, filed January 6, 2004

;

Betty Benson and
Andrea Nay-Richardson vs. Simon Property Group, Inc., and Simon Property Group, L.P., Superior Court of Cobb County, State of Georgia, Case No.:
04-1-9617-42, filed December 9, 2004

;

Christopher Lonner vs. Simon Property Group, Inc., Supreme Court of the State of
NY, County of Westchester, Case No.: 04-2246, filed February 18, 2004, Erin Reilly, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated vs. SPG, Inc., SPG, L.P. and
SPGGC, Inc., Lee County Circuit Court, Florida, filed February 8, 2005

and

Aliza Goldman, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated vs.
Simon Property Group, Inc., Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of Nassau, filed February 7, 2005

. Each of these proceedings has been brought by a private
plaintiff as a purported class action and alleges violation of state consumer protection laws, state abandoned property and contract laws or state statutes regarding gift certificates or gift cards
and seeks a variety of remedies including unspecified damages and injunctive relief.

On
February 3, 2005, the Attorney General of the State of New York filed a petition in the Supreme Court of New York, County of New York against us and the Operating Partnership
alleging violations of New York law with respect to gift card sales. The New York proceeding was settled on March 1, 2005.

We
believe that we have viable defenses under both state and federal laws to the gift card actions. Although it is not possible to provide any assurance of the ultimate outcome of any
of these pending actions, management does not believe that an adverse outcome would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flow.

Triple Five of Minnesota, Inc., a Minnesota corporation, v. Melvin Simon, et. al.

On or about November 9, 1999, Triple Five
of Minnesota, Inc. commenced an action in the District Court for the State of Minnesota, Fourth Judicial District, against, among others, Mall of America, certain members of the Simon family
and entities allegedly controlled by such individuals, and us. The action was later removed to federal court. On September 10, 2003, the
court issued its decision in a Memorandum and Order (the "Order"). In the Order, the court found that certain entities and individuals breached their fiduciary duties to Triple Five. The court did not
award Triple Five damages but instead awarded Triple Five equitable and other relief and imposed a constructive trust on that portion of the Mall of America owned by us. Specifically, as it relates to
us, the court ordered that Triple Five was entitled to purchase from us the one-half partnership interest that we purchased in October 1999, provided Triple Five remits to us the
sum of $81.38 million within nine months of the Order. On August 6, 2004, Triple Five closed on its purchase of our one-half partnership interest. The court further held that
we must disgorge all "net profits" that we received as a result of our ownership interest in the Mall from October 1999 to the present.

We
have appealed the Order and the Ancillary Relief Order to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. Briefing on the appeals is complete and oral argument took place
on October 18, 2004. It is not possible to provide any assurance on the ultimate outcome of this litigation.

As
a result of the Order, we initially recorded a $6.0 million charge for our share of the estimated loss in 2003. In the first quarter of 2004, as a result of the May 3,
2004 memorandum issued by the court appointed mediator, which has now been affirmed by the court, we recorded an additional $13.5 million charge for our share of the loss that is included in
"(Loss) gain on sales of assets and other, net" in the accompanying consolidated financial statements of operations and comprehensive income. We ceased recording any contribution to either net income
or Funds from Operations ("FFO") from the results of operations of Mall of America as of September 1, 2003.

We
are also involved in various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business. We believe that such routine litigation, claims and administrative proceedings will
not have a material adverse impact on our financial position or our results of operations. We record a liability when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If the
reasonable estimate of a probable loss is a range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate, the mid point in the range is accrued. If a loss is not probable or a probable loss cannot be
reasonably estimated, no liability is recorded.

trust to which Melvin Simon, Herbert Simon, David Simon and certain of their affiliates are parties and is exchangeable on a one-for-one basis into shares of common stock, and
the Class C common stock is held entirely by NID Corporation, the successor corporation of Edward J. DeBartolo Corporation, and is also exchangeable on a one-for-one
basis into shares of common stock.

Distributions

Simon Property qualifies as a REIT under the Code. To maintain our status as a REIT, we are required each year to distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of
our taxable income after certain adjustments. Future distributions are determined at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on our actual cash flow, financial condition, capital
requirements, the annual REIT distribution requirements and such other factors as our Board of Directors deem relevant.

Simon
Property offers an Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan for its common shares that allows stockholders, at their election, to acquire additional shares by automatically
reinvesting cash dividends. Shares are acquired pursuant to the plan at a price equal to the prevailing market price of such shares, without payment of any brokerage commission or service charge.

On
October 4, 2004, we announced a partial quarterly dividend of $0.409783 per share of common stock payable on November 30, 2004, for which ultimate payment of this
dividend was subject to the completion of the merger with Chelsea. The purpose of this dividend, which was paid on November 30, 2004, was to align the dividend payment periods for normal
recurring dividends paid on the common stock of Simon Property and Chelsea. Given that the completion of the merger with Chelsea was on October 14, 2004, the record date for the partial
dividend was October 13, 2004. This partial quarterly dividend was paid in addition to a later dividend to aggregate the $0.65 total quarterly dividend rate.

Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities

During the fourth quarter of 2004, we issued 709,013 shares of common stock to our limited partners in exchange for an equal number of units. The issuance
of the shares of common stock was made pursuant to the terms of the Partnership Agreement of the Operating Partnership and was exempt from registration under the Securities Act of


as amended, in reliance upon Section 4(2) as a private offering. We subsequently registered the resale of the shares of common stock under the Securities Act.
