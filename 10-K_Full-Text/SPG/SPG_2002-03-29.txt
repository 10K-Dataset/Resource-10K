Item 1. Business

Background and Description of the Business

Who we are – Simon Property Group, Inc. ("SPG"), a Delaware corporation, is a self-administered and
self-managed real estate investment trust ("REIT"). Each share of common stock of SPG is paired ("Paired Shares") with 1/100

th

of a share of common stock of SPG Realty
Consultants, Inc. ("SRC" and together with SPG, the "Companies"). Simon Property Group, L.P. (the "SPG Operating Partnership"), is the primary subsidiary of SPG. Units of ownership interest
("Units") in the SPG Operating Partnership are paired ("Paired Units") with Units of SPG Realty Consultants, L.P. (the "SRC Operating Partnership" and together with the SPG Operating Partnership, the
"Operating Partnerships"). The SRC Operating Partnership is the primary subsidiary of SRC. In this report, the terms "we", "us" and "our" refer to the Companies, the Operating Partnerships, and their
subsidiaries. The background and description of our business information required by this item is incorporated herein by reference to the Notes to Financial Statements, Note 1, paragraphs 1
through 8, on pages 51 and 52 of the 2001 Annual Report to Shareholders which is filed as Exhibit 13.1 to this Form 10-K.

As
of December 31, 2001, we owned or held an interest in 252 income-producing properties in the United States, which consisted of 166 regional malls, 72 community shopping
centers, five specialty retail centers, four office and mixed-use properties and five value-oriented super-regional malls in 36 states (the "Properties"). We also own 11 parcels of land
held for future development (together with the Properties, the "Portfolio" or the "Portfolio Properties"). In addition, we have ownership interests in seven additional retail real estate properties
operating in Europe and Canada.

Mergers and Acquisitions

Mergers and acquisitions have been a significant component of the growth and development of our business. Beginning with the merger with DeBartolo
Realty
Corporation in August of 1996 for approximately $3.0 billion, we have completed five major mergers and/or acquisitions that have helped shape the current organization. These acquisitions
included the merger with Corporate Property Investors, Inc., in 1998 for approximately $5.9 billion. Information regarding certain of these mergers and acquisitions is incorporated
herein by reference to the Notes to Financial Statements, Notes 3 and 4 (acquisitions portion only), on pages 52 to 53 of the 2001 Annual Report to Shareholders filed as Exhibit 13.1 to this
Form 10-K.

Subsequent
to December 31, 2001, we signed a definitive agreement to purchase, jointly with Westfield America Trust and The Rouse Company, the assets of Rodamco North America
N.V. for $5.3 billion. Our portion of the acquisition includes the purchase of the remaining ownership interests in four of our existing joint venture assets and new ownership interests in nine
additional properties. Our share of the purchase price is $1.55 billion including $570.0 million in debt and perpetual preferred stock assumed.

General

During 2001, regional malls (including specialty retail centers and retail space in the mixed-use Properties), community centers and the remaining
Portfolio comprised 92.2%, 4.9%, and 2.9%, respectively, of combined consolidated rent revenues and tenant reimbursements. The Properties contain an aggregate of approximately 187.4 million
square feet of gross leasable area ("GLA"), of which we own 111.3 million square feet ("Owned GLA"). More than 4,100 different retailers occupy more than 20,100 stores in the Properties. Total
estimated retail sales at the Properties in 2001 were approximately $39.0 billion.


SPG
and a subsidiary of the SPG Operating Partnership are taxed as REITs under sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and applicable
Treasury regulations relating to REIT qualification. SPG is self-administered and self-managed and does not engage or pay a REIT advisor. SPG provides management, development,
leasing, accounting, finance and legal, design and construction expertise through its own personnel or, where appropriate, through outside professionals.

Operating Strategies

Our primary business objectives are to increase cash generated from operations per Paired Share and to increase the value of the Portfolio Properties.
We plan to
achieve these objectives through a variety of methods discussed below, although we cannot assure you that that we will achieve such objectives.

Leasing.

We pursue an active leasing strategy that includes:

•

aggressively
marketing available space

•

renewing
existing leases at higher base rents per square foot, and

•

originating
leases that provide for percentage or overage rents and/or regular or periodic fixed contractual increases in base rents.

Management.

We draw upon our expertise gained through management of a geographically diverse
Portfolio nationally recognized
as high quality retail and mixed-use Properties. In doing so, we seek to maximize cash flow through a combination of:

•

an
active merchandising program to maintain our shopping centers as inviting shopping destinations

•

efforts
to minimize overhead and operating costs

•

coordinated
marketing and promotional activities that establish and maintain customer loyalty, and

•

systematic
planning and monitoring of results.

Acquisitions.

As noted above, we expect to acquire certain assets from Rodamco North America, N.V.
in 2002. We may
selectively acquire other individual properties and portfolios of properties that meet our investment criteria as opportunities arise. We continue to review and evaluate a limited number of
acquisition opportunities and will continue our focus on acquiring highly productive, market dominant malls. We believe that acquisition activity is a component of our growth strategy.

Development in the United States.

Our strategy is to selectively develop new properties in major
metropolitan areas that
exhibit strong population and economic growth. We opened one regional mall during 2001. This addition added approximately 0.6 million square feet of GLA to the Portfolio at a cost of
approximately $68.8 million. Currently there are no new developments under construction. We believe given the current economic environment there are no new developments that meet our
risk-reward criteria in order to commence development in the near term, especially in a weakening leasing economic environment.

We
also have direct or indirect interests in eleven parcels of land being held for future development in eight states totaling approximately 772 acres. We believe that we are well
positioned to pursue future development opportunities as conditions warrant.

Strategic Expansions and Renovations.

One of our key objectives is to increase the profitability and
market share of the
Properties through strategic renovations and expansions. We invested approximately $118.2 million on redevelopment projects during 2001. We also have a number of renovation and/or expansion
projects currently either under construction or in preconstruction


development. However, for the same reasons we are limiting development activities, we have reduced our renovation and expansion plans for the near term.

International Expansion.

We believe the expertise we have gained through the development and
management of our domestic
Properties can be utilized in retail properties throughout the world. We intend to continue pursuing international opportunities on a selected basis to enhance shareholder value. There are risks
inherent in international business that may be beyond our control. These risks include the following risks that may have a negative impact on our results of operations:

•

changes
in foreign currency exchange rates

•

declines
in economic conditions abroad

•

changes
in foreign political environments, and

•

changes
in foreign laws.

Other Revenues.

We also generate revenues due to our size and tenant relationships from:

•

mall
marketing initiatives

•

consumer
focused strategic corporate alliances, and

•

delivering
competitively priced property operating services to our tenants.

Competition

We believe that we have a competitive advantage in the retail real estate business as a result of:

•

the
size, quality and diversity of our Properties

•

our
management and operational expertise

•

our
use of innovative retailing concepts

•

our
extensive experience and relationships with retailers and lenders

•

our
mall marketing initiatives and consumer focused strategic corporate alliances, and

•

our
ability to use our size to deliver competitively priced property operating services to our tenants.

We
believe that the Portfolio is the largest, as measured by GLA, of any publicly traded REIT. In addition, we own more regional malls than any other publicly traded REIT. For these
reasons, we believe that we are the leader in our industry.

All
of the Portfolio Properties are located in developed areas. Certain of our Properties are of the same type and are within the same market area as other competitive properties. The
existence of competitive properties could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease space and on the level of rents we can obtain.

There
are numerous other commercial developers, real estate companies and other owners of real estate that compete with us in our trade areas. This results in competition for both
acquisition of prime sites (including land for development and operating properties) and for tenants to occupy the space that we and our competitors develop and manage.

Environmental Matters

General Compliance.

We believe that the Portfolio Properties are in compliance, in all material
respects, with all Federal,
state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances. Nearly all of the Portfolio Properties have been subjected to Phase I or similar environmental
audits (which generally involve only a review of records and visual inspection of the property without soil sampling or ground water analysis) by independent environmental consultants. Phase I
environmental audits are intended to discover information regarding, and to evaluate the environmental condition of, the surveyed properties and surrounding properties. These environmental audits have
not


revealed, nor are we aware of, any environmental liability that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We cannot assure you that:

•

existing
environmental studies with respect to the Portfolio Properties reveal all potential environmental liabilities

•

any
previous owner, occupant or tenant of a Portfolio Property created any material environmental condition not known to us

•

the
current environmental condition of the Portfolio Properties will not be affected by tenants and occupants, by the condition of nearby properties, or by
unrelated third parties, or

•

future
uses or condition (including, without limitation, changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations or the interpretation thereof) will not
result in environmental liabilities.

Asbestos-Containing Materials.

Asbestos-containing materials are present in most of the Properties,
primarily in the form of
vinyl asbestos tile, mastics and roofing materials, which we believe are generally in good condition. Fireproofing and insulation containing asbestos is also present in certain Properties in limited
concentrations or in limited areas. The presence of such asbestos-containing materials does not violate currently applicable laws. Generally, we remove asbestos-containing materials as required in
the ordinary course of any renovation, reconstruction and expansion, and in connection with the retenanting of space.

Underground Storage Tanks.

Several of the Portfolio Properties contain, or at one time contained,
underground storage tanks
used to store waste oils or other petroleum products primarily related to auto services center establishments or emergency electrical generation equipment. We believe that regulated tanks have been
removed, upgraded or abandoned in place in accordance with applicable environmental laws. Site assessments have revealed certain soil and groundwater contamination associated with such tanks at some
of these Properties. Subsurface investigations (Phase II assessments) and remediation activities are either completed, ongoing, or scheduled to be conducted at such Properties. The cost of remediation
with respect to such matters has not been material and we do not expect these costs will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

Properties to be Developed or Acquired.

Land held for shopping mall development or that may be
acquired for development may
contain residues or debris associated with the use of the land by prior owners or third parties. In certain instances, such residues or debris could be or contain hazardous wastes or hazardous
substances. Prior to exercising any option to acquire any of the optioned properties, we will conduct environmental due diligence consistent with acceptable industry standards.

Employees

At February 28, 2002 we and our affiliates employed approximately 4,170 persons at various centers and offices throughout the United States, of
which
approximately 1,590 were part-time. Approximately 940 of these employees were located at our headquarters.

Insurance

We have comprehensive liability, fire, flood, extended coverage and rental loss insurance with respect to our Properties. The impact of the events of
September 11, 2001 has affected our insurance programs. Our insurance programs are discussed in detail in Item 7 – Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations in this Form 10-K.

Corporate Headquarters

Our executive offices are located at National City Center, 115 West Washington Street, Indianapolis, Indiana 46204, and our telephone number is
(317) 636-1600.

Item 2. Properties

Portfolio Properties

Our Properties primarily consist of regional malls and community shopping centers. Regional malls generally contain two or more anchors and a wide
variety of
smaller stores ("Mall" stores) located in enclosed malls connecting the anchors. Additional stores ("Freestanding" stores) are usually located along the perimeter of the parking area. Our 166 regional
malls range in size from approximately 300,000 to 2.8 million square feet of GLA, with all but four regional malls over 400,000 square feet. Our regional malls contain in the aggregate more
than 17,000 occupied stores, including over 650 anchors which are mostly national retailers. As of December 31, 2001, regional malls (including specialty retail centers and retail space in the
mixed-use Properties) represented 84.8% of total GLA, 79.3% of Owned GLA and 86.4% of total annualized base rent of the Properties.

Community
shopping centers are generally unenclosed and smaller than regional malls. Most of our 72 community shopping centers in the Properties range in size from approximately 50,000
to 600,000 square feet of GLA. Community shopping centers generally are of two types. First, we own traditional community centers that focus primarily on value-oriented and convenience goods and
services. These centers are usually anchored by a supermarket, drugstore or discount retailer and are designed to service a neighborhood area. Second, we own "power centers" that are designed to serve
a larger trade area and contain at least two anchors that are usually national retailers among the leaders in their markets and occupy more than 70% of the GLA in the center. As of December 31,
2001, community shopping centers represented 9.1% of total GLA, 10.8% of Owned GLA and 6.0% of the total annualized base rent of the Properties.

We
also have interests in five specialty retail centers, four office and mixed-use Properties and five value-oriented super-regional malls. The specialty retail centers
contain approximately 1,843,000 square feet of GLA and do not have anchors. These properties feature retailers and entertainment facilities in a distinctive shopping environment and location. The four
office and mixed-use Properties range in size from approximately 512,000 to 1,030,000 square feet of GLA. Two of these Properties are regional malls with connected office buildings, and
two are located in mixed-use developments and contain
primarily office space. The value-oriented super-regional malls range in size from approximately 1.0 million to 1.6 million square feet of GLA. These Properties combine retail outlets,
manufacturers' off-price stores and other value-oriented tenants. As of December 31, 2001, value-oriented super-regional malls represented 3.5% of total GLA, 5.8% of Owned GLA and
5.4% of the total annualized base rent of the Properties.

As
of December 31, 2001, approximately 91.9% of the Mall and Freestanding Owned GLA in regional malls, specialty retail centers and the retail space in the mixed use Properties
was leased, approximately 93.7% of the Owned GLA in the value-oriented super-regional malls was leased, and approximately 89.3% of Owned GLA in the community shopping centers was leased.

Of
our 252 Properties, we own 100% of 171 of the Properties and the remainder we hold as joint venture interests. We are the managing or co-managing general partner or
member of all but 15 of the Properties held as joint venture interests.

expect to acquire the remaining ownership interests in these properties in connection with the expected closing of the Rodamco North America, N.V. acquisition in 2002.

(28)

These
properties are classified as assets held for sale. See Note 4 in the Notes to Financial Statements in the 2001 Annual Report to Shareholders, filed as Exhibit 13.1 to this Form
10-K.

(29)

We
are currently in negotiations with the properties' lenders to dispose of these properties in 2002.


Land Held for Development

We have direct or indirect ownership interests in eleven parcels of land held for future development, containing an aggregate of approximately 772
acres located
in eight states. In addition, we have an indirect interest in one parcel of land totaling 109 acres through M.S. Management Associates, Inc., which was previously held for development, but is
now being marketed for sale.

Joint Ventures

At certain of the Properties held as joint ventures, we and our partners each have rights of first refusal, subject to certain conditions, to acquire
additional
ownership in the Property should the other partner decide to sell its ownership interest. In addition, certain of the Properties held as joint ventures contain "buy-sell" provisions, which
gives the partners the right to trigger a purchase or sale of ownership interest amongst the partners.

Mortgage Financing on Properties

The following table sets forth certain information regarding the mortgages and other debt encumbering the Properties. Substantially all of the
mortgage and
property related debt is nonrecourse. In addition, certain limited partner Unitholders have guaranteed a portion of the property related debt in the aggregate amount of $559.3 million.

There
is no established public trading market for SPG's Class B common stock or Class C common stock. Distributions per share of the Class B and Class C
common stock were identical to the other Paired Shares.

Holders

The number of holders of record of the Paired Shares was 2,455 as of March 20, 2002. Additionally, the Class B common stock is held entirely
by a
voting trust to which Melvin Simon, Herbert Simon, David Simon and certain of their affiliates are parties and is exchangeable on a one-for-one basis into Paired Shares, and
the Class C common stock is held entirely by The Edward J. DeBartolo Corporation and is also exchangeable on a one-for-one basis into Paired Shares.

Distributions

SPG qualifies as a REIT under the Code. To maintain its status as a REIT, SPG is required each year to distribute to its shareholders at least 90% of
its taxable
income after certain adjustments.


Future
distributions are determined in the discretion of the Boards of Directors and will depend on the actual cash flow of the Companies, their financial condition, capital
requirements, the annual REIT
distribution requirements and such other factors as the Board of Directors of the Companies deem relevant.

The
Companies have an Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan") which allows shareholders to acquire additional Paired Shares by automatically reinvesting cash dividends. Paired
Shares are acquired pursuant to the Plan at a price equal to the prevailing market price of such Paired Shares, without payment of any brokerage commission or service charge. Shareholders who do not
participate in the Plan continue to receive cash dividends, as declared.

Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities

During the fourth quarter of 2001, the Companies issued 536,806 Paired Shares to limited partners of the Operating Partnerships in exchange for an
equal number
of Units. The issuance of the securities was made pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreements for the Operating Partnerships and was exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended, in reliance upon Section 4(2) as an exempt private offering. The Companies subsequently registered the resale of the Paired Shares under the Securities Act in accordance with the
terms of the agreements with the exchanging limited partners.

have audited in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States, the financial statements of SIMON PROPERTY GROUP, INC. and SPG REALTY CONSULTANTS, INC.
included in this Form 10-K and have issued our report thereon dated March 28, 2002. Our audits were made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic financial
statements taken as a whole. The schedule, "Schedule III: Real Estate and Accumulated Depreciation", as of December 31, 2001, of Simon Property Group, Inc. and SPG Realty
