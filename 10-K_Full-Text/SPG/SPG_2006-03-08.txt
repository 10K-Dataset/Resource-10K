Item 1. Business

Background

Simon Property Group, Inc. ("Simon Property") is a Delaware corporation that operates as a self-administered and self-managed real
estate investment trust ("REIT"). Simon Property Group, L.P. (the "Operating Partnership") is a majority-owned partnership subsidiary of Simon Property that owns all of our real estate properties. In
these notes to the audited consolidated financial statements, the terms "we", "us" and "our" refer to Simon Property, the Operating Partnership and their subsidiaries.

We
are engaged primarily in the ownership, development, and management of retail real estate, primarily regional malls, Premium Outlet® centers and community/lifestyle
centers. As of December 31, 2005, we owned or held an interest in 286 income-producing properties in the United States, which consisted of 171 regional malls, 33 Premium Outlet centers, 71
community/lifestyle centers, and 11 other shopping centers or outlet centers in 39 states and Puerto Rico (collectively, the "Properties", and individually, a "Property"). We also own interests in ten
parcels of land held for future development (together with the Properties, the "Portfolio"). Finally, we have ownership interests in 51 European shopping centers (in France, Italy and Poland), five
Premium Outlet centers in Japan, and one Premium Outlet center in Mexico.

Operating Policies and Strategies

The following is a discussion of our investment policies, financing policies, conflict of interest policies and policies with respect to certain other activities.
One or more of these policies may be amended or rescinded from time to time without a stockholder vote.

Investment Policies

We conduct our investment activities through the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries. Our primary business objectives are to increase Funds From Operations
("FFO") per share, operating results and the value of our Properties while maintaining a stable balance sheet consistent with our financing policies. We intend to achieve these objectives by:

•

developing
new shopping centers which meet our economic criteria;

•

renovating
and/or expanding our Properties where appropriate;

•

acquiring
additional shopping centers and portfolios of other retail real estate companies that meet our investment criteria;

•

pursuing
a leasing strategy that capitalizes on the desirable location of our Properties;

•

generating
additional revenues through merchandising, marketing and promotional activities;

•

adding
mixed-use elements to our Portfolio through our land intensification initiatives. This includes adding elements such as multifamily, condominiums, hotel
and self-storage at selected locations; and

•

improving
the performance of our Properties by using the economies of scale that result from our size to help control operating costs.

We
cannot assure you that we will achieve our business objectives.

We
develop and acquire properties to generate both current income and long-term appreciation in value. We do not limit the amount or percentage of assets that may be
invested in any particular property or type of property or in any geographic area. We may purchase or lease properties for long-term investment or develop, redevelop, and/or sell our
Properties, in whole or in part, when circumstances warrant. We participate with other entities in property ownership, through joint ventures or other types of co-ownership. These equity
investments may be subject to existing mortgage financing and other indebtedness that have priority over our equity interest.

While
we emphasize equity real estate investments, we may, at our discretion, invest in mortgages and other real estate interests consistent with our qualification as a REIT under the
Internal Revenue Code ("Code"). We do not currently intend to invest to a significant extent in mortgages or deeds of trust; however, we hold an interest in one Property through a mortgage note which
results in us receiving 100% of the economics of the Property. We may invest in participating or convertible mortgages if we conclude that we may benefit from the cash flow or any appreciation in the
value of the property.


We
may also invest in securities of other entities engaged in real estate activities or securities of other issuers. However, any of these investments would be subject to the percentage
ownership limitations and gross income tests necessary for REIT qualification under the Code. These REIT limitations mean that we cannot make an investment that would cause our real estate assets to
be less than 75% of our total assets. In addition, at least 75% of our gross income must be derived directly or indirectly from investments relating to real property or mortgages on real property,
including "rents from real property," dividends from other REIT's and, in certain circumstances, interest from certain types of temporary investments. At least 95% of our income must be derived from
such real property investments, and from dividends, interest and gains from the sale or dispositions of stock or securities or from other combinations of the foregoing.

Subject
to these REIT limitations, we may invest in the securities of other issuers in connection with acquisitions of indirect interests in real estate. Such an investment would
normally be in the form of general or limited partnership or membership interests in special purpose partnerships and limited liability companies that own one or more properties. We may, in the
future, acquire all or substantially all of the securities or assets of other REITs, management companies or similar entities where such investments would be consistent with our investment policies.

Financing Policies

We must comply with the covenant restrictions of debt agreements of the Operating Partnership that limit our ratio of debt to total market valuation. For example,
the Operating Partnership's lines of credit and the indentures
for the Operating Partnership's debt securities contain covenants that restrict the total amount of debt of the Operating Partnership to 65%, or 60% in relation to certain debt, of total assets, as
defined under the related arrangement, and secured debt to 50% of total assets. In addition, these agreements contain other covenants requiring compliance with financial ratios. Furthermore, the
amount of debt that we may incur is limited as a practical matter by our desire to maintain acceptable ratings for our equity securities and the debt securities of the Operating Partnership.

If
the Board of Directors ("Board") determines to seek additional capital, we may raise such capital through additional equity offerings, debt financing, creation of joint ventures with
existing ownership interests in Properties, retention of cash flows or a combination of these methods. Our ability to retain cash flows is subject to Code provisions requiring REITs to distribute a
certain percentage of their taxable income. We must also take into account taxes that would be imposed on undistributed taxable income. If the Board determines to raise additional equity capital, it
may, without stockholder approval, issue additional shares of common stock or other capital stock. The Board may issue a number of shares up to the amount of our authorized capital in any manner and
on such terms and for such consideration as it deems appropriate. This may include issuing stock in exchange for property. Such securities may be senior to the outstanding classes of common stock.
Such securities also may include additional classes of preferred stock, which may be convertible into common stock. Existing stockholders will have no preemptive right to purchase shares in any
subsequent offering of our securities. Any such offering could dilute a stockholder's investment in us.

We
anticipate that any additional borrowings would be made through the Operating Partnership or its subsidiaries. We might, however, incur borrowings that would be reloaned to the
Operating Partnership. Borrowings may be in the form of bank borrowings, publicly and privately placed debt instruments, or purchase money obligations to the sellers of properties. Any of such
indebtedness may be unsecured or may be secured by any or all of our assets, the Operating Partnership or any existing or new property-owning partnership. Any such indebtedness may also have full or
limited recourse to all or any portion of the assets of any of the foregoing. Although we may borrow to fund the payment of dividends, we currently have no expectation that we will regularly be
required to do so.

We
may obtain unsecured or secured lines of credit. We also may determine to issue debt securities. Any such debt securities may be convertible into capital stock or be accompanied by
warrants to purchase capital stock. We also may sell or securitize our lease receivables. The proceeds from any borrowings or financings may be used for the following:

•

financing
acquisitions;

•

developing
or redeveloping properties;

•

refinancing
existing indebtedness;

•

working
capital or capital improvements; or

•

meeting
the income distribution requirements applicable to REITs, if we have income without the receipt of cash sufficient to enable us to meet such distribution
requirements.


We
also may determine to finance acquisitions through the following:

•

issuance
of shares of common stock;

•

issuance
of shares of preferred stock;

•

issuance
of additional units of limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership;

•

issuance
of preferred units of the Operating Partnership;

•

issuance
of other securities; or

•

sale
or exchange of ownership interests in Properties.

The
ability to offer units of limited partnership interest to transferors may result in beneficial tax treatment for the transferors. This is because the exchange of units for
properties may defer the recognition of gain for tax purposes by the transferor. It may also be advantageous for us since certain investors may be limited in the number of shares of our capital stock
that they may purchase.

If
the Board determines to obtain additional debt financing, we intend to do so generally through mortgages on Properties, drawings against revolving lines of credit or term loan
facilities, or the issuance of unsecured debt through the Operating Partnership. We may do this directly or through an entity owned or controlled by us. The mortgages may be non-recourse,
recourse, or cross-collateralized. We do not have a policy limiting the number or amount of mortgages that may be placed on any particular property. Mortgage financing instruments, however, usually
limit additional indebtedness on such properties.

Typically,
we invest in or form special purpose entities only to obtain permanent financing for Properties on attractive terms. Permanent financing for Properties is typically
structured as a mortgage loan on one or a group of Properties in favor of an institutional third party, as a joint venture with a third party, or as a securitized financing. For securitized
financings, we are required to create special purpose entities to own the Properties. These special purpose entities are structured so that they would not be consolidated with us in the event we would
ever become subject to a bankruptcy proceeding. We decide upon the structure of the financing based upon the best terms then available to us and whether the proposed financing is consistent with our
other business objectives. For accounting purposes, we include the outstanding securitized debt of special purpose entities owning consolidated Properties as part of our consolidated indebtedness.

Conflict of Interest Policies

We maintain policies and have entered into agreements designed to reduce or eliminate potential conflicts of interest. We have adopted governance principles
governing our affairs and the Board, as well as written charters for each of the standing Committees of the Board. In addition, we have a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which applies to all of
our officers, directors, and employees. At least a majority of the members of our Board must qualify as independent under the listing standards for New York Stock Exchange companies and cannot be
affiliated with the Simon or DeBartolo families. Any transaction between us and the Simons or the DeBartolos, including property acquisitions, service and property management agreements and retail
space leases, must be approved by a majority of non-affiliated directors.

The
sale by the Operating Partnership of any property that it owns may have an adverse tax impact on the Simons or the DeBartolos and the other limited partners of the Operating
Partnership. In order to avoid any conflict of interest between Simon Property and the limited partners of the Operating Partnership, our charter requires that at least six of our independent
directors must authorize and require the Operating Partnership to sell any property it owns. Any such sale is subject to applicable agreements with third parties. Noncompetition agreements executed by
each of the Simons contain covenants limiting the ability of the Simons to participate in certain shopping center activities in North America.

Policies With Respect To Certain Other Activities

We intend to make investments which are consistent with the REIT requirements of the Code, unless the Board determines that it is no longer in our best interests
to qualify as a REIT. The Board may make such a determination because of changing circumstances or changes in the REIT requirements. We have authority to offer shares of our capital stock or other
securities in exchange for property. We also have authority to repurchase or otherwise reacquire our shares or any other securities. We may engage in such activities in the future. We may issue shares
of our common stock to holders of units of limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership in future periods upon exercise of such holders' rights under the Operating Partnership agreement.
We may also repurchase shares of our common stock


subject
to Board approval. We have not made loans to persons, including our officers and directors. It is our policy to not make any loans to our directors or executive officers for any purpose. We
may make loans to our management company and to joint ventures in which we participate.

Operating Strategies

We plan to achieve our primary business objectives through a variety of methods discussed below, although we cannot assure you that we will achieve such
objectives.

Leasing.

We pursue a leasing strategy that includes:

•

marketing
available space to maintain or increase occupancy levels;

•

renewing
existing leases and originating new leases at higher base rents per square foot;

•

negotiating
leases that allow us to recover from our tenants the majority of our property operating, real estate tax, repairs and maintenance, and advertising and promotion
expenditures; and

•

executing
leases that provide for percentage or overage rents and/or regular or periodic fixed contractual increases in base rents.

Management.

We draw upon our expertise gained through management of a geographically diverse Portfolio,
nationally recognized as comprising high quality retail and other Properties. In doing so, we seek to maximize cash flow through a combination of:

•

an
active merchandising program to maintain our shopping centers as inviting shopping destinations;

•

efforts
to minimize overhead and operating costs which not only benefits our operations but also reduces the costs reimbursed to us from our tenants. A tenant's ability to
pay rent is affected by the percentage of its sales represented by occupancy costs, which consist of rent and expense recoveries. As sales levels increase, if expenses subject to recovery are
controlled, the tenant can afford to pay higher base rent.

•

coordinated
marketing and promotional activities that establish and maintain customer loyalty; and

•

systematic
planning and monitoring of results.

We
believe that if we are successful in our efforts to increase sales while controlling operating expenses we will be able to continue to increase base rents at the Properties.

We
manage substantially all our Properties held as joint venture Properties and as a result we derive revenues from management fees and other services.

Other Revenues.

Due to our size, tenant and vendor relationships, we also generate revenues from the
activities of:

•

Simon
Brand Ventures ("Simon Brand") obtains revenues from establishing our malls as leading market resource providers for retailers and other businesses and
consumer-focused corporate alliances. Simon Brand revenues include payment services, national media contracts, a national beverage contract and other contracts with national companies as well as the
fees derived from the issuance of bank-issued co-branded gift cards.

•

Simon
Business Network ("Simon Business") revenues are derived from the offering of products and property operating services, resulting from its relationships with vendors,
to our tenants and others. These services include such items as waste handling, facility services, and energy services, as well as major capital expenditures such as roofing, parking lots and energy
systems.

We
also generate other revenues through the sale or lease of land adjacent to our Properties commonly referred to as "outlots" or "outparcels."

International Expansion.

Our investments in Europe, Japan, and Mexico are currently conducted through
joint ventures. In Europe, we have investments in partnerships with Groupe Auchan (known as Gallerie Commerciali Italia ("GCI") in Italy) and Ivanhoe Cambridge, Inc. (known as European Retail
Enterprises, B.V. ("ERE") in France and Poland). In Japan, our investments are in partnerships with Mitsubishi Estate Co., Ltd. and Sojitz Corporation (formerly known as Nissho Iwai
Corporation). Our Mexico investment is a joint venture with Sordo Madaleno y Asociados

.

We account for our international joint venture activities under
the equity method of accounting, as defined by accounting policies generally accepted in the United States. We are also evaluating additional investments opportunities in Korea and China through
additional joint venture relationships.


We
believe that the expertise we have gained through the development, leasing, management, and marketing of our Properties in the United States can be utilized in retail properties
abroad. There are risks inherent in international operations that may be beyond our control which are described in the following section entitled "Risk Factors."

Mergers and Acquisitions

Mergers and acquisitions have been a significant component of the growth and development of our business. In 2005, we completed two acquisitions that added to our
overall Portfolio:

•

On
November 18, 2005, we purchased a 37.99% interest in Springfield Mall in Springfield, Pennsylvania for approximately $39.3 million, including the issuance
of our share of debt of $29.1 million.

•

On
November 21, 2005, we purchased a 50% interest in Coddingtown Mall in Santa Rosa, California for approximately $37.1 million, including the assumption of
our share of debt of $10.5 million.

Dispositions

As part of our strategic plan to own quality retail real estate, we continually evaluate our properties and sell those which no longer meet our strategic
criteria. We may use the capital generated from these dispositions to invest in higher-quality, higher-growth properties. We believe that the sale of these non-core Properties will not
have a material impact on our future results of operations or cash flows nor will their sale materially affect our ongoing operations. We expect that any earnings dilution from the sales on our
results of operations from these dispositions will be offset by the positive impact of acquisition, development and redevelopment activities.

During
2005, we sold or disposed of sixteen previously consolidated non-core properties, consisting of four regional malls, one community/lifestyle center, nine other Outlet
centers, and two office buildings. The properties and the month and year of disposition were:

Regional Malls:

Community/Lifestyle Center:

•

Cheltenham Square — November 2005

•

Grove at Lakeland Square — July 2005

•

Southgate Mall — November 2005

Outlet Centers:

•

Eastland Mall (Oklahoma) — December 2005

•

Lakeland Factory Outlet Mall — March 2005

•

Biltmore Square — December 2005

•

Factory Stores of America

Office Buildings:

(Various properties — all December 2005):

•

Riverway — June 2005

— Draper, Arcadia, Hanson, Tri-Cities, Tupelo,

•

O'Hare International Center — June 2005

Union City, West Frankfort, and Patriot Plaza

The sale of these properties resulted in our recording an aggregate gain on the sale or disposition of these properties of $146.1 million,
$146.9 million of which was reported as gain on disposal or sale of discontinued operations, net. In addition, on January 11, 2005, Metrocenter, a regional mall located in Phoenix, Arizona, in
which we held a 50% interest, was sold. On December 22, 2005, we sold our 38% interest in our Canadian property, Forum Entertainment Centre. Both of these properties were accounted for on the
equity method of accounting.

Competition

We consider our principal competitors to be seven other major United States or internationally publicly-held companies that own or operate regional
malls, outlet centers, and other shopping centers in the United States and abroad. We also compete with many commercial developers, real estate companies and other owners of retail real estate that
operate in our trade areas. Some of our Properties and investments are of the same type and are within the same market area as competitor properties. The existence of competitive properties could have
a material adverse effect on our ability to lease space and on the level of rents we can obtain. This results in competition for both the acquisition of prime sites (including land for development and
operating properties) and for tenants to occupy the space that we and our competitors develop and manage. In addition, our Properties compete against other forms of retailing, such as catalog and
e-commerce websites, that offer retail products and services.

We
believe that our Portfolio is the largest, as measured by gross leasable area ("GLA"), of any publicly-traded retail REIT. In addition, we own or have an interest in more regional
malls than any other publicly-traded REIT. We believe that we have a competitive advantage in the retail real estate business as a result of:

•

the
size, quality and diversity of our Properties;


•

our
management and operational expertise;

•

our
extensive experience and relationships with retailers and lenders;

•

our
mall marketing initiatives and consumer focused strategic corporate alliances; including those developed by Simon Brand and Simon Business; and

•

our
ability to use our size to reduce the total occupancy cost of our tenants.

Our
size reduces our dependence upon individual retail tenants. Approximately 4,200 different retailers occupy more than 24,000 stores in our Properties and no retail tenant represents
more than 4.0% of our Properties' total minimum rents.

•

serves as Simon Property's Senior Vice President and Treasurer. He joined MSA in 1989 and held various financial positions with MSA until 1993 and thereafter has held
various positions with Simon Property. Mr. Juster became Treasurer in 2001.

Item 1A. Risk Factors.

The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements
made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and presented elsewhere by our management from time to time. These factors, among others, may have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, operating results and cash flows, and you should carefully consider them. It is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. You should not consider this list to be a
complete statement of all potential risks or uncertainties. Past performance should not be considered an indication of future performance.

Risks Relating to Debt and the Financial Markets

We have a substantial debt burden that could affect our future operations.

As of December 31, 2005, our consolidated mortgages and other indebtedness, net of the related premium and discount, totaled $14.0 billion, of which
approximately $1.4 billion matures during 2006, including recurring principal amortization. We are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash
flow from operations will be insufficient to meet required debt service. Our debt service costs generally will not be reduced when developments, such as the entry of new competitors or the loss of
major tenants, could cause a reduction in income from a Property. Should such events occur, our operations may be adversely affected. If a Property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and
income from the Property is insufficient to pay that indebtedness, the Property could be foreclosed upon by the mortgagee resulting in a loss of income and a decline in our total asset value.

We depend on external financings for our growth and ongoing debt service requirements.

We depend, primarily, on external financings, principally debt financings, to fund the growth of our business and to ensure that we can meet ongoing maturities of
our outstanding debt. Our access to financing depends on our credit rating, the willingness of banks to lend to us and conditions in the capital markets in general. We cannot assure you that we will
be able to obtain the financing we need for future growth or to meet our debt service as obligations mature, or that the financing available to us will be on acceptable terms.

Adverse changes in our credit rating could affect our borrowing capacity and borrowing terms.

Our outstanding senior unsecured notes and preferred stock are periodically rated by nationally recognized credit rating agencies. The credit ratings are based on
our operating performance, liquidity and leverage ratios, overall financial position, and other factors viewed by the credit rating agencies as relevant to our industry and the economic outlook in
general. Our credit rating can affect the amount of capital we can access, as well as the terms of any financing we obtain. Since we depend primarily on debt financing to fund our growth, adverse
changes in our credit rating could have a negative effect on our future growth.

Rising interest rates could adversely affect our debt service costs.

As of December 31, 2005, approximately $2.2 billion of our total consolidated debt, adjusted to reflect outstanding derivative instruments, was
subject to floating interest rates. In a rising interest rate environment, these debt service costs will increase. Increased debt service costs would adversely affect our cash flow. The impact of
changes in market rates of interest on the fair value of our debt and, in turn, our future earnings and cash flows appears elsewhere in this report.


Our hedging interest rate protection arrangements may not effectively limit our interest rate risk.

We manage our exposure to interest rate risk by a combination of interest rate protection agreements to effectively fix or cap a portion of our variable rate
debt, or in the case of a fair value hedge, effectively convert fixed rate debt to variable rate debt. In addition, we refinance fixed rate debt at times when we believe rates and terms are
appropriate. Our efforts to manage these exposures may not be successful.

Our
use of interest rate hedging arrangements to manage risk associated with interest rate volatility may expose us to additional risks, including a risk that a counterparty to a
hedging arrangement may fail to honor its obligations. Developing an effective interest rate risk strategy is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest
rate fluctuations. There can be no assurance that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition. Our termination of these hedging
agreements typically involve costs, such as transaction fees or breakage costs.

Rising interest rates could also make our equity securities less attractive.

One of the factors that may influence the price of our equity securities in public markets is the annual distribution rate we pay as compared with the yields on
alternative investments. Any significant increase in interest rates could lead holders of our equity securities to seek higher yields through other investments, which could adversely affect the market
price of our equity securities.

Factors Affecting Real Estate Investments and Operations

We face risks associated with the acquisition, development and expansion of properties.

We regularly acquire and develop new properties and expand and redevelop existing Properties, and these activities are subject to various risks. We may not be
successful in pursuing acquisition, development or redevelopment/expansion opportunities, and newly acquired, developed or redeveloped/expanded properties may not perform as well as expected. We are
subject to other risks in connection with any acquisition, development and redevelopment/expansion activities, including the following:

•

construction
costs of a project may be higher than projected, potentially making the project unfeasible or unprofitable;

•

we
may not be able to obtain financing or to refinance construction loans on favorable terms, if at all;

•

we
may be unable to obtain zoning, occupancy or other governmental approvals;

•

occupancy
rates and rents may not meet our projections and the project may not be profitable; and

•

we
may need the consent of third parties such as anchor tenants, mortgage lenders and joint venture partners, and those consents may be withheld.

If
a development or redevelopment/expansion project is unsuccessful, either because it is not meeting our expectations when operational or was not completed according to the project
planning, we could lose our investment in the project. Further, if we guarantee the property's financing, our loss could exceed our investment in the project.

We are subject to risks related to owning retail real estate.

We are subject to risks incidental to the ownership and operation of retail real estate. These risks include, among others:

•

the
risks normally associated with changes in the general economic climate;

•

trends
in the retail industry;

•

creditworthiness
of tenants;

•

competition
for tenants and customers;

•

consumer
confidence;

•

impact
of terrorist activities;

•

changes
in tax laws;

•

interest
and foreign currency exchange rates;

•

the
availability of financing; and

•

potential
liability under environmental and other laws.


Real estate investments are relatively illiquid.

Our Properties represent a substantial portion of our total consolidated assets. These investments are relatively illiquid. As a result, our ability to sell one
or more of our Properties or investments in real estate in response to any changes in economic or other conditions is limited. If we want to sell a Property, we cannot assure you that we will be able
to dispose of it in the desired time period or that the sales price of a Property will exceed the cost of our investment.

Environmental Risks

As owners of real estate, we can face liabilities for environmental contamination.

Federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require us, as a current or previous owner or operator of real
property, to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at a Property or at impacted neighboring properties. These laws often impose liability regardless of
whether the property owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances. These laws and regulations may require the abatement or removal of asbestos
containing materials in the event of damage, demolition or renovation, reconstruction or expansion of a Property and also govern emissions of and exposure to asbestos fibers in the air. Those laws and
regulations also govern the installation, maintenance and removal of underground storage tanks used to store waste oils or other petroleum products. Many of our Properties contain, or at one time
contained, asbestos containing materials or underground storage tanks (primarily related to auto service center establishments or emergency electrical generation equipment). The costs of
investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances may be substantial and could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition but is not estimable. The presence
of contamination, or the failure to remediate contamination, may also adversely affect our ability to sell, lease or redevelop a Property or to borrow using a Property as collateral.

Our efforts to identify environmental liabilities may not be successful.

Although we believe that the Portfolio is in substantial compliance with Federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations regarding
hazardous or toxic substances, this belief is based on limited testing. Nearly all of the Properties have been subjected to Phase I or similar environmental audits. These environmental audits have not
revealed, nor are we aware of, any environmental liability that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. However, we cannot assure you that:

•

existing
environmental studies with respect to the Portfolio reveal all potential environmental liabilities;

•

any
previous owner, occupant or tenant of a Property did not create any material environmental condition not known to us;

•

the
current environmental condition of the Portfolio will not be affected by tenants and occupants, by the condition of nearby properties, or by other unrelated third
parties; or

•

future
uses or conditions (including, without limitation, changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations or the interpretation thereof) will not result in
environmental liabilities.

Retail Operations Risks

We are subject to risks that affect the general retail environment.

Our concentration in the real estate market means that we are subject to the risks that affect the retail environment generally, including the levels of consumer
spending, seasonality, the willingness of retailers to lease space in our shopping centers, tenant bankruptcies, changes in economic conditions, consumer confidence and terrorist activities. Any one
or more of these factors could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.

We may not be able to lease newly developed Properties and renew leases and relet space at existing Properties.

We may not be able to lease new Properties to an appropriate mix of tenants or for rents that are consistent with our projections. Also, when leases for our
existing Properties expire, the premises may not be relet or the terms of reletting, including the cost of allowances and concessions to tenants, may be less favorable than the current lease terms. To
the extent that our leasing plans are not achieved, our cash generated before debt repayments and capital expenditures could be adversely affected.


Certain Properties depend on anchor tenants to attract shoppers and could be adversely affected by the loss of a key anchor tenant.

Regional malls are typically anchored by department stores and other large tenants. The value of certain of our Properties could be adversely affected if
department stores or other large tenants fail to comply with their contractual obligations, seek concessions in order to continue operations, or cease their operations. Department store and larger
store, or "big box", consolidations typically result in the closure of existing stores or duplicate store locations. We do not control the disposition of those department stores or larger stores that
we do not own. We also may not control the vacant space that is not re-leased in those stores we do own. Other tenants may be entitled to modify the terms of their existing leases in the
event of such closures. The modification could be unfavorable to us as the lessor and decrease rents or expense recovery charges. Additionally, major tenant
closures may result in decreased customer traffic which could lead to decreased sales at other stores. If the sales of stores operating in our Properties were to decline significantly due to closing
of anchors, economic conditions, or other reasons, tenants may be unable to pay their minimum rents or expense recovery charges. In the event of default by a tenant or anchor store, we may experience
delays and costs in enforcing our rights as landlord to recover amounts due to us under the terms of our agreements with those parties.

We face potential adverse effects from tenants' bankruptcies.

Bankruptcy filings by retailers occur frequently in the course of our operations. We are continually re-leasing vacant spaces resulting from tenant
terminations. The bankruptcy of a tenant, particularly an anchor tenant, may make it more difficult to lease the remainder of the affected Properties. Future tenant bankruptcies could adversely affect
our Properties or impact our ability to successfully execute our re-leasing strategy.

Risks Relating to Joint Venture Properties

We have limited control with respect to certain Properties partially owned or managed by third parties, which may adversely affect our ability to sell or refinance the Properties at the most
advantageous time for us.

As of December 31, 2005, we owned interests in 146 income-producing properties with other parties. Of those, 20 Properties are included in our consolidated
financial statements. We account for the other 126 properties under the equity method of accounting (joint venture properties). We serve as general partner or property manager for 59 of these 146
properties; however, certain major decisions, such as selling or refinancing these properties, require the consent of the other owners. The other owners also have other participating rights that we
consider substantive for purposes of determining control over the properties' assets. The remaining joint venture properties are managed by third parties. These limitations may adversely affect our
ability to sell, refinance, or otherwise operate these properties.

We guarantee debt or otherwise provide support for a number of joint venture Properties.

Joint venture debt is the liability of the joint venture and is typically secured by a mortgage on the joint venture Property. As of December 31, 2005, we
have guaranteed or have provided letters of credit to support $41.6 million
of our total $3.2 billion share of joint venture mortgage and other indebtedness. A default by a joint venture under its debt obligations may expose us to liability under a guaranty or letter
of credit.

Other Factors Affecting Our Business

Our Common Area Maintenance (CAM) contributions may not allow us to recover the majority of our operating expenses from tenants.

CAM costs typically include allocable energy costs, repairs, maintenance and capital improvements to common areas, janitorial services, administrative, property
and liability insurance costs, and security costs. We historically have used leases with variable CAM provisions that adjust to reflect inflationary increases. However, we are making a concerted
effort to shift from variable to fixed CAM contributions for our cost recoveries which will fix our tenants' CAM contributions to us. As a result, our CAM contributions may not allow us to recover all
operating costs and, we cannot assure you that we will succeed in our efforts to recover a substantial portion of these costs in the future.


We face a wide range of competition that could affect our ability to operate profitably.

Our Properties compete with other retail properties for tenants on the basis of the rent charged and location. The principal competition may come from existing or
future developments in the same market areas and from discount shopping centers, outlet malls, catalogues, discount shopping clubs and electronic commerce. The presence of competitive properties also
affects our ability to lease space and the level of rents we can obtain. Renovations and expansions at competing malls could also negatively affect our Properties.

We
also compete with other retail property developers to acquire prime development sites. In addition, we compete with other retail property companies for attractive tenants and
qualified management.

We expect to continue to pursue international expansion opportunities that may subject us to different or greater risk from those associated with our domestic operations.

We hold interests in joint venture properties in Europe, Japan and Mexico. We have also established arrangements to develop joint venture properties in China and
Korea, and expect to pursue additional expansion opportunities outside the United States. International development and ownership activities carry risks that are different from those we face with our
domestic Properties and operations. These risks include:

•

adverse
effects of changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies;

•

changes
in foreign political environments, regionally, nationally, and locally;

•

challenges
of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws including corporate governance, operations, taxes, and litigation;

•

differing
lending practices;

•

differences
in cultures;

•

changes
in applicable laws and regulations in the United States that affect foreign operations;

•

difficulties
in managing international operations; and

•

obstacles
to the repatriation of earnings and cash.

Although
our international activities currently are a relatively small portion of our business (international properties represented less than 6% of the GLA of all of our properties at
December 31, 2005), to the extent that we expand our international activities, these risks could increase in significance and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

Some of our potential losses may not be covered by insurance.

We maintain commercial general liability "all risk" property coverage including fire, flood, extended coverage and rental loss insurance on our Properties. One of
our subsidiaries indemnifies our general liability carrier for a specific layer of losses. A similar policy written through our subsidiary also provides a portion of our initial coverage for property
insurance and certain windstorm risks at the Properties located in Florida. Even insured losses could result in a serious disruption to our business and delay our receipt of revenue.

There
are some types of losses, including lease and other contract claims that generally are not insured. If an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs, we could
lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a Property, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the Property. If this happens, we may still remain obligated for any mortgage debt
or other financial obligations related to the Property.

The
events of September 11, 2001 significantly affected our insurance programs. Although insurance rates remain high, since the President signed into law the Terrorism Risk
Insurance Act (TRIA) in November of 2002, the price of terrorism insurance has steadily decreased, while the available capacity has been substantially increased. We have purchased terrorism insurance
covering all Properties. The program provides limits up to $1 billion per occurrence for Certified (Foreign) acts of terrorism and $500 million per occurrence for
Non-Certified (Domestic) acts of terrorism. The coverage is written on an "all risk" policy form. In December of 2005, the President signed into law the Terrorism Risk Insurance Extension
Act (TRIEA) of 2005, thereby extending the federal terrorism insurance backstop through 2007. TRIEA narrows terms and conditions afforded by TRIA for 2006 and 2007 by: 1) excluding lines of
coverage for commercial automobile, surety, burglary and theft, farm owners' multi-peril and professional liability; 2) raising the certifiable event trigger mechanism from $5 million to
$50 million during 2006 and to $100 million during 2007; and 3) increasing the deductibles and co-pays assigned to insurance companies. Upon the


expiration
of TRIEA in 2007, we could pay higher premiums for comparable terrorism coverage and/or obtain or be otherwise able to secure less coverage than we have currently.

Terrorist attacks may adversely affect the value of our properties.

Our higher profile Properties or markets they operate in could be potential targets for terrorism attacks, due to the large quantities of people at the Property
or in the surrounding areas. Threatened or actual terrorist attacks in these high profile markets could directly or indirectly impact our Properties by resulting in lower property values, a decline in
revenue, or a decline in customer traffic and, in turn, a decline in our tenants' sales.

Inflation may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Although inflation has not materially impacted our operations in the recent past, increased inflation could have a more pronounced negative impact on our mortgage
and debt interest and general and administrative expenses, as these costs could increase at a rate higher than our rents. Also, inflation may adversely affect tenant leases with stated rent increases,
which could be lower than the increase in inflation at any given time. Inflation could also have an adverse effect on consumer spending which could impact our tenants' sales and, in turn, our overage
rents, where applicable.

Risks Relating to Federal Income Taxes

Our failure to qualify as a REIT would have adverse tax consequences to us and our stockholders.

We cannot assure you that we will remain qualified as a REIT. Qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes is governed by highly technical and complex
Internal Revenue Code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations. If we fail to qualify as a REIT and any available relief provisions do not apply:

•

we
will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income;

•

we
will be subject to corporate level income tax, including any applicable alternative minimum tax, on our taxable income at regular corporate rates; and

•

unless
entitled to relief under relevant statutory provisions, we will also be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during
which qualification was lost.

As
a result, net income and funds available for distribution to our stockholders will be reduced for those years in which we fail to qualify as a REIT. Also, we would no longer be
required to distribute money to our stockholders. Although we currently intend to operate so as to qualify as a REIT, future economic, market, legal, tax or other considerations might cause us to
revoke our REIT election.

On
October 22, 2004 President Bush signed the American Jobs Creation Act which included several provisions of the REIT Improvement Act, which builds in some flexibility to the
REIT rules. This Act provides for monetary penalties in lieu of REIT disqualification. This better matches the severity of the penalty to the REIT's error and therefore reduces the possibility of
disqualification.

Item 2. Properties

United States Properties

Our Properties primarily consist of regional malls, Premium Outlet® centers, community/lifestyle centers, and other properties. Our Properties contain
an aggregate of approximately 200 million square feet of GLA, of which we own approximately 121.7 million square feet ("Owned GLA"). Total estimated retail sales at the Properties in
2005 were approximately $51 billion.

Regional
malls typically contain at least one traditional department store anchor or a combination of anchors and big box retailers with a wide variety of smaller stores ("Mall" stores)
located in enclosed malls connecting the anchors. Additional stores ("Freestanding" stores) are usually located along the perimeter of the parking area. Our 171 regional malls range in size from
approximately 400,000 to 2.0 million square feet of GLA. Our regional malls contain in the aggregate more than 18,300 occupied stores, including approximately 700 anchors, which are mostly
national retailers. Our regional mall totals include certain lifestyle centers when the center contains a traditional department store anchor.

Community/lifestyle
centers are generally unenclosed and smaller than our regional malls. Our 71 community/lifestyle centers generally range in size from approximately 100,000 to
600,000 square feet of GLA. Community/lifestyle centers are designed to serve a larger trade area and typically contain at least two anchors and other tenants that are usually national
retailers among the leaders in their markets. These tenants generally occupy a significant portion of the GLA of the center. We also own traditional community shopping centers that focus primarily on
value-oriented and convenience goods and services. These centers are usually anchored by a supermarket, discount retailer, or drugstore and are designed to service a neighborhood area. Finally, we own
open-air centers adjacent to our regional malls designed to take advantage of the drawing power of the mall.

Premium
Outlet centers generally contain a wide variety of retailers located in open-air manufacturer's outlet centers. Our 33 Premium Outlet centers range in size from
approximately 200,000 to 600,000 square feet of GLA. The Premium Outlet centers are generally located near metropolitan areas including New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Boston, Washington, D.C.,
San Francisco, Sacramento, Atlanta, and Dallas; or
within 20 miles of major tourist destinations including Palm Springs, Napa Valley, Orlando, Las Vegas, and Honolulu.

We
also have interests in 11 other shopping centers or outlet centers. These other Properties range in size from approximately 85,000 to 300,000 square feet of GLA. The combined other
Properties represent less than 1% of our total operating income before depreciation.

We
own 100% of 197 of our 286 Properties, effectively control 20 Properties in which we have a joint venture interest, and hold the remaining 69 Properties through
unconsolidated joint venture interests. We are the managing or co-managing general partner or member of 276 of our Properties. Substantially all of our joint
venture Properties are subject to rights of first refusal, buy-sell provisions, or other sale rights for all partners which are customary in real estate partnership agreements and the
industry. Our partners in our joint ventures may initiate these provisions at any time, which will result in either the use of available cash or borrowings to acquire their partnership interest or the
disposal of our partnership interest.

International Properties

We own interests in properties outside the United States through the following international joint venture arrangements.

European Investments

Subsequent
to December 31, 2005, we and our partner acquired additional interests and now each own 50% of ERE.

In
addition, we jointly hold with a third party an interest in one parcel of land for development near Paris, France outside of these two joint ventures. ERE also operates through a
wholly-owned subsidiary, Groupe BEG, S.A. ("BEG"). ERE and BEG are fully integrated European retail real estate developers, owners and managers.

Our
properties in Europe consist primarily of hypermarket-anchored shopping centers. Substantially all of our European properties are anchored by either the hypermarket retailer Auchan,
primarily in Italy, who is also our partner in GCI, or are anchored by the hypermarket Carrefour in France and Poland. Certain of these properties are subject to leaseholds whereby GCI leases all or a
portion of the premises from a third party who is entitled to receive substantially all the economic benefits of that portion of the properties. Auchan and Carrefour are the two largest hypermarket
operators in Europe.

Other International Investments

We also hold real estate interests in five joint ventures in Japan and one in Mexico. The five Premium Outlet centers in Japan have over 1.3 million square
feet of GLA and were 100% leased as of December 31, 2005. These five Premium Outlet centers contained 576 stores with approximately 273 different tenants. The Premium Outlet center in Mexico
opened in December of 2004.

Gallerie
Commerciali Italia, in which we have a 49% joint venture interest, has been notified by an Italian appellate court that the center which opened in February 2004,
though properly permitted, was not in accordance with the Modugno master plan. The joint venture is appealing the decision of the appellate court and is otherwise working to resolve the issue. The
center remains open. The joint venture partner has indemnified us for the amount of our allocated investment in the project.

(6)

Subsequent
to December 31, 2005, we acquired additional ownership interests and now hold a 50% ownership interest in ERE.


Land Held for Development

We have direct or indirect ownership interests in ten parcels of land held in the United States for future development, containing an aggregate of approximately
560 acres located in five states.

On
December 28, 2005, we invested $50 million of equity for a 40% interest in a joint venture with Toll Brothers, Inc. (Toll Brothers) and Meritage Homes Corp.
(Meritage Homes) to purchase a 5,485-acre land parcel in northwest Phoenix from DaimlerChrysler Corporation for $312 million. Toll Brothers and Meritage Homes each plan to build a
significant number of homes on the site. We have the option to purchase a substantial portion of the commercial property for retail uses. Other parcels may also be sold to third parties. Initial plans
call for a mixed-use master planned community, which will include approximately 4,840 acres of single-family homes and attached homes. Approximately 645 acres of commercial and retail
development will include schools, community amenities and open space. Initial home sales are tentatively scheduled to begin in 2009. The joint venture, of which Toll Brothers is the managing member,
expects to develop a master planned community of approximately 12,000 to 15,000 residential units.

Energy Costs Conservation

In 2003, we began monitoring and benchmarking our energy consumption and initiated a process to assess energy efficiency across our enclosed mall Properties. In
2004, we implemented a comprehensive strategy to improve energy efficiency. This included the launch of our Energy Best Practices Program which challenged managers of our enclosed mall Properties to
examine their operating practices in an effort to reduce energy costs without affecting comfort, safety or reliability, and to develop strategic relationships for investing in cost-effective, energy-
efficient projects. In 2005, we enhanced our monitoring capabilities with the implementation of a web-based energy tracking tool enabling management to review energy usage and costs on a
real time basis.

Through
the energy management efforts implemented at comparable mall properties, we reduced electricity usage by 133 million kWh's for 2004 and 2005 combined, as compared to
2003. This represented a 6.8 percent reduction in electricity usage across a portfolio of comparable properties. The EPA estimates this reduction in electricity usage further translates to the
avoidance of 84,038 metric tons of carbon dioxide. In addition, the EPA also calculates that this is equivalent to 18,190 cars not driven for one year, 689 acres of forest preserved from deforestation
or saved electrical energy to power 10,788 US homes for a full year.

As
a result of these efforts, we were named a finalist for the 7

th

Annual Platts Global Energy Award for Industry Leadership. In their nominating letter, Platts said
"Simon Property Group has illustrated tremendous leadership through its outstanding achievements." In addition, we received the Bronze Leader for the Light Award from the National Association of Real
Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) in recognition of excellence in energy efficiency and is awarded in collaboration with the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Simon Property was the only
retail REIT to receive this award.

Mortgage Financing on Properties

The following table sets forth certain information regarding the mortgages and other debt encumbering our Properties and the properties held by our international

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

On November 15, 2004, the Attorneys General of Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Connecticut filed complaints in their respective state Superior Courts
against us and our affiliate, SPGGC, Inc., alleging that the sale of co-branded, bank-issued gift cards sold in certain Properties violated gift certificate statutes and
consumer protection laws in those states. Each of these suits seeks injunctive relief, unspecified civil penalties and disgorgement of any fees determined to be improperly charged to consumers.

In
addition, we are a defendant in three other proceedings relating to the gift card program:

Betty Benson and Andrea Nay-Richardson vs. Simon Property
Group, Inc., and Simon Property Group, L.P., Superior Court of Cobb County, State of Georgia, Case No.: 04-1-9617-42, filed December 9,

;

Christopher Lonner vs. Simon Property Group, Inc., Supreme Court of the State of NY, County of Westchester, Case No.: 04-2246, filed
February 18, 2004

; and

Aliza Goldman, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated vs. Simon Property Group, Inc., Supreme Court of the State
of New York, County of Nassau, filed February 7, 2005

. Each of these proceedings has been brought by a private plaintiff as a purported class action and alleges violation of
state consumer protection laws, state abandoned property and contract laws or state statutes regarding gift certificates or gift cards and seeks a variety of remedies including unspecified damages and
injunctive relief.

We
believe that we have viable defenses under both state and federal laws to the above gift card actions. Although it is not possible to provide any assurance of the ultimate outcome of
any of these pending actions, management does not believe that an adverse outcome would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flow.

Triple Five of Minnesota, Inc., a Minnesota corporation, v. Melvin Simon, et al.

On or about November 9, 1999, Triple Five of
Minnesota, Inc. commenced an action in the District Court for the state of Minnesota, Fourth Judicial District, against, among others, Mall of America, certain members of the Simon family and
entities allegedly controlled by such individuals, and us. The action was later removed to federal court. On September 10, 2003, the court issued its decision in a Memorandum and Order (the
"September Order"). In the September Order, the court found that certain entities and individuals breached their fiduciary duties to Triple Five. The court did not award Triple Five damages but
instead awarded Triple Five equitable and other relief and imposed a constructive trust on that portion of the Mall of America owned by us. Specifically, as it relates to us, the court ordered that
Triple Five was entitled to purchase from us the one-half partnership interest that we purchased in October 1999, provided Triple Five remits the sum of $81.38 million within
nine months of the September Order. On August 6, 2004, Triple Five closed on its purchase of our one-half partnership interest and the court further held that we must disgorge all
"net profits" that we received as a result of our ownership interest in the Mall from October 1999 to the that date.

As
a result of the September Order, we initially recorded a $6.0 million charge for our share of the estimated loss in 2003. In the first quarter of 2004, as a result of a
May 3, 2004 memorandum issued by the court appointed mediator, which has now been affirmed by the court, we recorded an additional $13.5 million charge for our share of the loss that is
included in "(Loss) gain on sales of interests in unconsolidated entities and other assets, net" in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. We ceased recording
any contribution to net income from the results of operations of Mall of America as of September 1, 2003.

We
appealed the September Order to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. On April 21, 2005, the Court of Appeals issued its opinion, affirming in part and
reversing in part the Order of the trial court. The Appellate Court opinion changes the equitable remedy contained in the September Order and requires that the one-half partnership
interest Triple Five acquired from us pursuant to the September Order must instead be offered, for the same price, to Mall of America Associates, a general partnership in which Triple Five and an
entity affiliated with the Simon family are 50/50 partners ("MOAA"). If MOAA refuses to purchase the interest, then Triple Five must transfer back to us one-half of the interest it
acquired from us in August, 2004. Triple Five, as managing partner of MOAA, has elected to cause MOAA to acquire the one-half partnership interest. In addition, Triple Five asked the Trial
Court to grant it additional relief, namely to cause the Simon family partner in MOAA to be disassociated from that partnership and to terminate the existing management contract for the Mall with our
subsidiary. The trial court issued an order on December 23, 2005 ("December Order"), denying Triple Five's request for dissociation of the Simon family partner in MOAA, but granting Triple
Five's request that they be permitted to terminate the existing management contract for the Mall with our subsidiary. We have appealed that portion of the December Order granting Triple Five the right
to terminate the management contract. On January 18, 2006, Triple Five transferred to MOAA the partnership interest it acquired from us in August, 2004, for a purchase price of approximately
$23.1 million. The purchase price was financed with a new credit facility secured by distributions payable to MOAA's partner. In connection with the resolution of this matter, the Simon family
transferred, under certain circumstances, the right to receive cash flow distributions and capital transaction proceeds attributable to one-half of the interest that


MOAA
acquired from Triple Five (or 25%), subject to the new credit facility, to the Operating Partnership. The Simon family did not transfer its partnership interest in MOAA to us, and the Simon
family retains the right to make all decisions regarding that partnership interest. As a result of the transfer to us of the right to receive cash flow distributions and capital transaction proceeds,
we will recognize a gain in the first quarter of 2006 to recognize this beneficial interest, including prior earnings of the partnership since August, 2004. We will also begin to record contributions
to net income and FFO representing 25% of the results of operations at Mall of America as a result of this arrangement.

We
are involved in various other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business. We believe that such routine litigation, claims and administrative proceedings will
not have a material adverse impact on our financial position or our results of operations. We record a liability when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated.

There is no established public trading market for Simon Property's Class B common stock or Class C common stock. Distributions per
share of the Class B and Class C common stock are identical to the common stock.

Holders

The number of holders of record of common stock outstanding was 2,098 as of December 31, 2005. The Class B common stock is held entirely by a voting
trust to which Melvin Simon, Herbert Simon, David Simon and certain of their affiliates are parties and is exchangeable on a one-for-one basis into shares of common stock, and
the Class C common stock is held entirely by NID Corporation, the successor corporation of Edward J. DeBartolo Corporation, and is also exchangeable on a one-for-one
basis into shares of common stock.

Distributions

Simon Property qualifies as a REIT under the Code. We are required to pay a minimum level of dividends to maintain our status as a REIT. Our dividends and limited
partner distributions typically exceed our net income generated in any given year primarily because of depreciation, which is a "non-cash" expense. Our future dividends and the
distributions of the Operating Partnership will be determined by the Board based on actual results of operations, cash available for dividends and limited partner distributions, and what may be
required to maintain our status as a REIT. The Board declared and we paid a common stock dividend of $0.70 per share in the fourth quarter of 2005.

Simon
Property offers an Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan for its common shares that allows stockholders, at their election, to acquire additional shares by automatically
reinvesting cash dividends. Shares are acquired pursuant to the plan at a price equal to the prevailing market price of such shares, without payment of any brokerage commission or service charge.

Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities

During the fourth quarter of 2005, we issued 519,706 shares of common stock to limited partners in exchange for an equal number of units. The issuance of the
shares of common stock was made pursuant to the terms of the Partnership Agreement of the Operating Partnership and was exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933 as amended, in
reliance upon Section 4(2) as a private offering. We will subsequently register the resale of these shares of common stock under the Securities Act during 2006.

Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

On May 11, 2005, the Board authorized a new common stock repurchase program under which we may purchase up to 6,000,000 shares of our common stock subject
to a maximum aggregate purchase price of $250 million


over
the next twelve months as market conditions warrant. We may repurchase the shares in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The program has 5,184,600 shares, limited to
$191.4 million, remaining for our repurchase as of December 31, 2005. There were no purchases under this program during the fourth quarter of 2005.

Depreciation
of Simon Property's investment in buildings and improvements reflected in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income is calculated over the
estimated original lives of the assets as follows:

•

Buildings
and Improvements — typically 10-40 years for the structure, 15 years for landscaping and parking lot, and
10 years for HVAC equipment.

•

Tenant
Allowances and Improvements — shorter of lease term or useful life.

(3)

Initial
cost generally represents net book value at December 20, 1993 except for acquired properties and new developments after December 20, 1993. Initial cost also
includes any new developments that are opened during the current year. Costs of disposals of property are first reflected as a reduction to cost capitalized subsequent to acquisition.

(4)

Not
developed/constructed by Simon Property or its predecessors. The date of construction represents acquisition date.

(5)

Property
initial cost for these properties is the cost at the date of consolidation for properties previously accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Accumulated
depreciation amounts for properties consolidated which were previously accounted for under the equity method of accounting include the minority interest holders' portion of accumulated depreciation.
