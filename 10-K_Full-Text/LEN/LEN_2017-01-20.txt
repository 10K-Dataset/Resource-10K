PART I

Item 1.

Business

Overview of Lennar Corporation

We are one of the nation’s largest homebuilders, a provider of real estate related financial services, a commercial real estate, investment management and finance company through our Rialto segment and a developer of multifamily rental properties in select U.S. markets primarily through unconsolidated entities.

Our homebuilding operations are the most substantial part of our business, comprising

$9.7 billion

in revenues, or approximately

89%

of consolidated revenues, in fiscal


. As of

November 30, 2016

, we had grouped our homebuilding activities into three reportable segments, which we refer to as Homebuilding East, Homebuilding Central, and Homebuilding West, based primarily upon similar economic characteristics, geography and product type. Information about homebuilding activities in states in which our homebuilding activities are not economically similar to those in other states in the same geographic area is grouped under "Homebuilding Other."

As of

November 30, 2016

, our reportable homebuilding segments and Homebuilding Other have divisions located in:

East:

Florida, Georgia, Maryland, New Jersey, North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia

Central:

Arizona, Colorado and Texas

West:

California and Nevada

Other:

Illinois, Minnesota, Tennessee, Oregon and Washington

Our other reportable segments are Lennar Financial Services, Rialto and Lennar Multifamily.

For financial information about our Homebuilding, Lennar Financial Services, Rialto and Lennar Multifamily operations, you should review Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, which is Item 7 of this Report, and our consolidated financial statements and the notes to our consolidated financial statements, which are included in Item 8 of this Report.

A Brief History of Our Company

We are a national homebuilder that operates in various states with deliveries of

26,563

new homes in


. Our company was founded as a local Miami homebuilder in 1954. We completed our initial public offering in 1971 and listed our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange in 1972. During the 1980s and 1990s, we entered and expanded operations in a number of homebuilding markets, including California, Florida and Texas, through both organic growth and acquisitions, such as Pacific Greystone Corporation in 1997. In 1997, we completed the spin-off of our then commercial real estate business, LNR Property Corporation. In 2000, we acquired U.S. Home Corporation, which expanded our operations into New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia, Minnesota and Colorado and strengthened our position in other states. From 2002 through 2005, we acquired several regional homebuilders, which brought us into new markets and strengthened our position in several existing markets. From 2010 through 2013, we expanded our homebuilding operations into the Atlanta, Oregon, Seattle and Nashville markets. Through the most recent economic downturn, we strengthened and expanded our competitive position through strategic purchases of land at favorable prices. We are currently focused on maintaining moderate growth in community count and homes sales, reducing selling, general and administrative expenses by using innovative strategies to reduce customer acquisition costs, as well as on our soft-pivot land strategy, shortening the average time between when we acquire land and when we expect to begin building homes on it.

In addition to focusing on growing our core operating platforms, Lennar Homebuilding and Lennar Financial Services, we have also been focusing on maximizing the value of our investment in other businesses, including Rialto, Lennar Multifamily and FivePoint (included as one of our Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities), which is developing three very large multi-use planned developments in California.

On

September 22, 2016

, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") with WCI Communities, Inc. ("WCI"). WCI is a luxury homebuilder of single and multi-family homes, including a small percentage of luxury high-rise tower units, with operations in Florida. WCI's homes, tower units and communities are primarily targeted to move-up, second-home and active adult buyers. Under the Merger Agreement, we will acquire WCI through a merger for a combination of our Class A common stock and cash totaling

$23.50

per share of WCI common stock. It is currently anticipated that the merger consideration payable to WCI stockholders will be

$11.75

in cash and

$11.75

in Class A common stock, with the Class A common stock valued at the average of its volume weighted average price on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") on each of the ten NYSE trading days before closing. However, we have the right to reduce the portion of the merger consideration that will be Class A common stock and increase the portion that will be cash, including the right to make the entire merger consideration cash.



The transaction is subject to approval by WCI's stockholders and it is anticipated that a meeting of WCI's stockholders to vote will be held in February 2017. If the transaction is approved by the WCI stockholders, it will close promptly after the stockholder vote.

Homebuilding Operations

Overview

Our homebuilding operations include the construction and sale of single-family attached and detached homes as well as the purchase, development and sale of residential land directly and through unconsolidated entities in which we have investments. New home deliveries, including deliveries from unconsolidated entities, were

26,563

in fiscal


, compared to

24,292

in fiscal


and

21,003

in fiscal


. We primarily sell single-family attached and detached homes in communities targeted to first-time homebuyers, move-up homebuyers and active adult homebuyers. The average sales price of a Lennar home varies depending on product and geographic location. For fiscal


, the average sales price was

$361,000

, compared to

$344,000

in fiscal


and

$326,000

in fiscal


.

We operate primarily under the Lennar brand name. Our homebuilding mission is focused on the profitable development of residential communities. Key elements of our strategy include:

•

Strong Operating Margins -

We believe our operating leverage combined with our attractive land purchases position us for strong operating margins.

•

Everything’s Included

®

Approach

- We are focused on distinguishing our products, including through our Everything’s Included

®

approach, which maximizes our purchasing power and enables us to include luxury features as standard items in our homes.

•

Innovative Homebuilding -

We are constantly innovating the homes we build to create products that better meet our customers' needs and desires. Our Next Gen

®

home, or a home within a home, provides a unique new home solution for multi-generational households as homebuyers often need to accommodate children and parents to share the cost of their mortgage and other living expenses. In fiscal


, we delivered 1,186 Next Gen

®

homes representing an increase of 18% from the prior year and 4% of total home deliveries, excluding unconsolidated entities. The average sales price of the Next Gen

®

homes delivered in fiscal


was $461,000, which is 28% above the average sales price of total home deliveries, excluding unconsolidated entities.

•

Flexible Operating Structure

- Our local operating structure gives us the flexibility to make operating decisions based on local homebuilding conditions and customer preferences, while our centralized management structure provides oversight for our homebuilding operations.

Diversified Program of Property Acquisition

We generally acquire land for development and for the construction of homes that we sell to homebuyers. Land purchases are subject to specified underwriting criteria and are made through our diversified program of property acquisition, which may consist of:

•

Acquiring land directly from individual land owners/developers or homebuilders;

•

Acquiring local or regional homebuilders that own, or have options to purchase, land in strategic markets;

•

Acquiring land through option contracts, which generally enables us to control portions of properties owned by third parties (including land funds) and unconsolidated entities in which we have investments until we have determined whether to exercise the options;

•

Acquiring parcels of land through joint ventures or partnerships, which among other benefits, limits the amount of our capital invested in land while increasing our access to potential future homesites and allowing us to participate in strategic ventures;

•

Acquiring land in conjunction with Lennar Multifamily; and

•

Acquiring assets from banks and opportunity funds, often through relationships established by our Rialto segment.

At

November 30, 2016

, we owned

125,879

homesites and had access through option contracts to an additional

33,166

homesites, of which

26,650

homesites were through option contracts with third parties and

6,516

homesites were through option contracts with unconsolidated entities in which we have investments. At

November 30, 2015

, we owned

125,914

homesites and had access through option contracts to an additional

39,949

homesites, of which

33,491

homesites were through option contracts with third parties and

6,458

homesites were through option contracts with unconsolidated entities in which we have investments.



Construction and Development

Through our own efforts and those of unconsolidated entities in which Lennar Homebuilding has investments, we are involved in all phases of planning and building in our residential communities, including land acquisition, site planning, preparation and improvement of land and design, construction and marketing of homes. We use independent subcontractors for most aspects of home construction. At

November 30, 2016

, we were actively building and marketing homes in


communities, including

two

communities being constructed by unconsolidated entities.

We generally supervise and control the development of land and the design and building of our residential communities with a relatively small labor force. We hire subcontractors for site improvements and virtually all of the work involved in the construction of homes. Arrangements with our subcontractors generally provide that our subcontractors will complete specified work in accordance with price schedules and in compliance with applicable building codes and laws. The price schedules may be subject to change to meet changes in labor and material costs or for other reasons. We believe that the sources and availability of raw materials to our subcontractors are adequate for our current and planned levels of operation. We generally do not own heavy construction equipment. We finance construction and land development activities primarily with cash generated from operations and debt issuances.

For additional information about our investments in and relationships with unconsolidated entities, see Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of this Report.

Marketing

We offer a diversified line of homes for first-time, move-up, active adult and multi-generational homebuyers in a variety of locations ranging from urban infill communities to suburban golf course communities. Our Everything’s Included

®

marketing program simplifies the home buying experience by including the most desirable features as standard items. This marketing program enables us to differentiate our homes from those of our competitors by creating value through standard features and competitive pricing, while reducing construction and overhead costs through a simplified construction process, product standardization and volume purchasing. In addition, our advances in including solar powered technology and home automation in certain of the homes we sell, enhance our brand and improve our ability to generate traffic and sales.

We sell our homes primarily from models that we have designed and constructed. We employ new home consultants who are paid salaries, commissions or both to conduct on-site sales of our homes. We also sell homes through independent realtors.

Most recently our marketing strategy has shifted to increase advertising through digital channels including paid search, display advertising, social media and e-mail marketing, all of which drive traffic to our website, www.lennar.com. This has allowed us to attract more qualified and knowledgeable homebuyers and has contributed to reduce selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of home sales revenues. However, we also continue to advertise through more traditional media, including newspapers, radio advertisements and other local and regional publications and on billboards where appropriate. We tailor our marketing strategy and message based on the community being advertised and the customers being targeted, such as advertising our active adult communities in areas where prospective active adult homebuyers live or will potentially want to purchase.

Quality Service

We continually strive to improve homeowner customer satisfaction throughout the pre-sale, sale, construction, closing and post-closing periods. We strive to create a quality home buying experience for our customers through the participation of sales associates, on-site construction supervisors and customer care associates, all working in a team effort, which we believe leads to enhanced customer retention and referrals. The quality of our homes is substantially affected by the efforts of on-site management and others engaged in the construction process, by the materials we use in particular homes and by other similar factors.

We warrant our new homes against defective materials and workmanship for a minimum period of one year after the date of closing. Although we subcontract virtually all segments of construction to others and our contracts call for the subcontractors to repair or replace any deficient items related to their trades, we are primarily responsible to the homebuyers for the correction of any deficiencies.

Local Operating Structure and Centralized Management

We balance a local operating structure with centralized corporate level management. Our local operating structure consists of homebuilding divisions across the country, which are generally managed by a division president, a controller and personnel focused on land entitlement, acquisition and development, sales, construction, customer service and purchasing. This local operating structure gives our division presidents and their teams, who generally have significant experience in the homebuilding industry, and in most instances, in their particular markets, the flexibility to make local operating decisions,



including land identification, entitlement and development, the management of inventory levels for our current sales volume, community development, home design, construction and marketing of our homes. We centralize at the corporate level decisions related to our overall strategy, acquisitions of land and businesses, risk management, financing, cash management and information systems.

Backlog

Backlog represents the number of homes under sales contracts. Homes are sold using sales contracts, which are generally accompanied by deposits. In some instances, purchasers are permitted to cancel sales contracts if they fail to qualify for financing or under certain other circumstances. We experienced a cancellation rate of

16%

in


, compared to

16%

and

17%

in


and


, respectively. We do not recognize revenue on homes under sales contracts until the sales are closed and title passes to the new homeowners.

The backlog dollar value including unconsolidated entities at

November 30, 2016

was

$2.9 billion

, compared to

$2.5 billion

at

November 30, 2015

and

$2.0 billion

at

November 30, 2014

. We expect that substantially all homes currently in backlog will be delivered in fiscal year


.

Lennar Homebuilding Investments in Unconsolidated Entities

We create and participate in joint ventures that acquire and develop land for our homebuilding operations, for sale to third parties or for use in their own homebuilding operations. Through these joint ventures, we reduce the amount we invest in order to assure access to potential future homesites, thereby mitigating certain risks associated with land acquisitions, and, in some instances, we obtain access to land to which we could not otherwise have obtained access or could not have obtained access on as favorable terms. As of

November 30, 2016

and


, we had


and


Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated joint ventures, respectively, in which we were participating, and our maximum recourse debt exposure related to Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated joint ventures was

$52.4 million

and

$11.0 million

, respectively.

Homebuilding Ancillary Businesses

We have homebuilding ancillary business activities that are related to our homebuilding business, but are not components of our core homebuilding operations.

FivePoint

- On May 2, 2016, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiaries, contributed, or obtained the right to contribute, our investments in three strategic joint ventures which include the entities that own the Newhall Ranch, Great Park Neighborhoods, and The San Francisco Shipyard and Candlestick Point (the "Shipyard Venture") master planned mixed-used developments in California previously managed by FivePoint Communities, in exchange for an investment in a FivePoint entity, which is currently included within our Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities. A portion of the assets in the Shipyard Venture was retained by us and our Shipyard Venture partner.

Sunstreet

- Our solar business is focused on providing homeowners through solar purchases or lease programs, high-efficiency solar power systems that generate much of a home's annual expected energy needs. In fiscal


, Sunstreet expanded its operations into Florida, Oregon and Washington and exited its Nevada operations due to regulation changes. In addition to these states, Sunstreet also operates in California, Colorado, Maryland and Texas.

Lennar Financial Services Operations

Mortgage Financing

We offer conforming conventional, FHA-insured and VA-guaranteed residential mortgage loan products and other home mortgage products to buyers of our homes and others through our financial services subsidiary, Universal American Mortgage Company, LLC, which includes Universal American Mortgage Company, LLC, d/b/a Eagle Home Mortgage, from locations in most of the states in which we have homebuilding operations, as well as some other states. In


, our financial services subsidiaries provided loans to

82%

of our homebuyers who obtained mortgage financing in areas where we offered services. Because of the availability of mortgage loans from our financial services subsidiaries, as well as from independent mortgage lenders, we believe almost all credit worthy potential purchasers of our homes have access to financing.

During


, we originated approximately

33,500

residential mortgage loans totaling

$9.3 billion

, compared to

32,600

residential mortgage loans totaling

$8.9 billion

during


. Substantially all of the residential mortgage loans we originate are sold within a short period in the secondary mortgage market, the majority of which are sold on a servicing released, non-recourse basis. After the loans are sold, we retain potential liability for possible claims by purchasers that we breached certain limited industry-standard representations and warranties in the loan sale agreements.

We finance our mortgage loan activities with borrowings under our financial services warehouse facilities or from our operating funds. At

November 30, 2016

, our Lennar Financial Services had three warehouse facilities maturing at various dates through fiscal 2017 with a total maximum aggregate commitment of

$1.3 billion

including an uncommitted amount of

$250



million

. We expect the facilities to be renewed or replaced with other facilities when they mature. We have a corporate risk management policy under which we hedge our interest rate risk on rate-locked loan commitments and loans held-for-sale to mitigate exposure to interest rate fluctuations.

Title and Other Insurance and Closing Services

We provide title insurance and closing services to our homebuyers and others. During


, we provided title and closing services for approximately

116,000

real estate transactions, and issued approximately

298,900

title insurance policies through our underwriter, North American Title Insurance Company, compared to

108,600

real estate transactions and

263,500

title insurance policies during


. Title and closing services by agency subsidiaries are provided in Alabama, Arizona, California, Colorado, Delaware, District of Columbia, Georgia, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia and Wisconsin. Title insurance services are provided in 40 states.

We also provide our homebuyers and others with personal lines, property and casualty insurance products through our insurance agency subsidiary, North American Advantage Insurance Services, LLC, which operates in the same states as our homebuilding divisions, as well as other states. During


and


, we issued, as agent, approximately 13,500 and 10,700 new homeowner policies, respectively, and renewed approximately 27,700 and 17,200 homeowner policies, respectively.

Rialto Operations

The Rialto segment is a commercial real estate, investment management, and finance company. Rialto’s primary focus is to manage third-party capital and to originate commercial mortgage loans which it sells into securitizations. It also has invested its own capital in mortgage loans, properties and real estate related securities.

Rialto is the sponsor of and an investor in private equity vehicles, listed in the table below, that invest in and manage real estate related assets and other related investments:

Rialto also earns fees for its role as a manager of these vehicles and for providing asset management and other services to those vehicles and other third parties. In addition, Rialto owns general partner interests in each of the funds, which entitle it to a share of the sums distributed by the funds after investors have recovered their investments and received specified internal rates of return on those investments ("carried interests"). During the years ended

November 30, 2016

,


and


, Rialto received

$10.1 million

,

$20.0 million

and

$34.7 million

, respectively, of advance distributions with regard to its carried interests in its real estate funds in order to cover income tax obligations resulting from allocations of taxable income to Rialto's carried interests in these funds. These advance distributions are not subject to clawbacks but will reduce future carried interest payments to which Rialto becomes entitled from the applicable funds.

For Funds I, II and III, in order to protect investors in the Funds, we agreed that while the Funds were seeking investments (which no longer is the case with regard to Fund I and Fund II) we would not make investments that are suitable for the applicable Fund, except to the extent an Advisory Committee of the Fund decides that the Fund should not make particular investments, with an exception enabling us to purchase properties for use in connection with our homebuilding operations.

Rialto Mortgage Finance ("RMF") originates and sells into securitizations five, seven and ten year commercial first mortgage loans, generally with principal amounts between

$2 million

and

$75 million

, which are secured by income producing properties. RMF also originates floating rate loans secured by commercial real estate properties, many of which are undergoing transition, including properties undergoing lease-up, sell-out and renovation or repositioning. In order to finance RMF lending activities, as of

November 30, 2016

, RMF has secured four warehouse repurchase financing agreements maturing between 2017 and 2018 with commitments totaling

$1.1 billion

, which includes

$100 million

for floating rate loans.



Lennar Multifamily Operations

We have been actively involved, primarily through unconsolidated entities, in the development, construction and property management of multifamily rental properties. Our Lennar Multifamily segment focuses on developing a geographically diversified portfolio of institutional quality multifamily rental properties in select U.S. markets.

During the year ended

November 30, 2016

, our Lennar Multifamily segment continued to grow as a leading developer of apartment communities across the country with interests in


communities with development costs of approximately

$4.8 billion

, of which

five

communities were completed and operating,


communities were partially completed and leasing,


communities were under construction and the remaining communities were either owned or under contract. As of

November 30, 2016

, our Lennar Multifamily segment had a pipeline of future projects totaling

$2.8 billion

in assets across a number of states that will be developed primarily by unconsolidated entities.

Our Lennar Multifamily segment had equity investments in


and


unconsolidated entities (including the Lennar Multifamily Venture, described below) as of

November 30, 2016

and


, respectively. During the year ended

November 30, 2016

, our Lennar Multifamily segment sold seven operating properties through its unconsolidated entities resulting in the segment's

$91.0 million

share of gains included within Lennar Multifamily equity in earnings from unconsolidated entities. During the years ended

November 30, 2015

and


, our Lennar Multifamily segment sold two operating properties each year through its unconsolidated entities resulting in the segment's

$22.2 million

and

$14.7 million

share of gains included within Lennar Multifamily equity in earnings from unconsolidated entities, respectively.

In 2015, the Lennar Multifamily segment completed the initial closing of the Lennar Multifamily Venture (the "Venture") for the development, construction and property management of class-A multifamily assets with

$1.1 billion

of commitments. During the year ended

November 30, 2016

, the Venture received an additional

$1.1 billion

of equity commitments completing the fund raising for the Venture and increasing its total commitments to

$2.2 billion

, including a

$504 million

co-investment commitment by us. As of

November 30, 2016

,

$931.6 million

of the

$2.2 billion

in equity commitments had been called, of which we have contributed

$215.8 million

representing our pro-rata portion of the called equity, resulting in a remaining equity commitment for us of

$288.2 million

.

For additional information about our investments in and relationships with unconsolidated entities, see Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 of this Report.

Seasonality

We historically have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, variability in quarterly results. Our homebuilding business is seasonal in nature and generally reflects higher levels of new home order activity in our second fiscal quarter and increased deliveries in the second half of our fiscal year. However, periods of economic downturn in the industry can alter seasonal patterns.

Competition

The residential homebuilding industry is highly competitive. We compete for homebuyers in each of the market regions where we operate with numerous national, regional and local homebuilders, as well as with resales of existing homes and with the rental housing market. We compete for homebuyers on the basis of a number of interrelated factors including location, price, reputation, amenities, design, quality and financing. In addition to competition for homebuyers, we also compete with other homebuilders for desirable properties, raw materials and access to reliable, skilled labor. We compete for land buyers with third parties in our efforts to sell land to homebuilders and others. We believe we are competitive in the market regions where we operate primarily due to our:

•

Everything’s Included

®

marketing program, which simplifies the home buying experience by including most desirable features as standard items;

•

Innovative home designs, such as our Next Gen

®

homes that provide both privacy and togetherness for the multi-generational families;

•

Financial position, where we continue to focus on inventory management and liquidity;

•

Access to land, particularly in land-constrained markets;

•

Access to distressed assets, primarily through relationships established by our Rialto segment;

•

Pricing to current market conditions through sales incentives offered to homebuyers;

•

Cost efficiencies realized through our national purchasing programs and production of value-engineered homes; and

•

Quality construction and home warranty programs, which are supported by a responsive customer care team.



Our financial services operations compete with other mortgage lenders, including national, regional and local mortgage bankers and brokers, banks, savings and loan associations and other financial institutions, in the origination and sale of residential mortgage loans. Principal competitive factors include interest rates and other features of mortgage loan products available to the consumer. We compete with other title insurance agencies and underwriters for closing services and title insurance. Principal competitive factors include service and price.

The business of Rialto, and the funds it manages, of purchasing distressed real estate related assets is highly competitive and fragmented. A number of entities and funds have been formed in recent years for the purpose of acquiring real estate related assets and it is likely that additional entities and funds will be formed for this purpose during the next several years. We compete in the marketplace for assets based on many factors, including purchase price, representations, warranties and indemnities, timeliness of purchase decisions and reputation. In marketing of real estate investment funds we sponsor, we compete with a large variety of asset managers, including banks and other financial institutions and real estate investment firms. Rialto’s RMF business competes with other commercial mortgage lenders in a competitive market and its profitability depends on our ability to originate commercial real estate loans and sell them into securitizations at attractive prices.

Some of Rialto's competitors are substantially larger and have a lower cost of funds and greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than Rialto and have access to funding sources that may not be available to Rialto. In addition, some of Rialto's competitors may have higher risk tolerances or make different risk assessments, than Rialto does, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships than Rialto.

We believe that our major distinction from many of our competitors is that Rialto's team is made up of experienced managers who engage in working out and /or adding value to real estate assets and have been doing that for several years. RMF business is made up of highly seasoned managers who have been originating and securitizing loans for over 25 years with long-standing relationships and can leverage Rialto’s/Lennar’s infrastructure facilities for a rapid market entrance as well as Rialto’s current underwriting platform. Additionally, because we are a lender or capital provider to developers, we believe having our homebuilding team participating in the underwriting process provides us with a distinct advantage in our evaluation of real estate assets. We believe that our experienced team and the infrastructure already in place give the Rialto segment an advantage and position the segment well when compared to a number of our competitors.

Our multifamily operations compete with other multifamily apartment developers and operators, including REITs, across the United States. In addition, our multifamily operations compete in securing capital, partners and equity, and in securing tenants within the large supply of already existing rental apartments. Principal competitive factors include location, rental price and quality, and management of the apartment buildings.

Regulation

The residential communities and multifamily apartment developments that we build are subject to a large variety of local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations relating to, among other things, zoning, construction permits or entitlements, construction materials, density, building design and property elevation, building codes and handling of waste. These include laws requiring the use of construction materials that reduce the need for energy-consuming heating and cooling systems. These laws and regulations are subject to frequent change and often increase construction costs. In some instances, we must comply with laws that require commitments from us to provide roads and other offsite infrastructure, and may require them to be in place prior to the commencement of new construction. These laws and regulations are usually administered by counties and municipalities and may result in fees and assessments or building moratoriums. In addition, certain new development projects are subject to assessments for schools, parks, streets and highways and other public improvements, the costs of which can be substantial. Also, some states are attempting to make homebuilders responsible for violations of wage and other labor laws by their subcontractors. Recent National Labor Relations Board decisions may give support to these efforts if they are upheld on appeal.

Residential homebuilding and apartment development are also subject to a variety of local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning the protection of health and the environment. These environmental laws include such areas as storm water and surface water management, soil, groundwater and wetlands protection, subsurface conditions and air quality protection and enhancement. Environmental laws and existing conditions may result in delays, may cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs and may prohibit or severely restrict homebuilding activity in environmentally sensitive regions or areas. For example, a 2015 decision of the California Supreme Court will delay the start of a California master planned mixed-use development in which we have an investment.

In recent years, several cities and counties in which we have developments have submitted to voters "slow growth" initiatives and other ballot measures that could impact the affordability and availability of land suitable for residential development within those localities. Although many of these initiatives have been defeated, we believe that if similar initiatives were approved, residential construction by us and others within certain cities or counties could be seriously impacted.



In order to make it possible for some of our homebuyers to obtain FHA-insured or VA-guaranteed mortgages, we must construct the homes they buy in compliance with regulations promulgated by those agencies. Various states have statutory disclosure requirements relating to the marketing and sale of new homes. These disclosure requirements vary widely from state-to-state. In addition, some states require that each new home be registered with the state at or before the time title is transferred to a buyer (e.g., the Texas Residential Construction Commission Act). In some states, we are required to be registered as a licensed contractor and comply with applicable rules and regulations. In various states, our new home consultants are required to be registered as licensed real estate agents and to adhere to the laws governing the practices of real estate agents.

Our mortgage and title subsidiaries must comply with applicable real estate, lending and insurance laws and regulations. The subsidiaries are licensed in the states in which they do business and must comply with laws and regulations in those states. These laws and regulations include provisions regarding capitalization, operating procedures, investments, lending and privacy disclosures, forms of policies and premiums. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contains a number of requirements relating to mortgage lending and securitizations. These include, among others, minimum standards for lender practices, limitations on certain fees and a requirement that the originator of loans that are securitized retain a portion of the risk, either directly or by holding interests in the securitizations.

Several federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations and ordinances, including, but not limited to, the Federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ("FDCPA") and the Federal Trade Commission Act and comparable state statutes, regulate consumer debt collection activity. Although, for a variety of reasons, we may not be specifically subject to the FDCPA or certain state statutes that govern debt collectors, it is our policy to comply with applicable laws in our collection activities. To the extent that some or all of these laws apply to our collection activities, our failure to comply with such laws could have a material adverse effect on us. We are also subject to regulations promulgated by the Federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau regarding residential mortgage loans.

Because Rialto manages real estate asset investments, mezzanine loan and commercial mortgage-backed securities ("CMBS") funds and two entities partly owned by the FDIC, one of Rialto's entities is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. This Act has requirements related to dealings between investment advisers and the entities they advise and imposes record keeping and disclosure obligations on investment advisers. Our RMF subsidiary must comply with laws and regulations applicable to commercial mortgage lending. Rialto or its subsidiaries must be licensed in states in which they make loans and must comply with laws and regulations in those states.

Associates

At

November 30, 2016

, we employed 8,335 individuals of whom 4,351 were involved in the Lennar Homebuilding operations, 3,224 were involved in the Lennar Financial Services operations, 365 were involved in the Rialto operations and 395 were involved in the Lennar Multifamily operations, compared to

November 30, 2015

, when we employed 7,749 individuals of whom 4,138 were involved in the Lennar Homebuilding operations, 2,914 were involved in the Lennar Financial Services operations, 392 were involved in the Rialto operations and 305 were involved in the Lennar Multifamily operations. We do not have collective bargaining agreements relating to any of our associates. However, we subcontract many phases of our homebuilding operations and some of the subcontractors we use have employees who are represented by labor unions.

NYSE Certification

On April 15, 2016, we submitted our Annual CEO Certification to the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") in accordance with NYSE's listing standards. The certification was not qualified in any respect.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors.

The following are what we believe to be the principal risks that could materially affect us and our businesses.

Market and Economic Risks

The homebuilding recovery has continued its progression at a slow and steady pace; however, a downturn in the recovery or decline in economic conditions could adversely affect our operations.

In fiscal


, we continued to experience a steadily improving housing market, and we saw increases in new sales contracts signed and homes delivered compared with the prior year. However, demand for new homes is sensitive to changes in economic conditions such as the level of employment, consumer confidence, consumer income, the availability of financing and interest rate levels. The prior economic downturn severely affected both the numbers of homes we could sell and the prices for which we could sell them. We cannot predict whether the recovery in the housing market will continue. If the recovery were to slow or stop, or there were another economic downturn, the resulting decline in demand for new homes would negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.



During the prior economic downturn, we had to take significant write-downs on the carrying values of land we owned and of option values. A future decline in land values could result in similar write-downs.

Inventory risks are substantial for our homebuilding business. There are risks inherent in controlling, owning and developing land and if housing demand declines, we may own land or homesites we acquired at costs we will not be able to recover fully, or on which we cannot build and sell homes profitably. This is particularly true when entitled land becomes increasingly scarce, as it has recently, and the cost of purchasing such land may be relatively high. Also, there can be significant fluctuations in the value of our owned undeveloped land, building lots and housing inventories related to changes in market conditions. As a result, our deposits for building lots controlled under option or similar contracts may be put at risk, we may have to sell homes or land for lower than anticipated profit margins or we may have to record inventory impairment charges with regard to our developed and undeveloped land and lots. When demand for homes fell during the most recent recession, we were required to take significant write-downs of the carrying value of our land inventory and we elected not to exercise many options to purchase land, even though that required us to forfeit deposits and write-off pre-acquisition costs. Although we have reduced our exposure to costs of that type, a certain amount of exposure is inherent in our homebuilding business. If market conditions were to deteriorate significantly in the future, we could again be required to make significant write downs with regard to our land inventory, which would decrease the asset values reflected on our balance sheet and adversely affect our earnings and our stockholders' equity.

Inflation may adversely affect us by increasing costs beyond what we can recover through price increases.

Inflation can adversely affect us by increasing costs of land, materials and labor. In addition, significant inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates, which have a negative impact on demand for our homes. In an inflationary environment, depending on homebuilding industry and other economic conditions, we may be precluded from raising home prices enough to keep up with the rate of inflation, which would reduce our profit margins. Although the rate of inflation has been low for the last several years, in recent years we have been experiencing increases in the prices of labor and materials above the general inflation rate.

Homebuilding, mortgage lending, distressed asset investing and multifamily rentals are very competitive industries, and competitive conditions could adversely affect our business or financial results.

Homebuilding

. The homebuilding industry is highly competitive. Homebuilders compete not only for homebuyers, but also for desirable land, financing, raw materials, skilled management and labor resources. We compete in each of our markets with numerous national, regional and local homebuilders. We also compete with sellers of existing homes, including foreclosed homes, and with rental housing. These competitive conditions can reduce the number of homes we deliver, negatively impact our selling prices, reduce our profit margins, and cause impairments in the value of our inventory or other assets. Competition can also affect our ability to acquire suitable land, raw materials and skilled labor at acceptable prices or other terms.

Lennar Financial Services

. Our Lennar Financial Services business competes with other mortgage lenders, including national, regional and local banks and other financial institutions. Mortgage lenders who have greater access to low cost funds, superior technologies or different lending criteria than we do may be able to offer more attractive financing to potential customers than we can.

Rialto

. There are many firms and investment funds that compete with Rialto in trying to acquire distressed mortgage debt, foreclosed properties and other real estate related assets. At least some of the firms with which Rialto competes, or will compete, for investment opportunities have, or will have, a cost of funds or targeted investment return that is lower than that of Rialto or the funds it manages, and therefore those firms may be able to pay more for investment opportunities than would be prudent for Rialto or the funds it manages. Our RMF business competes with national and regional banks as well as smaller community banks within the various markets in which we operate and non-bank lenders, many of which are far larger than RMF or have access to lower cost funds than we do.

Lennar Multifamily

. Our multifamily rental business competes with other multifamily apartment developers and operators at locations across the United States where we have investments in rental properties. We also compete in securing partners, equity capital and debt financing, and we compete in securing tenants with the large supply of already existing or newly built rental apartments, as well as with sellers of homes. These competitive conditions could negatively impact the ability of the ventures in which we are participating to find renters for the apartments they are building or the prices for which those apartments can be rented.

Operational Risks

We may be subject to significant potential liabilities as a result of warranty and liability claims made against us.

As a homebuilder, we are subject in the ordinary course of our business to warranty and construction defect claims. We are also subject to claims for injuries that occur in the course of construction activities. We record warranty and other reserves for the homes we sell based on historical experience in our markets and our judgment of the qualitative risks associated with the



types of homes we build. We have, and many of our subcontractors have, general liability, property, workers compensation and other business insurance. These insurance policies are intended to protect us against a portion of our risk of loss from claims, subject to certain self-insured retentions, deductibles and coverage limits. However, it is possible that this insurance will not be adequate to address all warranty, construction defect and liability claims to which we are subject. Additionally, the coverage offered and the availability of general liability insurance for construction defects are currently limited and policies that can be obtained are costly and often include exclusions based upon past losses those insurers suffered as a result of use of defective products in homes we and many other homebuilders built. As a result, an increasing number of our subcontractors are unable to obtain insurance, and we have in many cases had to waive our customary insurance requirements, which increases our and our insurers’ exposure to claims and increases the possibility that our insurance will not be adequate to protect us for all the costs we incur.

Products supplied to us and work done by subcontractors can expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business.

We rely on subcontractors to perform the actual construction of our homes, and in many cases, to select and obtain building materials. Despite our detailed specifications and quality control procedures, in some cases, subcontractors may use improper construction processes or defective materials. Defective products widely used by the homebuilding industry can result in the need to perform extensive repairs to large numbers of homes. The cost of complying with our warranty obligations may be significant if we are unable to recover the cost of repairs from subcontractors, materials suppliers and insurers.

We also can suffer damage to our reputation, and may be exposed to possible liability, if subcontractors fail to comply with applicable laws, including laws involving things that are not within our control. When we learn about possibly improper practices by subcontractors, we try to cause the subcontractors to discontinue them. However, we are not always able to do that, and even when we can, it may not avoid claims against us relating to what the subcontractors already did.

Supply shortages and risks related to the demand for skilled labor and building materials could increase costs and delay deliveries.

Increased costs or shortages of skilled labor and/or lumber, framing, concrete, steel and other building materials could cause increases in construction costs and construction delays. During 2016, we experienced increases in the prices of some building materials and shortages of skilled labor in some areas. We generally are unable to pass on increases in construction costs to customers who have already entered into purchase contracts, as those contracts generally fix the price of the homes at the time the contracts are signed, which may be well in advance of the construction of the homes. Sustained increases in construction costs may, over time, erode our margins, particularly if pricing competition or weak demand restricts our ability to pass additional costs of materials and labor on to homebuyers.

Reduced numbers of home sales extend the time it takes us to recover land purchase and property development costs.

We incur many costs even before we begin to build homes in a community. Depending on the stage of development a land parcel is in when we acquire it, these may include costs of preparing land, finishing and entitling lots, installing roads, sewers, water systems and other utilities, taxes and other costs related to ownership of the land on which we plan to build homes. If the rate at which we sell and deliver homes slows, or if we delay the opening of new home communities, we may incur additional pre-construction costs and it may take longer for us to recover our costs.

Increased demand for homes could require us to increase our corporate credit line, and our inability to do that could limit our ability to take full advantage of market opportunities.

Our business requires that we be able to finance the development of our residential communities. One of the ways we do this is with bank borrowings. At

November 30, 2016

, we had a

$1.8 billion

revolving credit facility with a group of banks (the "Credit Facility"), which includes a

$298 million

accordion feature, subject in part to additional commitments. If market conditions strengthen to the point that we need additional funding but we are not able to increase our Credit Facility or obtain funds from other types of financings, that could prevent us from taking full advantage of the enhanced market opportunities.

Failure to comply with the covenants and conditions imposed by our credit facilities could restrict future borrowing or cause our debt to become immediately due and payable.

The agreement governing our Credit Facility (the "Credit Agreement") makes it a default if we fail to pay principal or interest when it is due (subject in some instances to grace periods) or to comply with various covenants, including covenants regarding financial ratios. In addition, our Lennar Financial Services segment has warehouse facilities to finance its lending activities and our Rialto segment has warehouse facilities to finance its mortgage origination activities. If we default under the Credit Agreement or our warehouse facilities, the lenders will have the right to terminate their commitments to lend and to require immediate repayment of all outstanding borrowings. This could reduce our available funds at a time when we are having difficulty generating all the funds we need from our operations, in capital markets or otherwise, and restrict our ability to obtain financing in the future. Further, Rialto's 7.00% senior notes due 2018 contain restrictive covenants imposing operational



and financial restrictions on our Rialto segment, including restrictions that may limit Rialto’s ability to sell assets, pay dividends or make other distributions, enter into transactions with affiliates or incur additional indebtedness. In addition, if we default under the Credit Agreement or our warehouse facilities, it could cause the amounts outstanding under our senior notes to become immediately due and payable, which would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition.

We have a substantial level of indebtedness which may have an adverse effect on our business or limit our ability to take advantage of business, strategic or financing opportunities.

As of

November 30, 2016

, our consolidated debt, net of debt issuance costs, and excluding amounts outstanding under our credit facilities, was $5.0 billion. The indentures governing our senior notes do not restrict our incurrence of future secured or unsecured debt, and the agreement governing our Credit Facility allows us to incur a substantial amount of future unsecured debt. Our substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay the principal, interest or other amounts due on our indebtedness. Our reliance on debt to help support our operations exposes us to a number of risks, including:

•

we may be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and homebuilding industry conditions;

•

we may have to pay higher interest rates upon refinancing indebtedness if interest rates rise, thereby reducing our earnings and cash flows;

•

we may find it difficult to, or may be unable to, obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements that would be in our best long-term interests;

•

we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt, reducing the cash flow available to fund operations and investments;

•

we may have reduced flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses or the industries in which they are conducted;

•

we may have a competitive disadvantage relative to other companies in our industry that are less leveraged; and

•

we may be required to sell debt or equity securities or sell some of our core assets, possibly on unfavorable terms, in order to meet payment obligations.

Our inability to obtain performance bonds could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.

We often are required to provide surety bonds to secure our performance or obligations under construction contracts, development agreements and other arrangements. At

November 30, 2016

, we had outstanding surety bonds of

$1.4 billion

including performance surety bonds related to site improvements at various projects (including certain projects of our joint ventures) and financial surety bonds including

$223.4 million

related to pending litigation. Although significant development and construction activities have been completed related to these site improvements, these bonds are generally not released until all development and construction activities are completed. Our ability to obtain surety bonds primarily depends upon our credit rating, financial condition, past performance and similar factors, the capacity of the surety market and the underwriting practices of surety bond issuers. The ability to obtain surety bonds also can be impacted by the willingness of insurance companies to issue performance bonds for construction and development activities. If we are unable to obtain surety bonds when required, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.

Our Lennar Financial Services segment and RMF have warehouse facilities that mature between 2017 and 2018, and if we cannot renew or replace these facilities, we may have to reduce our mortgage lending and origination activities.

Our Lennar Financial Services segment has an aggregate committed and uncommitted amount under three warehouse repurchase credit facilities that totaled

$1.3 billion

as of

November 30, 2016

, all of which will mature during 2017. Our Lennar Financial Services segment uses these facilities to finance its mortgage lending activities until the mortgage loans it originates are sold to investors. In addition, RMF, the commercial mortgage lender in our Rialto segment, has an aggregate committed amount under four warehouse repurchase credit facilities that totaled

$1.1 billion

as of

November 30, 2016

, all of which will mature between 2017 and 2018. RMF uses these facilities primarily to finance its mortgage origination activities. We expect these facilities to be renewed or replaced with other facilities when they mature. If we were unable to renew or replace these facilities on favorable terms or at all when they mature, that could seriously impede the activities of our Lennar Financial Services segment and RMF, as applicable, which would have a material adverse impact on our financial results.

We conduct some of our operations through joint ventures with independent third parties and we can be adversely impacted by our joint venture partners' failures to fulfill their obligations or decisions to act contrary to our wishes.

In our Homebuilding and Lennar Multifamily segments, we participate in joint ventures in order to help us acquire attractive land positions, to manage our risk profile and to leverage our capital base. In certain circumstances, the joint venture participants, including ourselves, are required to provide guarantees of obligations relating to the joint ventures, such as completion and environmental guarantees. If a joint venture partner does not perform its obligations, we may be required to bear more than our proportional share of the cost of fulfilling them. For example, in connection with our Lennar Multifamily



business, and its joint ventures, we and the other venture participants have assumed certain obligations to complete construction of multifamily residential buildings at agreed upon costs, which could make us and the other venture participants responsible for cost over-runs. Although all the participants in a venture are normally responsible for sharing the costs of fulfilling obligations of that type, if some of the venture participants are unable or unwilling to meet their share of the obligations, we may be held responsible for some or all of the defaulted payments. In addition, because we do not have a controlling interest in most of the joint ventures in which we participate, we may not be able to cause joint ventures to sell assets, return invested capital or take other actions when such actions might be in our best interest.

Several of the joint ventures in which we participate will in the relatively near future be required to repay, refinance, renegotiate or extend their borrowings. If any of those joint ventures are unable to do this, we could be required to provide at least a portion of the funds the joint ventures need to be able to repay the borrowings and to conduct the activities for which they were formed, which could adversely affect our financial position.

The loss of the services of members of our senior management or a significant number of our employees could negatively affect our business.

Our success depends to a significant extent upon the performance and active participation of our senior management, many of whom have been with the Company for a significant number of years. If we were to lose members of our senior management, we might not be able to find appropriate replacements on a timely basis and our operations could be negatively affected. Also, the loss of a significant number of operating employees and our inability to hire qualified replacements could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Our access to capital and our ability to obtain additional financing could be affected by any downgrade of our credit ratings.

Our corporate credit rating and ratings of our senior notes affect, among other things, our ability to access new capital, especially debt, and the costs of that new capital. A substantial portion of our access to capital is through the issuance of senior notes, of which we have

$4.4 billion

outstanding, net of debt issuance costs, and excluding Rialto's

7.00%

senior notes due 2018, as of

November 30, 2016

. Among other things, we rely on proceeds of debt issuances to pay the principal of existing senior notes when they mature. Negative changes in the ratings of our senior notes could make it difficult for us to sell senior notes in the future and could result in more stringent covenants and higher interest rates with regard to new senior notes we issue.

Natural disasters and severe weather conditions could delay deliveries and increase costs of new homes in affected areas, which could harm our sales and results of operations.

Many of our homebuilding operations are conducted in areas that are subject to natural disasters, including hurricanes, earthquakes, droughts, floods, wildfires and severe weather. The occurrence of natural disasters or severe weather conditions can delay new home deliveries, increase costs by damaging inventories and lead to shortages of labor and materials in areas affected by the disasters, and can negatively impact the demand for new homes in affected areas. If our insurance does not fully cover business interruptions or losses resulting from these events, our results of operations could be adversely affected.

If our homebuyers are not able to obtain suitable financing, that would reduce demand for our homes and our home sales revenues.

Most purchasers of our homes obtain mortgage loans to finance a substantial portion of the purchase price of the homes they purchase. While the majority of our homebuyers obtain their mortgage financing from Lennar Financial Services, others obtain mortgage financing from banks and other independent lenders. The uncertainties in the mortgage markets and increased government regulation could adversely affect the ability of potential homebuyers to obtain financing for home purchases, thus preventing them from purchasing our homes. Among other things, changes made by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and FHA/VA to sponsored mortgage programs, as well as changes made by private mortgage insurance companies, have reduced the ability of many potential homebuyers to qualify for mortgages. Principal among these are higher income requirements, larger required down payments, increased reserves and higher required credit scores. In addition, there continues to be uncertainty regarding the future of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, including proposals that they reduce or terminate their role as the principal sources of liquidity in the secondary market for mortgage loans. It is not clear how, if Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were to curtail their secondary market mortgage loan purchases, the liquidity they provide would be replaced. There is a substantial possibility that substituting an alternate source of liquidity would increase mortgage interest rates, which would increase the buyers' effective costs of the homes we sell, and therefore could reduce demand for our homes and adversely affect our results of operations.



Our Lennar Financial Services segment can be adversely affected by reduced demand for our homes or by a slowdown in mortgage refinancings.

Approximately 55% of the mortgage loans made by our Lennar Financial Services segment in


were made to buyers of homes we built. Therefore, a decrease in the demand for our homes would adversely affect the revenues of this segment of our business. In addition, the revenues of our Lennar Financial Services segment would be adversely affected by a decrease in refinance transactions, if mortgage interest rates rise.

If our ability to sell mortgages into the secondary market is impaired, that could significantly reduce our ability to sell homes unless we are willing to become a long-term investor in loans we originate.

Substantially all of the residential mortgage loans we originate are sold within a short period in the secondary mortgage market on a servicing released, non-recourse basis. If we became unable to sell loans into the secondary mortgage market or directly to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, we would have to either curtail our origination of mortgage loans, which among other things, could significantly reduce our ability to sell homes, or commit our own funds to long term investments in mortgage loans, which, in addition to requiring us to deploy substantial amounts of our own funds, could delay the time when we recognize revenues from home sales on our statements of operations.

We may be liable for certain limited representations and warranties we make in connection with sale of loans.

While substantially all of the residential mortgage loans we originate are sold within a short period in the secondary mortgage market on a servicing released, non-recourse basis, we remain responsible for certain limited representations and warranties we make in connection with such sales. Mortgage investors could seek to have us buy back mortgage loans or compensate them for losses incurred on mortgage loans that we have sold based on claims that we breached our limited representations or warranties. In addition, when our Rialto segment sells loans to securitization trusts or other purchasers, it gives limited industry standard representations and warranties about the loans, which, if incorrect, may require it to repurchase the loans, replace them with substitute loans or indemnify persons for losses or expenses incurred as a result of breaches of representations and warranties. If we have significant liabilities with respect to such claims, it could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, and possibly our financial condition.

New mortgage products that we may offer may expose us to liability.

Through our Lennar Financial Services segment, we offer non-Qualified Mortgage loan products which, unlike Qualified Mortgages, do not benefit from a presumption that when the loan is made the borrower has the ability to repay the loan. While we have taken substantial steps to try to mitigate exposure to bad credits and to insure that as to each loan we have made a reasonable determination that the borrower will have the ability to repay the loan, this type of product has increased risk and exposure to litigation and claims of borrowers. If we were to make a loan as to which we did not satisfy the regulatory standards for ascertaining the borrower's ability to repay the loan, the consequences could include giving the borrower a defense to repayment of the loan, which might prevent us from collecting interest and principal on that loan. If we have sold the loan or the servicing of the loan, failure to properly ascertain the borrower's ability to repay the loan may violate the representations and warranties we made in such a sale and impose upon us an obligation to repurchase the loan.

If real estate Rialto acquires through foreclosures is not properly valued when it is acquired, we could be required to take valuation charge-offs, which would reduce our earnings.

When a loan is foreclosed upon and we take title to the property, we obtain a valuation of the property and base its book value on that valuation. The book value of the foreclosed property is periodically compared to its updated market value (or its updated market value less estimated selling costs if the foreclosed property is classified as held-for-sale), and a charge-off is recorded for any excess of the property's book value over its fair value. If the revised valuation we establish for a property proves to be too high, we may have to record additional charge-offs in subsequent periods. Material charge-offs could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, and possibly even on our financial condition.

Regulatory Risks

We may be adversely impacted by legal and regulatory changes.

We are subject with regard to almost all of our activities to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations. Laws and regulations, and policies under or interpretations of existing laws and regulations, change frequently. Our businesses could be adversely affected by changes in laws, regulations, policies or interpretations or by our inability to comply with them without making significant changes in our businesses.



We may be adversely impacted by laws and regulations directed at the financial industry.

New or modified regulations and related regulatory guidance focused on the financial industry may have adverse effects on aspects of our businesses. For example, in October 2014, final rules were promulgated under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act that require mortgage lenders or third-party B-piece buyers to retain a portion of the credit risk related to securitized loans. We have determined that these rules do not affect our residential mortgage lending operations at this time; however, the new rules may adversely impact our RMF subsidiary's commercial mortgage lending operations. While it is still too early to know the full impact of the new rules on the market, we believe that the rules may reduce the price of commercial mortgage-backed securities ("CMBS") and limit the overall volume of CMBS related loan purchases, which could impact the financial results of our RMF business. In addition, if our residential mortgage lending operations became subject to these rules in the future, that would substantially increase the amount we would have to invest in our mortgage lending operations and increase our risks with regard to loans we originate and sell in the secondary mortgage market.

Governmental regulations regarding land use and environmental matters could increase the cost and limit the availability of our development and homebuilding projects and adversely affect our business or financial results.

We are subject to extensive and complex laws and regulations that affect the land development, homebuilding and apartment development process, including laws and regulations related to zoning, permitted land uses, levels of density, building design, elevation of properties, water and waste disposal and use of open spaces. These regulations often provide broad discretion to the administering governmental authorities as to the conditions we must meet prior to development or construction being approved, if they are approved at all. We are also subject to determinations by governmental authorities as to the adequacy of water or sewage facilities, roads and other local services with regard to particular residential communities. New housing developments may also be subject to various assessments for schools, parks, streets and other public improvements. In addition, in many markets government authorities have implemented no growth or growth control initiatives. Any of these can limit, delay, or increase the costs of land development or home construction.

We are also subject to a variety of local, state and federal laws and regulations concerning protection of the environment. In some of the markets where we operate, we are required by law to pay environmental impact fees, use energy-saving construction materials and give commitments to municipalities to provide infrastructure such as roads and sewage systems. We generally are required to obtain permits, entitlements and approvals from local authorities to commence and carry out residential development or home construction. These permits, entitlements and approvals may, from time-to-time, be opposed or challenged by local governments, environmental advocacy groups, neighboring property owners or other possibly interested parties, adding delays, costs and risks of non-approval to the process. Violations of environmental laws and regulations can result in injunctions, civil penalties, remediation expenses, and other costs. In addition, some environmental laws impose strict liability, which means that we may be held liable for unlawful environmental conditions on property we own which we did not create.

We are also subject to laws and regulations related to workers' health and safety, and there are efforts to subject us to other labor related laws or rules, some of which may make us responsible for things done by our subcontractors over which we have little or no control. In addition, our residential mortgage subsidiary is subject to various state and federal statutes, rules and regulations, including those that relate to lending operations and other areas of mortgage origination and loan servicing. The impact of those statutes, rules and regulations can increase our homebuyers’ costs of financing, and our cost of doing business, as well as restricting our homebuyers’ access to some types of loans.

Our obligation to comply with the laws and regulations under which we operate, and our need to ensure that our associates, subcontractors and other agents comply with these laws and regulations, could result in delays in construction and land development, cause us to incur substantial costs and prohibit or restrict land development and homebuilding activity in certain areas in which we operate. Budget reductions by state and local governmental agencies may increase the time it takes to obtain required approvals and therefore may aggravate the delays we could encounter. Government agencies also routinely initiate audits, reviews or investigations of our business practices to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, which can cause us to incur costs or create other disruptions in our businesses that can be significant.

We can be injured by improper acts of persons over whom we do not have control.

Although we expect all of our associates (i.e., employees), officers and directors to comply at all times with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, there may be instances in which subcontractors or others through whom we do business engage in practices that do not comply with applicable laws, regulations or governmental guidelines. When we learn of practices that do not comply with applicable laws or regulations, including practices relating to homes, buildings or multifamily rental properties we build or finance, we move actively to stop the non-complying practices as soon as possible and we have taken disciplinary action with regard to associates of ours who were aware of non-complying practices and did not take steps to address them, including in some instances terminating their employment. However, regardless of the steps we take after we learn of practices that do not comply with applicable laws or regulations, we can in some instances be subject to fines or other governmental penalties, and our reputation can be injured, due to the practices' having taken place.



We could be hurt by efforts to impose liabilities or obligations on persons with regard to labor law violations by other persons whose employees perform contracted services.

The homes we sell are built by employees of subcontractors and other contract parties. We do not have the ability to control what these contract parties pay their employees or the work rules they impose on their employees. However, various governmental agencies are trying to hold contract parties like us responsible for violations of wage and hour laws and other work related laws by firms whose employees are performing contracted for services. A recent National Labor Relations Board ruling holds that for labor law purposes a firm could under some circumstances be responsible as a joint employer of its contractors' employees. If that ruling is upheld on appeal, it could make us responsible for collective bargaining obligations and labor law violations by our subcontractors. Governmental rulings that make us responsible for labor practices by our subcontractors could create substantial exposures for us in situations that are not within our control.

Our ability to collect upon mortgage loans may be limited by the application of state laws.

Our mortgage loans typically permit us to accelerate the debt upon default by the borrower. The courts of all states will enforce acceleration clauses in the event of a material payment default, subject in some cases to a right of the court to revoke the acceleration and reinstate the mortgage loan if a payment default is cured. The equity courts of a state, however, may refuse to allow the foreclosure of a mortgage or to permit the acceleration of the indebtedness in instances in which they decide that the exercise of those remedies would be inequitable or unjust or the circumstances would render an acceleration unconscionable.

Further, the ability to collect upon mortgage loans may be limited by the application of state and federal laws. For example, Nevada has enacted a law providing that if the amount an assignee of a mortgage note paid to acquire the note is less than the face amount of the note, the assignee cannot recover more through a deficiency action than the amount it paid for the note. If the Nevada law is upheld, or similar laws are enacted in other jurisdictions, it could materially and adversely affect our ability and the ability of funds we manage to profit from purchases of distressed debt.

Other Risks

Our results of operations could be adversely affected if legal claims against us are not resolved in our favor.

In the ordinary course of our business, we are subject to legal claims by homebuyers, borrowers against whom we have instituted foreclosure proceedings, persons with whom we have land purchase contracts and a variety of other persons. We establish reserves against legal claims and we believe that, in general, legal claims will not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition. However, if the amounts we are required to pay as a result of claims against us substantially exceed the sums anticipated by our reserves, the need to pay those amounts could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the periods when we are required to make the payments. We have a substantial judgment against us in a contract suit, which we have bonded and are appealing as disclosed in Item 3. Legal Proceedings.

Information technology failures and data security breaches could harm our business.

We rely extensively on information technology ("IT") systems, including Internet sites, data hosting facilities and other hardware and software platforms, some of which are hosted by third parties, to assist in conducting our businesses. Our IT systems, like those of most companies, may be vulnerable to a variety of interruptions, including, but not limited to, natural disasters, telecommunications failures, hackers, and other security issues. Moreover, our computer systems, like those of most companies, are subjected to computer viruses or other malicious codes, and to cyber or phishing-attacks. Although we have implemented administrative and technical controls and taken other actions to minimize the risk of cyber incidents and protect our information technology, computer intrusion efforts are becoming increasingly sophisticated, and even the enhanced controls we have installed might be breached. If our IT systems cease to function properly, we could suffer interruptions in our operations. If our cyber-security is breached, unauthorized persons may gain access to proprietary or confidential information, including information about purchasers of our homes or borrowers from our mortgage lending subsidiaries. This could damage our reputation, expose us to claims, and require us to incur significant costs to repair or restore the security of our computer systems.



Increases in the rate of cancellations of home sale agreements could have an adverse effect on our business.

Our backlog reflects agreements of sale with our homebuyers for homes that have not yet been delivered. We have received a deposit from our home buyer for each home reflected in our backlog, and generally we have the right to retain the deposit if the homebuyer does not complete the purchase. In some cases, however, a homebuyer may cancel the agreement of sale and receive a complete or partial refund of the deposit for reasons such as state and local laws, the homebuyer’s inability to obtain mortgage financing, his or her inability to sell his or her current home or our inability to complete and deliver the home within the specified time. If there is a downturn in the housing market, or if mortgage financing becomes even less available than it currently is, more homebuyers may cancel their agreements of sale with us, which would have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

Our success depends on our ability to acquire land suitable for residential homebuilding at reasonable prices, in accordance with our land investment criteria.

There is strong competition among homebuilders for land that is suitable for residential development. The future availability of finished and partially finished developed lots and undeveloped land that meet our internal criteria depends on a number of factors outside our control, including land availability in general, competition with other homebuilders and land buyers for desirable property, inflation in land prices, zoning, allowable housing density, and other regulatory requirements. Should suitable lots or land become less available, the number of homes we could build and sell could be reduced, and the cost of land could be increased, perhaps substantially, which could adversely impact our results of operations.

Expansion of our services and investments into international markets through our Rialto segment subjects us to risks inherent in international operations.

Fund II, of which our Rialto segment owns an interest and for which it performs asset management services, owns an interest in a joint venture which holds real estate assets in Spain. Expansion of our services and investments in Spain and any expansion into other international markets in the future, could result in operational problems not typically experienced in the United States. Our activities outside the United States are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally, including fluctuations in currency exchange rates, the implementation of currency controls, material changes in a specific country’s or region’s political or economic conditions, differences in the legal and regulatory systems, reputational risks and cultural differences which may lead to competitive disadvantages, particularly due to our need to comply with U.S. anti-corruption laws. There also are tax consequences of doing business outside the U.S., both under U.S. tax laws and under the tax laws of the countries in which we do business.

We could suffer adverse tax and other financial consequences if we are unable to utilize our net operating loss ("NOL") carryforwards.

At

November 30, 2016

, we had state tax net operating loss ("NOL") carryforwards totaling

$90.6 million

that will expire between

2017 and 2035

. At

November 30, 2016

, we had a valuation allowance of

$5.8 million

, primarily related to state NOL carryforwards that are not more likely than not to be utilized due to an inability to carry back these losses in most states and short carryforward periods that exist in certain states. If we are unable to use our NOLs, we may have to record charges or reduce our deferred tax assets, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.

The new Trump Administration may make substantial changes to fiscal and tax policies that may adversely affect our business.

The Trump Administration has called for substantial change to fiscal and tax policies, which may include comprehensive tax reform. We cannot predict the impact, if any, of these changes to our business. However, it is possible that these changes could adversely affect our business. It is likely that some policies adopted by the new administration will benefit us and others will negatively affect us. Until we know what changes are enacted, we will not know whether in total we benefit from, or are negatively affected by, the changes.

We experience variability in our operating results on a quarterly basis and, as a result, our historical performance may not be a meaningful indicator of future results.

We historically have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, variability in quarterly results. As a result of such variability, our short-term performance may not be a meaningful indicator of future results. Our homebuilding business is seasonal in nature and generally reflects higher levels of new home order activity in our second fiscal quarter and increased deliveries in the second half of our fiscal year. Our quarterly results of operations may continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of a variety of factors, including, among others, seasonal home buying patterns, the timing of home closings and land sales and weather-related problems.



We have a stockholder who can exercise significant influence over matters that are brought to a vote of our stockholders.

Stuart Miller, our Chief Executive Officer and a Director, has voting control, through personal holdings and holdings by family-owned entities, of Class B, and to a lesser extent Class A, common stock that enables Mr. Miller to cast approximately

42%

of the votes that can be cast by the holders of all our outstanding Class A and Class B common stock combined. That effectively gives Mr. Miller the power to control the election of our directors and the approval of matters that are presented to our stockholders. Mr. Miller's voting power might discourage someone from seeking to acquire us or from making a significant equity investment in us, even if we needed the investment to meet our obligations or to operate our business. Also, because of his voting power, Mr. Miller could be able to cause our stockholders to approve actions that are contrary to our other stockholders' desires.

The trading price of our Class B common stock normally is lower than that of our Class A common stock.

The only difference between our Class A common stock and our Class B common stock is that the Class B common stock entitles the holders to ten votes per share, while the Class A common stock entitles holders to only one vote per share. However, the trading price of the Class B common stock on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") normally is substantially lower than the NYSE trading price of our Class A common stock. We believe this is because only a relatively small number of shares of Class B common stock are available for trading, which reduces the liquidity of the market for our Class B common stock to a point where many investors are reluctant to invest in it. The limited liquidity could make it difficult for a holder of even a relatively small number of shares of our Class B common stock to dispose of the stock without materially reducing the trading price of the Class B common stock.

Changes in global or regional environmental conditions and governmental actions in response to such changes may adversely affect us by increasing the costs of or restricting our planned or future growth activities.

There is growing concern from many members of the scientific community and the general public that an increase in global average temperatures due to emissions of greenhouse gases and other human activities have caused, or will cause, significant changes in weather patterns and increase the frequency and severity of natural disasters. Government mandates, standards or regulations intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or projected climate change impacts have resulted, and are likely to continue to result, in restrictions on land development in certain areas and increased energy, transportation and raw material costs, or cause us to incur compliance expenses that we will be unable fully to recover, which could reduce our housing gross profit margins and adversely affect our results of operations.

Item 2.

Properties.

We lease and maintain our executive offices in an office complex in Miami, Florida. Our homebuilding, financial services, Rialto and multifamily offices are located in the markets where we conduct business, primarily in leased space. We believe that our existing facilities are adequate for our current and planned levels of operation.

Because of the nature of our homebuilding operations, significant amounts of property are held as inventory in the ordinary course of our homebuilding business. We discuss these properties in the discussion of our homebuilding operations in Item 1 of this Report.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings.

We are party to various claims and lawsuits which arise in the ordinary course of business, but we do not consider the volume of our claims and lawsuits unusual given the number of homes we deliver and the fact that the lawsuits often relate to homes delivered several years before the lawsuits are commenced. Although the specific allegations in the lawsuits differ, they most commonly involve claims that we failed to construct homes in particular communities in accordance with plans and specifications or applicable construction codes and seek reimbursement for sums allegedly needed to remedy the alleged deficiencies, assert contract issues or relate to personal injuries. Lawsuits of these types are common within the homebuilding industry. We are a plaintiff in many cases in which we seek contribution from our subcontractors for home repair costs. The costs incurred by us in construction defect lawsuits may be offset by warranty reserves, our third-party insurers, subcontractor insurers and indemnity contributions from subcontractors. We are also a party to various lawsuits involving purchases and sales of real property. These lawsuits include claims regarding representations and warranties made in connection with the transfer of the property and disputes regarding the obligation to purchase or sell the property. From time-to-time, we also receive notices from environmental agencies or other regulators regarding alleged violations of environmental or other laws. We typically settle these matters before they reach litigation for amounts that are not material to us.

We have been engaged in litigation since 2008 in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland (U.S. Home Corporation v. Settlers Crossing, LLC, et al., Civil Action No. DKC 08-1863) regarding whether we are required by a contract we entered into in 2005 to purchase a property in Maryland. After entering into the contract, we later renegotiated the purchase price, reducing it from

$200 million

to

$134 million

,

$20 million

of which has been paid and subsequently written off, leaving a balance of

$114 million

. In January 2015, the District Court rendered a decision ordering us to purchase the property for the

$114 million

balance of the contract price, to pay interest at the rate of

12%

per annum from May 27, 2008, and to reimburse the seller for real estate taxes and attorneys’ fees. We believe the decision is contrary to applicable law and have appealed the decision. We do not believe it is probable that a loss has occurred and, therefore, no liability has been recorded with respect to this case.

On June 29, 2015, the court ruled that interest will be calculated as simple interest at the rate of

12%

per annum from May 27, 2008 until the date we purchase the property. Simple interest on

$114 million

at

12%

per annum will accrue at the rate of

$13.7 million

per year, totaling approximately

$116 million

as of

November 30, 2016

. In addition, if we are required to purchase the property, we will be obligated to reimburse the seller for real estate taxes, which currently total

$1.6 million

. We have not engaged in discovery regarding the amount of the plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees. If the District Court decision is totally reversed on appeal, we will not have to purchase the property or pay interest, real estate taxes or attorneys’ fees.

In its June 29, 2015 ruling, the District Court determined that we would be permitted to stay the judgment during appeal by posting a bond in the amount of

$223.4 million

related to pending litigation. The District Court calculated this amount by adding

12%

per annum simple interest to the

$114 million

purchase price for the period beginning May 27, 2008 through May 26, 2016, the date the District Court estimated the appeal of the case would be concluded.

In June 2016, we received Notices of Violation from the United States Environmental Protection Agency related to stormwater compliance at certain of our Tampa and Southwest Florida communities. It has been determined that violations occurred and this matter will result in monetary sanctions to us, which we do not currently expect will be material.

We do not believe that the ultimate resolution of these claims or lawsuits will have a material adverse effect on our business or financial position. However, the financial effect of litigation concerning purchases and sales of property may



depend upon the value of the subject property, which may have changed from the time the agreement for purchase or sale was entered into.

We undertake no obligation to revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of those statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events, except to the extent we are legally required to disclose certain matters in SEC filings or otherwise.

Outlook

As we look ahead to 2017, we expect to see a similar economic environment as in 2016 with some potential upside from the new administration in Washington. These expectations derive from the following general views. Even with the now clear upward movement in interest rates mapped out by the Federal Reserve and the many questions around taxes and the regulatory environment raised by our incoming new President, we expect to see a continued slow but steady, though sometimes erratic, positive homebuilding market. Lower unemployment, modest wage growth and consumer confidence should increase household formation, which drives families to purchase homes and to rent apartments. We believe the new home market continues to have significant pent-up demand, though stronger in some markets than in others, and we expect that demand will continue to drive increased production as the deficit in the housing stock ultimately needs to be replenished. We expect the first time homebuyer will continue to come back to the market as stronger economic conditions should drive purchasers to the market, with this demand being partially offset by marginally higher monthly payments. Nevertheless, land and labor shortages will continue to be limiting factors and will constrain supply and restrict the ability to quickly respond to growing demand, while the mortgage market and higher rents will continue to limit that demand due to potential homebuyers having less disposable income and limited ability to finance a new home purchase. We expect that these conditions will continue to result in slow but steady, though sometimes erratic growth throughout the industry.

Fiscal 2016 was another excellent year for Lennar, with revenues and net earnings attributable to Lennar increasing 16% and 14%, respectively, from 2015. Our core homebuilding business continued to produce strong operating results as gross margins and operating margins were 23.0% and 13.6%, respectively. Our home deliveries and new orders both increased 9% compared to fiscal 2015. Our efficient Everything’s Included

®

manufacturing model helped mitigate the impact of a tight labor market and our focus on digital marketing  and higher volume helped to improve our S,G&A leverage. In addition, we ended the year with a strong sales backlog, up 15% in homes and 17% in dollar value, which gives us a strong start for fiscal 2017.

Complementing our homebuilding business, we also had strong performances from our other businesses during fiscal 2016. Our Financial Services segment produced $163.6 million of pretax earnings compared to $127.8 million in 2015. The increase in profitability was primarily due to increased transactions and higher profit per transaction in the segment's mortgage and title operations.

Our Multifamily rental business continued to grow during fiscal 2016, as it sold seven completed rental properties.

In fiscal 2017, our principal focus in our homebuilding operations will continue to be 1) on our soft-pivot strategy, we plan to continue to identify and invest in unique and enticing land opportunities with shorter term land that we expect will drive our future growth and profitability; 2) lower targeted growth rate to maximize our net operating margin though we expect to continue to see lower margins in 2017 compared to 2016 due to cost increases outpacing sales price increases and competitive pressures; and 3) heavy focus on SG&A by using innovative strategies to reduce customer acquisition costs.

We expect that our Company’s main driver of earnings will continue to be our homebuilding and financial services operations as we believe we are currently positioned to deliver between 28,500 and 29,000 homes in fiscal 2017. We are also focused on our multiple platforms including Rialto and Multifamily, as such ancillary businesses continue to mature and expand their franchises providing opportunities that we expect will enhance shareholder value. Overall, we believe we are on track to achieve another year of substantial profitability in fiscal 2017.

versus


Revenues from home sales increased

15%

in the year ended

November 30, 2016

to

$9.6 billion

from

$8.3 billion

in


. Revenues were higher primarily due to a

9%

increase in the number of home deliveries, excluding unconsolidated entities, and a

5%

increase in the average sales price of homes delivered. New home deliveries, excluding unconsolidated entities, increased to

26,481

homes in the year ended

November 30, 2016

from

24,209

homes last year. There was an increase in home deliveries in all of our Homebuilding segments and Homebuilding Other. This includes an increase in home deliveries in Homebuilding Central despite a slight decrease in home deliveries in our former Homebuilding Houston segment, which is now aggregated into our Homebuilding Central segment as it no longer meets the reportable segment criteria. The increase in the number of deliveries was primarily driven by an increase in active communities over the last year and by higher demand as the number of deliveries per active community increased. The decrease in home deliveries in Houston was primarily due to less demand in the higher-priced communities driven by volatility in the energy sector. The average sales price of homes delivered increased to

$361,000

in the year ended

November 30, 2016

from

$344,000

in the year ended

November 30, 2015

, primarily due to product mix (selling at different price points) and increased pricing in certain of our markets due to favorable market conditions. Sales incentives offered to homebuyers were

$22,500

per home delivered in the year ended

November 30, 2016

, or

5.9%

as a percentage of home sales revenue, compared to

$21,400

, respectively. Our overall effective income tax rates were

31.40%

and

32.72%

for the years ended

November 30, 2016

and


, respectively. The reduction is primarily the result of the reversal of an accrual due to a settlement with the IRS in the year ended

November 30, 2016

, which reduced our effective tax rate by (1.02%). During the year ended

November 30, 2016

, tax legislation was passed extending the new energy efficient home credit through 2016, as well as extending the 30% investment tax credit for solar energy property through 2022. For the years ended November 30, 2016 and 2015, the impact of these tax credits was (3.46%) and (1.92%), respectively. However, the new energy efficient home credit expired in December 2016 and will not benefit our effective tax rate in 2017 and future years unless extending legislation is enacted.


versus


Revenues from home sales increased 22% in the year ended November 30, 2015 to $8.3 billion from $6.8 billion in 2014. Revenues were higher primarily due to a 15% increase in the number of home deliveries, excluding unconsolidated entities, and a 6% increase in the average sales price of homes delivered. New home deliveries, excluding unconsolidated entities, increased to 24,209 homes in the year ended November 30, 2015 from 20,971 homes in the year ended November 30, 2014. There was an increase in home deliveries in all of our Homebuilding segments and Homebuilding Other. The average sales price of homes delivered increased to $344,000 in the year ended November 30, 2015 from $326,000 in the year ended November 30, 2014, primarily due to increased pricing in many of our markets due to favorable market conditions. Sales incentives offered to homebuyers were $21,400 per home delivered in the year ended November 30, 2015, or 5.9% as a percentage of home sales revenue, compared to $21,400 per home delivered in the year ended November 30, 2014, or 6.2% as a percentage of home sales revenue.

Gross margins on home sales were $2.0 billion, or 24.0%, in the year ended November 30, 2015, compared to $1.7 billion, or 25.4%, in the year ended November 30, 2014. Gross margin percentage on home sales decreased compared to the year ended November 30, 2014, primarily due to an increase in land costs, partially offset by an increase in the average sales price of homes delivered and a decrease in sales incentives offered to homebuyers as a percentage of revenue from home sales.



Selling, general and administrative expenses were $831.1 million in the year ended November 30, 2015, compared to $714.8 million in the year ended November 30, 2014. As a percentage of revenues from home sales, selling, general and administrative expenses improved to 10.0% in the year ended November 30, 2015, from 10.5% in the year ended November 30, 2014 primarily due to improved operating leverage as a result of an increase in home deliveries.

Gross profits on land sales were $30.1 million in the year ended November 30, 2015, compared to $41.7 million in the year ended November 30, 2014.

Lennar Homebuilding equity in earnings (loss) from unconsolidated entities was $63.4 million in the year ended November 30, 2015, compared to ($0.4) million in the year ended November 30, 2014. In the year ended November 30, 2015, Lennar Homebuilding equity in earnings from unconsolidated entities primarily related to $82.8 million of equity in earnings from one of our unconsolidated entities, due to the sale of homesites and a commercial property to third parties, the sale of approximately 800 homesites to a joint venture in which we have a 50% investment, and a gain on debt extinguishment. In the year ended November 30, 2014, Lennar Homebuilding equity in loss from unconsolidated entities primarily related to our share of net operating losses from various Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities, which included $4.6 million of our share of valuation adjustments related to assets of Lennar Homebuilding's unconsolidated entities.

Lennar Homebuilding other income, net, totaled $18.6 million in the year ended November 30, 2015, compared to $7.5 million in the year ended November 30, 2014. In the year ended November 30, 2015, other income, net included $10.2 million aggregate gains on sales of an operating property and a clubhouse.

Lennar Homebuilding interest expense was $220.1 million in the year ended November 30, 2015 ($205.2 million was included in costs of homes sold, $2.5 million in costs of land sold and $12.5 million in other interest expense), compared to $201.5 million in the year ended November 30, 2014 ($161.4 million was included in costs of homes sold, $3.6 million in costs of land sold and $36.6 million in other interest expense). Interest expense included in costs of homes sold increased primarily due to an increase in our outstanding debt and home deliveries.

Operating earnings for our Lennar Financial Services segment were $127.8 million in the year ended November 30, 2015, compared to operating earnings of $80.1 million in the year ended November 30, 2014. The increase in profitability was primarily due to an increase in mortgage originations driven by a stronger refinance market and an increase in purchase volume for both Lennar and non-Lennar homebuyers, and an increase in capture rate. The increase in volume also benefited the title operations.

Operating earnings for our Rialto segment were $28.8 million in the year ended November 30, 2015 (which included $33.6 million of operating earnings, partially offset by $4.8 million of net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests), compared to operating earnings of $66.6 million in the year ended November 30, 2014 (which included $44.1 million of operating earnings and an add back of $22.5 million of net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests).

Rialto revenues were $221.9 million in the year ended November 30, 2015, compared to $230.5 million in the year ended November 30, 2014. Revenues decreased primarily due to a decrease in interest income as a result of a decrease in the portfolio of loans Rialto owns because of loan collections, resolutions and REO foreclosures and because Rialto no longer recognized interest income under the accretable yield method. Instead, interest income is recognized to the extent that loan collections exceed their carrying value. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in securitization revenue and interest income from RMF. In addition, in the years ended November 30, 2015 and 2014, revenues included $20.0 million and $34.7 million, respectively, of advance distributions with regard to Rialto's carried interests in its Funds in order to cover income tax obligations resulting from the allocations of taxable income to Rialto’s carried interests in these funds.

Rialto expenses were $222.9 million in the year ended November 30, 2015, compared to $249.1 million in the year ended November 30, 2014. Expenses decreased primarily due to a $46.8 million decrease in loan impairments, partially offset by an increase in RMF securitization expenses, general and administrative expenses and interest expense.

Rialto equity in earnings from unconsolidated entities was $22.3 million and $59.3 million in the years ended November 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, primarily related to the segment's share of net earnings from its Funds. The decrease in equity in earnings was primarily related to smaller net increases in the fair value of certain assets in the Rialto Funds in the year ended November 30, 2015 than in the year ended November 30, 2014.

In the year ended November 30, 2015, Rialto other income, net was $12.3 million, which consisted primarily of $35.2 million of net realized gains on the sale of REO and rental income, net, partially offset by expenses related to owning and maintaining REO and $12.4 million of impairments on REO. In the year ended November 30, 2014, Rialto other income, net was $3.4 million, which consisted primarily of $43.7 million of net realized gains on the sale of REO and rental income, net, partially offset by expenses related to owning and maintaining REO and $19.3 million of impairments on REO.

Operating loss for our Lennar Multifamily segment was $7.2 million in the year ended November 30, 2015, compared to $11.0 million in the year ended November 30, 2014. In the year ended November 30, 2015, the operating loss in Lennar Multifamily primarily related to general and administrative expenses, partially offset by the segment's $22.2 million share of



gains as a result of the sale of two operating properties by Lennar Multifamily's unconsolidated entities, management fee income and general contractor income, net. In the year ended November 30, 2014, the operating loss primarily related to general and administrative expenses, partially offset by the segment's $14.7 million share of gains as a result of the sale of two operating properties by Lennar Multifamily unconsolidated entities and management fee income.

Corporate general and administrative expenses were $216.2 million, or 2.3% as a percentage of total revenues, in the year ended November 30, 2015, compared to $177.2 million, or 2.3% as a percentage of total revenues, in the year ended November 30, 2014.

Net earnings (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests were $16.3 million and ($10.2) million in the years ended November 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests in the year ended November 30, 2015 were primarily attributable to earnings related to Lennar Homebuilding consolidated joint ventures and the FDIC's interest in the portfolio of real estate loans that we acquired in partnership with the FDIC. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in the year ended November 30, 2014 was primarily due to a net loss related to the FDIC's interest in the portfolio of real estate loans that we acquired in partnership with the FDIC, partially offset by a strategic transaction by one of Lennar Homebuilding's consolidated joint ventures that impacted noncontrolling interests by $5.6 million.

During the years ended November 30, 2015 and 2014, we had a tax provision of $390.4 million and $341.1 million, respectively. Our overall effective tax rates were 32.72% and 34.80% for the years ended November 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The effective tax rate for the year ended November 30, 2015 included tax benefits for the domestic production activities deduction and energy tax credits, offset primarily by state income tax expense and accruals for uncertain tax positions. The reduction was primarily from tax credits related to our increased investment in solar energy systems in 2015 compared with 2014, and the retroactive enactment of the new energy efficient home credit. For the year ended November 30, 2015, the impact of the solar energy credit on our effective tax rate was (0.91%). In addition, the new energy efficient home credit for homes delivered in 2014 was retroactively restored and extended in December 2014. We were eligible for this tax credit to the extent our homes meet the energy efficiency standards required under the tax code. The impact of this legislation on the Company’s effective tax rate for the year ended November 30, 2015 was (1.01%).

Homebuilding Segments

Our Homebuilding operations construct and sell homes primarily for first-time, move-up and active adult homebuyers primarily under the Lennar brand name. In addition, our homebuilding operations purchase, develop and sell land to third parties. In certain circumstances, we diversify our operations through strategic alliances and attempt to minimize our risks by investing with third parties in joint ventures.

As of and for the year ended

November 30, 2016

, we have aggregated our homebuilding activities into three reportable segments, which we refer to as Homebuilding East, Homebuilding Central, and Homebuilding West, based primarily upon similar economic characteristics, geography, and product type. Information about homebuilding activities in states that do not have economic characteristics that are similar to those in other states in the same geographic area is grouped under "Homebuilding Other," which is not a reportable segment. References in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations to homebuilding segments are to those three reportable segments.

During the fourth quarter of 2016, we evaluated all of our reportable segments and as the Houston operating division, which previously had been reported a separate reportable segment, did not meet the reportable criteria set forth in Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 280,

Segment Reporting

("ASC 280")

,

we aggregated this operating division into the Homebuilding Central reportable segment as this division exhibits similar economic characteristics, geography and product type as the other divisions in Homebuilding Central.

In addition, during the first quarter of 2016, we made the decision to divide the Southeast Florida operating division into two operating segments to maximize operational efficiencies given the continued growth of the division. As a result of this change in management structure, we re-evaluated our reportable segments and determined that neither operating segment met the reportable criteria set forth in ASC 280. We aggregated these operating segments into the Homebuilding East reportable segment as these divisions exhibit similar economic characteristics, geography and product type as the other divisions in Homebuilding East.

All prior year segment information has been restated to conform with the 2016 presentation. The changes in the reportable segments have no effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows for the periods presented.



At

November 30, 2016

our reportable homebuilding segments and Homebuilding Other consisted of homebuilding divisions located in:

East:

Florida, Georgia, Maryland, New Jersey, North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia

Central:

Arizona, Colorado and Texas

West:

and


for each of our reportable homebuilding segments and Homebuilding Other:




versus


Homebuilding East:

Revenues from home sales increased in


compared to


, primarily due to an increase in the number of home deliveries in all the states in the segment, except Virginia and Georgia, and an increase in the average sales price of homes delivered in all the states in the segment, except Florida. The increase in the number of deliveries was primarily driven by an increase in active communities over the last year primarily in Florida and/or driven by higher demand as the number of deliveries per active community increased. The decrease in home deliveries in Virginia and Georgia was primarily driven by a decrease in active communities that had a high volume of home deliveries in 2015. The increase in the average sales price of homes delivered was primarily due to a change in product mix as there was an increase in home deliveries in higher-priced communities in 2016 compared to the same period last year and/or because we have been able to increase the sales price in certain of our communities due to favorable market conditions. The decrease in average sales price of homes delivered in Florida was primarily driven by a change in product mix due to closing out the remaining homes in higher-priced communities in prior year and opening lower-priced communities in 2016. In addition, we have also been able to increase the sales prices in certain of our communities due to favorable market conditions. Gross margin percentage on home sales decreased compared to the same period last year primarily due to an increase in land and direct construction costs per home, partially offset by an increase in average sales price of homes delivered.

Homebuilding Central:

Revenues from home sales increased in


compared to


, primarily due to an increase in the number of home deliveries and in the average sales price of homes delivered in all the states in the segment. The increase in the number of deliveries was primarily driven by higher demand as the number of deliveries per active community increased. The increase in the average sales price of homes delivered was primarily due to a change in product mix driven by an increase in home deliveries in higher-priced close out communities in 2016 compared to the same period last year and/or because we have been able to increase the sales prices in certain of our communities due to favorable market conditions. Gross margin percentage on home sales slightly decreased compared to the same period last year primarily due to an increase in land costs per home, partially offset by an increase in the average sales price of homes delivered.

Homebuilding West:

Revenues from home sales increased in


compared to


, primarily due to an increase in the number of home deliveries in California, partially offset by a decrease in the number of home deliveries in Nevada and an increase in the average sales price of homes delivered in all the states in the segment. The increase in the number of deliveries in California was primarily driven by an increase in active communities over the last year and/or by higher demand as the number of deliveries per active community increased. The decrease in the number of deliveries in Nevada was primarily driven by lower demand as the number of deliveries per active community decreased due to a change in product mix (selling at different price points) from the same period last year. The increase in the average sales price of homes delivered was primarily due to a change in product mix (selling at different price points) and/or because we have been able to increase the sales prices in certain of our communities due to favorable market conditions. Gross margin percentage on home sales decreased compared to the same period last year primarily due to an increase in land costs per home and an increase in sales incentives offered to homebuyers as a percentage of revenues from home sales, partially offset by an increase in the average sales price of homes delivered.

Homebuilding Other:

Revenues from home sales increased in


compared to


, primarily due to an increase in the number of home deliveries in all the states in Homebuilding Other and an increase in the average sales price of homes delivered in all states in Homebuilding Other, except Minnesota. The increase in the number of deliveries was primarily driven by an increase in active communities over the last year and/or by higher demand as the number of deliveries per active community increased. The increase in the average sales price of homes delivered was primarily due to an increase in home deliveries in higher-priced communities in 2016 compared to the same period last year. The decrease in the average sales price of homes delivered in Minnesota was primarily due to the lower average sales price of the homes acquired in backlog. Gross margin percentage on home sales increased compared to the same period last year primarily due to an increase in the average sales price of homes delivered and a decrease in construction and land costs per home (prior year's land costs per home included a valuation adjustment of $9.6 million in our Northeast Urban operations).

The increase in the number of deliveries was primarily driven by an increase in active communities over 2014 and/or driven by higher demand as the number of deliveries per active community increased. The increase in the average sales price of homes delivered was primarily because we have been able to increase the sales price of homes delivered and/or reduce sales incentives in certain of our communities due to favorable market conditions.

The increase in the number of deliveries was primarily driven by an increase in active communities over 2014 and/or driven by higher demand as the number of deliveries per active community increased. The decrease in the number of homes delivered in Arizona was primarily due to the timing of deliveries in certain of our communities. The increase in the average sales price of homes delivered was primarily because we have been able to increase the sales price of homes delivered and/or we have been able to reduce sales incentives in certain of our communities due to favorable market conditions. Gross margin percentage on homes decreased compared to 2014 primarily due to an increase in land costs per home and because 2014 included $11.9 million of insurance recoveries and other nonrecurring items, which increased the gross margin percentage in 2014 by 70 basis points.

Gross margin percentage on homes sales decreased compared to 2014 primarily due to an increase in land costs per home, which included a valuation adjustment of $9.6 million in our Northeast Urban operations primarily related to a strategic decision to move forward on an inactive asset and an increase in sales incentives offered to homebuyers as a percentage of revenues from home sales.

Lennar Financial Services Segment

Our Lennar Financial Services reportable segment provides mortgage financing, title insurance and closing services for both buyers of our homes and others. Our Lennar Financial Services segment sells substantially all of the loans it originates within a short period in the secondary mortgage market, the majority of which are sold on a servicing released, non-recourse basis. After the loans are sold, we retain potential liability for possible claims by purchasers that we breached certain limited industry-standard representations and warranties in the loan sale agreements.

The following table sets forth selected financial and operational information related to our Lennar Financial Services segment:

Rialto Segment

Our Rialto reportable segment is a commercial real estate investment, investment management, and finance company focused on raising, investing and managing third-party capital, originating and selling into securitizations commercial mortgage loans as well as investing our own capital in real estate related mortgage loans, properties and related securities. Rialto utilizes its vertically-integrated investment and operating platform to underwrite, diligence, acquire, manage, workout and add value to diverse portfolios of real estate loans, properties and securities as well as providing strategic real estate capital. Rialto's primary focus is to manage third-party capital and to originate and sell into securitizations commercial mortgage loans. Rialto has continued the workout and/or oversight of billions of dollars of real estate assets across the United States, including commercial



and residential real estate loans and properties as well as mortgage backed securities with the objective of generating superior, risk-adjusted returns. To date, many of the investment and management opportunities have arisen from the dislocation in the United States real estate markets and the restructuring and recapitalization of those markets.

Rialto's operating earnings (loss) were as follows:

(1)

Costs and expenses included loan impairments of

$18.2 million

,

$10.4 million

and

$57.1 million

for the years ended

November 30, 2016

,


and


, respectively, primarily associated with the segment's FDIC loans portfolio (before noncontrolling interests).

(2)

Operating earnings (loss) for the years ended

November 30, 2016

,


and


included net earnings (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests of

($18.8) million

,

$4.8 million

and

($22.5) million

, respectively.

The following is a detail of Rialto other income (expense), net:

(1)

Rental and other income for the year ended

November 30, 2016

, included a $16.0 million write-off of uncollectible receivables related to the hospital.

Rialto Mortgage Finance

RMF originates and sells into securitizations five, seven and ten year commercial first mortgage loans, generally with principal amounts between

$2 million

and

$75 million

, which are secured by income producing properties. This business has become a significant contributor to Rialto's revenues.

During the year ended

November 30, 2016

, RMF originated loans with a total principal balance of

$1.8 billion

, of which

$1.7 billion

were recorded as loans held-for-sale and

$81.2 million

as accrual loans within loans receivable, net, and sold

$1.9 billion

of loans into


separate securitizations. During the year ended

November 30, 2015

, RMF originated loans with a total principal balance of

$2.7 billion

and sold

$2.4 billion

of loans into


separate securitizations. As of

November 30, 2016

and


, originated loans with an unpaid principal balance of

$199.8 million

and

$151.8 million

, respectively, were sold into a securitization trust but not settled and thus were included as Rialto's receivables, net.

Loans Receivable

In 2010, our Rialto segment acquired indirectly

40%

managing member equity interests in two limited liability companies ("LLCs") in partnership with the FDIC, which retained

60%

equity interests in the LLCs, for approximately

$243 million

(net of transaction costs and a

$22 million

working capital reserve). The LLCs held performing and non-performing loans formerly owned by


failed financial institutions and when our Rialto segment acquired its interests in the LLCs, the two portfolios consisted of approximately

5,500

distressed residential and commercial real estate loans. If the LLCs exceed expectations and meet certain internal rate of returns and distribution thresholds, our equity interest in the LLCs could be reduced from

40%

down to

30%

, with a corresponding increase to the FDIC’s equity interest from

60%

up to

70%

. As these thresholds have not been met, distributions continue being shared

60%

/

40%

with the FDIC. During the years ended

November 30, 2016

and


, the LLCs distributed

$108.2 million

and

$149.7 million

, respectively, of which

$64.9 million

and

$89.8 million

, respectively, was distributed to the FDIC and

$43.3 million

and

$59.9 million

, respectively, was distributed to Rialto, the parent company.

The LLCs met the accounting definition of variable interest entities ("VIEs") and since we were determined to be the primary beneficiary, we consolidated the LLCs. We were determined to be the primary beneficiary because we have the power to direct the activities of the LLCs that most significantly impact the LLCs’ performance through Rialto's management and



servicer contracts. At

November 30, 2016

, these consolidated LLCs had total combined assets and liabilities of

$213.8 million

and

$10.3 million

, respectively. At

November 30, 2015

, these consolidated LLCs had total combined assets and liabilities of

$355.2 million

and

$11.3 million

, respectively.

Also, in 2010, our Rialto segment acquired approximately


distressed residential and commercial real estate loans and over


REO properties from three financial institutions. We paid

$310 million

for the distressed real estate and real estate related assets of which

$124 million

was financed through a


-year senior unsecured note provided by one of the selling institutions for which the maturity was subsequently extended. The remaining balance of

$30.3 million

, which was due in December 2016, was fully paid off as of

November 30, 2016

.

Investments

Rialto is the sponsor of and an investor in private equity vehicles that invest in and manage real estate related assets and other related investments. These include:

At

November 30, 2016

and


, the carrying value of Rialto's non-investment grade commercial mortgage-backed securities ("CMBS") was

November 2020

and

November 2026

, and stated maturity dates between

November 2048

and

March 2059

. The Rialto segment classified these securities as held-to-maturity based on its intent and ability to hold the securities until maturity.

In 2014, the Rialto segment invested

$18 million

in a private commercial real estate services company. The investment was carried at cost at both

November 30, 2016

and


and is included in Rialto's other assets.

Lennar Multifamily Segment

We have been actively involved, primarily through unconsolidated entities, in the development, construction and property management of multifamily rental properties. Our Lennar Multifamily segment focuses on developing a geographically diversified portfolio of institutional quality multifamily rental properties in select U.S. markets.

Debt to total capital ratios are financial measures commonly used in the homebuilding industry and are presented to assist in understanding the leverage of our Lennar Homebuilding operations. Lennar Homebuilding debt to total capital and net Lennar Homebuilding debt to total capital were calculated as follows:

(1)

Net Lennar Homebuilding debt to total capital is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as net Lennar Homebuilding debt (Lennar Homebuilding debt less Lennar Homebuilding cash and cash equivalents) divided by total capital (net Lennar Homebuilding debt plus stockholders' equity). We believe the ratio of net Lennar Homebuilding debt to total capital is a relevant and a useful financial measure to investors in understanding the leverage employed in our Lennar Homebuilding operations. However, because net Lennar Homebuilding debt to total capital is not calculated in accordance with GAAP, this financial measure should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures prescribed by GAAP. Rather, this non-GAAP financial measure should be used to supplement our GAAP results.

At

November 30, 2016

, Lennar Homebuilding debt to total capital was lower compared to the prior year period, primarily as a result of an increase in stockholder’s equity primarily related to our net earnings and the conversion of all of our

3.25%

convertible senior notes due 2021 (the "

3.25%

Convertible Senior Notes") to stockholder's equity and a decrease in Lennar Homebuilding debt.

We are continually exploring various types of transactions to manage our leverage and liquidity positions, take advantage of market opportunities and increase our revenues and earnings. These transactions may include the issuance of additional indebtedness, the repurchase of our outstanding indebtedness for cash or equity, the acquisition of homebuilders and other companies, the purchase or sale of assets or lines of business, the issuance of common stock or securities convertible into shares of common stock, and/or pursuing other financing alternatives. In connection with some of our more recently formed businesses, such as Rialto and Lennar Multifamily, we may also consider other types of transactions such as restructurings, joint ventures, spin-offs or initial public offerings. If any of these transactions are implemented, they could materially impact the amount and composition of our indebtedness outstanding, increase our interest expense, dilute our existing stockholders and/or affect the net book value of our assets. At

November 30, 2016

, we had no agreements or understandings regarding any significant transactions other than an agreement to acquire WCI.

On September 22, 2016, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") with WCI under which we will acquire WCI through a merger for a combination of our Class A common stock and cash totaling $23.50 per share of WCI common stock. It is currently anticipated that the merger consideration payable to WCI stockholders will be $11.75 in cash and $11.75 in Class A common stock, with the Class A common stock valued at the average of its volume weighted average price on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") on each of the ten NYSE trading days before closing. For example, if the merger consideration is paid half in cash and half on our Class A common stock, based on the volume weighted average price of our Class A common stock on the ten NYSE trading days ended January 11, 2017, which was approximately $43.50 per share, a WCI stockholder would receive approximately 0.27 shares of our Class A common stock (as well as $11.75 in cash) with regard to each share of WCI common stock. However, we have the right to reduce the portion of the merger consideration that will be Class A common stock and increase the portion that will be cash, including the right to make the entire merger consideration cash. WCI can terminate the Merger Agreement to engage in a transaction that its Board of Directors deems to be more favorable to its stockholders than the transaction with the Company, unless the Company will match the deemed more favorable transaction. However, if WCI terminates the Merger Agreement to engage in another transaction, it will have to pay the Company a termination fee of $22.5 million. The Merger Agreement contains customary representations and warranties by the parties, and is subject to closing conditions, including the need for approval by the holders of WCI’s common stock. It is anticipated that a meeting of WCI stockholders to vote on the transaction will be held in February 2017, and, if the transaction is approved by the WCI stockholders, it will close promptly after the stockholder vote.



The following table summarizes our Lennar Homebuilding senior notes and other debts payable:

Our Lennar Homebuilding average debt outstanding was $5.1 billion with an average rate for interest incurred of 5.1% for the year ended

Interest is payable semi-annually for each of the series of senior notes. The senior notes are unsecured and unsubordinated, but are guaranteed by substantially all of the our 100% owned homebuilding subsidiaries.

(2)

We generally uses the net proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes, which can include the repayment or repurchase of other outstanding senior notes.

(3)

We issued

$400 million

aggregate principal amount at a price of

100%

and

$100 million

aggregate principal amount at a price of

100.5%

.

(4)

We issued

$350 million

aggregate principal amount at a price of

100%

and

$250 million

aggregate principal amount at a price of

100.25%

.

(5)

We issued

$350 million

aggregate principal amount at a price of

100%

,

$175 million

aggregate principal amount at a price of

98.073%

and

$50 million

aggregate principal amount at a price of

98.250%

.



In March 2016, we retired our

6.50%

Senior Notes for 100% of the

$250 million

outstanding principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest.

During the year ended

November 30, 2016

, all of the

$400 million

aggregate principal amount of the

3.25%

Convertible Senior Notes were converted or redeemed for

17.0 million

shares of Class A common stock, plus accrued and unpaid interest through the date of the conversions/redemptions and small cash premiums. The

3.25%

Convertible Senior Notes were converted or redeemed at the initial conversion rate of

42.5555

shares of Class A common stock per

$1,000

principal amount of the

3.25%

Convertible Senior Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately

$23.50

per share of Class A common stock.

During the year ended

November 30, 2016

, all of the remaining

$234 million

in aggregate outstanding principal amount of the

2.75%

Convertible Senior Notes were converted or exchanged by the holders for approximately

$234 million

in cash and

5.2 million

shares of Class A common stock, plus accrued and unpaid interest with respect to the exchanges. The

2.75%

Convertible Senior Notes were convertible into cash, shares of Class A common stock or a combination of both, at our election. However, we settled the face value of the

2.75%

Convertible Senior Notes in cash. Holders converted or exchanged the

2.75%

Convertible Senior Notes at the initial conversion rate of

45.1794

shares of Class A common stock per

$1,000

principal amount, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately

$22.13

per share of Class A common stock.

Subsequent to

November 30, 2016

, we issued

$600 million

aggregate principal amount of

4.125%

senior notes due 2022 (the "

4.125%

Senior Notes") at a price of

100%

. Proceeds from the offering, after underwriting fees but before expenses, are estimated to be

$596.1 million

. We will use the net proceeds from the sales of the

4.125%

Senior Notes to fund all or a portion of the cash consideration for our acquisition of WCI, to pay costs and expenses related to the acquisition of WCI and/or for general corporate purposes, which may include the repayment or repurchase of our debt. Interest on the

4.125%

Senior Notes is due semi-annually beginning July 15, 2017. The

4.125%

Senior Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated, but are guaranteed by substantially all of our 100% owned homebuilding subsidiaries.

Currently, substantially all of our 100% owned homebuilding subsidiaries are guaranteeing all of our senior notes (the "Guaranteed Notes"). The guarantees are full and unconditional. The principal reason our 100% owned homebuilding subsidiaries are guaranteeing the Guaranteed Notes is so holders of the Guaranteed Notes will have rights at least as great with regard to those subsidiaries as any other holders of a material amount of our unsecured debt. Therefore, the guarantees of the Guaranteed Notes will remain in effect with regard to a guarantor subsidiary only while it guarantees a material amount of the debt of Lennar Corporation, as a separate entity, to others. At any time when a guarantor subsidiary is no longer guaranteeing at least $75 million of Lennar Corporation’s debt other than the Guaranteed Notes, either directly or by guaranteeing other subsidiaries’ obligations as guarantors of Lennar Corporation’s debt, the guarantor subsidiary’s guarantee of the Guaranteed Notes will be suspended. Therefore, if the guarantor subsidiaries cease guaranteeing Lennar Corporation’s obligations under our Credit Facility and our letter of credit facilities and are not guarantors of any new debt, the guarantor subsidiaries’ guarantees of the Guaranteed Notes will be suspended until such time, if any, as they again are guaranteeing at least $75 million of Lennar Corporation’s debt other than the Guaranteed Notes.

If our guarantor subsidiaries are guaranteeing revolving credit lines totaling at least $75 million, we will treat the guarantees of the Guaranteed Notes as remaining in effect even during periods when Lennar Corporation’s borrowings under the revolving credit lines are less than $75 million. A subsidiary will be released from its guarantee and any other obligations it may have regarding the senior notes if all or substantially all its assets, or all of its capital stock, are sold or otherwise disposed of.

In June 2016, we amended our Credit Facility to increase the maximum borrowings from

$1.6 billion

to

$1.8 billion

. The maturity for

$1.3 billion

of the Credit Facility was extended from June 2019 to June 2020, with the remaining

$160 million

maturing in June 2018. As of

November 30, 2016

, the Credit Facility included a

$298 million

accordion feature, subject to additional commitments, with certain financial institutions. The proceeds available under the Credit Facility, which are subject to specified conditions for borrowing, may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. The credit agreement also provides that up to

$500 million

in commitments may be used for letters of credit. As of both

November 30, 2016

and


, we had

no

outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility. We may from time to time, borrow and repay amounts under the Credit Facility. Consequently, the amount outstanding under the Credit Facility at the end of the period may not be reflective of the total amounts outstanding during the period. In addition, we had

$320 million

letter of credit facilities with different financial institutions at

November 30, 2016

.

Under the amended Credit Facility agreement executed in June 2016 (the "Credit Agreement"), as of the end of each fiscal quarter, we are required to maintain minimum consolidated tangible net worth of approximately $1.5 billion plus the sum of 50% of the cumulative consolidated net income from February 29, 2012, if positive, and 50% of the net cash proceeds from any equity offerings from and after February 29, 2012 minus the lesser of 50% of the amount paid after June 24, 2016 to repurchase common stock and $100 million. We are required to maintain a leverage ratio that shall not exceed 65% and may be reduced by 2.5% per quarter if our interest coverage ratio is less than 2.25:1.00 for two consecutive fiscal calendar quarters. The



leverage ratio will have a floor of 60%. If our interest coverage ratio subsequently exceeds 2.25:1.00 for two consecutive fiscal calendar quarters, the leverage ratio we will be required to maintain will be increased by 2.5% per quarter to a maximum of 65%. As of the end of each fiscal quarter, we are also required to maintain either (1) liquidity in an amount equal to or greater than 1.00x consolidated interest incurred for the last twelve months then ended or (2) an interest coverage ratio equal to or greater than 1.50:1.00 for the last twelve months then ended. We believe that we were in compliance with our debt covenants at

November 30, 2016

The following summarizes our required debt covenants and our actual levels or ratios with respect to those covenants as calculated per the Credit Agreement as of

November 30, 2016

:

(1)

We are only required to maintain either (1) liquidity in an amount equal to or greater than 1.00x consolidated interest incurred for the last twelve months then ended or (2) an interest coverage ratio of equal to or greater than 1.50:1.00 for the last twelve months then ended. Although we are in compliance with our debt covenants for both calculations, we have only disclosed our liquidity test.

The terms minimum net worth test, maximum leverage ratio, liquidity test and interest coverage ratio used in the Credit Agreement are specifically calculated per the Credit Agreement and differ in specified ways from comparable GAAP or common usage terms.

Our performance letters of credit outstanding were

$270.8 million

and

$236.5 million

at

November 30, 2016

and


, respectively. Our financial letters of credit outstanding were

$210.3 million

and

$216.7 million

at

November 30, 2016

and


, respectively. Performance letters of credit are generally posted with regulatory bodies to guarantee the performance of certain development and construction activities. Financial letters of credit are generally posted in lieu of cash deposits on option contracts, for insurance risks, credit enhancements and as other collateral. Additionally, at

November 30, 2016

, we had outstanding surety bonds of

$1.4 billion

including performance surety bonds related to site improvements at various projects (including certain projects of our joint ventures) and financial surety bonds including

$223.4 million

related to pending litigation.

Our Lennar Financial Services segment's warehouse facilities at

November 30, 2016

were as follows:

(1)

Maximum aggregate commitment includes an uncommitted amount of

$250 million

.

(2)

Subsequent to

November 30, 2016

, the warehouse repurchase facility maturity date was extended to December 2017.

(3)

In accordance with the amended warehouse repurchase facility agreement, the maximum aggregate commitment will be decreased to

$400 million

in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and will be increased to

$600 million

in the second quarter of fiscal 2017.

Our Lennar Financial Services segment uses these facilities to finance its lending activities until the mortgage loans are sold to investors and the proceeds are collected. The facilities are non-recourse to us and are expected to be renewed or replaced with other facilities when they mature. Borrowings under the facilities and their prior year predecessors were

$1.1 billion

and

$858.3 million

, at

November 30, 2016

and


, respectively, and were collateralized by mortgage loans and receivables on loans sold to investors but not yet paid for with outstanding principal balances of

$1.1 billion

and

$916.9 million

, at

November 30, 2016

and


, respectively. The combined effective interest rate on the facilities at

November 30, 2016

was

2.9%

. If the facilities are not renewed or replaced, the borrowings under the lines of credit will be paid off by selling the mortgage loans held-for-sale to investors and by collecting on receivables on loans sold but not yet paid. Without the facilities, the Lennar Financial Services segment would have to use cash from operations and other funding sources to finance its lending activities.



At

November 30, 2016

, RMF warehouse facilities were as follows:

(1)

RMF uses these facilities to finance its loan origination and securitization business.

(2)

The warehouse repurchase facility has the option of an additional six month extension.

(3)

Rialto uses this warehouse repurchase facility to finance the origination of floating rate accrual loans which are reported as accrual loans within loans receivable, net. Borrowings under this facility were

$43.3 million

and

$36.3 million

as of

November 30, 2016

and


, respectively.

Borrowings under the facilities that finance RMF's loan originations and securitization activities were

$180.2 million

and

$317.1 million

as of

November 30, 2016

and


, respectively and were secured by a 75% interest in the originated commercial loans financed. The facilities require immediate repayment of the 75% interest in the secured commercial loans when the loans are sold in a securitization and the proceeds are collected. These warehouse repurchase facilities are non-recourse to us and are expected to be renewed or replaced with other facilities when they mature.

As of

November 30, 2016

and


, the carrying amount, net of debt issuance costs, of Rialto's

7.00%

Senior Notes was

$348.7 million

and

$347.9 million

, respectively. Under the indenture, Rialto is subject to certain covenants limiting, among other things, Rialto’s ability to incur indebtedness, to make investments, to make distributions to, or enter into transactions with Lennar or to create liens, subject to certain exceptions and qualifications. Rialto also has quarterly and annual reporting requirements, similar to an SEC registrant, to holders of the

7.00%

Senior Notes. We believe Rialto was in compliance with its debt covenants at

November 30, 2016

.

As of

November 30, 2016

and


, the outstanding amount, net of debt issuance costs, related to Rialto's Structured Notes was

$23.9 million

and

$31.3 million

, respectively. The estimated final payment date is

December 15, 2017

.

In November 2016, Rialto paid the remaining outstanding principal amount of

$30.3 million

related to a

$124 million


-year senior unsecured note provided by one of the selling institutions in the 2010 acquisition of a portfolio of distressed residential and commercial real estate loans and REO properties acquired from three financial institutions.

Changes in Capital Structure

We have a stock repurchase program adopted in 2001, which originally authorized us to purchase up to

20 million

shares of our outstanding common stock. During the years ended

November 30, 2016

,


and


, there were

no

share repurchases of common stock under the stock repurchase program. As of

November 30, 2016

, the remaining authorized shares that can be purchased under the stock repurchase program were

6.2 million

shares of common stock.

During the years ended

November 30, 2016

and


, treasury stock increased by

0.1 million

shares and

0.3 million

shares, respectively, of Class A common stock primarily due to activity related to our equity compensation plan.

During the years ended

November 30, 2016

,


and


, our Class A and Class B common stockholders received a per share annual dividend of

$0.16

.

Based on our current financial condition and credit relationships, we believe that our operations and borrowing resources will provide for our current and long-term capital requirements at our anticipated levels of activity.



Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Lennar Homebuilding - Investments in Unconsolidated Entities

At

November 30, 2016

, we had equity investments in


homebuilding and land unconsolidated entities (of which 2 had recourse debt, 9 had non-recourse debt and 27 had no debt), compared to 34 homebuilding and land unconsolidated entities at

November 30, 2015

. Historically, we have invested in unconsolidated entities that acquired and developed land (1) for our homebuilding operations or for sale to third parties or (2) for the construction of homes for sale to third-party homebuyers. Through these entities, we have primarily sought to reduce and share our risk by limiting the amount of our capital invested in land, while obtaining access to potential future homesites and allowing us to participate in strategic ventures. The use of these entities also, in some instances, has enabled us to acquire land to which we could not otherwise obtain access, or could not obtain access on as favorable terms, without the participation of a strategic partner. Participants in these joint ventures have been land owners/developers, other homebuilders and financial or strategic partners. Joint ventures with land owners/developers have given us access to homesites owned or controlled by our partners. Joint ventures with other homebuilders have provided us with the ability to bid jointly with our partners for large land parcels. Joint ventures with financial partners have allowed us to combine our homebuilding expertise with access to our partners’ capital. Joint ventures with strategic partners have allowed us to combine our homebuilding expertise with the specific expertise (e.g. commercial or infill experience) of our partner. Each joint venture is governed by an executive committee consisting of members from the partners.

Although the strategic purposes of our joint ventures and the nature of our joint ventures partners vary, the joint ventures are generally designed to acquire, develop and/or sell specific assets during a limited life-time. The joint ventures are typically structured through non-corporate entities in which control is shared with our venture partners. Each joint venture is unique in terms of its funding requirements and liquidity needs. We and the other joint venture participants typically make pro-rata cash contributions to the joint venture. In many cases, our risk is limited to our equity contribution and potential future capital contributions. Additionally, most joint ventures obtain third-party debt to fund a portion of the acquisition, development and construction costs of their communities. The joint venture agreements usually permit, but do not require, the joint ventures to make additional capital calls in the future. However, capital calls relating to the repayment of joint venture debt under payment guarantees generally is required.

Under the terms of our joint venture agreements, we generally have the right to share in earnings and distributions of the entities on a pro-rata basis based on our ownership percentage. Some joint venture agreements provide for a different allocation of profit and cash distributions if and when the cumulative results of the joint venture exceed specified targets (such as a specified internal rate of return). Lennar Homebuilding equity in earnings (loss) from unconsolidated entities excludes our pro-rata share of joint ventures’ earnings resulting from land sales to our homebuilding divisions. Instead, we account for those earnings as a reduction of our costs of purchasing the land from the joint ventures or reduce the investment in certain cost sharing unconsolidated entities. This in effect defers recognition of our share of the joint ventures’ earnings related to these sales until we deliver a home and title passes to a third-party homebuyer.

In many instances, we are designated as the manager of a venture under the direction of a management committee that has shared power among the partners of the unconsolidated entity and we receive fees for such services. In addition, we often enter into option and purchase contracts to acquire properties from our joint ventures, generally for market prices at specified dates in the future. Option contracts generally require us to make deposits using cash or irrevocable letters of credit toward the exercise price. These option deposits are generally negotiated on a case by case basis.

We regularly monitor the results of our unconsolidated joint ventures and any trends that may affect their future liquidity or results of operations. Joint ventures in which we have investments may be subject to a variety of financial and non-financial debt covenants related primarily to equity maintenance, fair value of collateral and minimum homesite takedown or sale requirements. We monitor the performance of joint ventures in which we have investments on a regular basis to assess compliance with debt covenants. For those joint ventures not in compliance with the debt covenants, we evaluate and assess possible impairment of our investment.

Our arrangements with joint ventures generally do not restrict our activities or those of the other participants. However, in certain instances, we agree not to engage in some types of activities that may be viewed as competitive with the activities of these ventures in the localities where the joint ventures do business.

As discussed above, the joint ventures in which we invest generally supplement equity contributions with third-party debt to finance their activities. In some instances, the debt financing is non-recourse, thus neither we nor the other equity partners are a party to the debt instruments. In other cases, we and the other partners agree to provide credit support in the form of repayment guarantees.

Material contractual obligations of our unconsolidated joint ventures primarily relate to the debt obligations described above. The joint ventures generally do not enter into lease commitments because the entities are managed either by us, or another of the joint venture participants, who supply the necessary facilities and employee services in exchange for market-



based management fees. However, they do enter into management contracts with the participants who manage them. Some joint ventures also enter into agreements with developers, which may be us or other joint venture participants, to develop raw land into finished homesites or to build homes.

The joint ventures often enter into option or purchase agreements with buyers, which may include us or other joint venture participants, to deliver homesites or parcels in the future at market prices. Option deposits are recorded by the joint ventures as liabilities until the exercise dates at which time the deposit and remaining exercise proceeds are recorded as revenue. Any forfeited deposit is recognized as revenue at the time of forfeiture. Our unconsolidated joint ventures generally do not enter into off-balance sheet arrangements.

As described above, the liquidity needs of joint ventures in which we have investments vary on an entity-by-entity basis depending on each entity’s purpose and the stage in its life cycle. During formation and development activities, the entities generally require cash, which is provided through a combination of equity contributions and debt financing, to fund acquisition and development of properties. As the properties are completed and sold, cash generated is available to repay debt and for distribution to the joint venture’s members. Thus, the amount of cash available for a joint venture to distribute at any given time is primarily a function of the scope of the joint venture’s activities and the stage in the joint venture’s life cycle.

We track our share of cumulative earnings and cumulative distributions of our joint ventures. For purposes of classifying distributions received from joint ventures in our statements of cash flows, cumulative distributions are treated as returns

on

capital to the extent of cumulative earnings and included in our consolidated statements of cash flows as cash flow from operating activities. Cumulative distributions in excess of our share of cumulative earnings are treated as returns

of

capital and included in our consolidated statements of cash flows as cash flows from investing activities.

Summarized financial information on a combined 100% basis related to Lennar Homebuilding’s unconsolidated entities that are accounted for by the equity method was as follows:

Statements of Operations and Selected Information

(1)

Our share of profit and cash distributions from the sales of land could be higher compared to our ownership interest in unconsolidated entities if certain specified internal rate of return or cash flow milestones are achieved.

For the year ended

November 30, 2016

, Lennar Homebuilding equity in loss from unconsolidated entities was primarily attributable to our share of costs associated with the FivePoint combination (discussed in the following page) and operational net losses from the new FivePoint unconsolidated entity, totaling

$42.6 million

. This was partially offset by

$12.7 million

of equity in earnings primarily due to sales of homesites to third parties by one of our unconsolidated entities.

For the year ended

November 30, 2015

, Lennar Homebuilding equity in earnings included

$82.8 million

of equity in earnings from one of our unconsolidated entities primarily due to (1) sales of approximately


homesites to a joint venture in which we have a 50% investment and for which our portion of the gross profit from the sale was deferred, (2) sales of approximately


homesites and a commercial property to third parties and (3) a gain on debt extinguishment. In addition, for the year ended

November 30, 2015

, net earnings of unconsolidated entities included sales of approximately


homesites to us by one of our unconsolidated entities that resulted in

$49.3 million

of gross profit, of which our portion was deferred.

For the year ended

November 30, 2014

, Lennar Homebuilding equity in loss from unconsolidated entities related primarily to our share of operating losses from various Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities, which included

$4.6 million

of valuation adjustments related to assets of Lennar Homebuilding's unconsolidated entities, partially offset by

$4.7 million

of equity in earnings as a result of third-party land sales by one unconsolidated entity.



Balance Sheets

On May 2, 2016 (the "Closing Date"), we contributed, or obtained the right to contribute, our investment in three strategic joint ventures previously managed by FivePoint Communities in exchange for an investment in a FivePoint entity. The fair values of the assets contributed to this FivePoint entity, included within the unconsolidated entities summarized condensed balance sheet presented above, are preliminary and may be adjusted when additional information is obtained during the transaction’s measurement period (a period of up to one year from the Closing Date) that may change the fair value allocation as of the acquisition date. A portion of the assets of one of the three strategic joint ventures was retained by us and our venture partner in a new unconsolidated entity. The transactions did not have a material impact to our financial position or cash flows. We recorded our share of combination costs in equity in loss from unconsolidated entities on our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended

November 30, 2016

.

As of

November 30, 2016

and


, our recorded investments in Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities were

$811.7 million

and

$741.6 million

, respectively, while the underlying equity in Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities partners’ net assets as of

November 30, 2016

and


was

$1.2 billion

and

$839.5 million

, respectively. The basis difference is primarily as a result of us contributing our investment in

three

strategic joint ventures with a higher fair value than book value for an investment in the FivePoint entity and deferring equity in earnings on land sales to us.

During the year ended November 30, 2015, one of our unconsolidated entities sold approximately


homesites to a joint venture, in which we have a

50%

investment, for

$472 million

of which

$320 million

was financed through a non-recourse note. This transaction resulted in

$157.4 million

of gross profit, of which our portion was deferred. In addition, this transaction resulted in an increase in inventory, other assets and debt of the Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities reflected in the summarized condensed financial information presented in the previous table for the year ended November 30, 2015.

The Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities in which we have investments usually finance their activities with a combination of partner equity and debt financing. In some instances, we and our partners have guaranteed debt of certain unconsolidated entities.

Debt to total capital of the Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities in which we have investments was calculated as follows:

Our investments in Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities by type of venture were as follows:



Indebtedness of an unconsolidated entity is secured by its own assets. Some unconsolidated entities own multiple properties and other assets. There is no cross collateralization of debt of different unconsolidated entities. We also do not use our investment in one unconsolidated entity as collateral for the debt of another unconsolidated entity or commingle funds among Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities.

In connection with loans to a Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entity, we and our partners often guarantee to a lender, either jointly and severally or on a several basis, any or all of the following: (i) the completion of the development, in whole or in part, (ii) indemnification of the lender from environmental issues, (iii) indemnification of the lender from "bad boy acts" of the unconsolidated entity (or full recourse liability in the event of an unauthorized transfer or bankruptcy) and (iv) that the loan to value and/or loan to cost will not exceed a certain percentage (maintenance or remargining guarantee) or that a percentage of the outstanding loan will be repaid (repayment guarantee).

In connection with loans to an unconsolidated entity where there is a joint and several guarantee, we sometimes have a reimbursement agreement with our partner. The reimbursement agreement provides that neither party is responsible for more than its proportionate share of the guarantee. However, if our joint venture partner does not have adequate financial resources to meet its obligations under the reimbursement agreement, we may be liable for more than our proportionate share, up to our maximum exposure, which is the full amount covered by the joint and several guarantee.

The total debt of Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities in which we have investments, including Lennar's maximum recourse exposure, were as follows:

(1)

Non-recourse land seller debt and other debt as of both

November 30, 2016

and


, included a

$320 million

non-recourse note related to a transaction between one of our unconsolidated entities and another unconsolidated joint venture, described previously, which was settled subsequent to

November 30, 2016

.

(2)

As of

November 30, 2016

, the increase in our maximum recourse exposure was primarily related to us providing a repayment guarantee on an unconsolidated entity's debt.

During the year ended

November 30, 2016

, our maximum recourse exposure related to indebtedness of Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities increased by

$41.5 million

, as a result of us providing a repayment guarantee of

$43.4 million

on a Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entity's debt, partially offset by

$0.9 million

of commitment reductions primarily through capital contributions to unconsolidated entities and by

$1.0 million

primarily related to the joint ventures selling assets.

The recourse debt exposure in the previous table represents our maximum exposure to loss from guarantees and does not take into account the underlying value of the collateral or the other assets of the borrowers that are available to repay debt or to reimburse us for any payments on our guarantees.

In addition, in most instances in which we have guaranteed debt of a Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entity, our partners have also guaranteed that debt and are required to contribute their share of the guarantee payment. In a repayment guarantee, we and our venture partners guarantee repayment of a portion or all of the debt in the event of a default before the lender would have to exercise its rights against the collateral.

In connection with many of the loans to Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities, we and our joint venture partners (or entities related to them) have been required to give guarantees of completion to the lenders. Those completion guarantees may require that the guarantors complete the construction of the improvements for which the financing was obtained. If the construction is to be done in phases, the guarantee generally is limited to completing only the phases as to which construction has already commenced and for which loan proceeds were used.

If we are required to make a payment under any guarantee, the payment would generally constitute a capital contribution or loan to the Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entity and increase our share of any funds the unconsolidated entity distributes.



As of

November 30, 2016

and


, the fair values of the repayment and completion guarantees were not material. We believe that as of

November 30, 2016

, in the event we become legally obligated to perform under a guarantee of the obligation of a Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entity due to a triggering event under a guarantee, the collateral is expected to be sufficient to repay at least a significant portion of the obligation or we and our partners would contribute additional capital into the venture. In certain instances, we have placed performance letters of credit and surety bonds with municipalities for our joint ventures (see Note 6 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements).

In view of credit market conditions during the past several years, it is not uncommon for lenders and/or real estate developers, including joint ventures in which we have interests, to assert non-monetary defaults (such as failure to meet construction completion deadlines or declines in the market value of collateral below required amounts) or technical monetary defaults against the real estate developers. In most instances, those asserted defaults are resolved by modifications of the loan terms, additional equity investments or other concessions by the borrowers. In addition, in some instances, real estate developers, including joint ventures in which we have interests, are forced to request temporary waivers of covenants in loan documents or modifications of loan terms, which are often, but not always obtained. However, in some instances developers, including joint ventures in which we have interests, are not able to meet their monetary obligations to lenders, and are thus declared in default. Because we sometimes guarantee all or portions of the obligations to lenders of joint ventures in which we have interests, when these joint ventures default on their obligations, lenders may or may not have claims against us. Normally, we do not make payments with regard to guarantees of joint venture obligations while the joint ventures are contesting assertions regarding sums due to their lenders. When it is determined that a joint venture is obligated to make a payment that we have guaranteed and the joint venture will not be able to make that payment, we accrue the amounts probable to be paid by us as a liability. Although we generally fulfill our guarantee obligations within a reasonable time after we determine that we are obligated with regard to them, at any point in time it is possible that we will have some balance of unpaid guarantee liability. At both

November 30, 2016

Rialto - Investments in Unconsolidated Entities

The following table reflects Rialto's investments in funds that invest in and manage real estate related assets and other investments:

During the years ended

November 30, 2016

,


, and


, Rialto's share of earnings from unconsolidated entities was

$19.0 million

,

$22.3 million

and

$59.3 million

, respectively.



As manager of real estate funds, we are entitled to receive additional revenue through carried interests if the funds meet certain performance thresholds. The amounts presented in the table below are advance distributions received related to Rialto's carried interests in order to cover income tax obligations resulting from allocations of taxable income to its carried interests in its real estate funds. These advance distributions are not subject to clawbacks but will reduce future carried interest payments to which Rialto becomes entitled from the applicable funds and have been recorded as revenues. Advance distributions received during the years ended

November 30, 2016

and


were as follows:

The following table represents amounts Rialto would have received had the funds ceased operations and hypothetically liquidated all their investments at their estimated fair values on

November 30, 2016

, both gross and net of amounts already received as advanced tax distributions. The actual amounts Rialto may receive could be materially different from amounts presented in the table below.

(1)

Net of interests of participating employees (refer to paragraph below).

During 2015, Rialto adopted a Carried Interest Incentive Plan (the "Plan"), under which participating employees in the aggregate may receive up to

40%

of the equity units of a limited liability company (a "Carried Interest Entity") that is entitled to distributions made by a fund or other investment vehicle (a "Fund") managed by a subsidiary of Rialto. As such, those employees receiving equity units in a Carried Interest Entity may benefit from distributions made by a Fund to the extent the Carried Interest Entity makes distributions to its equity holders. The units issued to employees are equity awards and are subject to vesting schedules and forfeiture or repurchase provisions in the case of termination of employment.

Summarized condensed financial information on a combined 100% basis related to Rialto’s investments in unconsolidated entities that are accounted for by the equity method was as follows:

Lennar Multifamily - Investments in Unconsolidated Entities

At

November 30, 2016

, Lennar Multifamily had equity investments in


unconsolidated entities that are engaged in multifamily residential developments (of which 18 had non-recourse debt and 10 had no debt), compared to


unconsolidated entities at

November 30, 2015

. We invest in unconsolidated entities that acquire and develop land to construct multifamily rental properties. Through these entities, we are focusing on developing a geographically diversified portfolio of institutional quality multifamily rental properties in select U.S. markets. Participants in these joint ventures have been financial partners. Joint ventures with financial partners have allowed us to combine our development and construction expertise with access to our partners’ capital. Each joint venture is governed by an operating agreement that provides significant substantive participating voting rights on major decisions to our partners.

In 2015, the Lennar Multifamily segment completed the initial closing of the Venture for the development, construction and property management of class-A multifamily assets with

$1.1 billion

of commitments. During the year ended

November 30, 2016

, the Venture received an additional

$1.1 billion

of equity commitments, completing the fund raising for the Venture and increasing its total commitments to

$2.2 billion

, including a

$504 million

co-investment commitment by us comprised of cash, undeveloped land and preacquisition costs. The Venture is currently seeded with


undeveloped multifamily assets that were previously purchased or under contract by the Lennar Multifamily segment totaling approximately

9,800

apartments with projected project costs of

$3.4 billion

as of

November 30, 2016

. During the year ended

November 30, 2016

,

$656.1 million

in equity commitments were called, of which we contributed our portion of

$203.8 million

. During the year ended

November 30, 2016

, we received net distributions of

$113.7 million

as return of capital from the Venture when bringing new investors into the Venture. As of

November 30, 2016

,

$931.6 million

of the

$2.2 billion

in equity commitments had been called, of which we have contributed

$215.8 million

representing our pro-rata portion of the called equity, resulting in a remaining equity commitment for us of

$288.2 million

. As of

November 30, 2016

and


, the carrying value of our investment in the Venture was

$198.2 million

and

$122.5 million

, respectively.

The joint ventures are typically structured through non-corporate entities in which control is shared with our venture partners. Each joint venture is unique in terms of its funding requirements and liquidity needs. We and the other joint venture participants typically make pro-rata cash contributions to the joint venture except for cost over-runs relating to the construction of the project. In all cases, we have been required to provide guarantees of completion and cost over-runs to the lenders and partners. These completion guarantees may require us to complete the improvements for which the financing was obtained. Therefore, our risk is limited to our equity contribution, draws on letters of credit and potential future payments under the guarantees of completion and cost over-runs. In certain instances, payments made under the cost over-run guarantees are considered capital contributions.

Additionally, the joint ventures obtain third-party debt to fund a portion of the acquisition, development and construction costs of the rental projects. The joint venture agreements usually permit, but do not require, the joint ventures to make additional capital calls in the future. However, the joint venture debt does not have repayment or maintenance guarantees. Neither we nor the other equity partners are a party to the debt instruments. In some cases, we agree to provide credit support in the form of a letter of credit provided to the bank.

We regularly monitor the results of our unconsolidated joint ventures and any trends that may affect their future liquidity or results of operations. We also monitor the performance of joint ventures in which we have investments on a regular basis to assess compliance with debt covenants. For those joint ventures not in compliance with the debt covenants, we evaluate and assess possible impairment of our investment. We believe all of the joint ventures were in compliance with their debt covenants at

November 30, 2016

.



Under the terms of our joint venture agreements, we generally have the right to share in earnings and distributions of the entities on a pro-rata basis based on our ownership percentages. Most joint venture agreements provide for a different allocation of profit and cash distributions if and when the cumulative results of the joint venture exceed specified targets (such as a specified internal rate of return).

In many instances, we are designated as the development manager and/or the general contractor and/or the property manager of the unconsolidated entity and receive fees for such services. In addition, we do not plan to enter into option and purchase contracts to acquire properties from our Lennar Multifamily joint ventures.

Our arrangements with joint ventures generally do not restrict our activities or those of the other participants. However, in certain instances, we agree not to engage in some types of activities that may be viewed as competitive with the activities of these ventures in the localities where the joint ventures do business.

Material contractual obligations of our unconsolidated joint ventures primarily relate to the debt obligations described above. The joint ventures generally do not enter into lease commitments because the entities are managed either by us or the other partners, who supply the necessary facilities and employee services in exchange for market-based management fees. However, they do enter into management contracts with the participants who manage them.

As described above, the liquidity needs of joint ventures in which we have investments vary on an entity-by-entity basis depending on each entity’s purpose and the stage in its life cycle. During formation and development activities, the entities generally require cash, which is provided through a combination of equity contributions and debt financing, to fund acquisition, development and construction of multifamily rental properties. As the properties are completed and sold, cash generated will be available to repay debt and for distribution to the joint venture’s members. Thus, the amount of cash available for a joint venture to distribute at any given time is primarily a function of the scope of the joint venture’s activities and the stage in the joint venture’s life cycle.

Summarized financial information on a combined 100% basis related to Lennar Multifamily’s investments in unconsolidated entities that are accounted for by the equity method was as follows:

Balance Sheets

The following table summarizes the principal maturities of our Lennar Multifamily unconsolidated entities debt as per current debt arrangements as of

November 30, 2016

and does not represent estimates of future cash payments that will be made to reduce debt balances.



Statements of Operations and Selected Information

(1)

During the year ended

November 30, 2016

, Lennar Multifamily equity in earnings from unconsolidated entities included the segment's

$91.0 million

share of gains as a result of the sale of seven operating properties by its unconsolidated entities. During the years ended

November 30, 2015

and


, Lennar Multifamily equity in earnings from unconsolidated entities included the segment's

$22.2 million

and

$14.7 million

share of gains, respectively, as a result of the sale of two operating properties each year by its unconsolidated entities.

(2)

Our share of profit and cash distributions from sales of operating properties could be higher compared to our ownership interest in unconsolidated entities if certain specified internal rate of return milestones are achieved.

Option Contracts

We often obtain access to land through option contracts, which generally enable us to control portions of properties owned by third parties (including land funds) and unconsolidated entities until we have determined whether to exercise the options.

The table below indicates the number of homesites owned and homesites to which we had access through option contracts with third parties ("optioned") or unconsolidated JVs (i.e., controlled homesites) at

November 30, 2016

and


:

We evaluate all option contracts for land to determine whether they are VIEs and, if so, whether we are the primary beneficiary of certain of these option contracts. Although we do not have legal title to the optioned land, if we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary or make a significant deposit for optioned land, we may need to consolidate the land under option at the purchase price of the optioned land.

During the year ended

November 30, 2016

, consolidated inventory not owned increased by

$62.2 million

with a corresponding increase to liabilities related to consolidated inventory not owned in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of

November 30, 2016

. The increase was primarily related to the consolidation of an option agreement, partially offset by us exercising our option to acquire land under previously consolidated contracts. To reflect the purchase price of the inventory consolidated, we had a net reclass related to option deposits from land under development to consolidated inventory not owned in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of

November 30, 2016

. The liabilities related to consolidated



inventory not owned primarily represent the difference between the option exercise prices for the optioned land and our cash deposits.

Our exposure to loss related to our option contracts with third parties and unconsolidated entities consisted of our non-refundable option deposits and pre-acquisition costs totaling

$85.0 million

and

$89.2 million

at

November 30, 2016

and


, respectively. Additionally, we had posted

$45.1 million

and

$70.4 million

of letters of credit in lieu of cash deposits under certain land and option contracts as of

November 30, 2016

and


, respectively.

Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments

The following table summarizes certain of our contractual obligations at

November 30, 2016

:

(1)

The amounts presented in the table above exclude debt issuance costs and any discounts/premiums. Subsequent to

November 30, 2016

, we issued

$600 million

aggregate principal amount of

4.125%

senior notes due 2022.

(2)

Amounts include notes payable and other debts payable of $351.0 million related to Rialto's

7.00%

Senior Notes,

$223.5 million

related to the Rialto warehouse repurchase facilities and

$23.9 million

related to Rialto's Structured Notes with an estimated final payment date of

December 15, 2017

. These amounts exclude debt issuance costs.

(3)

Interest commitments on variable interest-bearing debt are determined based on the interest rate as of

November 30, 2016

.

(4)

Amounts include

$288.2 million

remaining equity commitment to fund the Venture for future expenditures related to the construction and development of the projects,

$92.8 million

of commitments to fund Rialto's Fund III and

$14.3 million

of commitments to fund Rialto's RCP.

(5)

Total contractual obligations exclude our gross unrecognized tax benefits and accrued interest and penalties totaling

$58.3 million

as of

November 30, 2016

, because we are unable to make reasonable estimates as to the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities.

We are subject to the usual obligations associated with entering into contracts (including option contracts) for the purchase, development and sale of real estate in the routine conduct of our business. Option contracts for the purchase of land generally enable us to defer acquiring portions of properties owned by third parties and unconsolidated entities until we have determined whether to exercise our options. This reduces our financial risk associated with land holdings. At

November 30, 2016

, we had access to

33,166

homesites through option contracts with third parties and unconsolidated entities in which we have investments. At

November 30, 2016

, we had

$85.0 million

of non-refundable option deposits and pre-acquisition costs related to certain of these homesites and had posted

$45.1 million

of letters of credit in lieu of cash deposits under certain land and option contracts.

At

November 30, 2016

, we had letters of credit outstanding in the amount of

$481.1 million

(which included the

$45.1 million

of letters of credit discussed above). These letters of credit are generally posted either with regulatory bodies to guarantee our performance of certain development and construction activities, or in lieu of cash deposits on option contracts, for insurance risks, credit enhancements and as other collateral. Additionally, at

November 30, 2016

, we had outstanding surety bonds of

$1.4 billion

including performance surety bonds related to site improvements at various projects (including certain projects of our joint ventures) and financial surety bonds including

$223.4 million

related to pending litigation. Although significant development and construction activities have been completed related to these site improvements, these bonds are generally not released until all of the development and construction activities are completed. As of

November 30, 2016

, there were approximately

$488.9 million

, or

42%

, of anticipated future costs to complete related to these site improvements. We do not presently anticipate any draws upon these bonds or letters of credit, but if any such draws occur, we do not believe they would have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Our Lennar Financial Services segment had a pipeline of loan applications in process of $2.2 billion at

November 30, 2016

. Loans in process for which interest rates were committed to the borrowers totaled approximately $629.1 million as of

November 30, 2016

. Substantially all of these commitments were for periods of 60 days or less. Since a portion of these



commitments is expected to expire without being exercised by the borrowers or borrowers may not meet certain criteria at the time of closing, the total commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.

Our Lennar Financial Services segment uses mandatory mortgage-backed securities ("MBS") forward commitments, option contracts, future contracts and investor commitments to hedge our mortgage-related interest rate exposure. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk. Credit risk associated with MBS forward commitments, option contracts, future contracts and loan sales transactions is managed by limiting our counterparties to investment banks, federally regulated bank affiliates and other investors meeting our credit standards. Our risk, in the event of default by the purchaser, is the difference between the contract price and fair value of the MBS forward commitments and option contracts. At

November 30, 2016

, we had open commitments amounting to

$1.2 billion

to sell MBS with varying settlement dates through February 2017 and open future contracts in the amount of

$476.0 million

with the settlement dates through September 2023.

The following sections discuss market and financing risk, seasonality and interest rates and changing prices that may have an impact on our business:

Market and Financing Risk

We finance our contributions to JVs, land acquisition and development activities, construction activities, financial services activities, Rialto activities, Lennar Multifamily activities and general operating needs primarily with cash generated from operations, debt and equity issuances, as well as borrowings under our Credit Facility and warehouse repurchase facilities. We also purchase land under option agreements, which enables us to control homesites until we have determined whether to exercise the options. We try to manage the financial risks of adverse market conditions associated with land holdings by what we believe to be prudent underwriting of land purchases in areas we view as desirable growth markets, careful management of the land development process and, until recent years, limitation of risks by using partners to share the costs of purchasing and developing land as well as obtaining access to land through option contracts. Although we believed our land underwriting standards were conservative, we did not anticipate the severe decline in land values and the sharply reduced demand for new homes encountered in the prior economic downturn.

Seasonality

We historically have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, variability in quarterly results. Our homebuilding business is seasonal in nature and generally reflects higher levels of new home order activity in our second fiscal quarter and increased deliveries in the second half of our fiscal year. However, periods of economic downturn in the industry can alter seasonal patterns.

Interest Rates and Changing Prices

Inflation can have a long-term impact on us because increasing costs of land, materials and labor result in a need to increase the sales prices of homes. In addition, inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates, which can have a negative impact on housing demand and the costs of financing land development activities and housing construction. Rising interest rates as well as increased material and labor costs, may reduce gross margins. An increase in material and labor costs is particularly a problem during a period of declining home prices. Conversely, deflation can impact the value of real estate and make it difficult for us to recover our land costs. Therefore, either inflation or deflation could adversely impact our future results of operations.

New Accounting Pronouncements

See Note 1 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for a comprehensive list of new accounting pronouncements.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this document. As discussed in Note 1, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements. Listed below are those policies and estimates that we believe are critical and require the use of significant judgment in their application.



Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets

We record income taxes under the asset and liability method, whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and attributable to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or paid. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period when the changes are enacted. Interest related to unrecognized tax benefits is recognized in the financial statements as a component of income tax expense.

A reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance is required if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized. Accordingly, the need to establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets is assessed each reporting period by us based on the consolidation of all available positive and negative evidence using a "more-likely-than-not" standard with respect to whether deferred tax assets will be realized. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses, actual earnings, forecasts of future profitability, the duration of statutory carryforward periods, our experience with loss carryforwards not expiring unused and tax planning alternatives.

We believe that the accounting estimate for the valuation of deferred tax assets is a critical accounting estimate because of the judgment required in assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. We base our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates and, in certain cases, business plans and other expectations about future outcomes. Changes in existing tax laws or rates could affect actual tax results and future business results, which may affect the amount of deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of deferred tax assets over time. Our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents our best estimate of future events.

Lennar Homebuilding and Lennar Multifamily Operations

Lennar Homebuilding Revenue Recognition

Revenues from sales of homes are recognized when the sales are closed and title passes to the new homeowner, the new homeowner’s initial and continuing investment is adequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay for the home, the new homeowner’s receivable is not subject to future subordination and we do not have a substantial continuing involvement with the new home. Revenues from sales of land are recognized when a significant down payment is received, the earnings process is complete, title passes and collectability of the receivable is reasonably assured. We believe that the accounting policy related to revenue recognition is a critical accounting policy because of the significance of revenue.

Lennar Multifamily Revenue Recognition

Our Lennar Multifamily segment provides management services with respect to the development, construction and property management of rental projects in joint ventures in which we have investments. As a result, our Lennar Multifamily segment earns and receives fees, which are generally based upon a stated percentage of development and construction costs and a percentage of gross rental collections. These fees are included in Lennar Multifamily revenue and are recorded over the period in which the services are performed, fees are determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. In addition, our Lennar Multifamily segment provides general contractor services for the construction of some of its rental projects and recognizes the revenue over the period in which the services are performed under the percentage of completion method. We believe that the accounting policy related to Lennar Multifamily revenue recognition is a critical accounting policy because it represents a significant portion of our Lennar Multifamily's revenues and is expected to continue to grow in the future as the segment builds more rental properties.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at cost unless the inventory within a community is determined to be impaired, in which case the impaired inventory is written down to fair value. Inventory costs include land, land development and home construction costs, real estate taxes, deposits on land purchase contracts and interest related to development and construction. We review our inventory for indicators of impairment by evaluating each community during each reporting period. The inventory within each community is categorized as finished homes and construction in progress or land under development based on the development state of the community. There were


and


active communities, excluding unconsolidated entities, as of

November 30, 2016

and


, respectively. If the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by a community are less than its carrying amount, an impairment charge is recorded to write down the carrying amount of such community to its estimated fair value.

In conducting our review for indicators of impairment on a community level, we evaluate, among other things, the margins on homes that have been delivered, margins on homes under sales contracts in backlog, projected margins with regard to future home sales over the life of the community, projected margins with regard to future land sales, and the estimated fair



value of the land itself. We pay particular attention to communities in which inventory is moving at a slower than anticipated absorption pace and communities whose average sales price and/or margins are trending downward and are anticipated to continue to trend downward. From this review, we identify communities in which to assess if the carrying values exceed their undiscounted cash flows. Although gross margin percentages for the year ended

November 30, 2016

have decreased compared to the year ended

November 30, 2015

primarily due to an increase in land costs, revenues have increased for all of our homebuilding segments and Homebuilding Other, compared to the year ended

November 30, 2015

, primarily due to an increase in home deliveries and an increase in the average sales price of homes delivered.

We estimate the fair value of our communities using a discounted cash flow model. The projected cash flows for each community are significantly impacted by estimates related to market supply and demand, product type by community, homesite sizes, sales pace, sales prices, sales incentives, construction costs, sales and marketing expenses, the local economy, competitive conditions, labor costs, costs of materials and other factors for that particular community. Every division evaluates the historical performance of each of its communities as well as current trends in the market and economy impacting the community and its surrounding areas. These trends are analyzed for each of the estimates listed above.

Each of the homebuilding markets in which we operate is unique, as homebuilding has historically been a local business driven by local market conditions and demographics. Each of our homebuilding markets has specific supply and demand relationships reflective of local economic conditions. Our projected cash flows are impacted by many assumptions. Some of the most critical assumptions in our cash flow models are our projected absorption pace for home sales, sales prices and costs to build and deliver our homes on a community by community basis.

In order to arrive at the assumed absorption pace for home sales and the assumed sales prices included in our cash flow model, we analyze our historical absorption pace and historical sales prices in the community and in other comparable communities in the geographical area. In addition, we consider internal and external market studies and place greater emphasis on more current metrics and trends, which generally include, but are not limited to, statistics and forecasts on population demographics and on sales prices in neighboring communities, unemployment rates and availability and sales price of competing product in the geographical area where the community is located as well as the absorption pace realized in our most recent quarters and the sales prices included in our current backlog for such communities.

Generally, if we notice a variation from historical results over a span of two fiscal quarters, we consider such variation to be the establishment of a trend and adjust our historical information accordingly in order to develop assumptions on the projected absorption pace and sales prices in the cash flow model for a community.

In order to arrive at our assumed costs to build and deliver our homes, we generally assume a cost structure reflecting contracts currently in place with our vendors adjusted for any anticipated cost reduction initiatives or increases in cost structure. Those costs assumed are used in our cash flow models for our communities.

Since the estimates and assumptions included in our cash flow models are based upon historical results and projected trends, they do not anticipate unexpected changes in market conditions or strategies that may lead to us incurring additional impairment charges in the future.

Using all the available information, we calculate our best estimate of projected cash flows for each community. While many of the estimates are calculated based on historical and projected trends, all estimates are subjective and change from market to market and community to community as market and economic conditions change. The determination of fair value also requires discounting the estimated cash flows at a rate we believe a market participant would determine to be commensurate with the inherent risks associated with the assets and related estimated cash flow streams. The discount rate used in determining each asset’s fair value depends on the community’s projected life and development stage. We generally use a discount rate of approximately

20%

, subject to the perceived risks associated with the community’s cash flow streams relative to its inventory.

We estimate the fair value of inventory evaluated for impairment based on market conditions and assumptions made by management at the time the inventory is evaluated, which may differ materially from actual results if market conditions or our assumptions change. For example, changes in market conditions and other specific developments or changes in assumptions may cause us to re-evaluate our strategy regarding previously impaired inventory, as well as inventory not currently impaired but for which indicators of impairment may arise if market deterioration occurs, and certain other assets that could result in further valuation adjustments and/or additional write-offs of option deposits and pre-acquisition costs due to abandonment of those options contracts.

We also have access to land inventory through option contracts, which generally enables us to defer acquiring portions of properties owned by third parties and unconsolidated entities until we have determined whether to exercise our options. A majority of our option contracts require a non-refundable cash deposit or irrevocable letter of credit based on a percentage of the purchase price of the land. In determining whether to walk-away from an option contract, we evaluate the option primarily based upon the expected cash flows from the property under option.



Our investments in option contracts are recorded at cost unless those investments are determined to be impaired, in which case our investments are written down to fair value. We review option contracts for indicators of impairment during each reporting period. The most significant indicator of impairment is a decline in the fair value of the optioned property such that the purchase and development of the optioned property would no longer meet our targeted return on investment with appropriate consideration given to the length of time available to exercise the option. Such declines could be caused by a variety of factors including increased competition, decreases in demand or changes in local regulations that adversely impact the cost of development. Changes in any of these factors would cause us to re-evaluate the likelihood of exercising its land options.

If we intend to walk-away from an option contract, we record a charge to earnings in the period such decision is made for the deposit amount and any related pre-acquisition costs associated with the option contract.

We believe that the accounting related to inventory valuation and impairment is a critical accounting policy because: (1) assumptions inherent in the valuation of our inventory are highly subjective and susceptible to change and (2) the impact of recognizing impairments on our inventory has been and could continue to be material to our consolidated financial statements. Our evaluation of inventory impairment, as discussed above, includes many assumptions. The critical assumptions include the timing of the home sales within a community, management’s projections of selling prices and costs and the discount rate applied to estimate the fair value of the homesites within a community on the balance sheet date. Our assumptions on the timing of home sales are critical because the homebuilding industry has historically been cyclical and sensitive to changes in economic conditions such as interest rates, credit availability, unemployment levels and consumer sentiment. Changes in these economic conditions could materially affect the projected sales price, costs to develop the homesites and/or absorption rate in a community. Our assumptions on discount rates are critical because the selection of a discount rate affects the estimated fair value of the homesites within a community. A higher discount rate reduces the estimated fair value of the homesites within the community, while a lower discount rate increases the estimated fair value of the homesites within a community. Because of changes in economic and market conditions and assumptions and estimates required of management in valuing inventory during changing market conditions, actual results could differ materially from management’s assumptions and may require material inventory impairment charges to be recorded in the future.

Product Warranty

Although we subcontract virtually all aspects of construction to others and our contracts call for the subcontractors to repair or replace any deficient items related to their trades, we are primarily responsible to homebuyers to correct any deficiencies. Additionally, in some instances, we may be held responsible for the actions of or losses incurred by subcontractors. Warranty and similar reserves for homes are established at an amount estimated to be adequate to cover potential costs for materials and labor with regard to warranty-type claims expected to be incurred subsequent to the delivery of a home. Reserves are determined based upon historical data and trends with respect to similar product types and geographical areas. We believe the accounting estimate related to the reserve for warranty costs is a critical accounting estimate because the estimate requires a large degree of judgment.

At

November 30, 2016

, the reserve for warranty costs was

$135.4 million

, which included

$2.1 million

of adjustments to pre-existing warranties from changes in estimates during the current year primarily related to specific claims related to certain of our homebuilding communities and other adjustments. While we believe that the reserve for warranty costs is adequate, there can be no assurances that historical data and trends will accurately predict our actual warranty costs. Additionally, there can be no assurances that future economic or financial developments might not lead to a significant change in the reserve.

Lennar Homebuilding and Lennar Multifamily Investments in Unconsolidated Entities

We strategically invest in unconsolidated entities that acquire and develop land (1) for our homebuilding operations or for sale to third parties, (2) for construction of homes for sale to third-party homebuyers or (3) for the construction and sale of multifamily rental properties. Our Lennar Homebuilding partners generally are unrelated homebuilders, land owners/developers and financial or other strategic partners. Our Lennar Multifamily partners are all financial partners.

Most of the unconsolidated entities through which we acquire and develop land are accounted for by the equity method of accounting because we are not the primary beneficiary or a de-facto agent, and we have a significant, but less than controlling, interest in the entities. We record our investments in these entities in our consolidated balance sheets as "Lennar Homebuilding or Lennar Multifamily Investments in Unconsolidated Entities" and our pro-rata share of the entities’ earnings or losses in our consolidated statements of operations as "Lennar Homebuilding or Lennar Multifamily Equity in Earnings (Loss) from Unconsolidated Entities," as described in Note 4 and Note 9 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements. For most unconsolidated entities, we generally have the right to share in earnings and distributions on a pro-rata basis based upon ownership percentages. However, certain Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities and all of our Lennar Multifamily unconsolidated entities provide for a different allocation of profit and cash distributions if and when cumulative results of the



joint venture exceed specified targets (such as a specified internal rate of return). Advances to these entities are included in the investment balance.

Management looks at specific criteria and uses its judgment when determining if we are the primary beneficiary of, or have a controlling interest in, an unconsolidated entity. Factors considered in determining whether we have significant influence or we have control include risk and reward sharing, experience and financial condition of the other partners, voting rights, involvement in day-to-day capital and operating decisions and continuing involvement. The accounting policy relating to the use of the equity method of accounting is a critical accounting policy due to the judgment required in determining whether we are the primary beneficiary or have control or significant influence.

As of

November 30, 2016

, we believe that the equity method of accounting is appropriate for our investments in unconsolidated entities where we are not the primary beneficiary and we do not have a controlling interest, but rather share control with our partners. At

November 30, 2016

, the Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities in which we had investments had total assets of

$5.4 billion

and total liabilities of

$1.7 billion

. At

November 30, 2016

, the Lennar Multifamily unconsolidated entities in which we had investments had total assets of

$2.3 billion

and total liabilities of

$0.8 billion

.

We evaluate the long-lived assets in unconsolidated entities for indicators of impairment during each reporting period. A series of operating losses of an investee or other factors may indicate that a decrease in the fair value of our investment in the unconsolidated entity below its carrying amount has occurred which is other-than-temporary. The amount of impairment recognized is the excess of the investment’s carrying amount over its estimated fair value.

The evaluation of our investment in unconsolidated entities includes certain critical assumptions: (1) projected future distributions from the unconsolidated entities, (2) discount rates applied to the future distributions and (3) various other factors.

Our assumptions on the projected future distributions from unconsolidated entities are dependent on market conditions. Specifically, distributions are dependent on cash to be generated from the sale of inventory by the Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities or operating assets by the Lennar Multifamily unconsolidated entities. Such long-lived assets are also reviewed for potential impairment by the unconsolidated entities. The unconsolidated entities generally also use a discount rate of between

10%

and

20%

in their reviews for impairment, subject to the perceived risks associated with the community’s cash flow streams relative to its inventory. If a valuation adjustment is recorded by an unconsolidated entity related to its assets, our proportionate share is reflected in our Lennar Homebuilding or Lennar Multifamily equity in earnings (loss) from unconsolidated entities with a corresponding decrease to our Lennar Homebuilding or Lennar Multifamily investment in unconsolidated entities. We believe our assumptions on the projected future distributions from the unconsolidated entities are critical because the operating results of the unconsolidated entities from which the projected distributions are derived are dependent on the status of the homebuilding industry, which has historically been cyclical and sensitive to changes in economic conditions such as interest rates, credit availability, unemployment levels and consumer sentiment. Changes in these economic conditions could materially affect the projected operational results of the unconsolidated entities from which the distributions are derived.

Additionally, we evaluate if a decrease in the value of an investment below its carrying amount is other than-temporary. This evaluation includes certain critical assumptions made by management and other factors such as age of the venture, intent and ability for us to recover our investment in the entity, financial condition and long-term prospects of the unconsolidated entity, short-term liquidity needs of the unconsolidated entity, trends in the general economic environment of the land, entitlement status of the land held by the unconsolidated entity, overall projected returns on investments, defaults under contracts with third parties (including bank debt), recoverability of the investment through future cash flows and relationships with the other partners and banks. If the decline in the fair value of the investment is other-than-temporary, then these losses are included in Lennar Homebuilding other income, net or Lennar Multifamily costs and expenses.

We believe our assumptions on discount rates are critical accounting policies because the selection of the discount rates affects the estimated fair value of our investments in unconsolidated entities. A higher discount rate reduces the estimated fair value of our investments in unconsolidated entities, while a lower discount rate increases the estimated fair value of our investments in unconsolidated entities. Because of changes in economic conditions, actual results could differ materially from management’s assumptions and may require material valuation adjustments to our investments in unconsolidated entities to be recorded in the future.

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities

GAAP requires the consolidation of VIEs in which an enterprise has a controlling financial interest. A controlling financial interest will have both of the following characteristics: (a) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and (b) the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.



Our variable interest in VIEs may be in the form of (1) equity ownership, (2) contracts to purchase assets, (3) management services and development agreements between us and a VIE, (4) loans provided by us to a VIE or other partner and/or (5) guarantees provided by members to banks and other third parties. We examine specific criteria and use our judgment when determining if we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE. Factors considered in determining whether we are the primary beneficiary include risk and reward sharing, experience and financial condition of other partner(s), voting rights, involvement in day-to-day capital and operating decisions, representation on a VIE’s executive committee, existence of unilateral kick-out rights or voting rights, level of economic disproportionality between us and the other partner(s) and contracts to purchase assets from VIEs.

Generally, all major decision making in our joint ventures is shared among all partners. In particular, business plans and budgets are generally required to be unanimously approved by all partners. Usually, management and other fees earned by us are nominal and believed to be at market and there is no significant economic disproportionality between us and other partners. Generally, we purchase less than a majority of the JV’s assets and the purchase prices under our option contracts are believed to be at market.

Generally, our unconsolidated entities become VIEs and consolidate when the other partner(s) lack the intent and financial wherewithal to remain in the entity. As a result, we continue to fund operations and debt paydowns through partner loans or substituted capital contributions. The accounting policy relating to variable interest entities is a critical accounting policy because the determination of whether an entity is a VIE and, if so, whether we are primary beneficiary may require us to exercise significant judgment.

Lennar Financial Services Operations

Revenue Recognition

Title premiums on policies issued directly by us are recognized as revenue on the effective date of the title policies and escrow fees and loan origination revenues are recognized at the time the related real estate transactions are completed, usually upon the close of escrow. Revenues from title policies issued by independent agents are recognized as revenue when notice of issuance is received from the agent, which is generally when cash payment is received by us. Expected gains and losses from the sale of loans and their related servicing rights are included in the measurement of all written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value through earnings at the time of commitment. Interest income on loans held-for-sale and loans held-for-investment is recognized as earned over the terms of the mortgage loans based on the contractual interest rates. We believe that the accounting policy related to revenue recognition is a critical accounting policy because of the significance of revenue.

Loan Origination Liabilities

Substantially all of the loans our Lennar Financial Services segment originates are sold within a short period in the secondary mortgage market on a servicing released, non-recourse basis. After the loans are sold, we retain potential liability for possible claims by purchasers that we breached certain limited industry-standard representations and warranties related to loan sales. Over the last several years there has been an industry-wide effort by purchasers to defray their losses by purporting to have found inaccuracies related to sellers’ representations and warranties in particular loan sale agreements.

Our mortgage operations have established reserves for possible losses associated with mortgage loans previously originated and sold to investors. We establish reserves for such possible losses based upon, among other things, an analysis of repurchase requests received, an estimate of potential repurchase claims not yet received and actual past repurchases and losses through the disposition of affected loans, as well as previous settlements. While we believe that we have adequately reserved for known losses and projected repurchase requests, given the volatility in the mortgage industry and the uncertainty regarding the ultimate resolution of these claims, if either actual repurchases or the losses incurred resolving those repurchases exceed our expectations, additional recourse expense may be incurred. This allowance requires management’s judgment and estimate. For these reasons, we believe that the accounting estimate related to the loan origination losses is a critical accounting estimate.

Rialto Operations

Management Fee Revenue

Our Rialto segment provides services to a variety of legal entities and investment vehicles such as funds, joint ventures, co-invests, and other private equity structures to manage their respective investments. As a result, Rialto earns and receives management fees, underwriting fees and due diligence fees. These fees are included in Rialto revenues and are recorded over the period in which the services are performed, fees are determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Rialto receives investment management fees from investment vehicles based on 1) a percentage of committed or called capital during the commitment period and called capital after the commitment period ends and 2) a percentage of invested capital less the portion of such invested capital utilized to acquire investments that have been sold (in whole or in part) or liquidated. Fees earned for underwriting and due diligence services are based on actual costs incurred. In certain situations, Rialto may earn



additional fees when the return on assets managed exceeds contractually established thresholds. Such revenue is only booked when the contract terms are met, the contract is at, or near, completion and the amounts are known and collectability is reasonably assured. Since such revenue is recognized during the latter half of the life of the investment vehicle, after substantially all of the assets have been sold and investment gains and losses realized, the possibility of claw backs is limited. In addition, Rialto may also receive tax distributions in order to cover income tax obligations resulting from allocations of taxable income due to Rialto's carried interests in the Funds. These distributions are not subject to clawbacks and therefore are recorded as revenue when received.

We believe the way we record Rialto management fee revenue is a significant accounting policy because it represents a significant portion of our Rialto segment's revenues and is expected to continue to grow in the future as the segment manages more assets.

Rialto Mortgage Finance - Loans Held-for-Sale

The originated mortgage loans are classified as loans held-for-sale and are recorded at fair value. We elected the fair value option for RMF's loans held-for-sale in accordance with ASC 825,

Financial Instruments

, which permits entities to measure various financial instruments and certain other items at fair value on a contract-by-contract basis. Changes in fair values of the loans are reflected in Rialto revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Interest income on these loans is calculated based on the interest rate of the loan and is recorded in Rialto revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Substantially all of the mortgage loans originated are sold within a short period of time in securitizations on a servicing released, non-recourse basis; although, we remain liable for certain limited industry-standard representations and warranties related to loan sales. We recognize revenue on the sale of loans into securitization trusts when control of the loans has been relinquished.

We believe this is a critical accounting policy due to the significant judgment involved in estimating the fair values of loans held-for-sale during the period between when the loans are originated and the time the loans are sold and because of its significance to our Rialto segment.

Real Estate Owned

REO represents real estate that our Rialto segment has taken control, or has effective control of, in partial or full satisfaction of loans receivable. At the time of acquisition of a property through foreclosure of a loan, REO is recorded at fair value less estimated costs to sell if classified as held-for-sale or at fair value if classified as held-and-used, which becomes the property’s new basis. The fair values of these assets are determined in part by placing reliance on third-party appraisals of the properties and/or internally prepared analyses of recent offers or prices on comparable properties in the proximate vicinity. The third-party appraisals and internally developed analyses are significantly impacted by the local market economy, market supply and demand, competitive conditions and prices on comparable properties, adjusted for anticipated date of sale, location, property size, and other factors. Each REO is unique and is analyzed in the context of the particular market where the property is located. In order to establish the significant assumptions for a particular REO, we analyze historical trends, including trends achieved by our local homebuilding operations, if applicable, and current trends in the market and economy impacting the REO. Using available trend information, we then calculate our best estimate of fair value, which can include projected cash flows discounted at a rate we believe a market participant would determine to be commensurate with the inherent risks associated with the assets and related estimated cash flow streams.

Changes in economic factors, consumer demand and market conditions, among other things, could materially impact estimates used in the third-party appraisals and/or internally prepared analyses of recent offers or prices on comparable properties. Thus, estimates can differ significantly from the amounts ultimately realized by our Rialto segment from disposition of these assets. The amount by which the recorded investment in the loan is less than the REO’s fair value (net of estimated cost to sell if held-for-sale), is recorded as an unrealized gain on foreclosure in our consolidated statement of operations. The amount by which the recorded investment in the loan is greater than the REO’s fair value (net of estimated cost to sell if held-for-sale) is recorded as a provision for loan losses in our consolidated statement of operations.

Subsequent to obtaining REO via foreclosure or directly from a financial institution, management periodically performs valuations using the methodologies described above such that the real estate is carried at the lower of its carrying value or current fair value, less estimated costs to sell if classified as held-for-sale. Held-and-used assets are tested for recoverability whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable, and impairment losses are recorded for any amount by which the carrying value exceeds its fair value. Any subsequent impairment losses, operating expenses or income, and gains and losses on disposition of such properties are also recognized in Rialto other income (expense), net. REO assets classified as held-and-used are depreciated using a useful life of forty years for commercial properties and twenty seven and a half years for residential properties. REO assets classified as held-for-sale are not depreciated. Occasionally, an asset will require certain improvements to yield a higher return. Construction costs incurred prior to acquisition or during development of the asset may be capitalized.



We believe that the accounting related to REO is a critical accounting policy because of the significant judgment required in the third-party appraisals and/or internally prepared analyses of recent offers or prices of comparable properties in the proximate vicinity used to estimate the fair value of REOs.

Consolidations of Variable Interest Entities

In 2010, our Rialto segment acquired indirectly 40% managing member equity interests in two LLCs, in partnership with the FDIC. We determined that each of the LLCs met the definition of a VIE and we were the primary beneficiary. In accordance with ASC 810-10-65-2,

Consolidations

, ("ASC 810-10-65-2"), we identified the activities that most significantly impact the LLCs’ economic performance and determined that we have the power to direct those activities. The economic performance of the LLCs is most significantly impacted by the performance of the LLCs’ portfolios of assets, which consist primarily of distressed residential and commercial mortgage loans. Thus, the activities that most significantly impact the LLCs’ economic performance are the servicing and disposition of mortgage loans and real estate obtained through foreclosure of loans, restructuring of loans, or other planned activities associated with the monetizing of loans.

The FDIC does not have the unilateral power to terminate our role in managing the LLCs and servicing the loan portfolios. While the FDIC has the right to prevent certain types of transactions (i.e., bulk sales, selling assets with recourse back to the selling entity, selling assets with representations and warranties and financing the sales of assets without the FDIC’s approval), the FDIC does not have full voting or blocking rights over the LLCs’ activities, making their voting rights protective in nature, not substantive participating voting rights. Other than as described in the preceding sentence, which are not the primary activities of the LLCs, we can cause the LLCs to enter into both the disposition and restructuring of loans without any involvement of the FDIC. Additionally, the FDIC has no voting rights with regard to the operation/management of the operating properties that are acquired upon foreclosure of loans (e.g. REO) and no voting rights over the business plans of the LLCs. The FDIC can make suggestions regarding the business plans, but we can decide not to follow the FDIC’s suggestions and not to incorporate them in the business plans. Since the FDIC’s voting rights are protective in nature and not substantive participating voting rights, we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the LLCs’ economic performance.

In accordance with ASC 810-10-65-2, we determined that we had an obligation to absorb losses of the LLCs that could potentially be significant to the LLCs or the right to receive benefits from the LLCs that could potentially be significant to the LLCs based on the following factors:

•

Rialto/Lennar owns 40% of the equity of the LLCs and has the power to direct the activities of the LLCs that most significantly impact their economic performance through loan resolutions and the sale of REO.

•

Rialto/Lennar has a management/servicer contract under which we earn a 0.5% servicing fee.

•

Rialto/Lennar has guaranteed, as the servicer, its obligations under the servicing agreement up to $10 million.

We are aware that the FDIC, as the owner of 60% of the equity of each of the LLCs, may also have an obligation to absorb losses of the LLCs that could potentially be significant to the LLCs. However, in accordance with ASC 810-10-25-38A, only one enterprise, if any, is expected to be identified as the primary beneficiary of a VIE.

Since both criteria for consolidation in ASC 810-10-65-2 are met, we consolidated the LLCs. We believe that our assessment that we are the primary beneficiary of the LLCs is a critical accounting policy because of the significant judgment required in evaluating all of the key factors and circumstances in determining the primary beneficiary.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

We are exposed to a number of market risks in the ordinary course of business. Our primary market risk exposure relates to fluctuations in interest rates on our investments, loans held-for-sale, loans held-for-investment and outstanding variable rate debt.

For fixed rate debt, such as our senior notes, changes in interest rates generally affect the fair value of the debt instrument, but not our earnings or cash flows. For variable debt such as our unsecured revolving credit facility and Lennar Financial Services’ and Rialto’s warehouse repurchase facilities, changes in interest rates generally do not affect the fair value of the outstanding borrowings on the debt facilities, but do affect our earnings and cash flows.

In our Lennar Financial Services operations, we utilize mortgage backed securities forward commitments, option contracts and investor commitments to protect the value of fixed rate-locked commitments and loans held-for-sale from fluctuations in mortgage-related interest rates.

To mitigate interest risk associated with Rialto’s loans held-for-sale, we use derivative financial instruments to hedge our exposure to risk from the time a borrower locks a loan until the time the loan is securitized. We hedge our interest rate exposure through entering into interest rate swap futures. We also manage a portion of our credit exposure by buying protection within the CMBX and CDX markets.

We do not enter into or hold derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.



The table below provides information at

November 30, 2016

about our significant instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For loans held-for-investment, net and investments held-to-maturity, senior notes and other debts payable and notes and other debts payable, the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average effective interest rates by expected maturity dates and estimated fair values at

November 30, 2016

. Weighted average variable interest rates are based on the variable interest rates at

November 30, 2016

.

Rialto’s loans receivable, net, is comprised of nonaccrual and accrual loans. Only the accrual loans are included in the table below, as we believe that since the nonaccrual loans were acquired having deteriorated credit quality, they are not sensitive to changes in interest rates.

See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 and Notes 1 and 14 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for a further discussion of these items and our strategy of mitigating our interest rate risk.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Lennar Corporation and all subsidiaries, partnerships and other entities in which Lennar Corporation has a controlling interest and VIEs (see Note 15) in which Lennar Corporation is deemed the primary beneficiary (the "Company"). The Company’s investments in both unconsolidated entities in which a significant, but less than controlling, interest is held and in VIEs in which the Company is not deemed to be the primary beneficiary are accounted for by the equity method. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Revenue Recognition

Revenues from sales of homes are recognized when the sales are closed and title passes to the new homeowner, the new homeowner’s initial and continuing investment is adequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay for the home, the new homeowner’s receivable is not subject to future subordination and the Company does not have a substantial continuing involvement with the new home. Revenues from sales of land are recognized when a significant down payment is received, the earnings process is complete, title passes and collectability of the receivable is reasonably assured. See Lennar Financial Services, Rialto and Lennar Multifamily within this Note for disclosure of other revenue recognition policies related to those segments.

Advertising Costs

The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred.

Advertising costs were

$

40.9

million

,

$

47.9

million

and

$

45.2

million

for the years ended

November 30, 2016

,


and


, respectively.

Share-Based Payments

The Company has share-based awards outstanding under the 2007 Equity Incentive Plan and the 2016 Equity Incentive Plan (the "Plans"), each of which provides for the granting of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted common stock ("nonvested shares") and other share based awards to officers, associates and directors. The exercise prices of stock options may not be less than the market value of the common stock on the date of the grant. Exercises are permitted in installments determined when options are granted. Each stock option will expire on a date determined at the time of the grant, but not more than

ten

years after the date of the grant. The Company accounts for stock option awards and nonvested share awards granted under the Plans based on the estimated grant date fair value.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Due to the short maturity period of cash equivalents, the carrying amounts of these instruments approximate their fair values.

Cash and cash equivalents as of

November 30, 2016

and


included

$

460.5

million

and

$

414.9

million

, respectively, of cash held in escrow for approximately


days.

Restricted Cash

Lennar Homebuilding restricted cash consists of customer deposits on home sales held in restricted accounts until title transfers to the homebuyer, as required by the state and local governments in which the homes were sold, as well as funds on deposit to secure and support performance obligations. Rialto restricted cash primarily consists of upfront deposits and application fees Rialto Mortgage Finance ("RMF") receives before originating loans and is recognized as income once the loan has been originated as well as cash held in escrow by the Company’s loan servicer provider on behalf of customers and lenders and is disbursed in accordance with agreements between the transacting parties.



LENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Inventories

Finished homes and construction in progress are included within inventories. Inventories are stated at cost unless the inventory within a community is determined to be impaired, in which case the impaired inventory is written down to fair value. Inventory costs include land, land development and home construction costs, real estate taxes, deposits on land purchase contracts and interest related to development and construction. Construction overhead and selling expenses are expensed as incurred. Homes held-for-sale are classified as inventories until delivered. Land, land development, amenities and other costs are accumulated by specific area and allocated to homes within the respective areas.

The Company reviews its inventory for indicators of impairment by evaluating each community during each reporting period. The inventory within each community is categorized as finished homes and construction in progress or land under development based on the development state of the community. There were


and


active communities, excluding unconsolidated entities, as of

and


, respectively. If the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by a community are less than its carrying amount, an impairment charge is recorded to write down the carrying amount of such community to its estimated fair value.

In conducting its review for indicators of impairment on a community level, the Company evaluates, among other things, the margins on homes that have been delivered, margins on homes under sales contracts in backlog, projected margins with regard to future home sales over the life of the community, projected margins with regard to future land sales and the estimated fair value of the land itself. The Company pays particular attention to communities in which inventory is moving at a slower than anticipated absorption pace and communities whose average sales price and/or margins are trending downward and are anticipated to continue to trend downward. From this review, the Company identifies communities in which to assess if the carrying values exceed their undiscounted projected cash flows.

The Company estimates the fair value of its communities using a discounted cash flow model. The projected cash flows for each community are significantly impacted by estimates related to market supply and demand, product type by community, homesite sizes, sales pace, sales prices, sales incentives, construction costs, sales and marketing expenses, the local economy, competitive conditions, labor costs, costs of materials and other factors for that particular community. Every division evaluates the historical performance of each of its communities as well as current trends in the market and economy impacting the community and its surrounding areas. These trends are analyzed for each of the estimates listed above.

Each of the homebuilding markets in which the Company operates is unique, as homebuilding has historically been a local business driven by local market conditions and demographics. Each of the Company’s homebuilding markets has specific supply and demand relationships reflective of local economic conditions. The Company’s projected cash flows are impacted by many assumptions. Some of the most critical assumptions in the Company’s cash flow model are projected absorption pace for home sales, sales prices and costs to build and deliver homes on a community by community basis.

In order to arrive at the assumed absorption pace for home sales and the assumed sales prices included in the Company’s cash flow model, the Company analyzes its historical absorption pace and historical sales prices in the community and in other comparable communities in the geographical area. In addition, the Company considers internal and external market studies and places greater emphasis on more current metrics and trends, which generally include, but are not limited to, statistics and forecasts on population demographics and on sales prices in neighboring communities, unemployment rates and availability and sales prices of competing product in the geographical area where the community is located as well as the absorption pace realized in its most recent quarters and the sales prices included in the Company's current backlog for such communities.

Generally, if the Company notices a variation from historical results over a span of two fiscal quarters, the Company considers such variation to be the establishment of a trend and adjusts its historical information accordingly in order to develop assumptions on the projected absorption pace and sales prices in the cash flow model for a community.

In order to arrive at the Company’s assumed costs to build and deliver homes, the Company generally assumes a cost structure reflecting contracts currently in place with its vendors adjusted for any anticipated cost reduction initiatives or increases in cost structure. Those costs assumed are used in the cash flow model for the Company’s communities.

Since the estimates and assumptions included in the Company’s cash flow models are based upon historical results and projected trends, they do not anticipate unexpected changes in market conditions or strategies that may lead the Company to incur additional impairment charges in the future.

The determination of fair value requires discounting the estimated cash flows at a rate the Company believes a market participant would determine to be commensurate with the inherent risks associated with the assets and related estimated cash flow streams. The discount rate used in determining each asset’s fair value depends on the community’s projected life and development stage. The Company generally uses a discount rate of approximately


%

, subject to the perceived risks associated with the community’s cash flow streams relative to its inventory.

The Company estimates the fair value of inventory evaluated for impairment based on market conditions and assumptions made by management at the time the inventory is evaluated, which may differ materially from actual results if market conditions or assumptions change. For example, changes in market conditions and other specific developments or changes in assumptions may cause the Company to re-evaluate its strategy regarding previously impaired inventory, as well as inventory not currently impaired but for which indicators of impairment may arise if market deterioration occurs, and certain other assets that could result in further valuation adjustments and/or additional write-offs of option deposits and pre-acquisition costs due to abandonment of those options contracts.

As of

The Company also has access to land inventory through option contracts, which generally enables the Company to defer acquiring portions of properties owned by third parties and unconsolidated entities until it has determined whether to exercise its option.

A majority of the Company’s option contracts require a non-refundable cash deposit or irrevocable letter of credit based on a percentage of the purchase price of the land. The Company’s option contracts sometimes include price adjustment provisions, which adjust the purchase price of the land to its approximate fair value at the time of acquisition or are based on the fair value at the time of takedown.

In determining whether to walk away from an option contract, the Company evaluates the option primarily based upon its expected cash flows from the property under option. If the Company intends to walk away from an option contract, it records a charge to earnings in the period such decision is made for the deposit amount and any related pre-acquisition costs associated with the option contract.

Some option contracts contain a predetermined take-down schedule for the optioned land parcels. However, in almost all instances, the Company is not required to purchase land in accordance with those take-down schedules. In substantially all instances, the Company has the right and ability to not exercise its option and forfeit its deposit without further penalty, other than termination of the option and loss of any unapplied portion of its deposit and pre-acquisition costs. Therefore, in substantially all instances, the Company does not consider the take-down price to be a firm contractual obligation. When the Company does not intend to exercise an option, it writes off any unapplied deposit and pre-acquisition costs associated with the option contract.

Lennar Homebuilding and Lennar Multifamily Investments in Unconsolidated Entities

The Company evaluates the long-lived assets in unconsolidated entities for indicators of impairment during each reporting period. If a valuation adjustment is recorded by an unconsolidated entity related to its assets, the Company generally uses a discount rate between


%

and


%

, subject to the perceived risks associated with the community’s cash flow streams relative to its inventory or operating assets. The Company’s proportionate share of a valuation adjustment is reflected in the Company's Lennar Homebuilding or Lennar Multifamily equity in earnings (loss) from unconsolidated entities with a corresponding decrease to its Lennar Homebuilding or Lennar Multifamily investment in unconsolidated entities.

Additionally, the Company evaluates if a decrease in the value of an investment below its carrying value is other-than-temporary. This evaluation includes certain critical assumptions made by management: (1) projected future distributions from the unconsolidated entities, (2) discount rates applied to the future distributions and (3) various other factors, which include age of the venture, relationships with the other partners and banks, general economic market conditions, land status and liquidity needs of the unconsolidated entity. If the decline in the fair value of the investment is other-than-temporary, then these losses are included in Lennar Homebuilding other income, net or Lennar Multifamily costs and expenses.

The Company tracks its share of cumulative earnings and distributions of its joint ventures ("JVs"). For purposes of classifying distributions received from JVs in the Company’s consolidated statements of cash flows, cumulative distributions are treated as returns

on

capital to the extent of cumulative earnings and included in the Company’s consolidated statements of cash flows as operating activities. Cumulative distributions in excess of the Company’s share of cumulative earnings are treated as returns of capital and included in the Company’s consolidated statements of cash flows as cash from investing activities.

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities

GAAP requires the consolidation of VIEs in which an enterprise has a controlling financial interest. A controlling financial interest will have both of the following characteristics: (a) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and (b) the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.

The Company’s variable interest in VIEs may be in the form of (1) equity ownership, (2) contracts to purchase assets, (3) management and development agreements between the Company and a VIE, (4) loans provided by the Company to a VIE or other partner and/or (5) guarantees provided by members to banks and other third parties. The Company examines specific criteria and uses its judgment when determining if it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. Factors considered in determining whether the Company is the primary beneficiary include risk and reward sharing, experience and financial condition of other partner(s), voting rights, involvement in day-to-day capital and operating decisions, representation on a VIE’s executive committee, existence of unilateral kick-out rights or voting rights, level of economic disproportionality, if any, between the Company and the other partner(s) and contracts to purchase assets from VIEs. The determination whether an entity is a VIE and, if so, whether the Company is the primary beneficiary may require it to exercise significant judgment.

Generally, all major decision making in the Company’s joint ventures is shared among all partners. In particular, business plans and budgets are generally required to be unanimously approved by all partners. Usually, management and other fees earned by the Company are nominal and believed to be at market and there is no significant economic disproportionality between the Company and other partners. Generally, the Company purchases less than a majority of the JV’s assets and the purchase prices under its option contracts are believed to be at market.

Generally, Lennar Homebuilding and Lennar Multifamily unconsolidated entities become VIEs and consolidate when the other partner(s) lack the intent and financial wherewithal to remain in the entity. As a result, the Company continues to fund operations and debt paydowns through partner loans or substituted capital contributions.

Operating Properties and Equipment

Operating properties and equipment are recorded at cost and are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The assets are depreciated over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. At the time operating properties and equipment are disposed of, the asset and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is credited or charged to earnings. The estimated useful life for operating properties is

30 years

, for furniture, fixtures and equipment is

two

to

ten

years and for leasehold improvements is

five

years or the life of the lease, whichever is shorter. Operating properties are reviewed for possible impairment if there are indicators that their carrying amounts are not recoverable.

Investment Securities

Investment securities are classified as available-for-sale unless they are classified as trading or held-to-maturity. Securities classified as trading are carried at fair value and unrealized holding gains and losses are recorded in earnings. Available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value. Any unrealized holding gains or losses on available-for-sale securities are reported as accumulated other comprehensive gain or loss, which is a separate component of stockholders’ equity, net of tax, until realized. Securities classified as held-to-maturity are carried at amortized cost because they are purchased with the intent and ability to hold to maturity.

Interest and Real Estate Taxes

Interest and real estate taxes attributable to land and homes are capitalized as inventory costs while they are being actively developed. Interest related to homebuilding and land, including interest costs relieved from inventories, is included in costs of homes sold and costs of land sold. Interest expense related to the Lennar Financial Services operations is included in its costs and expenses.

Interest expense was included in costs of homes sold, costs of land sold and other interest expense as follows:

Income Taxes

The Company records income taxes under the asset and liability method, whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and attributable to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or paid. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period when the changes are enacted. Interest related to unrecognized tax benefits is recognized in the financial statements as a component of income tax expense.

A reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance is required if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized. Accordingly, the need to establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets is assessed each reporting period by the Company based on the consideration of all available positive and negative evidence using a "more-likely-than-not" standard with respect to whether deferred tax assets will be realized. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses, actual earnings, forecasts of future profitability, the duration of statutory carryforward periods, the Company’s experience with loss carryforwards not expiring unused and tax planning alternatives.



LENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Based on the analysis of positive and negative evidence, the Company believed that there was enough positive evidence for the Company to conclude that it was more likely than not that the Company would realize the majority of its deferred tax assets.

As of

November 30, 2016

and


, the Company's net deferred tax assets included a valuation allowance of

$

5.8

million

and

$

5.9

million

, respectively. See Note 10 for additional information.

Product Warranty

Warranty and similar reserves for homes are established at an amount estimated to be adequate to cover potential costs for materials and labor with regard to warranty-type claims expected to be incurred subsequent to the delivery of a home. Reserves are determined based on historical data and trends with respect to similar product types and geographical areas. The Company regularly monitors the warranty reserve and makes adjustments to its pre-existing warranties in order to reflect changes in trends and historical data as information becomes available. Warranty reserves are included in Lennar Homebuilding other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.

The activity in the Company’s warranty reserve was as follows:

(1)

The adjustments to pre-existing warranties from changes in estimates during the years ended

November 30, 2016

and


primarily related to specific claims related to certain of our homebuilding communities and other adjustments.

Self-Insurance

Certain insurable risks such as construction defects, general liability, medical and workers’ compensation are self-insured by the Company up to certain limits. Undiscounted accruals for claims under the Company’s self-insurance program are based on claims filed and estimates for claims incurred but not yet reported. The Company’s self-insurance reserve as of

November 30, 2016

and


was

$

87.6

million

and

$

96.5

million

, respectively, of which

$

57.4

million

and

$

65.0

million

, respectively, was included in Lennar Financial Services’ other liabilities in the respective years. Amounts incurred in excess of the Company's self-insurance occurrence or aggregate retention limits are covered by insurance up to the Company's purchased coverage levels. The Company's insurance policies are maintained with highly-rated underwriters for whom the Company believes counterparty default risk is not significant.

Earnings per Share

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in earnings of the Company.

All outstanding nonvested shares that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents that participate in undistributed earnings with common stock are considered participating securities and are included in computing earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. The two-class method is an earnings allocation formula that determines earnings per share for each class of common stock and participating securities according to dividends or dividend equivalents and participation rights in undistributed earnings. The Company’s restricted common stock ("nonvested shares") are considered participating securities.

Lennar Financial Services

Revenue Recognition

Title premiums on policies issued directly by the Company are recognized as revenue on the effective date of the title policies and escrow fees and loan origination revenues are recognized at the time the related real estate transactions are completed, usually upon the close of escrow. Revenues from title policies issued by independent agents are recognized as revenue when notice of issuance is received from the agent, which is generally when cash payment is received by the Company. Expected gains and losses from the sale of loans and their related servicing rights are included in the measurement of all written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value through earnings at the time of commitment. Interest income on loans



LENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

held-for-sale and loans held-for-investment is recognized as earned over the terms of the mortgage loans based on the contractual interest rates.

Loans Held-for-Sale

Loans held-for-sale by the Lennar Financial Services segment, including the rights to service the mortgage loans, are carried at fair value and changes in fair value are reflected in earnings. Premiums and discounts recorded on these loans are presented as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the loans and are not amortized. Management believes carrying loans held-for-sale at fair value improves financial reporting by mitigating volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring the fair value of the loans and the derivative instruments used to economically hedge them without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions.

In addition, the Lennar Financial Services segment recognizes the fair value of its rights to service a mortgage loan as revenue upon entering into an interest rate lock loan commitment with a borrower. The fair value of these servicing rights is included in Lennar Financial Services' other assets as of

November 30, 2016

and


. Fair value of the servicing rights is determined based on values in the Company’s servicing sales contracts.

Provision for Losses

The Company establishes reserves for possible losses associated with mortgage loans previously originated and sold to investors based upon, among other things, an analysis of repurchase requests received, an estimate of potential repurchase claims not yet received and actual past repurchases and losses through the disposition of affected loans, as well as previous settlements. Loan origination liabilities are included in Lennar Financial Services’ liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.

The activity in the Company’s loan origination liabilities was as follows:

(1)

The adjustments to pre-existing provisions for losses from changes in estimates for the years ended

November 30, 2016

and


primarily related to an adjustment for additional repurchase requests that were received beyond the estimated provision that was recorded.

Loans Held-for-Investment, Net

Loans for which the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity consist of mortgage loans carried at the principal amount outstanding, net of unamortized discounts and allowance for loan losses. Discounts are amortized over the estimated lives of the loans using the interest method.

The Lennar Financial Services segment also provides an allowance for loan losses. The provision recorded and the adequacy of the related allowance is determined by management’s continuing evaluation of the loan portfolio in light of past loan loss experience, credit worthiness and nature of underlying collateral, present economic conditions and other factors considered relevant by the Company’s management. Anticipated changes in economic factors, which may influence the level of the allowance, are considered in the evaluation by the Company’s management when the likelihood of the changes can be reasonably determined. While the Company’s management uses the best information available to make such evaluations, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary as a result of future economic and other conditions that may be beyond management’s control.

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Lennar Financial Services segment, in the normal course of business, uses derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in mortgage-related interest rates. The segment uses mortgage-backed securities ("MBS") forward commitments, option contracts, future contracts and investor commitments to protect the value of fixed rate-locked loan commitments and loans held-for-sale from fluctuations in mortgage-related interest rates. These derivative financial instruments are carried at fair value with the changes in fair value included in Lennar Financial Services revenues.

Rialto

Management Fee Revenue

The Rialto segment provides services to a variety of legal entities and investment vehicles such as funds, joint ventures, co-invests, and other private equity structures to manage their respective investments. As a result, Rialto earns and receives management fees, underwriting fees and due diligence fees. These fees are included in Rialto revenues and are recorded over the period in which the services are performed, fees are determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Rialto receives investment management fees from investment vehicles based on 1) a percentage of committed or called capital during the commitment period and called capital after the commitment period ends and 2) a percentage of invested capital less the portion of such invested capital utilized to acquire investments that have been sold (in whole or in part) or liquidated. Fees earned for underwriting and due diligence services are based on actual costs incurred. In certain situations, Rialto may earn additional fees when the return on assets managed exceeds contractually established thresholds. Such revenue is only booked when the contract terms are met, the contract is at, or near, completion and the amounts are known and collectability is reasonably assured. Since such revenue is recognized during the latter half of the life of the investment vehicle, after substantially all of the assets have been sold and investment gains and losses realized, the possibility of claw backs is limited. In addition, Rialto may also receive tax distributions in order to cover income tax obligations resulting from allocations of taxable income due to Rialto's carried interests in the funds. These distributions are not subject to clawbacks and therefore are recorded as revenue when received.

Rialto Mortgage Finance - Loans Held-for-Sale

The originated mortgage loans are classified as loans held-for-sale and are recorded at fair value. The Company elected the fair value option for RMF's loans held-for-sale in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 825,

Financial Instruments

, which permits entities to measure various financial instruments and certain other items at fair value on a contract-by-contract basis. Management believes that carrying loans held-for-sale at fair value improves financial reporting by mitigating volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring the fair value of the loans and the derivative instruments, which are also carried at fair value, used to economically hedge them without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. Changes in fair values of the loans are reflected in Rialto revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Interest income on these loans is calculated based on the interest rate of the loan and is recorded in Rialto revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Substantially all of the mortgage loans originated are sold within a short period of time in a securitization on a servicing released, non-recourse basis; although, the Company remains liable for certain limited industry-standard representations and warranties related to loan sales. The Company recognizes revenue on the sale of loans into securitization trusts when control of the loans has been relinquished.

Real Estate Owned

Real estate owned ("REO") represents real estate that the Rialto segment has taken control in partial or full satisfaction of loans receivable. At the time of acquisition of a property through foreclosure of a loan, REO is recorded at fair value less estimated costs to sell if classified as held-for-sale or at fair value if classified as held-and-used, which becomes the property’s new basis. The fair values of these assets are determined in part by placing reliance on third-party appraisals of the properties and/or internally prepared analyses of recent offers or prices on comparable properties in the proximate vicinity. The third-party appraisals and internally developed analyses are significantly impacted by the local market economy, market supply and demand, competitive conditions and prices on comparable properties, adjusted for anticipated date of sale, location, property size, and other factors. Each REO is unique and is analyzed in the context of the particular market where the property is located. In order to establish the significant assumptions for a particular REO, the Company analyzes historical trends, including trends achieved by the Company's local homebuilding operations, if applicable, and current trends in the market and economy impacting the REO. Using available trend information, the Company then calculates its best estimate of fair value, which can include projected cash flows discounted at a rate the Company believes a market participant would determine to be commensurate with the inherent risks associated with the assets and related estimated cash flow streams. These methods use unobservable inputs to develop fair value for the Company’s REO. Due to the volume and variance of unobservable inputs, resulting from the uniqueness of each of the Company's REO, the Company does not use a standard range of unobservable inputs with respect to its evaluation of REO. However, for operating properties included within REO, the Company may also use estimated cash flows multiplied by a capitalization rate to determine the fair value of the property. Generally, the capitalization rates used to estimate fair value ranged from


%

to


%

and varied based on the location of the asset, asset type and occupancy rates for the operating properties.



LENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Changes in economic factors, consumer demand and market conditions, among other things, could materially impact estimates used in the third-party appraisals and/or internally prepared analyses of recent offers or prices on comparable properties. Thus, estimates can differ significantly from the amounts ultimately realized by the Rialto segment from disposition of these assets. The amount by which the recorded investment in the loan is less than the REO’s fair value (net of estimated cost to sell if held-for-sale), is recorded as an unrealized gain upon foreclosure in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. The amount by which the recorded investment in the loan is greater than the REO’s fair value (net of estimated cost to sell if held-for-sale) is recorded as a provision for loan losses in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations.

Additionally, REO includes real estate which Rialto has purchased directly from financial institutions. These REOs are recorded at cost or allocated cost if purchased in a bulk transaction.

Subsequent to obtaining REO via foreclosure or directly from a financial institution, management periodically performs valuations using the methodologies described above such that the real estate is carried at the lower of its carrying value or current fair value, less estimated costs to sell if classified as held-for-sale. Held-and-used assets are tested for recoverability whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable, and impairment losses are recorded for any amount by which the carrying value exceeds its fair value. Any subsequent impairment losses, operating expenses or income, and gains and losses on disposition of such properties are also recognized in Rialto other income (expense), net. REO assets classified as held-and-used are depreciated using a useful life of forty years for commercial properties and twenty seven and a half years for residential properties. REO assets classified as held-for-sale are not depreciated. Occasionally an asset will require certain improvements to yield a higher return. In accordance with ASC 970-340-25,

Real Estate

, construction costs incurred prior to acquisition or during development of the asset may be capitalized.

Derivative Instruments

The Rialto segment, in the normal course of business, uses derivative financial instruments on loans held-for-sale in order to minimize its exposure to fluctuations in mortgage-related interest rates as well as lessen its credit risk. The segment hedges interest rate exposure by entering into interest rate swaps and swap futures. These derivative financial instruments are carried at fair value with derivative instruments in gain positions recorded in other assets while derivative instruments in loss positions are recorded in other liabilities.

Consolidations of Variable Interest Entities

In 2010, the Rialto segment acquired indirectly


%

managing member equity interests in

two

limited liability companies ("LLCs"), in partnership with the FDIC. The Company determined that each of the LLCs met the definition of a VIE and that the Company was the primary beneficiary. In accordance with ASC 810-10-65-2,

Consolidations

, ("ASC 810-10-65-2"), the Company identified the activities that most significantly impact the LLCs’ economic performance and determined that it has the power to direct those activities. The economic performance of the LLCs is most significantly impacted by the performance of the LLCs’ portfolios of assets, which consisted primarily of distressed residential and commercial mortgage loans. Thus, the activities that most significantly impact the LLCs’ economic performance are the servicing and disposition of mortgage loans and real estate obtained through foreclosure of loans, restructuring of loans, or other planned activities associated with the monetizing of loans. At

November 30, 2016

, these consolidated LLCs had total combined assets and liabilities of

$

213.8

million

and

$

10.3

million

, respectively. At

November 30, 2015

, these consolidated LLCs had total combined assets and liabilities of

$

355.2

million

and

$

11.3

million

, respectively.

The FDIC does not have the unilateral power to terminate the Company’s role in managing the LLCs and servicing the loan portfolios. While the FDIC has the right to prevent certain types of transactions (i.e., bulk sales, selling assets with recourse back to the selling entity, selling assets with representations and warranties and financing the sales of assets without the FDIC’s approval), the FDIC does not have full voting or blocking rights over the LLCs’ activities, making their voting rights protective in nature, not substantive participating voting rights. Other than as described in the preceding sentence, which are not the primary activities of the LLCs, the Company can cause the LLCs to enter into both the disposition and restructuring of loans without any involvement of the FDIC. Additionally, the FDIC has no voting rights with regard to the operation/management of the operating properties that are acquired upon foreclosure of loans (e.g. REO) and no voting rights over the business plans of the LLCs. The FDIC can make suggestions regarding the business plans, but the Company can decide not to follow the FDIC’s suggestions and not to incorporate them in the business plans. Since the FDIC’s voting rights are protective in nature and not substantive participating voting rights, the Company has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the LLCs’ economic performance.



LENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

In accordance with ASC 810-10-65-2, the Company determined that it had an obligation to absorb losses of the LLCs that could potentially be significant to the LLCs or the right to receive benefits from the LLCs that could potentially be significant to the LLCs based on the following factors:

•

Rialto/Lennar owns


%

of the equity of the LLCs and has the power to direct the activities of the LLCs that most significantly impact their economic performance through loan resolutions and the sale of REO.

•

Rialto/Lennar has a management/servicer contract under which the Company earns a

0.5

%

servicing fee.

•

Rialto/Lennar has guaranteed, as the servicer, its obligations under the servicing agreement up to

$


million

.

The Company is aware that the FDIC, as the owner of


%

of the equity of each of the LLCs, may also have an obligation to absorb losses of the LLCs that could potentially be significant to the LLCs. However, in accordance with ASC 810-10-25-38A, only one enterprise, if any, is expected to be identified as the primary beneficiary of a VIE.

Since both criteria for consolidation in ASC 810-10-65-2 are met, the Company consolidated the LLCs.

Voting Interest Entities

Rialto Real Estate Fund, LP ("Fund I"), Rialto Real Estate Fund II, LP ("Fund II"), Rialto Real Estate Fund III ("Fund III"), Rialto Mezzanine Partners Fund, LP ("Mezzanine Fund") and the Rialto Credit Partnership, LP ("RCP") are unconsolidated entities and are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. They were determined to have the attributes of an investment company in accordance with ASC Topic 946,

Financial Services – Investment Companies

, the attributes of which are different from the attributes that would cause a company to be an investment company for purposes of the Investment Company Act of 1940. As a result, Fund I, Fund II, Fund III, Mezzanine Fund, and the RCP's assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value with increases/decreases in fair value recorded in their respective statements of operations, the Company’s share of which will be recorded in the Rialto equity in earnings (loss) from unconsolidated entities financial statement line item. The Company determined that Fund I, Fund II, Fund III, Mezzanine Fund, and the RCP are not variable interest entities but rather voting interest entities due to the following factors:

•

The Company determined that Rialto’s general partner interest and all the limited partners’ interests qualify as equity investment at risk.

•

Based on the capital structure of Fund I, Fund II, Fund III, Mezzanine Fund, and the RCP (100% capitalized via equity contributions), the Company was able to conclude that the equity investment at risk was sufficient to allow Fund I, Fund II, Fund III, Mezzanine Fund and the RCP to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support.

•

The general partner and the limited partners in Fund I, Fund II, Fund III, Mezzanine Fund and the RCP, collectively, have full decision-making ability as they collectively have the power to direct the activities of Fund I, Fund II, Fund III, Mezzanine Fund and the RCP, since Rialto, in addition to being a general partner with a substantive equity investment in Fund I, Fund II, Fund III, Mezzanine Fund and the RCP, also provides services to Fund I, Fund II, Fund III, Mezzanine Fund and the RCP, under a management agreement and an investment agreement, which are not separable from Rialto’s general partnership interest.

•

As a result of all these factors, the Company has concluded that the power to direct the activities of Fund I, Fund II, Fund III, Mezzanine Fund, and the RCP reside in its general partnership interest and thus with the holders of the equity investment at risk.

•

In addition, there are no guaranteed returns provided to the equity investors and the equity contributions are fully subjected to Fund I, Fund II, Fund III, Mezzanine Fund and the RCP's operational results, thus the equity investors absorb the expected negative and positive variability relative to Fund I, Fund II, Fund III, Mezzanine Fund and the RCP.

•

Finally, substantially all of the activities of Fund I, Fund II, Fund III, Mezzanine Fund and the RCP are not conducted on behalf of any individual investor or related group that has disproportionately few voting rights (i.e., on behalf of any individual limited partner).

Having concluded that Fund I, Fund II, Fund III, Mezzanine Fund and the RCP are voting interest entities, the Company has evaluated the funds under the voting interest entity model to determine whether, as general partner, it has control over Fund I, Fund II, Fund III, Mezzanine Fund and the RCP. The Company determined that it does not control Fund I, Fund II, Fund III, Mezzanine Fund or the RCP as its general partner, because the unaffiliated limited partners have substantial kick-out rights and can remove Rialto as general partner at any time for cause or without cause through a simple majority vote of the limited partners or in the case of the RCP, and individual limited partner. In addition, there are no significant barriers to the exercise of these rights. As a result of determining that the Company does not control Fund I, Fund II, Fund III, Mezzanine Fund or the RCP under the voting interest entity model, Fund I, Fund II, Fund III, Mezzanine Fund and the RCP are not consolidated in the Company’s financial statements.

Management Fees and General Contractor Revenue

The Lennar Multifamily segment provides management services with respect to the development, construction and property management of rental projects in joint ventures in which the Company has investments. As a result, the Lennar Multifamily segment earns and receives fees, which are generally based upon a stated percentage of development and construction costs and a percentage of gross rental collections. These fees are included in Lennar Multifamily revenue and are recorded over the period in which the services are performed, fees are determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. In addition, the Lennar Multifamily provides general contractor services for the construction of some of its rental projects and recognizes the revenue over the period in which the services are performed under the percentage of completion method.

New Accounting Pronouncements

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued ASU 2014-09,

Revenue from Contracts with Customers,

("ASU 2014-09"). ASU 2014-09 provides a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. ASU 2014-09 will require an entity to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This update creates a five-step model that requires entities to exercise judgment when considering the terms of the contract(s) which include (i) identifying the contract(s) with the customer, (ii) identifying the separate performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determining the transaction price, (iv) allocating the transaction price to the separate performance obligations, and (v) recognizing revenue when each performance obligation is satisfied. In July 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date by one year and permitted early adoption of the standard, but not before the original effective date; therefore, ASU 2014-09 will be effective for the Company’s fiscal year beginning December 1, 2018 and subsequent interim periods. The Company has the option to apply the provisions of ASU 2014-09 either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of applying this ASU recognized at the date of initial application. The Company is currently evaluating the method and impact the adoption of ASU 2014-09 will have on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

Subsequent to the issuance of ASU 2014-09, the FASB has issued several ASUs such as ASU 2016-08,

Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)

, ASU 2016-09,

Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting

, and ASU 2016-12,

Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients

among others. These ASUs do not change the core principle of the guidance stated in ASU 2014-09, instead these amendments are intended to clarify and improve operability of certain topics included within the revenue standard. These ASUs will have the same effective date and transition requirements as ASU 2014-09. The Company is currently evaluating the method and impact the adoption of these ASUs and ASU 2014-09 will have on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02,

Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis

("ASU 2015-02"). ASU 2015-02 amends the consolidation requirements and significantly changes the consolidation analysis required. ASU 2015-02 requires management to reevaluate all legal entities under a revised consolidation model specifically (i) modify the evaluation of whether limited partnership and similar legal entities are VIEs, (ii) eliminate the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership, (iii) affect the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with VIEs particularly those that have fee arrangements and related party relationships, and (iv) provide a scope exception from consolidation guidance for reporting entities with interests in legal entities that are required to comply with or operate in accordance with requirements that are similar to those in Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Act of 1940 for registered money market funds. ASU 2015-02 will be effective for the Company’s fiscal year beginning December 1, 2016 and subsequent interim periods. The adoption of ASU 2015-02 is not expected to have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-05,

Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customers' Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement

("ASU 2015-05"). ASU 2015-05 provides guidance for a customer to determine whether a cloud computing arrangement contains a software license or should be accounted for as a service contract. ASU 2015-05 will be effective for the Company’s fiscal year beginning December 1, 2016 and subsequent interim periods. As permitted, the Company elected early adoption. The adoption of ASU 2015-05 did not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.



LENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16,

Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments

("ASU 2015-16"). ASU 2015-16 requires an acquirer to recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. ASU 2015-16 will be effective for the Company’s fiscal year beginning December 1, 2017 and subsequent interim periods. The adoption of ASU 2015-16 is not expected to have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,

Financial Instruments - Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities

("ASU 2016-01"). ASU 2016-01 modifies how entities measure equity investments and present changes in the fair value of financial liabilities. Under the new guidance, entities will have to measure equity investments that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method at fair value and recognize any changes in fair value in net income unless the investments qualify for the new practicality exception. A practicality exception will apply to those equity investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value and do not qualify for the practical expedient to estimate fair value under ASC 820,

Fair Value Measurements

, and as such these investments may be measured at cost. ASU 2016-01 will be effective for the Company’s fiscal year beginning December 1, 2018 and subsequent interim periods. The adoption of ASU 2016-01 is not expected to have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,

Leases

("ASU 2016-02"), which provides guidance for accounting for leases. ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to classify leases as either finance or operating leases and to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term greater than 12 months regardless of the lease classification. The lease classification will determine whether the lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest rate method or on a straight line basis over the term of the lease. Accounting for lessors remains largely unchanged from current GAAP. ASU 2016-02 will be effective for the Company’s fiscal year beginning December 1, 2019 and subsequent interim periods. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-07,

Investments- Equity Method and Joint Ventures: Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting

("ASU 2016-07"). ASU 2016-07 eliminates the requirement to apply the equity method of accounting retrospectively when a reporting entity obtains significant influence over a previously held investment. ASU 2016-07 will be effective for the Company’s fiscal year beginning December 1, 2017 and subsequent interim periods. The adoption of ASU 2016-07 is not expected to have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,

Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting

("ASU 2016-09"). ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects related to the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, statutory tax withholding requirements and classification on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 will be effective for the Company’s fiscal year beginning December 1, 2017 and subsequent interim periods. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of ASU 2016-09 but the Company does not expect it to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,

Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230), Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments

("ASU 2016-15"). ASU 2016-15 reduces the existing diversity in practice in financial reporting across all industries by clarifying certain existing principles in ASC 230,

Statement of Cash Flows

, ("ASC 230") including providing additional guidance on how and what an entity should consider in determining the classification of certain cash flows. In addition, in November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18,

Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230), Restricted Cash

("ASU 2016-18"). ASU 2016-18 clarifies certain existing principles in ASC 230, including providing additional guidance related to transfers between cash and restricted cash and how entities present, in their statement of cash flows, the cash receipts and cash payments that directly affect the restricted cash accounts. These ASUs will be effective for the Company’s fiscal year beginning December 1, 2018 and subsequent interim periods. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2016-15 and ASU 2016-18 will modify the Company's current disclosures and reclassifications within the consolidated statement of cash flows but they are not expected to have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Reclassifications/Revisions

As a result of the Company's change in reportable segments during fiscal year 2016, the Company restated certain prior year amounts in the consolidated financial statements to conform with the 2016 presentation (see Note 2). These reclassifications had no impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

Operating and Reporting Segments

As of and for the year ended

November 30, 2016

, the Company’s operating segments are aggregated into reportable segments, based primarily upon similar economic characteristics, geography and product type. The Company’s reportable segments consist of:

(1)

Homebuilding East

(2)

Homebuilding Central

(3)

Homebuilding West

(4)

Lennar Financial Services

(5)

Rialto

(6)

Lennar Multifamily

During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company evaluated all of its reportable segments and as the Houston operating division, which previously had been reported a separate reportable segment, did not meet the reportable criteria set forth in ASC 280,

Segment Reporting

("ASC 280")

,

the Company aggregated this operating division into the Homebuilding Central reportable segment as this division exhibits similar economic characteristics, geography and product type as the other divisions in Homebuilding Central.

In addition, during the first quarter of 2016, the Company made the decision to divide the Southeast Florida operating division into

two

operating segments to maximize operational efficiencies given the continued growth of the division. As a result of this change in management structure, the Company re-evaluated its reportable segments and determined that neither operating segment met the reportable criteria set forth in ASC 280. The Company aggregated these operating segments into the Homebuilding East reportable segment as these divisions exhibit similar economic characteristics, geography and product type as the other divisions in Homebuilding East.

All prior year segment information has been restated to conform with the 2016 presentation. The changes in the reportable segments have no effect on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows for the periods presented.

Information about homebuilding activities in states which are not economically similar to other states in the same geographic area is grouped under "Homebuilding Other," which is not considered a reportable segment.

Evaluation of segment performance is based primarily on operating earnings (loss) before income taxes. Operations of the Company’s homebuilding segments primarily include the construction and sale of single-family attached and detached homes, as well as the purchase, development and sale of residential land directly and through the Company’s unconsolidated entities. Operating earnings (loss) for the homebuilding segments consist of revenues generated from the sales of homes and land, equity in earnings (loss) from unconsolidated entities and other income (expense), net, less the cost of homes sold and land sold, selling, general and administrative expenses and other interest expense of the segment.

The Company’s reportable homebuilding segments and all other homebuilding operations not required to be reported separately, have homebuilding divisions located in:

East:

Florida, Georgia, Maryland, New Jersey, North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia

Central:

Arizona, Colorado and Texas

West:

California and Nevada

Other:

Illinois, Minnesota, Oregon, Tennessee and Washington

Operations of the Lennar Financial Services segment include primarily mortgage financing, title insurance and closing services for both buyers of the Company’s homes and others. The Lennar Financial Services segment sells substantially all of the loans it originates within a short period in the secondary mortgage market, the majority of which are sold on a servicing released, non-recourse basis. After the loans are sold, the Company retains potential liability for possible claims by purchasers that it breached certain limited industry-standard representations and warranties in the loan sale agreements. Lennar Financial Services’ operating earnings consist of revenues generated primarily from mortgage financing, title insurance and closing services, less the cost of such services and certain selling, general and administrative expenses incurred by the segment. The Lennar Financial Services segment operates generally in the same states as the Company’s homebuilding operations as well as in other states.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Operations of the Rialto segment include raising, investing and managing third-party capital, originating and securitizing commercial mortgage loans as well as investing its own capital in real estate related mortgage loans, properties and related securities. Rialto utilizes its vertically-integrated investment and operating platform to underwrite, diligence, acquire, manage, workout and add value to diverse portfolios of real estate loans, properties and real estate related securities as well as providing strategic real estate capital. Rialto’s operating earnings consist of revenues generated primarily from gains from securitization transactions and interest income from the RMF business, interest income associated with portfolios of real estate loans acquired and other portfolios of real estate loans and assets acquired, asset management, due diligence and underwriting fees derived from the real estate investment funds managed by the Rialto segment, fees for sub-advisory services, other income (expense), net, and equity in earnings (loss) from unconsolidated entities, less the costs incurred by the segment for managing portfolios, costs related to RMF and other general and administrative expenses.

Operations of the Lennar Multifamily segment include revenues generated from land sales, revenue from construction activities and management fees generated from joint ventures, and equity in earnings (loss) from unconsolidated entities, less the cost of land sold, expenses related to construction activities and general and administrative expenses.

Each reportable segment follows the same accounting policies described in Note 1—"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" to the consolidated financial statements. Operational results of each segment are not necessarily indicative of the results that would have occurred had the segment been an independent, stand-alone entity during the periods presented.

On May 2, 2016 (the "Closing Date"), the Company contributed, or obtained the right to contribute, its investment in

three

strategic joint ventures previously managed by FivePoint Communities in exchange for an investment in a FivePoint entity. The fair values of the assets contributed to this FivePoint entity, included within the unconsolidated entities summarized condensed balance sheet presented above, are preliminary and may be adjusted when additional information is obtained during the transaction's measurement period (a period of up to one year from the Closing Date) that may change the fair value allocation as of the acquisition date. A portion of the assets of one of the

three

strategic joint ventures was retained by Lennar and its venture partner in a new unconsolidated entity. The transactions did not have a material impact to the Company’s financial position or cash flows. The Company recorded its share of combination costs in equity in loss from unconsolidated entities on the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended

November 30, 2016

.

As of

November 30, 2016

and

million

and

$

741.6

million

, respectively, while the underlying equity in Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities partners’ net assets as of

November 30, 2016

and


was

$

1.2

billion

and

$

839.5

million

, respectively. The basis difference is primarily as a result of the Company contributing its investment in

three

strategic joint ventures with a higher fair value than book value for an investment in the FivePoint entity and deferring equity in earnings on land sales to the Company.

During the year ended

November 30, 2015

, one of the Company's unconsolidated entities sold approximately


homesites to a joint venture, in which the Company has a


%

investment, for

$


million

of which

$

320.0

million

was financed through a non-recourse note. This transaction resulted in

$

157.4

million

of gross profit, of which the Company's portion was deferred. In addition, this transaction resulted in an increase in inventory, other assets and debt of the Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities reflected in the summarized condensed financial information presented in the previous table for the year ended

November 30, 2015

.

The Company’s partners generally are unrelated homebuilders, land owners/developers and financial or other strategic partners. The unconsolidated entities follow accounting principles that are in all material respects the same as those used by the Company. The Company shares in the profits and losses of these unconsolidated entities generally in accordance with its ownership interests. In many instances, the Company is appointed as the day-to-day manager under the direction of a management committee that has shared powers amongst the partners of the unconsolidated entities and the Company receives management fees and/or reimbursement of expenses for performing this function. During the years ended

November 30, 2016

$

13.2

million

,

$

31.3

million

and

$

30.7

million

, respectively.

The Company and/or its partners sometimes obtain options or enter into other arrangements under which the Company can purchase portions of the land held by the unconsolidated entities. Option prices are generally negotiated prices that approximate fair value when the Company receives the options. During the years ended

$

130.4

million

,

$

177.6

million

and

$

, respectively, of the unconsolidated entities’ revenues were from land sales to the Company. The Company does not include in its Lennar Homebuilding equity in earnings (loss) from unconsolidated entities its pro-rata share of unconsolidated entities’ earnings resulting from land sales to its homebuilding divisions. Instead, the Company accounts for those earnings as a reduction of the cost of purchasing the land from the unconsolidated entities. This in effect defers recognition of the Company’s share of the unconsolidated entities’ earnings related to these sales until the Company delivers a home and title passes to a third-party homebuyer.

In most instances in which the Company has guaranteed debt of a Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entity, the Company’s partners have also guaranteed that debt and are required to contribute their share of the guarantee payments. In a repayment guarantee, the Company and its venture partners guarantee repayment of a portion or all of the debt in the event of default before the lender would have to exercise its rights against the collateral.

In connection with many of the loans to Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entities, the Company and its joint venture partners (or entities related to them) have been required to give guarantees of completion to the lenders. Those completion guarantees may require that the guarantors complete the construction of the improvements for which the financing was obtained. If the construction is to be done in phases, the guarantee generally is limited to completing only the phases as to which construction has already commenced and for which loan proceeds were used.

If the Company is required to make a payment under any guarantee, the payment would constitute a capital contribution or loan to the Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entity and increase the Company's investment in the unconsolidated entity and its share of any funds the entity distributes.

As of both

November 30, 2016

and


, the fair values of the repayment guarantees and completion guarantees were not material. The Company believes that as of

November 30, 2016

, in the event it becomes legally obligated to perform under a guarantee of the obligation of a Lennar Homebuilding unconsolidated entity due to a triggering event under a guarantee, most of the time the collateral should be sufficient to repay at least a significant portion of the obligation or the Company and its partners would contribute additional capital into the venture. In certain instances, the Company has placed performance letters of credit and surety bonds with municipalities for its joint ventures (see Note 6).

Loans Receivable

The following table represents loans receivable, net by type:



LENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The nonaccrual loan portfolios consist primarily of loans acquired at a discount. In 2010, the Rialto segment acquired indirectly


%

managing member equity interests in

two

limited liability companies in partnership with the FDIC ("FDIC Portfolios"). The LLCs met the accounting definition of VIEs and since the Company was determined to be the primary beneficiary, the Company consolidated the LLCs. The Company was determined to be the primary beneficiary because it has the power to direct the activities of the LLCs that most significantly impact the LLCs' performance through Rialto's management and servicer contracts. At

November 30, 2016

and


, these consolidated LLCs had total combined assets of

$

213.8

million

and

$

355.2

million

, respectively, and liabilities of

$

10.3

million

and

$

11.3

million

, respectively.

In addition, in 2010 Rialto acquired


distressed residential and commercial real estate loans ("Bank Portfolios") and over


REO properties from

three

financial institutions.

Based on the nature of these loans, the portfolios are managed by assessing the risks related to the likelihood of collection of payments from borrowers and guarantors, as well as monitoring the value of the underlying collateral. As of

November 30, 2016

and


, management classified all loans receivable within the FDIC Portfolios and Bank Portfolios as nonaccrual loans as forecasted principal and interest cannot be reasonably estimated, and therefore, the Company accounts for these assets in accordance with ASC 310-10,

Receivables

.

As of

November 30, 2016

, accrual loans included floating and fixed rate commercial property loans maturing between October 2017 and June 2018. Accrual loans as of

November 30, 2015

included

$

17.1

million

of convertible land loans that matured and were settled in July 2016 and

$

59.1

million

of floating and fixed rate commercial property loans that were maturing between May 2016 and July 2018.

The following tables represent nonaccrual loans in the FDIC Portfolios and Bank Portfolios accounted for under ASC 310-10 aggregated by collateral type:

November 30, 2015

The average recorded investment in impaired loans totaled approximately

$


million

and

$


million

for the years ended

November 30, 2016

and


, respectively.

In order to assess the risk associated with each risk category, management evaluates the forecasted cash flows and the value of the underlying collateral securing the loans receivable on a quarterly basis or when an event occurs that suggests a decline in the collateral’s fair value.



LENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Allowance for Loan Losses

The allowance for loan losses is a valuation reserve established through provisions for loan losses charged against Rialto’s operating earnings. For nonaccrual loans, the risk relates to a decline in the value of the collateral securing the outstanding obligation.

If the recorded investment in the nonaccrual loan exceeds its fair value, an impairment is recognized through an allowance for loan losses. The activity in the Company's allowance rollforward related to nonaccrual loans was as follows:

For accrual loans an allowance is calculated based on a review of individual loans considered impaired. The analysis of impaired losses may be based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the effective loan rate, an observable market price or the fair value of the underlying collateral on collateral dependent loans. In determining the collectability of certain loans, management also considers the fair value of any underlying collateral. Based on management's assessment,

no

allowance for loan losses were recorded for Rialto's accrual loans as of

November 30, 2016

and


, respectively.

Real Estate Owned

The acquisition of properties acquired through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosure are reported within the consolidated balance sheets as REO held-and-used, net and REO held-for-sale.

Lennar Multifamily Segment

The Company is actively involved, primarily through unconsolidated entities, in the development, construction and property management of multifamily rental properties. The Lennar Multifamily segment focuses on developing a geographically diversified portfolio of institutional quality multifamily rental properties in select U.S. markets.

The assets and liabilities related to the Lennar Multifamily segment were as follows:

(1)

Receivables primarily related to general contractor services and management fee income receivables as of

November 30, 2016

and


.

The unconsolidated entities in which the Lennar Multifamily segment has investments usually finance their activities with a combination of partner equity and debt financing. In connection with many of the loans to Lennar Multifamily unconsolidated entities, the Company (or entities related to them) has been required to give guarantees of completion and cost over-runs to the lenders and partners. Those completion guarantees may require that the guarantors complete the construction of the improvements for which the financing was obtained. If the construction is to be done in phases, the guarantee generally is limited to completing only the phases as to which construction has already commenced and for which loan proceeds were used. Additionally, the Company guarantees the construction costs of the project as construction cost over-runs would be paid by the Company. Generally, these payments would be increases to the Company's investment in the entities and would increase its share of funds the entities distribute after the achievement of certain thresholds. As of both

November 30, 2016

and


, the fair value of the completion guarantees was immaterial. Additionally, as of

November 30, 2016

and


, the Lennar Multifamily segment had

$

32.0

million

and

$

37.9

million

, respectively, of letters of credit outstanding primarily for credit enhancements for the bank debt of certain of its unconsolidated entities and deposits on land purchase contracts. These letters of credit outstanding are included in the disclosure in Note 6 related to the Company's performance and financial letters of credit. As of

November 30, 2016

and


, the Lennar Multifamily segment's unconsolidated entities had non-recourse debt with completion guarantees of

$

589.4

million

and

$

466.7

million

, respectively.

In many instances, the Lennar Multifamily segment is appointed as the construction, development and property manager of certain of its Lennar Multifamily unconsolidated entities and receives fees for performing this function. During the years ended

November 30, 2016

,


and


, the Lennar Multifamily segment received fee income, net of deferrals, from its unconsolidated entities of

$

38.5

million

,

$

A reconciliation of the statutory rate and the effective tax rate was as follows:

(1)

During the year ended

November 30, 2015

, the Company recorded a benefit for additional state net operating loss carryforwards as a result of the conclusion of a state tax examination.

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.

The tax effects of significant temporary differences that give rise to the net deferred tax assets were as follows:



LENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The detail of the Company's net deferred tax assets were as follows:

(1)

Net deferred tax assets and net deferred tax liabilities detailed above are included within other assets and other liabilities in the respective segments.

A reduction of the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance is required if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized. Accordingly, the need to establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets is assessed each reporting period by the Company based on the consideration of all available positive and negative evidence using a "more-likely-than-not" standard with respect to whether deferred tax assets will be realized. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses, actual earnings, forecasts of future profitability, the duration of statutory carryforward periods, the Company’s experience with loss carryforwards not expiring unused and tax planning alternatives.

As of

November 30, 2016

and


, the net deferred tax assets included a valuation allowance of

$

5.8

million

and

$

5.9

million

, respectively, primarily related to state net operating loss ("NOL") carryforwards that are not more likely than not to be utilized due to an inability to carry back these losses in most states and short carryforward periods that exist in certain states. During the years ended

November 30, 2016

and


, the Company reversed

$

0.2

million

and

$

2.1

million

, respectively, of valuation allowance primarily due to the utilization of state net operating losses.

At

November 30, 2016

and


, the Company had federal tax effected NOL carryforwards totaling

$

1.8

million

and

$

1.9

million

, respectively, that may be carried forward up to


years to offset future taxable income and begin to expire in 2029. At

November 30, 2016

and


, the Company had state tax effected NOL carryforwards totaling

$

90.6

million

and

$

120.7

million

, respectively, that may be carried forward from


to


years, depending on the tax jurisdiction, with losses expiring between

2017 and 2035

.

The following table summarizes the changes in gross unrecognized tax benefits:

(1)

Increased the Company's effective tax rate for the year ended November 30, 2015 from

32.30

%

to

32.72

%

due to state audits.

(2)

Decreased the Company's effective tax rate for the year November 30, 2014 from

35.13

%

to

34.80

%

.

If the Company were to recognize its gross unrecognized tax benefits as of

November 30, 2016

,

$

8.0

million

would affect the Company’s effective tax rate. The Company does not expect the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits to increase or decrease by a material amount within the following twelve months.

The following summarizes the changes in interest and penalties accrued with respect to gross unrecognized tax benefits:

(1)

The Company's accrual for interest and penalties was reduced during the year ended

November 30, 2016

primarily due to a settlement with the IRS.

The IRS is currently examining the Company’s federal income tax returns for fiscal year 2015, and certain state taxing authorities are examining various fiscal years. The final outcome of these examinations is not yet determinable. The statute of limitations for the Company’s major tax jurisdictions remains open for examination for fiscal year 2005 and subsequent years. The Company participates in an IRS examination program, Compliance Assurance Process, "CAP." This program operates as a contemporaneous exam throughout the year in order to keep exam cycles current and achieve a higher level of compliance.

Financial Instruments and Fair Value Disclosures

The following table presents the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of financial instruments held by the Company at

November 30, 2016

and


, using available market information and what the Company believes to be appropriate valuation methodologies. Considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value. The use of different market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies might have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. The table excludes cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, receivables, net, and accounts payable, all of which had fair values approximating their carrying amounts due to the short maturities and liquidity of these instruments.

The following methods and assumptions are used by the Company in estimating fair values:

Rialto

—The fair values for loans receivable, net are based on the fair value of the collateral less estimated cost to sell or discounted cash flows, if estimable. The fair value for investments held-to-maturity is based on discounted cash flows. For notes and other debts payable, the fair value is calculated based on discounted cash flows using the Company’s weighted average borrowing rate and for the warehouse repurchase financing agreements fair values approximate their carrying value due to their short-term maturities.

Lennar Financial Services

—The fair values above are based on quoted market prices, if available. The fair values for instruments that do not have quoted market prices are estimated by the Company on the basis of discounted cash flows or other financial information. For notes and other debts payable, the fair values approximate their carrying value due to variable interest pricing terms and the short-term nature of the borrowings.

Lennar Homebuilding

—For senior notes and other debts payable, the fair value of fixed-rate borrowings is primarily based on quoted market prices and the fair value of variable-rate borrowings is based on expected future cash flows calculated using current market forward rates.

Fair Value Measurements

GAAP provides a framework for measuring fair value, expands disclosures about fair value measurements and establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value summarized as follows:

Level 1:    Fair value determined based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets.

Level 2:    Fair value determined using significant other observable inputs.

Level 3:    Fair value determined using significant unobservable inputs.

The estimated fair values of the Company’s financial instruments have been determined by using available market information and what the Company believes to be appropriate valuation methodologies. Considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value. The use of different market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies might have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. The following methods and assumptions are used by the Company in estimating fair values:

Rialto loans held-for-sale

— The fair value of loans held-for-sale is calculated from model-based techniques that use discounted cash flow assumptions and the Company’s own estimates of CMBS spreads, market interest rate movements and the underlying loan credit quality. Loan values are calculated by allocating the change in value of an assumed CMBS capital structure to each loan. The value of an assumed CMBS capital structure is calculated, generally, by discounting the cash flows associated with each CMBS class at market interest rates and at the Company’s own estimate of CMBS spreads. The Company estimates CMBS spreads by observing the pricing of recent CMBS offerings, secondary CMBS markets, changes in the CMBX index, and general capital and commercial real estate market conditions. Considerations in estimating CMBS spreads include comparing the Company’s current loan portfolio with comparable CMBS offerings containing loans with similar duration, credit quality and collateral composition. These methods use unobservable inputs in estimating a discount rate that is used to assign a value to each loan. While the cash payments on the loans are contractual, the discount rate used and assumptions regarding the relative size of each class in the CMBS capital structure can significantly impact the valuation. Therefore, the estimates used could differ materially from the fair value determined when the loans are sold to a securitization trust.

Rialto interest rate swaps and swap futures

— The fair value of interest rate swaps (derivatives) is based on observable values for underlying interest rates and market determined risk premiums. The fair value of interest rate swap futures (derivatives) is based on quoted market prices for identical investments traded in active markets.

Rialto credit default swaps

— The fair value of credit default swaps (derivatives) is based on quoted market prices for similar investments traded in active markets.

Lennar Financial Services loans held-for-sale

— Fair value is based on independent quoted market prices, where available, or the prices for other mortgage whole loans with similar characteristics. Management believes carrying loans held-for-sale at fair value improves financial reporting by mitigating volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring the fair value of the loans and the derivative instruments used to economically hedge them without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. In addition, the Company recognizes the fair value of its rights to service a mortgage loan as revenue upon entering into an interest rate lock loan commitment with a borrower. The fair value of these servicing rights is included in Lennar Financial Services’ loans held-for-sale as of

November 30, 2016

and


. Fair value of servicing rights is determined based on actual sales of servicing rights on loans with similar characteristics.



LENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Lennar Financial Services investments available-for-sale

— The fair value of these investments is based on the quoted market prices for similar financial instruments.

Lennar Financial Services mortgage loan commitments

— Fair value of commitments to originate loans is based upon the difference between the current value of similar loans and the price at which the Lennar Financial Services segment has committed to originate the loans. The fair value of commitments to sell loan contracts is the estimated amount that the Lennar Financial Services segment would receive or pay to terminate the commitments at the reporting date based on market prices for similar financial instruments. In addition, the Company recognizes the fair value of its rights to service a mortgage loan as revenue upon entering into an interest rate lock loan commitment with a borrower. The fair value of servicing rights is determined based on actual sales of servicing rights on loans with similar characteristics. The fair value of the mortgage loan commitments and related servicing rights is included in Lennar Financial Services’ other assets.

Lennar Financial Services forward contracts

— Fair value is based on quoted market prices for similar financial instruments. The fair value of forward contracts is included in the Lennar Financial Services segment's other assets as of

November 30, 2016

and

November 30, 2015

.

The Lennar Financial Services segment uses mandatory mortgage-backed securities ("MBS") forward commitments, option contracts and investor commitments to hedge its mortgage-related interest rate exposure. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk. Credit risk associated with MBS forward commitments, option contracts and loan sales transactions is managed by limiting the Company’s counterparties to investment banks, federally regulated bank affiliates and other investors meeting the Company’s credit standards. The segment’s risk, in the event of default by the purchaser, is the difference between the contract price and fair value of the MBS forward commitments and option contracts. At

November 30, 2016

, the segment had open commitments amounting to

$

1.2

billion

to sell MBS with varying settlement dates through February 2017.

Lennar Financial Services mortgage servicing rights

—

Lennar Financial Services records the value of mortgage servicing rights when it sells loans on a servicing-retained basis or through the acquisition or assumption of the right to service a financial asset. The fair value of the mortgage servicing rights is calculated using third-party valuations. The key assumptions, which are generally unobservable inputs, used in the valuation of the mortgage servicing rights include mortgage prepayment rates, discount rates and delinquency rates. As of

November 30, 2016

, the key assumptions used in determining the fair value include a

12.9

%

mortgage prepayment rate, a

12.4

%

discount rate and a

7.0

%

delinquency rate. The fair value of mortgage servicing rights is included in the Lennar Financial Services segment's other assets.

The changes in fair values for Level 1 and Level 2 financial instruments measured on a recurring basis are shown below by financial instrument and financial statement line item:

Interest on Lennar Financial Services loans held-for-sale and Rialto loans held-for-sale measured at fair value is calculated based on the interest rate of the loan and recorded as revenues in the Lennar Financial Services’ statement of operations and Rialto's statement of operations, respectively.

$

122.1

million

and liabilities of

$

96.4

million

. During the year ended

November 30, 2016

, there were no VIEs that were deconsolidated.

The Company’s recorded investments in unconsolidated entities were as follows:

Consolidated VIEs

As of

November 30, 2016

, the carrying amount of the VIEs’ assets and non-recourse liabilities that consolidated was

$

536.3

million

and

$

126.4

million

, respectively. As of

November 30, 2015

, the carrying amount of the VIEs’ assets and non-recourse liabilities that consolidated was

$

652.3

million

and

$

84.4

million

, respectively. Those assets are owned by, and those liabilities are obligations of, the VIEs, not the Company.

A VIE’s assets can only be used to settle obligations of that VIE. The VIEs are not guarantors of the Company’s senior notes and other debts payable. The assets held by a VIE usually are collateral for that VIE’s debt. The Company and other partners do not generally have an obligation to make capital contributions to a VIE unless the Company and/or the other partner(s) have entered into debt guarantees with the VIE’s banks. Other than debt guarantee agreements with a VIE’s banks, there are no liquidity arrangements or agreements to fund capital or purchase assets that could require the Company to provide financial support to a VIE. While the Company has option contracts to purchase land from certain of its VIEs, the Company is not required to purchase the assets and could walk away from the contracts.

million

repayment guarantee of an unconsolidated entity's debt. At

November 30, 2015

, the maximum exposure to loss of Lennar Homebuilding’s investments in unconsolidated VIEs was limited to its investments in the unconsolidated VIEs, except with regard to an

, investments in unconsolidated VIEs and Lennar’s maximum exposure to loss included

$

71.3

million

and

$

25.6

, respectively, related to Rialto’s investments held-to-maturity.

As of

and


, the remaining equity commitment of

$

288.2

million

and

$

378.3

million

, respectively, to fund the Venture for future expenditures related to the construction and development of its projects was included in Lennar's maximum exposure to loss. In addition, at

November 30, 2016

and


, the maximum exposure to loss of Lennar Multifamily's investments in unconsolidated VIEs was limited to its investments in the unconsolidated VIEs, except with regard to

$

19.7

million

and

$

30.0

million

, respectively, of letters of credit outstanding for certain of the unconsolidated VIEs that could be drawn upon in the event of default under their debt agreements.

While these entities are VIEs, the Company has determined that the power to direct the activities of the VIEs that most significantly impact the VIEs’ economic performance is generally shared and the Company and its partners are not de-facto agents. While the Company generally manages the day-to-day operations of the VIEs, each of these VIEs has an executive committee made up of representatives from each partner. The members of the executive committee have equal votes and major decisions require unanimous consent and approval from all members. The Company does not have the unilateral ability to exercise participating voting rights without partner consent.

As of

November 30, 2016

, the Company and other partners do not generally have an obligation to make capital contributions to the VIEs, except for

$

288.2

million

remaining equity commitment to fund the Venture for future expenditures related to the construction and development of the projects and

$

19.7

million

of letters of credit outstanding for certain Lennar Multifamily unconsolidated VIEs that could be drawn upon in the event of default under their debt agreements. In addition, there are no liquidity arrangements or agreements to fund capital or purchase assets that could require the Company to provide financial support to the VIEs, except with regard to a

$

43.4

million

repayment guarantee of an unconsolidated entity's debt. Except for the unconsolidated VIEs discussed above, the Company and the other partners did not guarantee any debt of the other unconsolidated VIEs. While the Company has option contracts to purchase land from certain of its unconsolidated VIEs, the Company is not required to purchase the assets and could walk away from the contracts.

Option Contracts

The Company has access to land through option contracts, which generally enables it to control portions of properties owned by third parties (including land funds) and unconsolidated entities until the Company has determined whether to exercise the option.

The Company evaluates all option contracts for land to determine whether they are VIEs and, if so, whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of certain of these option contracts. Although the Company does not have legal title to the optioned land, if the Company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary or makes a significant deposit for optioned land, it may need to consolidate the land under option at the purchase price of the optioned land.

During the year ended

November 30, 2016

, consolidated inventory not owned increased by

$

62.2

million

with a corresponding increase to liabilities related to consolidated inventory not owned in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of

November 30, 2016

. The increase was primarily related to the consolidation of an option agreement, partially offset by the Company exercising its option to acquire land under previously consolidated contracts. To reflect the purchase price of the inventory consolidated, the Company had a net reclass related to option deposits from land under development to consolidated inventory not owned in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of

November 30, 2016

. The liabilities related to consolidated inventory not owned primarily represent the difference between the option exercise prices for the optioned land and the Company’s cash deposits.

Commitments and Contingent Liabilities

The Company is party to various claims, legal actions and complaints arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. The Company is also a party to various lawsuits involving purchases and sales of real property. These lawsuits include claims regarding representations and warranties made in connection with the transfer of properties and disputes regarding the obligation to purchase or sell properties.

The Company has been engaged in litigation since 2008 in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland regarding whether the Company is required by a contract it entered into in 2005 to purchase a property in Maryland. After entering into the contract, the Company later renegotiated the purchase price, reducing it from

$


million

to

$


million

,

$


million

of which has been paid and subsequently written off, leaving a balance of

$


million

. In January 2015, the District Court rendered a decision ordering the Company to purchase the property for the

$


million

balance of the contract price, to pay interest at the rate of


%

per annum from May 27, 2008, and to reimburse the seller for real estate taxes and attorneys’ fees. The Company believes the decision is contrary to applicable law and has appealed the decision. The Company does not believe it is probable that a loss has occurred and, therefore, no liability has been recorded with respect to this case.

If the District Court decision is affirmed in its entirety, the Company will purchase the property and record it at fair value, which the Company believes will not result in an impairment. The amount of interest the Company will be required to pay has been the subject of further proceedings before the court. On June 29, 2015, the court ruled that interest will be calculated as simple interest at the rate of


%

per annum from May 27, 2008 until the date the Company purchases the property. Simple interest on

$


million

at


%

per annum will accrue at the rate of

$

13.7

million

per year, totaling approximately

$


million

as of

November 30, 2016

. In addition, if the Company is required to purchase the property, it will be obligated to reimburse the seller for real estate taxes, which currently total

$

1.6

million

. The Company has not engaged in discovery regarding the amount of the plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees. If the District Court decision is totally reversed on appeal, the Company will not have to purchase the property or pay interest, real estate taxes or attorneys’ fees.

In its June 29, 2015 ruling, the District Court determined that the Company would be permitted to stay the judgment during appeal by posting a bond in the amount of

$

223.4

million

related to pending litigation. The District Court calculated this amount by adding


%

per annum simple interest to the

$


million

purchase price for the period beginning May 27, 2008 through May 26, 2016, the date the District Court estimated the appeal of the case would be concluded.

The Company does not believe that the ultimate resolution of these claims or lawsuits will have a material adverse effect on its business or financial position. However, the financial effect of litigation concerning purchases and sales of property may depend upon the value of the subject property, which may have changed from the time the agreement for purchase or sale was entered into.

The Company is subject to the usual obligations associated with entering into contracts (including option contracts) for the purchase, development and sale of real estate, which it does in the routine conduct of its business. Option contracts generally enable the Company to control portions of properties owned by third parties (including land funds) and unconsolidated entities until the Company determines whether to exercise the option. The use of option contracts allows the Company to reduce the financial risks associated with long-term land holdings. At

November 30, 2016

, the Company had

$

85.0

million

of non-refundable option deposits and pre-acquisition costs related to certain of these homesites, which were included in inventories in the consolidated balance sheet.

The Company has entered into agreements to lease certain office facilities and equipment under operating leases. Future minimum payments under the noncancellable leases in effect at

November 30, 2016

were as follows:

and

$

,

$

and

$

, respectively.

The Company is committed, under various letters of credit, to perform certain development and construction activities and provide certain guarantees in the normal course of business. Outstanding letters of credit under these arrangements totaled

$

481.1

million

at

November 30, 2016

. Additionally, at

November 30, 2016

, the Company had outstanding surety bonds of

$

1.4

billion

including performance surety bonds related to site improvements at various projects (including certain projects in the Company’s joint ventures) and financial surety bonds including

$

223.4

million

related to pending litigation. Although significant development and construction activities have been completed related to these site improvements, these bonds are generally not released until all development and construction activities are completed. As of

November 30, 2016

, there were approximately

$

488.9

million

, or


%

, of anticipated future costs to complete related to these site improvements. The Company does not presently anticipate any draws upon these bonds that would have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.

Substantially all of the loans the Lennar Financial Services segment originates are sold within a short period in the secondary mortgage market on a servicing released, non-recourse basis. After the loans are sold, the Company retains potential liability for possible claims by purchasers that it breached certain limited industry-standard representations and warranties in the loan sale agreements. Over the last several years there has been an industry-wide effort by purchasers to defray their losses by purporting to have found inaccuracies related to sellers’ representations and warranties in particular loan sale agreements. Mortgage investors could seek to have the Company buy back mortgage loans or compensate them for losses incurred on mortgage loans that the Company has sold based on claims that the Company breached its limited representations or warranties. The Company’s mortgage operations have established reserves for possible losses associated with mortgage loans previously originated and sold to investors. While the Company believes that it has adequately reserved for known losses and projected repurchase requests, given the volatility in the mortgage industry and the uncertainty regarding the ultimate resolution of these claims, if either actual repurchases or the losses incurred resolving those repurchases exceed the Company’s expectations, additional recourse expense may be incurred.

17.

Business Acquisition

On

September 22, 2016

, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") with WCI, under which the Company will acquire WCI through a merger for a combination of the Company’s Class A common stock and cash totaling

$

23.50

per share of WCI common stock. It is currently anticipated that the merger consideration payable to WCI stockholders will be

$

11.75

in cash and

$

11.75

in Class A common stock, with the Class A common stock valued at the average of its volume weighted average price on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") on each of the ten NYSE trading days before closing. However, the Company has the right to reduce the portion of the merger consideration that will be Class A common stock and increase the portion that will be cash, including the right to make the entire merger consideration cash. WCI can terminate the Merger Agreement to engage in a transaction that its Board of Directors deems to be more favorable to its stockholders than the transaction with the Company, unless the Company will match the deemed more favorable transaction. However, if WCI terminates the Merger Agreement to engage in another transaction, it will have to pay the Company a termination fee of $

22.5

million

. The Merger Agreement contains customary representations and warranties by the parties, and is subject to closing conditions, including the need for approval by the holders of WCI’s common stock. It is anticipated that a meeting of WCI stockholders to vote on the transaction will be held in February 2017, and, if the transaction is approved by the WCI stockholders, it will close promptly after the stockholder vote.

principal amount of debt of Lennar Corporation, those subsidiaries must also guarantee Lennar Corporation’s obligations with regard to its senior notes. The entities referred to as "guarantors" in the following tables are subsidiaries that are not finance company subsidiaries or foreign subsidiaries and were guaranteeing the senior notes because at

November 30, 2016

they were guaranteeing Lennar Corporation's letter of credit facilities and its Credit Facility, described in Note 6. The guarantees are full, unconditional and joint and several and the guarantor subsidiaries are 100% directly or indirectly owned by Lennar Corporation. A subsidiary's guarantee will be suspended at any time when it is not directly or indirectly guaranteeing at least

$


million

principal amount of debt of Lennar Corporation, and a subsidiary will be released from its guarantee and any other obligations it may have regarding the senior notes if all or substantially all its assets, or all of its capital stock, are sold or otherwise disposed of.

For purposes of the consolidating statement of cash flows included in the following supplemental financial information, the Company's accounting policy is to treat cash received by Lennar Corporation ("the Parent") from its subsidiaries, to the extent of net earnings from such subsidiaries as a dividend and accordingly a return on investment within cash flows from operating activities. Distributions of capital received by the Parent from its subsidiaries are reflected as cash flows from investing activities. The cash outflows associated with the return on investment dividends and distributions of capital received by the Parent are reflected by the Guarantor and Non-Guarantor subsidiaries in the Dividends line item within cash flows from financing activities. All other cash flows between the Parent and its subsidiaries represent the settlement of receivables and payables between such entities in conjunction with the Parent's centralized cash management arrangement with its subsidiaries, which operates with the characteristics of a revolving credit facility, and are accordingly reflected net in the Intercompany line item within cash flows from investing activities for the Parent and net in the Intercompany line item within cash flows from financing activities for the Guarantor and Non-Guarantor subsidiaries.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer participated in an evaluation by our management of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on their participation in that evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of

November 30, 2016

to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or furnished under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.

Our CEO and CFO also participated in an evaluation by our management of any changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended

November 30, 2016

. That evaluation did not identify any changes that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting and the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm obtained from Deloitte & Touche LLP relating to the effectiveness of Lennar Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting are included elsewhere in this document.



Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

(2013)

,

our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of

November 30, 2016

. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of

November 30, 2016

has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their attestation report which is included herein.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Lennar Corporation

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Lennar Corporation and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of

November 30, 2016

, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of

November 30, 2016

, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended

November 30, 2016

of the Company and our report dated

January 20, 2017

expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
