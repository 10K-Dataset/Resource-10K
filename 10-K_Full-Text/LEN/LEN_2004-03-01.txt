Item 1.    Business.

General Development of Business

We are one of the nation’s largest homebuilders and a provider of financial services. Our homebuilding operations include the sale and construction
of single-family attached and detached homes, as well as the purchase, development and sale of residential land directly and through our unconsolidated partnerships. Our financial services subsidiaries provide mortgage financing, title insurance,
closing services and insurance agency services for both buyers of our homes and others, and sell the loans they originate in the secondary mortgage market. These subsidiaries also provide high-speed Internet access, cable television and alarm
installation and monitoring services to residents of communities we develop and others.

The following is a summary of our growth history:


Financial Information about Operating Segments

We have two operating segments—homebuilding and financial services. The financial information related to these
operating segments is contained in Item 8.

Narrative Description of
Business

HOMEBUILDING

Under the Lennar Family of Builders banner, we operate using the following
brand names: Lennar Homes, U.S. Home, Greystone Homes, Village Builders, Renaissance Homes, Orrin Thompson Homes, Lundgren Bros., Winncrest Homes, Patriot Homes, NuHome, Barry Andrews Homes, Concord Homes, Summit Homes, Cambridge Homes, Coleman
Homes and Rutenberg Homes. Our active adult communities are primarily marketed under the Heritage and Greenbriar brand names.

Through our own efforts and unconsolidated partnerships in which we have interests, we are involved in all phases of planning and building in our
residential communities, including land acquisition, site planning, preparation and improvement of land, and design, construction and marketing of homes. We subcontract virtually all aspects of development and construction.

We primarily sell single-family attached and detached homes. The homes are
targeted primarily to first-time, move-up and active adult homebuyers. The average sales price of a Lennar home was $256,000 in fiscal 2003.

Current Homebuilding Activities

Of the deliveries
listed above, 768, 568 and 795 deliveries relate to unconsolidated partnerships for the years ended November 30, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

At November 30, 2003, our market regions consisted of homebuilding divisions in the following states:

East

: Florida, Maryland, Virginia, New
Jersey, North Carolina and South Carolina.

Central

: Texas, Illinois and Minnesota.

West

: California, Colorado, Arizona and Nevada.

Management and Operating Structure

We balance a local operating structure with centralized corporate level management. Our local managers, who have significant experience both in the
homebuilding industry generally and in their particular markets, are responsible for operating decisions regarding land identification, community development, home design, construction and marketing. Decisions related to our overall strategy,
acquisitions of land and businesses, risk management, financing, cash management and information systems are centralized at the corporate level.

We view unconsolidated partnerships and similar entities as a means to both expand our market opportunities and manage our risk. For additional
information about our unconsolidated partnerships, see Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7.


Property Acquisition

In our homebuilding operations, we generally acquire land for development and the construction of homes which we sell to
homebuyers. We also sell land to third parties. Land acquisitions are subject to strict underwriting criteria and may be made directly or through partnerships with other entities. Through unconsolidated partnerships, we reduce our risk as well as
the amounts invested in owned land and increase our access to other land. Partnerships also, in some instances, help us acquire land to which we could not obtain access, or could not obtain access on as favorable terms, without the participation of
a strategic partner.

In some instances, we acquire land
through option contracts, which enables us to defer acquiring portions of properties owned by third parties and unconsolidated partnerships until we are ready to build homes on them. This reduces our financial risk associated with land holdings.
Most of our land is not subject to mortgages; however, the majority of land acquired by partnerships is subject to purchase money mortgages. We generally do not acquire land for speculation. At November 30, 2003, we owned approximately 74,000
homesites and had access to an additional 135,000 homesites through option contracts or our unconsolidated partnerships.

Construction and Development

We supervise and control the development of the land and the building of our residential communities. We hire subcontractors for site improvements and
virtually all of the work involved in the construction of homes. In almost all instances, the arrangements with our subcontractors commit the subcontractors to complete specified work in accordance with written price schedules. These price schedules
normally change to meet changes in labor and material costs. We generally do not own heavy construction equipment and only have a relatively small labor force used to supervise development and construction and perform routine maintenance and minor
amounts of other work. We generally finance construction and land development activities with cash generated from operations as well as from borrowings under our working capital lines and issuances of public debt.

Marketing

We offer a diversified line of homes for first-time, move-up and active adult homebuyers. With homes priced from under
$100,000 to above one million dollars and available in a variety of environments ranging from urban infill communities to golf course communities, we are focused on providing homes for a wide spectrum of buyers. Our unique dual marketing strategies
of Everything’s Included

®

and Design
Studio

SM

provide customers with flexibility to choose how they would like to purchase their new home. In our
Everything’s Included

®

homes, we make the
homebuying experience simple by including desirable, top-of-the-line features as standard items. In our Design Studio

SM

homes, we provide an individualized homebuying experience and personalized design consultation in our design studios, offering a diverse selection of upgrades and options for a new home. We sell our homes primarily from models that
we have designed and constructed.

We employ sales associates
who are paid salaries, commissions or both to make on-site sales of homes. We also sell through independent brokers. We advertise our communities in newspapers and other local and regional publications, on billboards and through our web site,
www.lennar.com. The website allows homebuyers to search for homes with specific design criteria in their price range and desired location. In addition, we advertise our active adult communities in areas where prospective active adult homebuyers
live.

Our business is somewhat seasonal, with signings of new
home sales contracts being strongest in the late winter and spring, resulting in the strongest home deliveries (and therefore, strongest home sales revenues) in the late summer and fall (our third and fourth fiscal quarters).

For a small percentage of our homebuyers (generally less than 5% of our
deliveries), we have participated in charitable down-payment assistance programs. Through these programs, we make a donation to a non-profit organization that provides financial assistance to a homebuyer, who would not otherwise have sufficient
funds for a down payment.

Quality Service

We strive to continually improve customer satisfaction by employing a
process which is intended to provide a positive experience for each homeowner throughout the pre-sale, sale, building, closing and post-closing


periods. The participation of sales associates, on-site construction supervisors and post-closing customer care associates, working in a team effort, is
intended to foster our reputation for quality service and ultimately lead to enhanced customer retention and referrals.

The quality of our homes is affected substantially more by the efforts of on-site management and others engaged in the construction process than it is by
the materials we use in particular homes or similar factors. Currently, most management team members’ bonus plans are in part contingent upon achieving customer satisfaction.

We have a “Heightened Awareness” program which is a focused initiative designed to objectively evaluate and
measure the quality of construction in our communities. The purpose of this program is to ensure that the homes delivered to our customers meet our high standards. Our communities are inspected and reviewed on a periodic basis by one of our trained
associates. This program is an example of our commitment to provide the finest homes to our customers. In addition to our “Heightened Awareness” program, we have a quality assurance program in certain markets where we employ third-party
consultants to inspect our homes during the construction process. These inspectors provide us with documentation of all inspection reports and follow-up verification. We also obtain independent surveys of selected customers through a third-party
consultant and use the survey results to further improve our standard of quality and customer satisfaction.

Competition

The
housing industry is highly competitive. In our activities, we compete with numerous developers and builders of various sizes, both national and local, who are building homes in and near the areas where our communities are located. Competition is on
the basis of location, design, quality, amenities, price, service and reputation. Sales of existing homes also provide significant competition. Some of our principal national competitors include Beazer Homes USA, Inc., Centex Corporation, D.R.
Horton, Inc., Hovnanian Enterprises, Inc., KB Home, M.D.C. Holdings, Inc., NVR, Inc., Pulte Homes, Inc., Standard Pacific Corp., The Ryland Group, Inc. and Toll Brothers, Inc.

FINANCIAL SERVICES

Mortgage Financing

We provide a full spectrum of conventional, FHA-insured and VA-guaranteed, first and second lien residential mortgage loan products to our homebuyers and
others through our financial services subsidiaries, Universal American Mortgage Company, LLC, and Eagle Home Mortgage, Inc., in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina,
Ohio, Oregon, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia and Washington. In 2003, our financial services subsidiaries provided loans to approximately 72% of our homebuyers who obtained mortgage financing from us in areas where we offered services for the
entire year. Because of the availability of mortgage loans from our financial services subsidiaries, as well as independent mortgage lenders, we believe access to financing has not been, and is not, a significant obstacle for most purchasers of our
homes.

During 2003, we originated approximately 41,000
mortgage loans totaling $7.6 billion. We sell the loans we originate in the secondary mortgage market on a servicing released, non-recourse basis. We have a corporate risk management policy under which we hedge our interest rate risk on rate locked
loan commitments and loans held for sale against exposure to interest rate fluctuations. We finance our mortgage loan activities with borrowings under our financial services subsidiaries’ warehouse lines of credit or from our general corporate
funds.

Title Insurance, Closing Services and Insurance Agency Services

We provide closing services and title insurance to our
homebuyers and others. We provided closing services for approximately 245,000 real estate transactions and issued 175,000 title insurance policies during 2003 through subsidiaries of North American Title Group, Inc. Closing services are provided by
agency subsidiaries in Arizona, California, Colorado, District of Columbia, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Nevada, Texas and Virginia. North American Title Insurance Corporation in Florida and Texas, and North American Title Insurance Company in
Arizona, California, Colorado and Nevada provide title insurance underwriting.


We provide personal lines, property and casualty insurance products through our insurance agency
subsidiary, Universal American Insurance Agency, Inc., for our homebuyers and others in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, Nevada, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas and Virginia. During 2003, we issued
approximately 8,500 new homeowner policies and renewed approximately 4,600 homeowner policies.

Strategic Technologies

Our subsidiary, Strategic Technologies, Inc., provides broadband services including high-speed Internet access, as well as alarm installation and monitoring services to residents of our communities and others. At November 30, 2003, we had
approximately 6,000 broadband subscribers and approximately 14,000 alarm monitoring customers in Florida and California.

RELATIONSHIP WITH LNR PROPERTY CORPORATION

In connection with the 1997 transfer of our commercial real estate investment and management business to LNR Property Corporation (“LNR”), and
the spin-off of LNR to our stockholders, we entered into an agreement which, among other things, prevented us from engaging through December 2002 in any of the businesses in which LNR was engaged, or anticipated becoming engaged, at the time of the
spin-off, and prohibited LNR from engaging, at least through December 2002, in any of the businesses in which we were engaged, or anticipated becoming engaged, at the time of the spin-off (except in limited instances in which our then activities or
anticipated activities overlap with LNR). In August 2003, this agreement was extended through November 30, 2005. We have no current intention to become involved in the types of activities in which LNR primarily engages (primarily related to
commercial or multi-family residential real estate, commercial mortgage loans and investments in commercial mortgage-backed securities). Further, the agreement delineating activities in which we could engage from those in which LNR could engage has
helped the two companies work cooperatively in partnerships and other joint endeavors.

We and LNR are separate publicly-traded companies and neither of us has any financial interest in the other, except for partnerships in which we both have investments. Stuart Miller, our President and Chief Executive
Officer, is the Chairman of the Board of Directors of LNR and is the sole director and officer of family-owned entities which own stock that gives Mr. Miller voting control, or near voting control, of both companies. An Independent Directors
Committee approves all ventures we enter into with LNR and any significant transactions between LNR and us or any of our subsidiaries.

In July 2003, a company of which we and LNR each owns 50% agreed to purchase The Newhall Land and Farming Company for approximately $1 billion. That
transaction was completed in January 2004. In connection with the transaction, the company jointly owned by LNR and us, and another company of which we and LNR each owns 50%, entered into a $600 million bank financing arrangement.

For more information about certain of our partnerships with LNR, see
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7.

REGULATION

Homes and residential communities that we build must comply with state and local laws and regulations relating to, among other things, zoning, treatment of waste, construction materials which must be used, density requirements, building
design and minimum elevation of properties. These include laws requiring use of construction materials which reduce the need for energy-consuming heating and cooling systems. These laws and regulations are subject to frequent change and often
increase construction costs. In some cases, there are laws which require that commitments to provide roads and other offsite infrastructure be in place prior to the commencement of new construction. These laws and regulations are usually
administered by individual counties and municipalities and may result in fees and assessments or building moratoriums. In addition, certain new development projects are subject to assessments for schools, parks, streets and highways and other public
improvements, the costs of which can be substantial.


The residential homebuilding industry also is subject to a variety of local, state and federal statutes,
ordinances, rules and regulations concerning the protection of health and the environment. Environmental laws and conditions may result in delays, may cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs, and can prohibit or severely restrict
homebuilding activity in environmentally sensitive regions or areas.

In recent years, several cities and counties in which we have developments have submitted to voters “slow growth” initiatives and other ballot measures which could impact the affordability and availability of homes and land within
those localities. Although many of these initiatives have been defeated, we believe that if similar initiatives were approved, residential construction by us and others within certain cities or counties could be seriously impacted.

In order to make it possible for purchasers of some of our homes to obtain
FHA-insured or VA-guaranteed mortgages, we must construct those homes in compliance with regulations promulgated by those agencies.

We have registered condominium communities with the appropriate authorities in Florida and California. Sales in other states would require compliance with
laws in those states regarding sales of condominium homes.

Our
personal lines insurance and title subsidiaries must comply with applicable insurance laws and regulations. Our mortgage financing subsidiaries and title agencies must comply with applicable real estate lending laws and regulations.

Our mortgage banking and insurance subsidiaries are licensed in the states in
which they do business and must comply with laws and regulations in those states regarding mortgage banking and title insurance companies. These laws and regulations include provisions regarding capitalization, operating procedures, investments,
lending and privacy disclosures, forms of policies and premiums.

We can be affected by government regulation that does not directly apply to us, such as any curtailment of activities of the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac).
Because these organizations provide significant liquidity to the secondary mortgage market, a serious curtailment of their activities could increase mortgage interest rates and therefore increase the effective cost of purchasing our homes.

A subsidiary of The Newhall Land and Farming Company, of which
we indirectly own 50%, provides water to a portion of Los Angeles County. This subsidiary is subject to extensive regulation by the California Public Utilities Commission.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS

Some of the statements in this Report are “forward-looking statements” as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act
of 1995. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those which the statements anticipate. They include the factors discussed under
“Particular Factors Which Could Affect Us.”

PARTICULAR FACTORS WHICH COULD AFFECT US

The
following factors in particular could significantly affect our operations and financial results. We publicly disseminate future earnings goals which could be impacted by some of these factors.

We are subject to the cyclical nature of the home sales market.

The residential homebuilding industry is cyclical and is highly sensitive to
changes in general economic conditions, such as levels of employment, consumer confidence and income, availability of financing, interest rate levels and demand for housing. The resale market for used homes, including foreclosed homes, also affects
the sale of new homes or cancellations of contracts in backlog.


Although the homebuilding business historically has been cyclical, it has not undergone a down cycle in a
number of years. This has led some people to assert that the prices of homes and the stocks of homebuilding companies are overvalued and will decline when or if the market for new homes begins to weaken. A decline in prices of stocks of homebuilding
companies could make it more difficult and more expensive for us to raise funds through stock issuances if we needed funds to meet our obligations or otherwise wanted to do so.

We could be affected by prices or shortages of materials or by weather conditions

.

The residential homebuilding industry has, from time-to-time, experienced
fluctuating lumber prices and supply, as well as shortages of other materials and labor, including insulation, drywall, concrete, carpenters, electricians and plumbers. Delays in construction of homes due to these factors or due to weather
conditions, could have an adverse effect upon our operations.

We are
dependent on the availability of suitable land.

Our
ability to build homes depends upon our being able to acquire at acceptable prices land that is suitable for residential development in the areas in which we want to build homes. Because of this, we maintain, directly or through partnerships or
similar arrangements, a significant inventory of land, much of which is undeveloped or only partially developed.

We could be affected by governmental regulations.

All of our businesses are subject to substantial governmental regulations. In particular, the homebuilding business is subject to government regulations
relating to land use, water rights, construction materials, building design and minimum elevation of properties, as well as a variety of environmental matters. Changes in government regulations often increase the cost of building homes in areas in
which we have communities and could prevent entirely the building of new homes in some areas.

We could be affected by inflation or deflation.

Inflation can increase the cost of building materials, land, labor and other construction related costs. Conversely, deflation can reduce the value of our land inventory and make it more difficult for us to recover
the full cost of previously purchased land in home sale prices.

Customers
may be unwilling or unable to purchase our homes at times when mortgage financing costs are high.

The majority of our homebuyers finance their acquisitions through our financial services subsidiaries or third-party lenders. In general, housing demand
is adversely affected by increases in interest rates and by decreases in the availability of mortgage financing. If mortgage interest rates increase and the ability or willingness of prospective buyers to finance home purchases is adversely
affected, our operating results may be negatively affected. Our homebuilding activities also are dependent upon the availability and cost of mortgage financing for buyers of homes currently owned by potential purchasers of our homes who cannot
purchase our homes until they sell their current homes.

Competition may
affect our profitability.

Our profitability is affected
both by the number of homes we sell and by the profit margins we achieve when we sell homes. Competition and similar factors can reduce the number of homes we sell, or can force us to accept reduced profit margins in order to maintain sales volume.

Our operating results vary from quarter to quarter.

We have historically experienced, and expect to continue to experience,
variability in operating results on a quarterly basis. Factors which may contribute to this variability include, but are not limited to:

—

the timing of home deliveries and land sales;

—

the timing of receipt of regulatory approvals for the construction of homes;

—

the condition of the real estate market, prices for homes and general economic conditions;


—

the cyclical nature of the homebuilding and financial services industries;

—

prevailing interest rates and availability of mortgage financing;

—

the increase in the number of homes available for sale in the marketplace;

—

pricing policies of our competitors;

—

the timing of the opening of new residential communities;

—

weather conditions; and

—

the cost and availability of materials and labor.

Our historical financial performance is not necessarily a meaningful indicator of future results. We expect our financial results to continue to vary from
quarter to quarter.

We could be hurt by loss of key personnel.

Our success depends to a significant degree on the
efforts of our senior management. Our operations may be adversely affected if key members of senior management cease to be active in our Company. We have designed our compensation structure and employee benefit programs to encourage long-term
employment by senior management.

We have a significant stockholder.

We have two classes of stock: Class A common stock, which
is entitled to one vote per share; and Class B common stock, which is entitled to ten votes per share. Stuart Miller, our President and Chief Executive Officer, has voting control, through family-owned entities and personal holdings, of Class A and
Class B common stock that entitles Mr. Miller to approximately 48% of the combined votes that can be cast by the holders of our outstanding Class A and Class B common stock combined. That gives significant influence to Mr. Miller in electing all our
directors and approving most matters that are presented to our stockholders. Mr. Miller’s voting power might discourage someone from making a significant equity investment in us, even if we needed the investment to meet our obligations and to
operate our business.

EMPLOYEES

At November 30, 2003, we employed 10,572 individuals of whom 6,786 were
involved in homebuilding operations and 3,786 were involved in financial services operations. We do not have collective bargaining agreements relating to any of our employees. However, some of the subcontractors we use have employees who are
represented by labor unions.

ACCESS TO OUR INFORMATION

We electronically file our Annual Report on Form 10-K,
Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and all exhibits and amendments to these reports, with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). The public may read and copy any of the reports that are filed with the SEC
at the SEC’s Public Reference Room at 450 Fifth Street, NW, Washington, D.C. 20549. The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC maintains an Internet site,
www.sec.gov, that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically.

We make available, free of charge, through our website, www.lennar.com, and by responding to requests addressed to our investor relations department, our
Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and all exhibits and amendments to these reports. These reports are available as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed
with or furnished to the SEC.


Item 2.    Properties.

For information about properties we own for use in our homebuilding activities, see Item 1.

We lease and maintain our executive offices, financial services subsidiary
headquarters, certain mortgage and title branches and a homebuilding division in an office complex in Miami, Florida. The leases for these offices expire through 2009. Our other homebuilding and financial services offices are located in the markets
where we conduct business, primarily in leased space.

Item
3.    Legal Proceedings.

We are party
to various claims and lawsuits which arise in the ordinary course of business. Although the specific allegations in the lawsuits differ, most of them involve claims that we failed to construct buildings in particular communities in accordance with
plans and specifications or applicable construction codes, and seek reimbursement for sums allegedly needed to remedy the alleged deficiencies, or assert contract issues or relate to personal injuries. Lawsuits of these types are common within the
homebuilding industry. We do not believe that these claims or lawsuits will have a material effect on our business, financial position or results of operations.

Item 4.    Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

Not applicable.

Item 7.    Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations.

Some of the statements contained in the
following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are “forward-looking statements” as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. By their nature,
forward-looking statements involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those which the statements anticipate. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate
strictly to historical or current facts. They contain words such as “anticipate,” “estimate,” “expect,” “project,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “may,” “can,”
“could,” “might,” “guidance,” “goal,” “visibility,” and other words or phrases of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. Factors which may
affect our results include, but are not limited to, changes in general economic conditions, the market for homes and prices for homes generally and in areas where we have developments, the availability and cost of land suitable for residential
development, materials prices, labor costs, interest rates, consumer confidence, competition, terrorist acts or other acts of war, environmental factors and government regulations affecting our operations.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Overview

We achieved record revenues, profits and earnings per share in 2003. Our net earnings in 2003 were $751.4 million, or $4.65 per share diluted, compared to
$545.1 million, or $3.51 per share diluted, in 2002. The increase in net earnings was attributable to strong homebuilding gross margins and increased operating earnings from our Financial Services Division. In particular, both our deliveries and
average sales price on homes delivered increased due to strong demand resulting from supply constraints, strong demographic trends, low interest rates and improving economic trends. With $1.2 billion of cash at year-end, our net homebuilding debt
(i.e., homebuilding debt less homebuilding cash) to total net capital (i.e., net homebuilding debt plus stockholders’ equity) ratio was 9.7% at November 30, 2003, compared to 27.7% last year. Additionally, we had zero outstanding under our $1
billion revolving credit facilities at year-end. Our record earnings combined with a strong balance sheet contributed to a return on net capital of approximately 23% in 2003, compared to approximately 22% in 2002.

Earnings per share amounts for all years have been adjusted to reflect the
effect of our April 2003 10% Class B common stock distribution and our January 2004 two-for-one stock split.

Homebuilding

Our
Homebuilding Division sells and constructs homes primarily for first-time, move-up and active adult homebuyers. We use a dual marketing strategy in which we sell homes under both our Everything’s Included

programs. Our land operations include the purchase, development and sale of land for our homebuilding activities, as well as the sale of land to third
parties. In certain circumstances, we diversify our operations through strategic alliances and minimize our risk by forming partnerships with other entities. The following tables set forth selected financial and operational information for the years
indicated. The results of operations of the homebuilders we acquired during these years are included in the information since the respective dates of the acquisitions.


Selected Homebuilding Division Financial Data

Prior year amounts
contain reclassifications to conform to the 2003 presentation. These reclassifications had no impact on reported net earnings. Homebuilding results reflect reclassifications that have been made to interest expense (now included in cost of homes sold
and cost of land sold), equity in earnings from unconsolidated partnerships and management fees and other income, net.


Summary of Home and Backlog Data By Region

At November 30, 2003,
our market regions consisted of homebuilding divisions in the following states:

East:

Florida, Maryland, Virginia, New Jersey, North Carolina and South Carolina.

Central:

Texas, Illinois and Minnesota.

West:

California,
Colorado, Arizona and Nevada.

During 2003, we expanded our
operations in California and South Carolina through homebuilding acquisitions. During 2002, we acquired nine homebuilders, which expanded our operations into the Carolinas and the Chicago, Baltimore and Central Valley, California homebuilding
markets and strengthened our positions in several of our existing markets. The results of operations of the homebuilders we acquired are included in our results of operations since their respective acquisition dates.

Revenues from sales of homes increased 22% in 2003 and 20% in 2002, compared
to the previous years as a result of a 17% increase and a 16% increase in the number of home deliveries, respectively, in 2003 and 2002, and a 4% increase in the average sales price in both years. In 2003, new home deliveries were higher in most of
our markets, primarily in California, Florida, Texas and Illinois. In 2002, new home deliveries were higher primarily due to a strong homebuilding market, combined with our acquisitions during the year. The average sales price of homes delivered
increased in 2003 and 2002 primarily due to an increase in the average sales price in most of our existing markets, combined with changes in our product and geographic mix.

Gross margin percentages on home sales were 23.1%, 22.2% and 21.8% in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The increase in
2003 was due to a greater contribution from a strong California market, combined


with lower interest costs due to a lower debt leverage ratio while we continued to grow. The increase in 2002 was due to improved operational efficiencies
and strength in the homebuilding markets in which we operated, partially offset by softness primarily in the Texas market.

Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues from home sales increased to 10.9% in 2003, compared to 10.7% and 10.5% in 2002
and 2001, respectively. The increase in 2003 was primarily due to higher personnel-related expenses, compared to 2002. The increase in 2002 was primarily due to an increase in insurance costs, compared to 2001.

Gross profits on land sales totaled $73.3 million in the year ended November
30, 2003, compared to $2.0 million in 2002 and $1.7 million in 2001. Profits in 2003 were positively impacted by each of our regions, with strong contributions from our East and West regions. Equity in earnings from unconsolidated partnerships
was $81.9 million in the year ended November 30, 2003, compared to $42.7 million in 2002 and $27.1 million in 2001. Management fees and other income, net, totaled $21.9 million in the year ended November 30, 2003, compared to $33.3 million in 2002
and $18.4 million in 2001. Land sales, equity in earnings from unconsolidated partnerships, and management fees and other income, net, may vary significantly from period to period depending on the timing of land sales and other transactions by us
and our unconsolidated partnerships.

At November 30, 2003, we
owned approximately 74,000 homesites and had access to an additional 135,000 homesites through either option contracts or our unconsolidated partnerships. At November 30, 2003, approximately 15% of the homesites we owned were subject to home
purchase contracts. Our backlog of sales contracts was 13,905 homes ($3.9 billion) at November 30, 2003, compared to 12,108 homes ($3.2 billion) at November 30, 2002. The higher backlog was primarily attributable to our homebuilding acquisitions and
growth in the number of active communities, which resulted in higher new orders in 2003, compared to 2002. As a result of these acquisitions combined with our organic growth, inventories increased 13% during 2003, while revenues from sales of homes
increased 22% for the year ended November 30, 2003, compared to prior year.

Financial Services

Our Financial Services
Division provides mortgage financing, title insurance, closing services and insurance agency services for both buyers of our homes and others. The Division sells the loans it originates in the secondary mortgage market. The Division also provides
high-speed Internet access, cable television and alarm installation and monitoring services to residents of our communities and others. The following table sets forth selected financial and operational information relating to our Financial Services
Division. The results of operations of companies we acquired during these years are included in the information since the respective dates of the acquisitions.

Operating earnings
from our Financial Services Division increased to $154.5 million in 2003, compared to $127.6 million and $89.1 million in 2002 and 2001, respectively. The increase in 2003 was primarily due to improved results from our mortgage and title operations,
which benefited from low interest rates and a strong refinance and housing environment. The increase in 2002 was primarily due to improved results from our


mortgage and title operations, which benefited from a low interest rate and strong housing environment in 2002. The operating earnings in 2002 included a
$5.0 million gain on the sale of a cable system. The Division’s mortgage capture rate (i.e., mortgage capture rate is the percentage of our homebuyers who obtained mortgage financing from us in areas where we offered services for the entire
year) decreased in the year ended November 30, 2003 due to the transitioning of the mortgage business related to the homebuilders we have acquired since the beginning of fiscal 2002 as well as increasing competitiveness in the mortgage market.

Corporate General and Administrative

Corporate general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total
revenues were 1.3% in 2003 compared to 1.2% in 2002 and 1.3% in 2001.

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

At
November 30, 2003, we had cash of $1.2 billion, compared to $731.2 million at the end of fiscal 2002. The increase in cash was primarily due to an increase in net earnings partially offset by an increase in inventories as we position ourselves for
future growth. In connection with the acquisition of The Newhall Land and Farming Company by an entity jointly-owned with LNR Property Corporation (“LNR”), we contributed approximately $200 million to fund a portion of the purchase price.
The majority of this commitment was funded subsequent to year-end.

Operating Cash Flow Activity

During 2003 and
2002, cash flows provided by operating activities amounted to $580.8 million and $204.6 million, respectively. During 2003, cash flows provided by operating activities consisted primarily of net earnings and a decrease in loans held for sale
offset in part by an increase in operating assets to support a significantly higher backlog and a higher number of active communities. In particular, inventories at November 30, 2003 had increased by $267.2 million since November 30, 2002, due
to an increase in backlog and the expansion of operations in our market areas. We finance our land acquisition and development activities, construction activities, financial services activities and general operating needs primarily with cash
generated from operations and public debt issuances, as well as cash borrowed under revolving credit facilities.

During 2002, cash flows provided by operating activities consisted primarily of net earnings offset in part by increased levels of operating assets to
support a significantly higher backlog and a higher number of active communities as we continued to grow. Cash flows provided by operating activities were lower in 2001 due to an increase in financial services loans held for sale of $211.1 million
and $57.1 million in receivables. We sell the loans we originate in the secondary mortgage market, generally within 45 days of the closing of the loans. The cash related to these loans and receivables was primarily received in December 2001 and was
used to pay down our warehouse lines of credit. Inventories increased $130.7 million in 2001 as we positioned ourselves for future growth.

Investing Cash Flow Activity

Cash flows used in investing activities totaled $118.2 million in the year ended November 30, 2003 compared to $365.7 million in 2002, and cash provided
by investing activities of $1.9 million in 2001. In 2003, we used $159.4 million of cash for acquisitions and $18.8 million for net additions to operating properties and equipment. This usage of cash was offset by $72.1 million of net distributions
by unconsolidated partnerships in which we invest. In 2002, we used $424.3 million of cash for acquisitions offset by $57.9 million of net distributions by unconsolidated partnerships. In 2001, $10.8 million was provided by the sale of substantially
all of our mortgage servicing rights and $5.6 million related to net distributions by unconsolidated partnerships in which we invest. This generation of cash was offset by $13.1 million of net additions to operating properties and equipment.

During 2003, we expanded our presence in California and South
Carolina, with our homebuilding acquisitions and we purchased a title company, which expanded our title and closing business into the Chicago market. In connection with these acquisitions and contingent consideration related to prior period
acquisitions, we paid $159.4 million, net of cash acquired. During 2002, we expanded our operations into the Carolinas and the Chicago, Baltimore and Central Valley, California homebuilding markets and strengthened our positions in


several of our existing markets through our homebuilding acquisitions. In connection with the 2002 acquisitions, total consideration, including debt of
acquired companies, totaled approximately $600 million. The results of operations of the acquired companies are included in our results of operations since their respective acquisition dates. We are always looking at the possibility of acquiring
homebuilders and other companies. We currently are engaged in discussions regarding possible transactions. However, we have no agreements or understandings regarding any transactions, and it is possible we will not enter into any significant
transactions in the near future.

In July 2003, we formed a
joint venture with LNR named NWHL Investment, LLC (“NWHL”), and NWHL entered into an agreement to acquire The Newhall Land and Farming Company (“Newhall”). Newhall’s primary business is developing two master-planned
communities in Los Angeles County, California. The transaction was completed on January 27, 2004. The total purchase consideration, after payments with regard to employee options, was approximately $1 billion. In connection with the transaction,
NWHL and another company jointly owned by us and LNR, obtained $600 million of bank financing, of which $400 million was used in connection with the acquisition of Newhall. The remainder of the bank financing will be available to finance operations
of Newhall and other property ownership and development companies that are jointly owned by us and LNR. We and LNR each contributed approximately $200 million to NWHL to fund a portion of the purchase price. Simultaneous with the closing of the
transaction, LNR purchased income-producing properties from Newhall for approximately $217 million and we agreed to purchase 687 homesites and obtained options to purchase 623 homesites from the venture.

Financing Cash Flow Activity

The following summarizes our senior notes and other debts payable:

Our ratio of net
homebuilding debt to total net capital was 9.7% at November 30, 2003, compared to 27.7% at November 30, 2002. The decrease in the ratio primarily resulted from cash generated by our operations during 2003. In addition to the use of capital in our
homebuilding and financial services activities, we will continue to actively evaluate various other uses of capital which fit into our homebuilding and financial services strategies and appear to meet our profitability and return on capital
requirements. This may include acquisitions of or investments in other entities, the payment of dividends or repurchases of our outstanding common stock or debt. These activities may be funded through any combination of our credit facilities, cash
generated from operations, sales of assets or the issuance of public debt, common stock or preferred stock.

Our average debt outstanding was $1.6 billion in both 2003 and 2002 and $1.5 billion in 2001. The average rates for interest incurred were 7.7% in 2003,
and 7.6% in both 2002 and 2001. The majority of our short-term financing needs are met with cash generated from operations and funds available under our senior secured credit facilities. In May 2003, we amended and restated our senior secured credit
facilities (the “Credit Facilities”) to provide us with up to $1.3 billion of financing. The Credit Facilities consist of a $712 million revolving credit facility maturing in May 2008, a $315 million 364-day revolving credit facility
maturing in May 2004 and a $300 million term loan B maturing in December 2008. We may elect to convert borrowings under the 364-day revolving credit facility to a term loan, which would mature in May 2008. The Credit Facilities are
collateralized by the stock of certain of our subsidiaries and are also guaranteed on a joint and several basis by substantially all of our subsidiaries, other than subsidiaries primarily engaged in mortgage and title reinsurance activities. At


November 30, 2003, $296.0 million was outstanding under the term loan B and no amounts were outstanding under the revolving credit facilities.

At November 30, 2003, we had letters of credit outstanding in the amount of
$627.9 million. The majority of these letters of credit are posted with regulatory bodies to guarantee our performance of certain development and construction activities or are posted in lieu of cash deposits on option contracts. Of our total
letters of credit, $341.4 million were collateralized against certain borrowings available under the Credit Facilities.

In February 2003, we issued $350 million of 5.95% senior notes due 2013 at a price of 98.287%. The senior notes are guaranteed on a joint and several
basis by substantially all of our subsidiaries, other than subsidiaries primarily engaged in mortgage and title reinsurance activities. Proceeds from the offering, after underwriting discount and expenses, were approximately $342 million. We used
$116 million of the proceeds to repay outstanding indebtedness and added the remainder to our general working capital. The senior notes were issued under our shelf registration statement.

At November 30, 2003, our Financial Services Division had warehouse lines of credit totaling $750 million, which included a
$145 million temporary increase that expired in December 2003, to fund its mortgage loan activities. Borrowings under the facilities were $714.4 million at November 30, 2003 and were collateralized by mortgage loans and receivables on loans sold not
yet funded with outstanding principal balances of $742.2 million. The warehouse lines of credit mature in May 2004 ($250 million) and in October 2005 ($500 million), at which time we expect both facilities to be renewed. Additionally, the
line of credit maturing in May 2004 includes an incremental $100 million commitment available at each fiscal quarter-end. At November 30, 2003, we had advances under a conduit funding agreement with a major financial institution amounting to $0.6
million. Borrowings under this agreement are collateralized by mortgage loans. We also had a $20 million revolving line of credit with a bank, collateralized by certain assets of the Division and stock of certain title subsidiaries. Borrowings under
the line of credit were $19.4 million at November 30, 2003.

We
have various interest rate swap agreements, which effectively convert variable interest rates to fixed interest rates on approximately $300 million of outstanding debt related to our homebuilding operations. The interest rate swaps mature at various
dates through 2007 and fix the LIBOR index (to which certain of our debt interest rates are tied) at an average interest rate of 6.8% at November 30, 2003. The net effect on our operating results is that interest on the variable-rate debt being
hedged is recorded based on fixed interest rates. Counterparties to these agreements are major financial institutions. At November 30, 2003, the fair value of the interest rate swaps, net of tax, was a $21.0 million liability. Our Financial Services
Division, in the normal course of business, uses derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. The Division enters into forward commitments and, to a lesser extent, option contracts to protect the value
of loans held for sale from increases in market interest rates. We do not anticipate that we will suffer credit losses from counterparty non-performance.

Changes in Capital Structure

On April 8, 2003, at our Annual Meeting of Stockholders, our stockholders approved an amendment to our certificate of incorporation that eliminated the
restrictions on transfer of our Class B common stock and eliminated a difference between the dividends on the common stock (renamed Class A common stock) and the Class B common stock. The only significant remaining difference between the Class A
common stock and the Class B common stock is that the Class A common stock entitles holders to one vote per share and the Class B common stock entitles holders to ten votes per share.

Because stockholders approved the change to the terms of the Class B common stock, we distributed to the holders of record
of our stock at the close of business on April 9, 2003, one share of Class B common stock for each ten shares of Class A common stock or Class B common stock held at that time. The distribution occurred on April 21, 2003 and our Class B common stock
became listed on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”). Our Class A common stock was already listed on the NYSE. Approximately 13 million shares of Class B common stock (adjusted for the January 2004 two-for-one stock split) were issued as
a result of the stock distribution.

Additionally, our
stockholders approved an amendment to our certificate of incorporation increasing the number of shares of common stock we are authorized to issue to 300 million shares of Class A common stock and 90 million shares of Class B common stock. However,
we have committed to Institutional Shareholder


Services that we will not issue, without a subsequent stockholder vote, shares that would increase the outstanding Class A common stock to more than 170
million shares or increase the outstanding Class B common stock to more than 45 million shares.

The principal purpose of the April 2003 10% Class B stock distribution and the amendments to our certificate of incorporation was to make a greater number
of authorized shares available for us to use in acquisitions, to sell in order to raise capital, to issue under stock option or other incentive programs or otherwise to issue.

In June 2003, we called our 3


/


% zero-coupon senior convertible debentures due 2018 (the “Debentures”) for redemption. At the option of the holders, the Debentures could have been converted into Class A common stock at any
time prior to the redemption date. Each $1,000 principal amount at maturity of Debentures was convertible into 27.4814 shares of Class A common stock (inclusive of the adjustment for the April 2003 10% Class B stock distribution and January 2004
two-for-one stock split), which equated to a redemption price of approximately $20.46 per share of Class A common stock. In 2003, substantially all of the Debentures were converted into approximately 13.6 million shares of Class A common stock
(adjusted for the January 2004 two-for-one stock split).

In December 2003, our Board of Directors approved a two-for-one stock split in the form of a 100% stock dividend of Class A and Class B common stock for stockholders of record on January 6, 2004. The additional shares were distributed on
January 20, 2004. There was no net effect on total stockholders’ equity. Share and per share data (except authorized shares, treasury shares and par value) for all periods presented have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split.

Our 2003 Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan (the
“2003 Plan”) provides for the granting of Class A and Class B stock options and stock appreciation rights and awards of restricted common stock to key officers, employees and directors. The exercise prices of stock options and stock
appreciation rights are not less than the market value of the common stock on the date of the grant. No options granted under the 2003 Plan may be exercisable until at least six months after the date of the grant. Thereafter, exercises are permitted
in installments determined when options are granted. Each stock option and stock appreciation right will expire on a date determined at the time of the grant, but not more than 10 years after the date of the grant. At November 30, 2003, the 2003
Plan had no shares of restricted stock outstanding.

In June
2001, our Board of Directors increased our previously authorized stock repurchase program to permit future purchases of up to 20 million shares of our outstanding Class A common stock (adjusted for our January 2004 two-for-one stock split). During
2003, we did not repurchase any of our outstanding common stock in the open market under these authorizations. In prior years under prior approvals, we had repurchased approximately 9.8 million shares (not adjusted for our January 2004 two-for-one
stock split) of our outstanding Class A common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $158.9 million, or $16 per share. In December 2003, we granted approximately 2.4 million stock options (adjusted for our January 2004 two-for-one
stock split) to our employees under the 2003 Plan and in January 2004, repurchased a similar amount of shares of our outstanding Class A common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $109.6 million, or $45.64 per share (adjusted for
our January 2004 two-for-one stock split).

In September 2003,
our Board of Directors voted to increase the rate at which dividends are paid with regard to our Class A and Class B common stock to $0.50 per share per year (payable quarterly) from $0.025 per share per year (both adjusted for our January 2004
two-for-one stock split). Additionally, our Board of Directors voted to retire our Class A common stock held in treasury.

In recent years, we have sold convertible and non-convertible debt into public markets, and at year end, we had effective Securities Act registration
statements under which we could sell to the public up to $620 million of debt securities, common stock, preferred stock or other securities and could issue up to $400 million of equity or debt securities in connection with acquisitions of companies,
businesses or assets.

Based on our current financial condition
and credit relationships, we believe that our operations and borrowing resources will provide for our current and long-term capital requirements at our anticipated levels of growth.


OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS, CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS

Investments in Unconsolidated Partnerships

We frequently enter into partnerships that acquire and develop land for our
homebuilding operations or for sale to third parties. Through partnerships, we reduce and share our risk and also reduce the amount invested in land, while increasing access to potential future homesites. The use of partnerships also, in some
instances, enables us to acquire land to which we could not otherwise obtain access, or could not obtain access on as favorable terms, without the participation of a strategic partner. Our partners in these partnerships generally are unrelated
homebuilders, land sellers or other real estate entities. While we view the use of unconsolidated partnerships as beneficial to our homebuilding activities, we do not view them as essential to those activities.

Most of the partnerships in which we invest are accounted for by the equity
method of accounting. At November 30, 2003, we had ownership interests in these unconsolidated partnerships that did not exceed 50%. In many instances, we are appointed as the day-to-day manager of the partnerships and receive fees for performing
this function. During 2003, 2002 and 2001, we received management fees and reimbursement of expenses totaling $39.0 million, $29.2 million and $26.1 million, respectively, from unconsolidated partnerships in which we had interests. We and/or our
partners sometimes obtain options or enter into other arrangements under which we can purchase portions of the land held by the unconsolidated partnerships. Option prices are generally negotiated prices that approximate fair value when we receive
the options. During 2003, 2002 and 2001, $460.5 million, $419.3 million and $232.6 million, respectively, of the unconsolidated partnerships’ revenues were from land sales to our homebuilding divisions.

At November 30, 2003, the unconsolidated partnerships in which we had
interests had total assets of $2.1 billion and total liabilities of $1.2 billion, which included $901.8 million of notes and mortgages payable. In some instances, we and/or our partners have provided varying levels of guarantees on certain
partnership debt. At November 30, 2003, we had recourse guarantees of $88.7 million and limited maintenance guarantees of $111.6 million of the unconsolidated partnerships’ debts. When we and/or our partners provide guarantees, the
partnership generally receives more favorable terms from its lenders. The limited maintenance guarantees only apply if a partnership defaults on its loan arrangements and the carrying value of the collateral (generally land and improvements) is less
than a specified percentage of the loan balance. If we are required to make a payment under a limited maintenance guarantee to bring the carrying value of the collateral above the specified percentage of the loan balance, the payment would
constitute a capital contribution or loan to the unconsolidated partnership and increase our share of any funds the unconsolidated partnership distributes.

During 2003, the unconsolidated partnerships in which we were a partner generated $1.3 billion of revenues and incurred $939.0 million of expenses,
resulting in net earnings of $375.7 million. Our share of those net earnings was $81.9 million. We do not include in our income our pro rata share of partnership earnings resulting from land sales to our homebuilding divisions. Instead, we account
for those earnings as a reduction of our cost of purchasing the land from the partnerships. This in effect defers recognition of our share of the partnership earnings until a home is delivered and title passes to a homebuyer.

In November 2003, we and LNR each contributed our 50% interests in certain of
our jointly-owned unconsolidated partnerships that had significant assets to a new limited liability company named LandSource Communities Development LLC (“LandSource”), in exchange for 50% interests in LandSource. In addition, in July
2003, we and LNR formed, and obtained 50% interests in, NWHL, which agreed to purchase, and in January 2004 completed the purchase, of The Newhall Land and Farming Company, for a total of approximately $1 billion. We and LNR each contributed
approximately $200 million to NWHL to fund a portion of the purchase price, and LandSource and NWHL jointly obtained $600 million of bank financing, of which $400 million was used in connection with the acquisition of Newhall (the remainder of
the acquisition price was paid with proceeds of a sale of income-producing properties from Newhall to LNR for $217 million). We are not obligated with regard to the borrowings by LandSource and NWHL, except that we and LNR have made limited
maintenance guarantees and have committed to complete any property development commitments in the event of default. The combined assets and liabilities of LandSource and NWHL at November 30, 2003 were $380.7 million and $122.3 million,
respectively. Our combined investment in LandSource and NWHL was $128.8 million at November 30, 2003.


Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments

The following summarizes our contractual obligations at November 30, 2003:

We are subject to the
usual obligations associated with entering into contracts (including option contracts) for the purchase, development and sale of real estate in the routine conduct of our business. Option contracts for the purchase of land enable us to defer
acquiring portions of properties owned by third parties and unconsolidated partnerships until we are ready to build homes on them. This reduces our financial risk associated with land holdings. At November 30, 2003, we had access to acquire
approximately 135,000 homesites through option contracts and unconsolidated partnerships. At November 30, 2003, we had $220.6 million of non-refundable option deposits and advanced costs on real estate related to certain of these homesites.

We are committed, under various letters of credit, to perform
certain development and construction activities and provide certain guarantees in the normal course of business. Outstanding letters of credit under these arrangements totaled $627.9 million at November 30, 2003. Additionally, we had outstanding
performance and surety bonds related to site improvements at various projects with estimated costs to complete of $1.0 billion. We do not believe that draws upon these bonds, if any, will have a material effect on our financial position, results of
operations or cash flows.

Our Financial Services
Division’s commitments regarding loans in process totaled approximately $2.6 billion at November 30, 2003. To minimize credit risk, we use the same credit policies in the approval of the commitments as are applied to our lending
activities. Since a portion of these commitments is expected to expire without being exercised by the borrowers, the total commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Loans in process for which interest rates were committed to
the borrowers totaled approximately $330.7 million as of November 30, 2003. Substantially all of these commitments were for periods of 60 days or less.

Our Financial Services Division uses mandatory mortgage-backed securities forward commitments (“MBS”) to hedge its interest rate exposure during
the period from when it makes an interest rate commitment to a loan applicant until the time at which the loan is sold to an investor. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk. Credit risk is managed
by entering into MBS only with investment banks with primary dealer status and with permanent investors meeting our credit standards. Our risk, in the event of default by the purchaser, is the difference between the contract price and current market
value. At November 30, 2003, we had open commitments amounting to $512.0 million to sell MBS with varying settlement dates through January 2004.

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS

During 2003, the homebuilding environment remained strong due to a positive supply/demand relationship as well as low interest rates. As a result of this
favorable environment, as well as our recent homebuilding acquisitions and growth in the number of our active communities, our new orders increased by 18% in 2003. Although the homebuilding business historically has been cyclical, it has not
undergone a down cycle in a number of years. This has led some people to assert that the prices of homes and the stocks of homebuilding companies are overvalued and will decline rapidly when the market for new homes begins to weaken. A decline in
prices of stocks of homebuilding companies would make it more expensive, and could make it more difficult, for us to raise funds through stock issuances.


MARKET AND FINANCING RISK

We finance our land acquisition and development activities, construction activities, financial services activities and
general operating needs primarily with cash generated from operations and public debt issuances, as well as cash borrowed under revolving credit facilities. We also buy land under option agreements, which enable us to acquire homesites when we are
ready to build homes on them. The financial risks of adverse market conditions associated with land holdings is managed by prudent underwriting of land purchases in areas we view as desirable growth markets, careful management of the land
development process, and limitation of risk by using partners to share the costs of purchasing and developing land, as well as obtaining access to land through option arrangements.

BACKLOG

Backlog represents the number of homes subject to pending sales contracts. Homes are sold using sales contracts which are generally accompanied by
sales deposits. Before entering into sales contracts, we generally prequalify our customers. In some instances, purchasers are permitted to cancel sales contracts if they are unable to close on the sale of their existing home or fail to qualify for
financing and under certain other circumstances. We experienced an average cancellation rate of 20% in 2003, compared to 21% and 22% in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Although cancellations can delay the sales of our homes, they have not had a
material impact on sales, operations or liquidity, because we closely monitor our prospective buyers’ ability to obtain financing and use the information to adjust construction start plans to match anticipated deliveries of homes. We do not
recognize revenue on homes covered by pending sales contracts until the sales are closed and title passes to the new homeowners.

SEASONALITY

We have historically experienced variability in results of operations from quarter to quarter due to the seasonal nature of the homebuilding
business. We typically experience the highest rate of orders for new homes in the first half of the calendar year, although the rate of orders for new homes is highly dependent on the number of active communities and the timing of new community
openings. Because new home deliveries trail orders for new homes by several months, we typically have a greater percentage of new home deliveries in the second half of our fiscal year compared to the first half. As a result, our earnings from sales
of homes are generally higher in the second half of the fiscal year.

INTEREST RATES AND CHANGING PRICES

Inflation
can have a long-term impact on us because increasing costs of land, materials and labor result in a need to increase the sales prices of homes. In addition, inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates, which can have a negative impact on
housing demand and the costs of financing land development activities and housing construction. Rising interest rates, as well as increased materials and labor costs, may reduce gross margins. In recent years, the increases in these costs have
followed the general rate of inflation and hence have not had a significant adverse impact on us. In addition, deflation can impact the value of real estate and make it difficult for us to recover our land costs. Therefore, either inflation or
deflation could adversely impact our future results of operations.

NEW
ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

Our discussion of new
accounting pronouncements and their impact on our financial statements is included in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

Our accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. As discussed in Note 1, the preparation of
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements
and accompanying notes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and such differences
may be material to the financial statements. Listed below are those policies and estimates that we believe are critical and require the use of significant judgment in their application.


Homebuilding Division

Revenue Recognition

Sales of homes are recognized when sales are closed and title passes to the new homeowners. Additionally, sales of other real estate (including sales of
land and operating properties) are recognized when a significant down payment is received, the earnings process is complete and collectibility of the receivable is assured. We do not include in our income our pro rata share of partnership earnings
resulting from land sales to our homebuilding divisions. Instead, we account for those earnings as a reduction of our cost of purchasing the land from the partnerships. This in effect defers recognition of our share of the partnership earnings until
a home is delivered and title passes to a homebuyer. We believe that the accounting policy related to revenue recognition is a “critical accounting policy” because of the significance of revenue recognition.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at cost, unless the inventory within a community is
determined to be impaired, in which case the impaired inventory is written down to fair value. Inventory costs include land, land development and home construction costs, real estate taxes and interest related to development and construction. Land,
land development, amenities and other costs are accumulated by specific area and allocated to homes within the respective areas.

We evaluate our inventory for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. Accounting standards require that if the sum of the undiscounted future
cash flows expected to result from an asset is less than the reported value of the asset, an asset impairment must be recognized in the consolidated financial statements. The amount of impairment to recognize is calculated by subtracting the fair
value of the asset from the carrying value of the asset.

We
believe that the accounting estimate related to inventory valuation and impairment is a “critical accounting estimate” because: (1) it is highly susceptible to change because of the assumptions about future sales and cost of sales and (2)
the impact of recognizing impairments on the assets reported in our consolidated balance sheets as well as our net earnings could be material. Our assumptions about future home sales prices and volumes require significant judgment because the
residential homebuilding industry is cyclical and is highly sensitive to changes in economic conditions. Although the homebuilding business historically has been cyclical, it has not undergone a down cycle in a number of years.

While no impairment existed as of November 30, 2003, there can be no
assurances that future economic or financial developments, including general interest rate increases or a slowdown in the economy, might not lead to impairment of inventory.

Warranty Costs

Although we subcontract virtually all segments of construction to others and our contracts call for the subcontractors to repair or replace any deficient
items related to their trade, we are primarily responsible to correct any deficiencies. Additionally, in some instances, we may be held responsible for the actions of or losses incurred by subcontractors. Warranty reserves are established at an
amount estimated to be adequate to cover potential costs for materials and labor with regard to warranty-type claims to be incurred subsequent to the delivery of a home. Reserves are determined based upon historical data and trends with respect to
similar product types and geographical areas. We believe the accounting estimate related to the reserve for warranty costs is a “critical accounting estimate” because the estimate requires a large degree of judgment.

At November 30, 2003, the reserve for warranty costs was $116.6 million.
While we believe that the reserve for warranty costs is adequate, there can be no assurances that historical data and trends will accurately predict our actual warranty costs. Additionally, there can be no assurances that future economic or
financial developments might not lead to a significant change in the reserve.

Investments in Unconsolidated Partnerships

We frequently enter into partnerships that acquire and develop land for sale to us in connection with our homebuilding operations or for sale to third parties. Our partners generally are unrelated homebuilders, land
sellers or other real estate entities.


Most of the partnerships through which we acquire and develop land are accounted for by the equity method
of accounting, because we are not the primary beneficiary for partnerships created after January 31, 2003, as defined under Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46 (“FIN 46”),

Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities

, and we have a significant, but less than controlling, interest in the partnerships. We record the investments in these partnerships in our consolidated balance sheets as “Investments in Unconsolidated Partnerships” and our
share of the partnerships’ earnings or losses in our consolidated statements of earnings as “Equity in Earnings from Unconsolidated Partnerships,” as described in Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Advances to these
partnerships are included in the investment amount.

Management
uses its judgment when determining the primary beneficiary of, or a controlling interest in, a partnership. Factors considered in determining whether we have significant influence or we have control include risk and reward sharing, experience and
financial condition of the other partners, voting rights, involvement in day-to-day capital and operating decisions and continuing involvement. Due to the judgment required in determining whether we are the primary beneficiary or have control or
only significant influence, the accounting policy relating to the use of the equity method of accounting is a “critical accounting policy.”

As of November 30, 2003, we believe that the equity method of accounting is appropriate for our investments in unconsolidated partnerships where we are
not the primary beneficiary and we do not have a controlling interest but rather share control with our partners. At November 30, 2003, the unconsolidated partnerships in which we had interests had total assets of $2.1 billion and total liabilities
of $1.2 billion.

Financial Services Division

Revenue Recognition

Loan origination revenues, net of direct origination costs, are recognized
when the related loans are sold. Gains and losses from the sale of loans and loan servicing rights are recognized when the loans are sold and delivered to an investor. Premiums from title insurance policies are recognized as revenue on the effective
date of the policy. Escrow fees are recognized at the time the related real estate transactions are completed, usually upon the close of escrow. In all circumstances, we do not recognize revenue until the earnings process is complete and
collectibility of the receivable is reasonably assured. We believe that the accounting policy related to revenue recognition is a “critical accounting policy” because of the significance of revenue recognition.

Allowances for Loss Reserves

We provide an allowance for loan losses when and if we determine that loans
or portions of them are not likely to be collected. In evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, we consider various factors such as past loan loss experience, regulatory examinations, present economic conditions and other factors
considered relevant by management. Anticipated changes in economic conditions, which may influence the level of the allowance, are considered in the evaluation by management when the likelihood of the changes can be reasonably determined. This
analysis is based on judgments and estimates and may change in response to economic developments or other conditions that may influence borrowers’ financial conditions or prospects. At November 30, 2003, the allowance for loan losses was $3.0
million. While we believe that the 2003 year-end allowance was adequate, particularly in view of the fact that we usually sell the loans on a non-recourse basis within 45 days after we originate them, there can be no assurances that future economic
or financial developments, including general interest rate increases or a slowdown in the economy, might not lead to increased provisions to the allowance or a higher incidence of loan charge-offs. At November 30, 2003, we also had an allowance for
title and escrow losses of $0.6 million related to certain assets. These allowances require management’s judgments and estimates. For these reasons, we believe that the accounting estimates related to the allowances for loss reserves are
“critical accounting estimates.”

Homebuilding and Financial
Services Divisions

Goodwill Valuation

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value
of net assets acquired. The process of determining goodwill requires judgment. Evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of our reporting units. Inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments
and


estimates, including the interpretation of current economic indicators and market valuations, and our strategic plans with regard to our operations. To the
extent additional information arises or our strategies change, it is possible that our conclusion regarding goodwill impairment could change, which could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations. For those reasons,
we believe that the accounting estimate related to goodwill impairment is a “critical accounting estimate.”

During fiscal 2002, we adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets

. In connection with the adoption of SFAS No. 142, we performed a test for impairment of goodwill as of December 1, 2001, which resulted in no impairment being identified. Goodwill is no longer subject to amortization. Instead, we review
goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. We performed our annual impairment test of goodwill as of September 30, 2003 and determined that goodwill
was not impaired.

At November 30, 2003, goodwill was $212.7
million (net of accumulated amortization of $18.0 million). While we believe that no impairment existed as of November 30, 2003, there can be no assurances that future economic or financial developments, including general interest rate increases or
a slowdown in the economy, might not lead to impairment of goodwill.

Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets

We record
income taxes under the asset and liability method, whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and
liabilities and their respective tax bases, and attributable to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which the temporary differences
are expected to be recovered or paid. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period when the changes are enacted.

We believe that the accounting estimate for the valuation of deferred tax assets is a “critical accounting
estimate” because judgment is required in assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. We base our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax
laws and rates and, in certain cases, business plans and other expectations about future outcomes. Changes in existing tax laws or rates could affect actual tax results and future business results may affect the amount of deferred tax liabilities or
the valuation of deferred tax assets over time. Our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents our best estimate of future events. Although it is possible there will be changes that are not anticipated in our current estimates, we believe
it is unlikely such changes would have a material period-to-period impact on our financial position or results of operations.

At November 30, 2003, our net deferred tax asset was $177.8 million. Based on our assessment, it appears more likely than not that the net deferred tax
asset will be realized through future taxable earnings.

Item
7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

We are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on our debt obligations, mortgage loans and mortgage loans held for sale. We utilize derivative instruments, including interest rate swaps, in
conjunction with our overall strategy to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates. We also utilize forward commitments and option contracts to mitigate the risk associated with our mortgage loan portfolio.

The tables on the following pages provide information at November 30, 2003
and 2002 about our significant derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For mortgage loans held for sale, mortgage loans and investments, senior notes, notes and other debts
payable, the tables present principal cash flows and related weighted average effective interest rates by expected maturity dates and estimated fair market values at November 30, 2003 and 2002. Weighted average variable interest rates are based on
the variable interest rates at November 30, 2003 and 2002. Our term loan B is presented as fixed rate debt because our interest rate swaps effectively changed the majority of the debt from a variable interest rate to a fixed interest rate. For
interest rate swaps, the tables present notional amounts and weighted average interest


rates by contractual maturity dates and estimated fair market values at November 30, 2003 and 2002. Notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual
cash flows to be exchanged under the contracts. Our limited-purpose finance subsidiaries have placed mortgages and other receivables as collateral for various long-term financings. These limited-purpose finance subsidiaries pay the principal of, and
interest on, these financings almost entirely from the cash flows generated by the related pledged collateral and are excluded from the following tables. Our trading investments, primarily mutual funds, do not have interest rate sensitivity, and
therefore, are also excluded from the following tables.

See
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 7 and Notes 1 and 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for a further discussion of these items and our strategy of mitigating
our interest rate risk.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Lennar Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Lennar
Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of November 30, 2003 and 2002 and the related consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended November 30, 2003.
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion,
the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of November 30, 2003 and 2002, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended November 30, 2003, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

LENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Lennar Corporation and all subsidiaries, partnerships and other entities (the
“Company”) in which the Company has a controlling interest and variable interest entities (“VIEs”) created after January 31, 2003 in which the Company is deemed the primary beneficiary (see Note 15). The Company’s
investments in unconsolidated partnerships in which a significant, but less than controlling, interest is held and VIEs created after January 31, 2003 in which the Company is not deemed to be the primary beneficiary, are accounted for by the equity
method. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.

Stock Split

In December 2003, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a two-for-one stock split in the form of a 100% stock dividend of Class A and Class B
common stock for stockholders of record on January 6, 2004. The additional shares were distributed on January 20, 2004. All share and per share amounts (except authorized shares, treasury shares and par value) have been retroactively adjusted to
reflect the stock split. There was no net effect on total stockholders’ equity as a result of the stock split.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Revenue Recognition

Revenues from sales of homes are recognized when the sales are closed and title passes to the new homeowners. Revenues from sales of other real estate
(including the sales of land and operating properties) are recognized when a significant down payment is received, the earnings process is complete and the collection of any remaining receivables is reasonably assured.

Cash

The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash
equivalents. Due to the short maturity period of the cash equivalents, the carrying amount of these instruments approximates their fair values. Cash as of November 30, 2003 and 2002 included $68.7 million and $56.2 million, respectively, of cash
primarily held in escrow for approximately three days and $45.2 million and $20.9 million, respectively, of restricted deposits.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at cost unless the inventory within a community is determined to be impaired, in which case the impaired inventory is written down
to fair value. Inventory costs include land, land development and home construction costs, real estate taxes and interest related to development and construction. The Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment based on the undiscounted
future cash flows of the assets. Write-downs of inventories deemed to be impaired are recorded as adjustments to the cost basis of the respective inventories. No impairment was recorded during the years ended November 30, 2003, 2002 or 2001.

Construction overhead and selling expenses are expensed as
incurred. Homes held for sale are classified as inventories until delivered. Land, land development, amenities and other costs are accumulated by specific area and allocated to homes within the respective areas.


LENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Interest and Real Estate Taxes

Interest and real estate taxes attributable to land and homes are capitalized as inventories while they are being actively
developed. Interest related to homebuilding and land, including interest costs relieved from inventories, is included in cost of homes sold and cost of land sold. Interest expense related to the financial services operations is included in its costs
and expenses.

During 2003, 2002 and 2001, interest incurred by
the Company’s homebuilding operations was $131.8 million, $130.6 million and $127.9 million, respectively, and interest expense primarily included in cost of homes sold and cost of land sold was $141.3 million, $145.6 million and $119.5
million, respectively.

Operating Properties and Equipment

Operating properties and equipment are recorded at cost
and are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The assets are depreciated over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. At the time operating properties and equipment are disposed of, the asset and related
accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is credited or charged to earnings. The estimated useful life for operating properties is 30 years, for leasehold improvements is 5 years and for equipment is 2 to
10 years.

Investment Securities

Investment securities are classified as available-for-sale unless they are
classified as trading or held-to-maturity. Securities classified as trading are carried at fair value and unrealized holding gains and losses are recorded in earnings. Securities classified as held-to-maturity are carried at amortized cost because
they are purchased with the intent and ability to hold to maturity. Available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value. Any unrealized holding gains or losses on available-for-sale securities would be reported in a separate component of
stockholders’ equity, net of tax effects, until realized.

At November 30, 2003 and 2002, investment securities classified as held-to-maturity totaled $28.0 million and $22.4 million, respectively, and were included in the assets of the Financial Services Division. At November 30, 2003, investment
securities classified as trading totaled $6.9 million and were included in other assets of the Homebuilding Division. The trading securities are comprised mainly of marketable equity mutual funds designated to approximate the Company’s
liabilities under its deferred compensation plan. There were no available-for-sale investment securities at November 30, 2003 or 2002.

Derivative Financial Instruments

Effective December 1, 2000, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities

, as amended. SFAS No. 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging activities by requiring that all derivatives be recognized in the balance sheet and measured
at fair value. Gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognized in earnings or recorded in other comprehensive income and recognized in the statement of earnings when the hedged item affects earnings, depending
on the purpose of the derivatives and whether they qualify for hedge accounting treatment.

The Company’s policy is to designate at a derivative’s inception the specific assets, liabilities, or future commitments being hedged and monitor the derivative to determine if it remains an effective hedge.
The effectiveness of a derivative as a hedge is based on high correlation between changes in its value and changes in the value of the underlying hedged item. The Company recognizes gains or losses for amounts received or paid when the underlying
transaction settles. The Company does not enter into or hold derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.

The Company has various interest rate swap agreements which effectively convert variable interest rates to fixed interest rates on approximately $300
million of outstanding debt related to its homebuilding operations. The swap agreements have been designated as cash flow hedges and, accordingly, are reflected at their fair value in


LENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

the consolidated balance sheets at November 30, 2003 and 2002. The related loss is deferred, net of tax, in stockholders’ equity as accumulated other
comprehensive loss (see Note 11). The Company accounts for its interest rate swaps using the shortcut method, as described in SFAS No. 133. Amounts to be received or paid as a result of the swap agreements are recognized as adjustments to interest
incurred on the related debt instruments. The Company believes that there will be no ineffectiveness related to the interest rate swaps and therefore no portion of the accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into future earnings.
The net effect on the Company’s operating results is that interest on the variable rate debt being hedged is recorded based on fixed interest rates.

The Financial Services Division, in the normal course of business, uses derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in
interest rates. The Division enters into forward commitments and, to a lesser extent, option contracts to protect the value of fixed rate locked loan commitments and loans held for sale from fluctuations in market interest rates. These derivative
financial instruments are designated as fair value hedges, and, accordingly, for all qualifying and highly effective fair value hedges, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and the loss or gain on the hedged asset relating to the risk
being hedged are recorded currently in earnings. The effect of the implementation of SFAS No. 133 on the Financial Services Division’s operating earnings was not significant.

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired and was amortized by the Company through fiscal 2001 on a
straight-line basis over periods ranging from 15 to 20 years. At November 30, 2003 and 2002, goodwill was $212.7 million and $189.4 million, respectively (net of accumulated amortization of $18.0 million at November 30, 2003 and 2002). During fiscal
2003, the Company’s goodwill increased $30.3 million due to current year acquisitions and payment of contingent consideration related to prior year acquisitions, partially offset by the reduction of the Company’s net deferred tax asset
valuation allowance. Because the asset was established in connection with an acquisition, the reduction of the valuation allowance resulted in a decrease to goodwill. Goodwill is included in other assets of the Homebuilding Division ($169.2 million
and $155.4 million at November 30, 2003 and 2002, respectively) and the assets of the Financial Services Division ($43.5 million and $34.0 million at November 30, 2003 and 2002, respectively) in the consolidated balance sheets. Historically through
fiscal 2001, in the event that facts and circumstances had indicated that the carrying value of goodwill might be impaired, an evaluation of recoverability would have been performed. If an evaluation had been required, the estimated future
undiscounted cash flows associated with the goodwill would have been compared to the carrying amount to determine if a write-down to fair value based on discounted cash flows was required. No impairment was recorded during the years ended November
30, 2003, 2002 or 2001.

The Company adopted SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

on December 1, 2001. SFAS No. 142 no longer requires or permits the amortization of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. Instead, these assets must be reviewed annually (or more frequently
under certain conditions) for impairment in accordance with this statement. This impairment test uses a fair value approach rather than the undiscounted cash flows approach previously required by SFAS No. 121,

Accounting for the Impairment of
Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of

. No impairment charges were recognized from the adoption of SFAS No. 142. The Company performed its annual impairment test of goodwill as of September 30, 2003 and determined that
goodwill was not impaired. As of November 30, 2003 and 2002, there were no material identifiable intangible assets, other than goodwill. Net earnings and earnings per share for fiscal 2001 (adjusted for the Company’s April 2003 10% Class B
stock distribution and January 2004 two-for-one stock split) adjusted to exclude goodwill amortization, net of taxes, is as follows:


LENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Income Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for in accordance with SFAS
No. 109,

Accounting for Income Taxes

. Under SFAS No. 109, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting carrying values and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and are measured by using
enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to reverse.

Warranty Costs

Warranty and similar reserves for homes are established at an amount estimated to be adequate to cover potential costs for materials and labor with regard
to warranty-type claims to be incurred subsequent to the delivery of a home. Reserves are determined based on historical data and trends with respect to similar product types and geographical areas. Warranty reserves are included in accounts payable
and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table sets forth the activity in the Company’s warranty reserve for the year ended November 30, 2003:

Self-Insurance

Certain insurable risks such as general liability,
medical and workers’ compensation are self-insured by the Company up to certain limits. Undiscounted accruals for claims under the Company’s self-insurance program are based on claims filed and estimates for claims incurred but not
reported.

Advertising Costs

The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred. Advertising costs were
$54.9 million, $43.9 million and $43.6 million for the years ended November 30, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company grants stock options to certain employees for fixed numbers of shares with, in each instance, an exercise price not less than the fair value
of the shares at the date of the grant. The Company accounts for the


LENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

stock option grants in accordance with Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.

No
compensation expense is recognized because all stock options granted have exercise prices not less than the market value of the Company’s stock on the date of the grant. The Company also grants restricted stock, which is valued based on the
market price of the common stock on the date of grant. Unearned compensation arising from the restricted stock grants is amortized to expense using the straight-line method over the period of the restrictions. Unearned restricted stock is shown as a
reduction of stockholders’ equity in the consolidated balance sheets.

The following table illustrates the effect on net earnings and earnings per share if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

as
amended by SFAS No. 148,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation—Transition and Disclosure

, which was effective for the Company in fiscal 2003, to stock-based employee compensation:

The fair value of
these options was determined at the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The significant weighted average assumptions for the years ended November 30, 2003, 2002 and 2001 were as follows:

Earnings per Share

Earnings per share is accounted for in accordance with
SFAS No. 128,

Earnings per Share

, which requires a dual presentation of basic and diluted earnings per share on the face of the consolidated statement of earnings. Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing earnings attributable to
common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or
converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the earnings of the Company.

Financial Services

Loan origination revenues, net of direct origination costs, are recognized when the related loans are sold. Gains and losses from the sale of loans and
loan servicing rights are recognized when the loans are sold and


LENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

delivered to an investor. Premiums from title insurance policies are recognized as revenue on the effective date of the policy. Escrow fees are recognized at
the time the related real estate transactions are completed, usually upon the close of escrow.

Mortgage loans held for sale by the Financial Services Division that are designated as hedged assets are carried at market value, as the effect of changes in fair value are reflected in the carrying amount of the
loans and in earnings. Premiums and discounts recorded on these loans are presented as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the loans and are not amortized.

When the Division sells loans in the secondary market, a gain or loss is recognized to the extent that the sales proceeds exceed, or are less than, the
book value of the loans. Loan origination fees, net of direct origination costs, are deferred and recognized as a component of the gain or loss when loans are sold.

Mortgage loans for which the Financial Services Division has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity consist of
mortgage loans carried at cost, net of unamortized discounts. Discounts are amortized over the estimated lives of the loans using the interest method.

The Division also provides allowances for loan losses when and if management determines that loans or portions thereof are uncollectible. The provision
recorded and the adequacy of the related allowance is determined by management’s continuing evaluation of the loan portfolio in light of past loan loss experience, regulatory examinations, present economic conditions and other factors
considered relevant by management. Anticipated changes in economic factors which may influence the level of the allowance are considered in the evaluation by management when the likelihood of the changes can be reasonably determined. While
management uses the best information available to make such evaluations, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary as a result of future economic and other conditions that may be beyond management’s control.

The Division provides an allowance for estimated title and escrow losses
based upon management’s evaluation of claims presented and estimates for any incurred but not reported claims. The allowance is established at a level that management estimates to be sufficient to satisfy those claims where a loss is determined
to be probable and the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. The allowance for title and escrow losses for both known and incurred but not reported claims is considered by management to be adequate for such purposes.

New Accounting Pronouncements

In October 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
issued SFAS No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

. SFAS No. 144 provides accounting guidance for financial accounting and reporting for impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. SFAS No. 144 supersedes
SFAS No. 121. The implementation of SFAS No. 144 did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149,

Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities

. This statement amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts (collectively referred to as derivatives) and for hedging
activities under SFAS No. 133. This statement was effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003. The implementation of SFAS No. 149 did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition, results of
operations or cash flows.

In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS
No. 150,

Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity

. This statement establishes standards for the classification and measurement of certain financial instruments with characteristics of
both liabilities and equity. Certain provisions of this statement were effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003 and otherwise was effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June 15,
2003. In October 2003, the FASB deferred indefinitely certain provisions of this statement pertaining to non-controlling interests


LENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

in limited life entities. The Company does not believe that the implementation of SFAS No. 150 had, or will have, a material impact on the Company’s
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In
November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45 (“FIN 45”),

Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others

. In accordance with the provisions of
FIN 45, the Company adopted the initial recognition and measurement provisions on a prospective basis with regard to guarantees issued after December 31, 2002. The implementation of FIN 45 did not have a material impact on the Company’s
financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

In
January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46 (“FIN 46”),

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities

, as further clarified and amended by the FASB’s issuance of a revision to FIN 46 in December 2003. FIN 46 requires
the consolidation of entities in which an enterprise absorbs a majority of the entity’s expected losses, receives a majority of the entity’s expected residual returns, or both, as a result of ownership, contractual or other financial
interests in the entity. Prior to the issuance of FIN 46, entities were generally consolidated by an enterprise when it had a controlling financial interest through ownership of a majority voting interest in the entity. FIN 46 applied immediately to
variable interests created after January 31, 2003, and with respect to variable interests created before February 1, 2003, FIN 46 will apply in the Company’s second quarter ending May 31, 2004, as deferred by the FASB in December 2003. Although
the Company does not believe the full adoption of FIN 46 will have a material impact on net earnings, the Company cannot make any definitive determination until it completes its evaluation (see Note 15).

In December 2003, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”)
expressed their view on accounting for loan commitments that relate to the origination of mortgage loans that will be held for resale. It is the SEC’s view that loan commitments are written options that should be recorded at their fair value,
which in all cases should be a liability until either expiration or exercise. The Company estimates the value of these loan commitments as the difference between the current value of similar loans and the price at which the Company has committed to
originate the loans. Under the Company’s current method of accounting for these loan commitments, the Company recognizes both derivative assets and liabilities. The SEC’s view, which is to be applied prospectively, is effective for
commitments entered into in the first reporting period beginning after March 15, 2004. Management is currently evaluating the adoption of the SEC’s view and has not made a definitive determination as to its impact.

Reclassifications

Certain prior year amounts in the consolidated financial statements have
been reclassified to conform with the 2003 presentation. These reclassifications had no impact on reported net earnings. In particular, homebuilding results reflect reclassifications that have been made to interest expense (now included in cost of
homes sold and cost of land sold), equity in earnings from unconsolidated partnerships and management fees and other income, net.

2.    Acquisitions

During 2003, the Company expanded its presence in California and South Carolina through its homebuilding acquisitions, and purchased a title company,
which expanded the Company’s title and closing business into the Chicago market. In connection with these acquisitions and contingent consideration related to prior period acquisitions, the Company paid $159.4 million, net of cash acquired. The
results of operations of the companies acquired by the Company are included in the Company’s results of operations since their respective acquisition dates. The pro forma effect of these acquisitions on the results of operations is not
presented as the effect is not considered material. Total goodwill associated with these acquisitions and contingent consideration relating to prior year acquisitions was $30.3 million.

During 2002, the Company expanded its operations into the Carolinas and the Chicago, Baltimore and Central Valley,
California homebuilding markets and strengthened its positions in several of its existing markets


LENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

with the Company’s homebuilding acquisitions. In connection with these acquisitions, total consideration, including debt of acquired companies, totaled
approximately $600 million. The results of operations of the homebuilders acquired by the Company are included in the Company’s results of operations since their respective acquisition dates. The pro forma effect of these acquisitions on the
results of operations is not presented as the effect is not considered material. Total goodwill associated with these acquisitions was $74.7 million.

3.    Operating and Reporting Segments

The Company has two operating and reporting segments: Homebuilding and Financial Services. The Company’s reportable segments are strategic business
units that offer different products and services. The accounting policies of the segments are described in the summary of significant accounting policies in Note 1. Segment amounts include all elimination adjustments made in consolidation.

Homebuilding

Homebuilding operations primarily include the sale and construction of
single-family attached and detached homes, as well as the purchase, development and sale of residential land directly and through the Company’s unconsolidated partnerships.

Financial Services

The Financial Services Division provides mortgage financing, title insurance, closing services and insurance agency services for both buyers of the
Company’s homes and others. It sells the loans it originates in the secondary mortgage market. The Financial Services Division also provides high-speed Internet access, cable television and alarm installation and monitoring services to
residents of the Company’s communities and others.

Financial information relating to the Company’s reportable segments is as follows:

5.    Investments in Unconsolidated Partnerships

Summarized condensed financial information on a combined 100% basis related to unconsolidated partnerships and other similar entities (collectively the “Partnerships”) in which the Company invests that are
accounted for by the equity method was as follows:


LENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

At November 30, 2003,
the Company’s equity interest in these Partnerships did not exceed 50%. The Company’s partners generally are unrelated homebuilders, land sellers or other real estate entities. The Partnerships follow accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. The Company shares in the profits and losses of these Partnerships generally in accordance with its ownership interests. In many instances, the Company is appointed as the day-to-day manager of the
Partnerships and receives fees for performing this function. During 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company received management fees and reimbursement of expenses from the Partnerships totaling $39.0 million, $29.2 million and $26.1 million, respectively.
In determining its share of the Partnerships’ net earnings, the Company does not include in its income its pro rata share of partnership earnings resulting from land sales to its homebuilding divisions. Instead, the Company accounts for those
earnings as a reduction of the cost of purchasing the land from the partnerships. This in effect defers recognition of the Company’s share of the partnership earnings relating to these sales until a home is delivered and title passes to a
homebuyer.

The Company and/or its partners sometimes obtain
options or enter into other arrangements under which the Company can purchase portions of the land held by the Partnerships. Option prices are generally negotiated prices that approximate fair value when the options are purchased. During 2003, 2002
and 2001, $460.5 million, $419.3 million and $232.6 million, respectively, of the Partnerships’ revenues were from land sales to the Company.

In some instances, the Company and/or its partners have provided varying levels of guarantees of debt of unconsolidated partnerships. At November 30,
2003, the Company had recourse guarantees of $88.7 million and limited maintenance guarantees of $111.6 million of debt of unconsolidated partnerships. When the Company and/or its partners provide a guarantee, the partnership generally receives more
favorable terms from its lenders than would otherwise be available to it. The limited maintenance guarantees only apply if a partnership defaults on its loan arrangements and the carrying value of the collateral (generally land and improvements) is
less than a specified percentage of the loan balance. If the Company is required to make a payment under a limited maintenance guarantee to bring the carrying value of the collateral above the specified percentage of the loan balance, the payment
would constitute a capital contribution or loan to the unconsolidated partnership and increase the Company’s share of any funds the unconsolidated partnership distributes. There were no assets held as collateral that, upon the occurrence of any
triggering event or condition under a guarantee, the Company could obtain and liquidate to recover all or a portion of the amounts paid under a guarantee.

In November 2003, the Company and LNR each contributed its 50% interests in certain of its jointly-owned unconsolidated partnerships that had significant
assets to a new limited liability company named LandSource Communities Development LLC (“LandSource”), in exchange for 50% interests in LandSource. In addition, in July 2003, the Company and LNR formed, and obtained 50% interests in, NWHL
Investment, LLC (“NWHL”), which agreed to purchase, and in January 2004 completed the purchase, of The Newhall Land and Farming Company (“Newhall”) for a total of approximately $1 billion. Newhall’s primary business is
developing two master-planned communities in Los Angeles County, California. The Company and LNR each contributed approximately $200 million to NWHL, and LandSource and NWHL jointly obtained $600 million of bank financing, of which $400 million was
used in connection with the acquisition of Newhall (the remainder of the acquisition price was paid with proceeds of a sale of income-producing properties from Newhall to LNR for $217 million at the closing of the transaction). The Company
agreed to purchase 687 homesites and obtained options to purchase 623 homesites from the venture. The Company is not obligated with regard to the borrowings by LandSource and NWHL, except that the Company and LNR have made limited maintenance
guarantees and


LENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

have committed to complete any property development commitments in the event of default. The combined assets and liabilities of LandSource and NWHL at
November 30, 2003 were $380.7 million and $122.3 million, respectively. The Company’s combined investment in LandSource and NWHL was $128.8 million at November 30, 2003.

6.    Operating Properties and Equipment

Operating properties
and equipment are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets.

7.    Senior Notes and Other Debts Payable

In May 2003, the
Company amended and restated its senior secured credit facilities (the “Credit Facilities”) to provide the Company with up to $1.3 billion of financing. The Credit Facilities consist of a $712 million revolving credit facility maturing in
May 2008, a $315 million 364-day revolving credit facility maturing in May 2004 and a $300 million term loan B maturing in December 2008. The Company may elect to convert borrowings under the 364-day revolving credit facility to a term loan, which
would mature in May 2008. The Credit Facilities are collateralized by the stock of certain of the Company’s subsidiaries and are also guaranteed on a joint and several basis by substantially all of the Company’s subsidiaries, other than
subsidiaries primarily engaged in mortgage and title reinsurance activities. At November 30, 2003, $296.0 million was outstanding under the term loan B and no amounts were outstanding under the revolving credit facilities. Interest rates are
LIBOR-based and the margins are set by a pricing grid with thresholds that adjust based on changes in the Company’s leverage ratio and the Credit Facilities’ credit rating.

At November 30, 2003, the Company had letters of credit outstanding in the amount of $627.9 million. The majority of these
letters of credit are posted with regulatory bodies to guarantee the Company’s performance of certain development and construction activities or are posted in lieu of cash deposits on option contracts. Of the Company’s total letters of
credit, $341.4 million were collateralized against certain borrowings available under the Credit Facilities.


LENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

In February 2003, the Company issued $350 million of 5.95% senior notes due 2013 at a price of
98.287%. Proceeds from the offering, after underwriting discount and expenses, were approximately $342 million. The Company used $116 million of the proceeds to repay outstanding indebtedness and added the remainder to its general working capital.
The senior notes are guaranteed on a joint and several basis by substantially all of the Company’s subsidiaries, other than subsidiaries primarily engaged in mortgage and title reinsurance activities. At November 30, 2003, the carrying value of
the senior notes was $344.3 million.

In June 2003, the Company
called its 3


/


% zero-coupon senior convertible debentures due 2018 (the “Debentures”) for redemption.
At the option of the holders, the Debentures could have been converted into Class A common stock at any time prior to the redemption date. Each $1,000 principal amount at maturity of Debentures was convertible into 27.4814 shares of Class A common
stock (inclusive of the adjustment for the April 2003 10% Class B stock distribution and January 2004 two-for-one stock split), which equated to a redemption price of approximately $20.46 per share of Class A common stock. In 2003, substantially all
of the Debentures were converted into approximately 13.6 million shares of Class A common stock (adjusted for the January 2004 two-for-one stock split).

As a result of the acquisition of The Fortress Group, Inc. (“Fortress”) in 2002, the Company assumed Fortress’s publicly held notes
totaling $33.8 million. During fiscal 2003, the Company repaid the balance of the outstanding senior notes.

In the second quarter of 2001, the Company issued, for gross proceeds of approximately $230 million, zero-coupon convertible senior subordinated notes due
2021 (“Notes”) with a face amount at maturity of approximately $633 million. The Notes were issued at a price of $363.46 per $1,000 face amount at maturity, which equates to a yield to maturity over the life of the Notes of 5.125%.
Proceeds from the issuance, after underwriting discount, were approximately $224 million. The Notes are guaranteed on a joint and several basis by substantially all of the Company’s subsidiaries, other than subsidiaries engaged in mortgage and
title reinsurance activities. The Company used the proceeds to repay amounts outstanding under its revolving credit facilities and added the balance of the net proceeds to working capital. The indenture relating to the Notes provides that the Notes
are convertible into the Company’s Class A common stock during limited periods after the market price of the Company’s Class A common stock exceeds 110% of the accreted conversion price at the rate of approximately 14.2 Class A common
shares per $1,000 face amount of Notes at maturity, which would total approximately 9.0 million shares (adjusted for the April 2003 10% Class B stock distribution and January 2004 two-for-one stock split). For this purpose, the “market
price” is the average closing price of the Company’s Class A common stock over the last twenty trading days of a fiscal quarter.

Other events that would cause the Notes to be convertible are: a) a call of the Notes for redemption; b) the initial credit ratings assigned to the Notes
by any two of Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services and Fitch Ratings are reduced by two rating levels; c) a distribution to all holders of the Company’s Class A common stock of options expiring
within 60 days entitling the holders to purchase common stock for less than its quoted price; or d) a distribution to all holders of the Company’s Class A common stock of common stock, assets, debt, securities or rights to purchase securities
with a per share value exceeding 15% of the closing price of the Class A common stock on the day preceding the declaration date for the distribution. The conversion ratio equates to an initial conversion price of $25.64 per share when the
Company’s stock price was $19.42 per share (adjusted for the April 2003 10% Class B stock distribution and January 2004 two-for-one stock split).

At November 30, 2003, the Notes were convertible because the average closing price of the Company’s Class A common stock over the last twenty trading
days of the fourth quarter of 2003 (adjusted for the April 2003 10% Class B stock distribution and January 2004 two-for-one stock split) exceeded 110% ($32.28 per share at November 30, 2003) of the accreted conversion price. These shares were not
included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share for the years ended November 30, 2002 and 2001 because the contingencies discussed above were not met.

Holders have the option to require the Company to repurchase the Notes on any of the fifth, tenth, or fifteenth anniversaries of the issue date for the
initial issue price plus accrued yield to the purchase date. The


LENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Company has the option to satisfy the repurchases with any combination of cash and/or shares of the Company’s common stock. The Company will have the
option to redeem the Notes, in cash, at any time after the fifth anniversary for the initial issue price plus accrued yield to redemption. The Company will pay contingent interest on the Notes during specified six-month periods beginning on April 4,
2006 if the market price of the Notes exceeds specified levels. At November 30, 2003, the carrying value of outstanding Notes, net of unamortized original issue discount, was $261.0 million.

At November 30, 2003, the Company had mortgage notes on land and other debt
bearing interest at fixed interest rates ranging from 2.9% to 25.0% with an average rate of 8.8%. The notes are due through 2009 and are collateralized by land. At November 30, 2003, the carrying value of the mortgage notes on land and other debt
was $73.0 million.

The minimum aggregate principal maturities
of senior notes and other debts payable during the five years subsequent to November 30, 2003 are as follows: 2004—$21.5 million; 2005—$45.7 million; 2006—$18.4 million; 2007—$4.0 million and 2008—$4.0 million. The
remaining principal obligations are due subsequent to November 30, 2008. The Company’s debt arrangements contain certain financial covenants with which the Company was in compliance at November 30, 2003.

8.    Financial Services

The assets and liabilities related to the Company’s financial services
operations were as follows:

At November 30, 2003,
the Financial Services Division had warehouse lines of credit totaling $750 million, which included a $145 million temporary increase that expired in December 2003, to fund its mortgage loan activities. Borrowings under the facilities were $714.4
million and $489.7 million at November 30, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and were collateralized by mortgage loans and receivables on loans sold not yet funded with outstanding principal balances of $742.2 million and $523.8 million, respectively.
There are several interest rate pricing options which fluctuate with market rates. The effective interest rate on the facilities at November 30, 2003 and 2002 was 1.7% and 2.3%, respectively. The warehouse lines of credit mature in May 2004
($250 million) and in October 2005 ($500 million), at which time the Division expects both facilities to be renewed. Additionally, the line of credit maturing in May 2004 includes an incremental $100 million commitment available at each fiscal
quarter-end. At November 30, 2003 and 2002, the Division had advances under a conduit funding agreement with a major financial institution amounting to $0.6 million and $343.7 million, respectively. Borrowings under this agreement are
collateralized by mortgage loans and had an


LENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

effective interest rate of 1.9% and 2.3% at November 30, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The Division also had a $20 million revolving line of credit with a
bank, collateralized by certain assets of the Division and stock of certain title subsidiaries. Borrowings under the line of credit were $19.4 million and $20.0 million at November 30, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and had an effective interest
rate of 2.1% and 2.4% at November 30, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

The limited-purpose finance subsidiaries of the Financial Services Division have placed mortgages and other receivables as collateral for various long-term financings. These limited-purpose finance subsidiaries pay the principal of, and
interest on, these financings almost entirely from the cash flows generated by the related pledged collateral, which includes a combination of mortgage notes, mortgage-backed securities and funds held by a trustee. At November 30, 2003 and 2002, the
balances outstanding for the bonds and notes payable were $5.8 million and $9.2 million, respectively. The borrowings mature in 2015 through 2018 and carry interest rates ranging from 8.8% to 11.7%. The annual principal repayments are dependent upon
collections on the underlying mortgages, including prepayments, and therefore cannot be reasonably determined.

The minimum aggregate principal maturities of the Financial Services Division’s notes and other debts payable (including limited-purpose finance
subsidiaries) during the five years subsequent to November 30, 2003 are as follows: 2004—$734.5 million; 2005—$0.1 million and 2006—$0.1 million. The remaining principal obligations are due subsequent to November 30, 2008.

9.    Income Taxes

The provision (benefit) for income taxes consisted of the following:


LENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying
amounts of the assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The tax effects of significant temporary differences that give rise to the net deferred tax asset are as follows:

The Homebuilding
Division’s net deferred tax asset amounting to $166.7 million and $114.4 million at November 30, 2003 and 2002, respectively, is included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets.

At November 30, 2003 and 2002, the Financial Services Division had a net
deferred tax asset of $11.1 million and $7.8 million, respectively, which is included in the assets of the Financial Services Division.

SFAS No. 109 requires the reduction of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than
not that a portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Based on management’s assessment, it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset will be realized through future taxable earnings. During fiscal 2003,
restrictions associated with the utilization of the capital loss carryforwards and acquisition adjustments lapsed, resulting in the reduction of the valuation allowance. Because the asset was established in connection with an acquisition, the
reduction of the valuation allowance resulted in a decrease to goodwill.

A reconciliation of the statutory rate and the effective tax rate follows:

10.    Earnings Per Share

Basic and diluted earnings per share for the years ended November 30, 2003, 2002 and 2001 were calculated as follows:

Basic and diluted
earnings per share amounts and weighted average shares outstanding have been adjusted to reflect the effect of the April 2003 10% Class B stock distribution and the January 2004 two-for-one stock split.

In 2001, the Company issued zero-coupon convertible senior subordinated notes
due 2021. The indenture relating to the notes provides that the notes are convertible into the Company’s Class A common stock during limited periods after the market price of the Company’s Class A common stock exceeds 110% of the accreted
conversion price at the rate of approximately 14.2 Class A common shares per $1,000 face amount of notes at maturity, which would total approximately 9.0 million shares (adjusted for the April 2003 10% Class B stock distribution and January 2004
two-for-one stock split). For this purpose, the “market price” is the average closing price of the Company’s Class A common stock over the last twenty trading days of a fiscal quarter.

Other events that would cause the notes to be convertible are: a) a call of
the notes for redemption; b) the initial credit ratings assigned to the notes by any two of Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services and Fitch Ratings are reduced by two rating levels; c) a distribution to
all holders of the Company’s Class A common stock of options expiring within 60 days entitling the holders to purchase common stock for less than its quoted price; or d) a distribution to all holders of the Company’s Class A common stock
of common stock, assets, debt, securities or rights to purchase securities with a per share value exceeding 15% of the closing price of the Class A common stock on the day preceding the declaration date for the distribution.

The calculation of diluted earnings per share included 4.5 million shares
(adjusted for the April 2003 10% Class B stock distribution and January 2004 two-for-one stock split) for the year ended November 30, 2003 because the average closing price of the Company’s Class A common stock over the last twenty trading days
of both the third and fourth quarters of 2003 exceeded 110% of the accreted conversion price. These shares were not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share for the years ended November 30, 2002 and 2001 because the contingencies
discussed above were not met.


LENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

11.    Comprehensive Income

Comprehensive income represents changes in stockholders’ equity from non-owner sources. For the years ended November
30, 2003, 2002 and 2001, the change in the fair value of interest rate swaps was the only adjustment to the Company’s net earnings in deriving comprehensive income. In accordance with the transition provisions of SFAS No. 133, on December 1,
2000, the Company recorded a cumulative-effect type adjustment of $3.5 million (net of tax benefit of $2.2 million) in accounts payable and other liabilities and accumulated other comprehensive loss to recognize the fair value of interest rate
swaps. Subsequent to the Company’s adoption of SFAS No. 133 through November 30, 2001, the liability and accumulated other comprehensive loss increased $15.8 million (net of tax benefit of $9.9 million) to $19.3 million. For the years ended
November 30, 2003 and 2002, the liability and accumulated other comprehensive loss decreased $3.5 million (net of tax of $2.1 million) and increased $5.2 million (net of tax benefit of $2.7 million), respectively. Comprehensive income was
$754.9 million, $540.0 million and $398.6 million for the years ended November 30, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

12.    Capital Stock

Preferred Stock

The Company is authorized to issue 500,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value of $10 per share and 100 million shares of participating preferred
stock with a par value of $0.10 per share. No shares of preferred stock or participating preferred stock have been issued as of November 30, 2003.

Common Stock

On April 8, 2003, at the Company’s Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the Company’s stockholders approved an amendment to the Company’s
certificate of incorporation that eliminated the restrictions on transfer of the Company’s Class B common stock and eliminated a difference between the dividends on the common stock (renamed Class A common stock) and the Class B common stock.
The only significant remaining difference between the Class A common stock and the Class B common stock is that the Class A common stock entitles holders to one vote per share and the Class B common stock entitles holders to ten votes per share.

Because stockholders approved the change to the terms of the
Class B common stock, the Company distributed to the holders of record of its stock at the close of business on April 9, 2003, one share of Class B common stock for each ten shares of Class A common stock or Class B common stock held at that time.
The distribution occurred on April 21, 2003 and the Company’s Class B common stock became listed on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”). The Company’s Class A common stock was already listed on the NYSE. Approximately 13 million
shares of Class B common stock (adjusted for the January 2004 two-for-one stock split) were issued as a result of the stock distribution.

Additionally, the Company’s stockholders approved an amendment to the certificate of incorporation increasing the number of shares of common stock
the Company is authorized to issue to 300 million shares of Class A common stock and 90 million shares of Class B common stock. However, the Company has committed to Institutional Shareholder Services that it will not issue, without a subsequent
stockholder vote, shares that would increase the outstanding Class A common stock to more than 170 million shares or increase the outstanding Class B common stock to more than 45 million shares.

In September 2003, the Company’s Board of Directors voted to increase
the rate at which dividends are paid with regard to the Company’s Class A and Class B common stock to $0.50 per share per year (payable quarterly) from $0.025 per share per year (adjusted for the January 2004 two-for-one stock split). During
2003, Class A and Class B common stockholders received annual dividends of $0.14 per share. During 2002 and 2001, Class A common stockholders received quarterly dividends of $0.00625 per share and the Class B common stockholders received quarterly
dividends of $0.005625 per share.


LENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

As of November 30, 2003, Mr. Stuart Miller, the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer,
directly owned or controlled as the director and officer of family-owned entities, approximately 22 million shares (adjusted for the January 2004 two-for-one stock split) of Class A and Class B common stock, which represented approximately 48%
voting power of the Company’s stock.

In December 2003,
the Company’s Board of Directors approved a two-for-one stock split in the form of a 100% stock dividend of Class A and Class B common stock for stockholders of record on January 6, 2004. The additional shares were distributed on January 20,
2004. All share and per share amounts (except authorized shares, treasury shares and par value) have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the split. There was no net effect on total stockholders’ equity as a result of the stock split.

In June 2001, the Company’s Board of Directors increased
the previously authorized stock repurchase program to permit future purchases of up to 20 million shares (adjusted for the January 2004 two-for-one stock split) of the Company’s outstanding Class A common stock. During 2003, 2002 and 2001, the
Company did not repurchase any of its outstanding Class A or Class B common stock in the open market under these authorizations. In prior years under prior approvals, the Company had repurchased approximately 9.8 million shares (not adjusted
for the Company’s January 2004 two-for-one stock split) of its outstanding Class A common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $158.9 million, or $16 per share. In September 2003, the Board of Directors voted to retire the
Company’s Class A common stock held in treasury. As a result, approximately 9.9 million Class A common shares (not adjusted for the Company’s January 2004 two-for-one stock split) were retired. The retirement had no net effect on total
stockholders’ equity. In December 2003, the Company granted approximately 2.4 million stock options (adjusted for the Company’s January 2004 two-for-one stock split) to employees under the 2003 Plan and in January 2004, repurchased a
similar amount of shares of its outstanding Class A common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $109.6 million, or $45.64 per share (adjusted for the Company’s January 2004 two-for-one stock split).

At November 30, 2003, the Company had shelf registration statements under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, relating to up to $620 million of equity or debt securities which it may sell for cash and up to $400 million of equity or debt securities which it could issue in connection with acquisitions of companies,
businesses or assets.

Restrictions on Payment of Dividends

Other than as required to maintain the financial ratios
and net worth required by the Credit Facilities, there are no restrictions on the payment of dividends on common stock by the Company. There are no agreements which restrict the payment of dividends by subsidiaries of the Company other than as
required to maintain the financial ratios and net worth requirements under the Financial Services Division’s warehouse lines of credit.

Stock Option Plans

The Lennar Corporation 2003 Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan (the “2003 Plan”) provides for the granting of Class A and Class B stock
options and stock appreciation rights and awards of restricted common stock to key officers, employees and directors. The exercise prices of stock options and stock appreciation rights are not less than the market value of the common stock on the
date of the grant. No options granted under the 2003 Plan may be exercisable until at least six months after the date of the grant. Thereafter, exercises are permitted in installments determined when options are granted. Each stock option and stock
appreciation right will expire on a date determined at the time of the grant, but not more than 10 years after the date of the grant. At November 30, 2003, there were no shares of restricted stock outstanding under the 2003 Plan.

The Lennar Corporation 2000 Stock Option and Restricted Stock Plan (the
“2000 Plan”) provided for the granting of Class A stock options and stock appreciation rights and awards of restricted common stock to key officers, employees and directors. No options granted under the 2000 Plan may be exercisable until
at least six months after the date of the grant. Thereafter, exercises are permitted in installments determined when options


LENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

are granted. Each stock option and stock appreciation right will expire on a date determined at the time of the grant, but not more than 10 years after the
date of the grant. At November 30, 2003, a combined total of 1,036,200 shares of Class A and Class B restricted stock (adjusted for the January 2004 two-for-one stock split) were outstanding under the Plan. The stock was valued based on its market
price on the date of the grant. The grants vest over 5 years from the date of issuance. Unearned compensation arising from the restricted stock grants is amortized to expense over the period of the restrictions and is shown as a reduction of
stockholders’ equity in the consolidated balance sheets.

The Lennar Corporation 1997 Stock Option Plan (the “1997 Plan”) provided for the granting of Class A stock options and stock appreciation rights to key employees of the Company to purchase shares at prices not less than market
value of the common stock on the date of the grant. No options granted under the 1997 Plan may be exercisable until at least six months after the date of the grant. Thereafter, exercises are permitted in installments determined when options are
granted. Each stock option and stock appreciation right granted will expire on a date determined at the time of the grant, but not more than 10 years after the date of the grant.

The Lennar Corporation 1991 Stock Option Plan (the “1991 Plan”) provided for the granting of options to certain
key employees of the Company to purchase Class A shares at prices not less than market value of the common stock on the date of the grant. No options granted under the 1991 Plan may be exercisable until at least six months after the date of the
grant. Thereafter, exercises are permitted in installments determined when options are granted. Each stock option granted will expire on a date determined at the time of the grant, but not more than 10 years after the date of the grant.

A summary of the Company’s stock option activity for the years ended
November 30, 2003, 2002 and 2001 (adjusted for the January 2004 two-for-one stock split) is as follows:

*

Represents options for Class B common stock which were issued as a result of anti-dilution provisions with regard to unexercised Class A stock options as of the date of the April
2003 10% Class B stock distribution.


LENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

The following table summarizes information about stock options outstanding at November 30, 2003
(adjusted for the January 2004 two-for-one stock split):

Employee Stock
Ownership/401(k) Plan

Prior to 1998, the Employee Stock
Ownership/401(k) Plan (the “Plan”) provided shares of stock to employees who had completed one year of continuous service with the Company. During 1998, the Plan was amended to exclude any new shares from being provided to employees. All
prior year contributions to employees actively employed on or after October 1, 1998 vested at a rate of 20% per year over a five year period. All active participants in the Plan whose employment terminated prior to October 1, 1998 vested based upon
the Plan that was active prior to their termination of employment. Under the 401(k) portion of the Plan, contributions made by employees can be invested in a variety of mutual funds or proprietary funds provided by the Plan trustee. The Company may
also make contributions for the benefit of employees. The Company records as compensation expense an amount which approximates the vesting of the contributions to the Employee Stock Ownership portion of the Plan, as well as the Company’s
contribution to the 401(k) portion of the Plan. This amount was $9.1 million in 2003, $7.0 million in 2002 and $6.5 million in 2001.

13.    Deferred Compensation Plan

In June 2002, the Company adopted the Lennar Corporation Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan (the “Deferred Compensation Plan”) that allows
a selected group of members of management to defer a portion of their salaries and bonuses and up to 100% of their restricted stock. All participant contributions to the Deferred Compensation Plan are vested. Salaries and bonuses that are deferred
under the Deferred Compensation Plan are credited with earnings or losses based on investment decisions made by the participants. The cash contributions to the Deferred Compensation Plan are invested by the Company in various investment securities
that are classified as trading.

Restricted stock is deferred
under the Deferred Compensation Plan by surrendering the restricted stock in exchange for the right to receive in the future a number of shares equal to the number of restricted shares that are surrendered. The surrender is reflected as a reduction
in stockholders’ equity equal to the value of the restricted stock when it was issued, with an offsetting increase in stockholders’ equity to reflect a deferral of the compensation expense related to the surrendered restricted stock.
Changes in the value of the shares that will be issued in the future are not reflected in the financial statements.

As of November 30, 2003, approximately 534,000 Class A shares and 53,400 Class B shares of restricted stock (adjusted for the April 2003 10% Class B stock
distribution and January 2004 two-for-one stock split) had been surrendered in exchange for rights under the Deferred Compensation Plan, resulting in a reduction in stockholders’ equity of $4.9 million fully offset by an increase in
stockholders’ equity to reflect the deferral of compensation in that amount. Shares that the Company is obligated to issue in the future under the Deferred Compensation Plan are treated as outstanding shares in both the Company’s basic and
diluted earnings per share calculations for the years ended November 30, 2003 and 2002.

14.    Financial Instruments

The following table presents the carrying amounts and estimated fair values
of financial instruments held by the Company at November 30, 2003 and 2002, using available market information and what the Company believes to be appropriate valuation methodologies. Considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to
develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the estimates presented are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the Company could realize in a current market exchange. The use of different market assumptions and/or estimation
methodologies might have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. The table excludes cash, receivables and accounts payable, which had fair values approximating their carrying values.

The following methods
and assumptions are used by the Company in estimating fair values:

Homebuilding

—Investments classified as trading (included in other assets): The fair value is based on quoted market prices. Senior notes and other debts payable: The fair value of fixed rate borrowings is based on quoted market
prices. Variable rate borrowings are tied to market indices and therefore approximate fair value. Interest rate swaps: The fair value is based on dealer quotations and generally represents an estimate of the amount the Company would pay or receive
to terminate the agreement at the reporting date.

Financial
services

—The fair values are based on quoted market prices, if available. The fair values for instruments which do not have quoted market prices are estimated by the Company on the basis of discounted cash flows or other financial
information.

The Company utilizes interest rate swap
agreements to manage interest costs and hedge against risks associated with changing interest rates. Counterparties to these agreements are major financial institutions. Credit loss from counterparty non-performance is not anticipated. A majority of
the Company’s available variable rate borrowings are based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) index. At November 30, 2003, the


LENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Company had four interest rate swap agreements outstanding with a total notional amount of $300 million, which will mature at various dates through 2007.
These agreements fixed the LIBOR index at an average interest rate of 6.8% at November 30, 2003. The effect of the interest rate swap agreements on interest incurred and on the average interest rate was an increase of $16.7 million and 1.03% for the
year ended November 30, 2003, an increase of $17.0 million and 1.08% for the year ended November 30, 2002 and an increase of $7.2 million and 0.48% for the year ended November 30, 2001.

As of November 30, 2003, the Financial Services Division’s commitments regarding loans in process totaled approximately
$2.6 billion. To minimize credit risk, the Division uses the same credit policies in the approval of the commitments as are applied to all lending activities. Since a portion of these commitments is expected to expire without being exercised by the
borrowers, the total commitments do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Loans in process for which interest rates were committed to the borrowers totaled approximately $330.7 million as of November 30, 2003. Substantially all of
these commitments were for periods of 60 days or less.

Mandatory mortgage-backed securities forward commitments (“MBS”) are used by the Company to hedge its interest rate exposure during the period from when it makes an interest rate commitment to a loan applicant until the time at
which the loan is sold to an investor. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk. Credit risk is managed by entering into MBS only with investment banks with primary dealer status and with permanent
investors meeting the credit standards of the Company. At any time, the risk to the Company, in the event of default by the purchaser, is the difference between the contract price and current market value. At November 30, 2003, the Company had open
commitments amounting to $512.0 million to sell MBS with varying settlement dates through January 2004.

15.    Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities

In January 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46, as further clarified and amended by the FASB’s issuance of a revision to FIN 46 in December 2003, which
requires the consolidation of entities in which an enterprise absorbs a majority of the entity’s expected losses, receives a majority of the entity’s expected residual returns, or both, as a result of ownership, contractual or other
financial interests in the entity. Prior to the issuance of FIN 46, entities were generally consolidated by an enterprise when it had a controlling financial interest through ownership of a majority voting interest in the entity. FIN 46 applied
immediately to variable interests created after January 31, 2003, and with respect to variable interests created before February 1, 2003, FIN 46 will apply in the Company’s second quarter ending May 31, 2004, as deferred by the FASB in December
2003. Although the Company does not believe the full adoption of FIN 46 will have a material impact on net earnings, the Company cannot make any definitive determination until it completes its evaluation.

Partnerships

At November 30, 2003, the Company had investments in and advances to
partnerships established to acquire and develop land for sale to the Company in connection with its homebuilding operations or for sale to third parties. The Company evaluated its partnership agreements entered into subsequent to January 31, 2003
under FIN 46. The Company determined that it is the primary beneficiary of one partnership that was created after January 31, 2003, and, accordingly, included the accounts of that partnership in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. No
other partnerships created after January 31, 2003 were consolidated as the Company determined it was not the primary beneficiary, as defined under FIN 46. The Company is in the process of evaluating the remainder of its unconsolidated partnerships
that may be deemed variable interest entities under the provisions of FIN 46. At November 30, 2003, the Company’s estimated maximum exposure to loss with regard to unconsolidated partnerships was its recorded investment in these partnerships
totaling $390.3 million in addition to the exposure under the guarantees discussed in Note 5.


LENNAR CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued)

Option contracts

The Company evaluated its option contracts for land entered into subsequent to January 31, 2003 and determined it is the
primary beneficiary of certain of these option contracts. Although the Company does not have legal title to the optioned land, under FIN 46, the Company, as the primary beneficiary, is required to consolidate the land under option at fair value (the
exercise price). The effect of the consolidation was an increase of $45.2 million to consolidated inventory not owned with a corresponding increase to liabilities related to consolidated inventory not owned in the accompanying consolidated balance
sheet as of November 30, 2003. To reflect the fair value of the inventory consolidated under FIN 46, the Company reclassified $4.1 million of related option deposits from land under development to consolidated inventory not owned. The liabilities
related to consolidated inventory not owned represent the difference between the exercise price of the optioned land and the Company’s deposits. The Company is in the process of evaluating the remainder of its option contracts that may be
deemed issued by variable interest entities under the provisions of FIN 46. At November 30, 2003, the Company’s exposure to loss represents its non-refundable option deposits and/or letters of credit related to options with estimated aggregate
exercise prices totaling approximately $3 billion.

16.    Commitments and Contingent Liabilities

The Company and its subsidiaries are party to various claims, legal actions and complaints arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the disposition of these matters will not have a
material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations or cash flows of the Company.

The Company is subject to the usual obligations associated with entering into contracts (including option contracts) for the purchase, development and
sale of real estate, which it does in the routine conduct of its business. Option contracts for the purchase of land permit the Company to defer acquiring portions of properties owned by third parties and certain unconsolidated partnerships until
the Company is ready to build homes on them. The use of option contracts allows the Company to reduce the financial risk of adverse market conditions associated with long-term land holdings. At November 30, 2003, the Company had access to acquire
approximately 135,000 homesites through option contracts and unconsolidated partnerships. At November 30, 2003, the Company had $220.6 million of non-refundable option deposits and advanced costs on real estate related to certain of these homesites.

The Company has entered into agreements to lease certain
office facilities and equipment under operating leases. Future minimum payments under the noncancelable leases are as follows: 2004—$48.0 million; 2005—$38.2 million; 2006—$31.0 million; 2007—$24.3 million; 2008—$16.3
million and thereafter—$34.9 million. Rental expense for the years ended November 30, 2003, 2002 and 2001 was $63.2 million, $55.0 million and $42.3 million, respectively.

The Company is committed, under various letters of credit, to perform certain development and construction activities and
provide certain guarantees in the normal course of business. Outstanding letters of credit under these arrangements totaled $627.9 million at November 30, 2003. The Company also had outstanding performance and surety bonds with estimated costs to
complete of $1.0 billion related principally to its obligations for site improvements at various projects at November 30, 2003. The Company does not believe that draws upon these bonds, if any, will have a material effect on the Company’s
financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

17.    Supplemental Financial Information

As discussed in Note 7, the Company’s obligations to pay principal,
premium, if any, and interest under certain debt instruments are guaranteed on a joint and several basis by substantially all of the Company’s subsidiaries, other than subsidiaries primarily engaged in mortgage and title reinsurance activities.
The guarantees are full and unconditional and the guarantor subsidiaries are 100% directly or indirectly owned by Lennar Corporation. The Company has determined that separate, full financial statements of the guarantors would not be material to
investors and, accordingly, supplemental financial information for the guarantors is presented.
