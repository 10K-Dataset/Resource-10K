PART I

Item 1.  Business.

Introduction

We are a leading international beverage alcohol company with many of our products recognized as leaders in their respective categories and geographic markets.  We are the third-largest producer and marketer of beer for the U.S. market and the world’s leading premium wine company with a leading market position in the U.S., Canada and New Zealand.  Our wine portfolio is complemented by select premium spirits brands and other select beverage alcohol products.  We are the largest multi-category supplier (beer, wine and spirits) (“Multi-category Supplier”) of beverage alcohol in the U.S.  Our strong market positions make us a supplier of choice to many of our customers, who include wholesale distributors, retailers, on-premise locations and government alcohol beverage control agencies.

The Company is a Delaware corporation incorporated on December 4, 1972, as the successor to a business founded in 1945.  We have approximately

6,300

employees located primarily in the U.S., Canada and Mexico, with our corporate headquarters located in Victor, New York.  We conduct our business through entities we wholly own as well as through a variety of joint ventures and other entities.

Strategy

Certain key industry trends during the past decade have impacted our activities, results and strategy.  These include:

•

consolidation of suppliers, wholesalers and retailers;

•

high-end beer (imports and crafts) growing faster than domestic beer in the U.S.;

•

an increase in global wine consumption, with premium wines growing faster than value-priced wines; and

•

volume of premium spirits growing faster than value-priced spirits in the U.S.

To capitalize on these trends, become more competitive and grow our business, we have generally employed a strategy focused on a combination of organic growth and acquisitions, with an increasing focus on the higher-margin premium categories of the beverage alcohol industry.  Key elements of our strategy include:

•

leveraging our existing portfolio of leading brands;

•

developing new products, new packaging and line extensions;

•

strengthening relationships with wholesalers and retailers;

•

expanding distribution of our product portfolio;

•

enhancing production capabilities;

•

realizing operating efficiencies and synergies; and

•

maximizing asset utilization.

We have complemented this strategy by divesting certain businesses, brands and assets as part of our efforts to increase the mix of premium brands, improve margins, create operating efficiencies and reduce debt.  Further, we have acquired higher-margin premium wine growth brands, and we have completed the Beer Business Acquisition to solidify our position in the U.S. beer market over the long-term; diversify our profit base and enhance our margins, earnings and cash flow; and provide new avenues for growth.

For further information on our strategy, see Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (“MD&A”).



Acquisitions and Divestitures

As part of our strategy to improve margins, enhance production capabilities and keep an increased focus on the higher-margin premium categories of the beverage alcohol industry, we have made the following acquisitions and divestitures:

Beer Business Acquisition

The acquisition of Modelo’s U.S. beer business included the remaining 50% interest in Crown Imports, which provides us with complete, independent control of our U.S. commercial beer business; a state-of-the-art Brewery in Mexico; and exclusive perpetual brand rights to import, market and sell Corona and the other Mexican Beer Brands in the U.S. market.  The transaction solidifies our position in the U.S. beer market for the long term and makes us the third-largest brewer and seller of beer for the U.S. market.  Combining this with our strong position in wine and spirits positions us as the largest Multi-category Supplier of beverage alcohol in the U.S.

Mark West

The acquisition of this higher-margin, premium wine growth brand has complemented our existing portfolio and further strengthened our position in the U.S. Pinot Noir category.

Ruffino

The acquisition of the remaining equity interest in this business has solidified our position in the Italian premium wine category in the U.S. and Canada.

CWAE Divestiture

Consistent with our strategic focus on premiumizing our portfolio and improving our margins and return on invested capital, we sold 80.1% of our Australian and U.K. business in January 2011 (the “CWAE Divestiture”).

For further information about our Fiscal 2014, Fiscal 2013 and Fiscal 2012 transactions, see (i)  MD&A and (ii)  Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Notes to the Financial Statements”).



Business Segments

We report our operating results in three segments:  (i)  Beer (formerly Crown Imports), (ii)  Wine and Spirits (formerly Constellation Wines and Spirits) and (iii)  Corporate Operations and Other.  The business segments reflect how our operations are managed, how operating performance is evaluated by senior management and the structure of our internal financial reporting.  We report net sales in two reportable segments, as follows:

Beer

In connection with the Beer Business Acquisition and the resulting consolidation of the acquired businesses as of June 2013, the Crown Imports segment, together with the Brewery Purchase, is now known as the Beer segment.  We have the exclusive right to import, market and sell these Mexican Beer Brands in all 50 states of the U.S.:

•

Corona Extra

•

Corona Light

•

Modelo Especial

•

Pacifico

•

Negra Modelo

•

Victoria

In the U.S., we have five of the top-selling 15 imported beer brands.  Corona Extra is the best-selling imported beer and the fifth best-selling beer overall in the U.S.; Corona Light is the leading imported light beer; and Modelo Especial is the third-largest and one of the fastest-growing major imported beer brands.  During Fiscal 2014, we introduced Modelo Especial Chelada, a blend of Modelo Especial with flavors of tomato, salt and lime, to further capitalize on the strength of this growing brand.

The current capacity of our Brewery is 10 million hectoliters.  We intend to expand the Brewery’s capacity to 20 million hectoliters so it can produce all of our anticipated Mexican beer supply requirements.  The Brewery expansion is targeted to be completed over the three-year period from the date of the Beer Business Acquisition, with total spend estimated to be in the range of $900 million to $1.1 billion.  We have invested approximately $124 million in the Brewery expansion for Fiscal 2014.

Prior to the Beer Business Acquisition, we and Modelo, indirectly, each had an equal interest in Crown Imports, which had the exclusive right to import, market and sell the Mexican Beer Brands.

Wine and Spirits

We are the world’s leading producer and marketer of premium wine.  We sell a large number of wine brands across all categories – table wine, sparkling wine and dessert wine – and across all price points – popular, premium,



super-premium and fine wine – and we have a leading market position in the U.S., Canada and New Zealand.  Our portfolio of super-premium and fine wines is supported by vineyard holdings in the U.S., Canada, New Zealand and Italy.  Our premium spirit brands each have a leading position in their respective categories.

Our wine produced in the U.S. is primarily marketed domestically and in Canada and the U.K.  Wine produced in Canada is primarily marketed domestically.  Wine produced in New Zealand is primarily marketed in the U.S., Canada, Australia, the U.K. and domestically.  Wine produced in Italy is primarily marketed in the U.S., Canada and domestically.  In addition, we export our wine products to other major world markets.

In our spirits business, Svedka Vodka is imported from Sweden and is the second-largest imported vodka brand in the U.S.  Black Velvet Canadian Whisky is the second-largest Canadian whisky brand in the U.S.

In the U.S., we sell 14 of the top-selling 100 table wine brands and are a leading premium wine company.  Some of our well-known wine and spirits brands sold in the U.S., which comprise our U.S. Focus Brands (“Focus Brands”), include:

We dedicate a large share of sales and marketing resources to these brands as they represent a majority of our U.S. wine and spirits revenue and profitability, and have strong positions in their respective price segments, mostly within the $5 to $20 price range at U.S. retail.  Within the Focus Brands, we have been increasing brand building support behind certain key brands which we collectively believe provide the best opportunity for growth and operating margin enhancement for our wine and spirits business.  These brands include Robert Mondavi, Svedka, Black Box, Rex Goliath, Clos du Bois, Ruffino, Estancia, Mark West, Kim Crawford and Nobilo.

We have been increasing resources in support of product innovation as we believe this is one of the key drivers of overall beverage alcohol category growth.  In wine, we have introduced varietal line extensions behind many of our focus brands and newer brands like The Dreaming Tree, Thorny Rose and Simply Naked.  In spirits, we have been introducing flavor extensions for Svedka and Black Velvet.

In Canada, we are the leading wine company and have six of the top-selling 25 table wine brands.  In this market, Jackson-Triggs is the top-selling wine brand and Inniskillin is the leading icewine brand.  In addition to our domestic brands, we are targeting to increase our import brand presence in this market with offerings like Robert Mondavi, Kim Crawford and Ruffino.

Corporate Operations and Other

The Corporate Operations and Other segment includes traditional corporate-related items including executive management, corporate development, corporate finance, human resources, internal audit, investor relations, legal, public relations and global information technology.

Further information regarding net sales, operating income and total assets of each of our business segments and information regarding geographic areas is set forth in Note 21 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.

Marketing and Distribution

To focus on their respective product categories, build brand equity and increase sales, our segments employ full-time, in-house marketing, sales and customer service functions.  These functions engage in a range of marketing activities and strategies, including market research, consumer and trade advertising, price promotions, point-of-sale



materials, event sponsorship, on-premise promotions and public relations.  Where opportunities exist, particularly with national accounts in the U.S., we leverage our sales and marketing skills across the organization.

In North America, our products are primarily distributed by wholesale distributors, with separate distribution networks utilized for our imported beer and wine and spirits portfolios, as well as state and provincial alcohol beverage control agencies.  As is the case with all other beverage alcohol companies, products sold through these agencies are subject to obtaining and maintaining listings to sell our products in that agency’s state or province.  State and provincial governments can affect prices paid by consumers of our products through the imposition of taxes or, in states and provinces in which the government acts as the distributor of our products through an alcohol beverage control agency, by directly setting the retail prices.

Trademarks and Distribution Agreements

Trademarks are an important aspect of our business.  We sell products under a number of trademarks, which we own or use under license.  Throughout our segments, we also have various licenses and distribution agreements for the sale, or the production and sale, of our products and products of third parties.  These licenses and distribution agreements have varying terms and durations.

Prior to the Beer Business Acquisition, all of our imported beer products were imported, marketed and sold through Crown Imports.  Crown Imports had entered into exclusive importation agreements with the suppliers of the imported beer products and had an exclusive sub-license to use certain trademarks related to the Mexican Beer Brands in the U.S. and Guam pursuant to a renewable sub-license agreement between Crown Imports and Marcas Modelo, S.A. de C.V.  As a result of the Beer Business Acquisition, our sub-license agreement for the exclusive use of the trademarks for our Mexican Beer Brands is now perpetual.

Competition

The beverage alcohol industry is highly competitive.  We compete on the basis of quality, price, brand recognition and distribution strength.  Our beverage alcohol products compete with other alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages for consumer purchases, as well as shelf space in retail stores, restaurant presence and wholesaler attention.  We compete with numerous multinational producers and distributors of beverage alcohol products, some of which have greater resources than we do.  Our principal competitors include:

Production

Approximately

55%

of our Mexican Beer Brands requirements are produced by our Brewery, which is located in Nava, Coahuila, Mexico.  This location is approximately 10 miles from the Texas border.  The current capacity of the Brewery is 10 million hectoliters.  We intend to expand the Brewery’s capacity to 20 million hectoliters so it can produce all of our anticipated Mexican beer supply requirements.  The Brewery expansion is targeted to be completed over the three-year period from the date of the Beer Business Acquisition.  To meet our beer supply requirements above the current Brewery capacity, we have entered into a three-year interim supply agreement with Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (“ABI”).  This agreement also provides for up to two one-year extensions.  However, the United States, acting through the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice (“DOJ”), has a right of approval, in its sole discretion, of any extension of the term of this interim supply agreement beyond three years.



In the U.S., we operate 18 wineries using many varieties of grapes grown principally in the Napa, Sonoma, Monterey and San Joaquin regions of California.  We also operate nine wineries in Canada, four wineries in New Zealand and five wineries in Italy.  Grapes are crushed at most of our wineries and stored as wine until packaged for sale under our brand names or sold in bulk.  The inventories of wine are usually at their highest levels during and after the crush of each year’s grape harvest, and are reduced prior to the subsequent year’s crush.  Wine inventories are usually at their highest levels in September through November in the U.S., Canada and Italy, and in March through May in New Zealand.

Our Canadian whisky requirements are produced and aged at our Canadian distillery in Lethbridge, Alberta.  Our requirements for grains and bulk spirits used in the production of Canadian whisky are purchased from various suppliers.

Sources and Availability of Production Materials

The principal components in the production of our Mexican Beer Brands at our Brewery include water; agricultural products, such as malt, hops and corn starch; and packaging materials, which include glass, aluminum and cardboard.  Packaging materials represent the largest cost component of production, with glass bottles representing the largest cost component of our packaging materials.  In Fiscal 2014, the package format mix of our beer volume sold in the U.S. was

78%

glass bottles,

21%

aluminum cans and

1%

in stainless steel kegs.

The Brewery receives allotments of water originating from a mountain aquifer.  We believe we have adequate access to water allotments to support the Brewery’s on-going requirements and future requirements after completing the Brewery expansion.  In connection with the Beer Business Acquisition, we have entered into a transition services agreement with ABI for the supply of glass, aluminum cans, can lids, crowns, caps, cartons, malt, hops, corn starch and yeast for a period of 36 months from the date of the acquisition.  Investments and efforts to establish stand-alone procurement systems and supply arrangements for the beer business operations are on-going and progressing.  We believe that ABI will have adequate sources of the materials noted above to meet our sales expectations.

The principal components in the production of our wine and spirits products are agricultural products, such as grapes and grain, and packaging materials (primarily glass).

Most of our annual grape requirements are satisfied by purchases from each year’s harvest which normally begins in August and runs through October in the U.S., Canada and Italy, and begins in February and runs through May in New Zealand.  We receive grapes from approximately

1,040

independent growers in the U.S., approximately


independent growers in Canada, approximately


independent growers in New Zealand and approximately


independent growers in Italy.  We enter into purchase agreements with a majority of these growers with pricing that generally varies year-to-year and is generally based on then-current market prices.

As of

February 28, 2014

, we owned or leased approximately

20,000

acres of land and vineyards, either fully bearing or under development, in the U.S., Canada, New Zealand and Italy.  This acreage supplies only a small percentage of our overall total grape needs for wine production.  However, most of this acreage is used to supply a large portion of the grapes used for the production of our super-premium and fine wines.  We continue to consider the purchase or lease of additional vineyards, and additional land for vineyard plantings, to supplement our grape supply.

We believe that we have adequate sources of grape supplies to meet our sales expectations.  However, when demand for certain wine products exceeds expectations, we look to source the extra requirements from the bulk wine markets around the world.

The distilled spirits manufactured and imported by us require various agricultural products, neutral grain spirits and bulk spirits which we fulfill through purchases from various sources by contractual arrangement and through purchases on the open market.  We believe that adequate supplies of the aforementioned products are available at the present time.



We utilize glass and polyethylene terephthalate (“PET”) bottles and other materials such as caps, corks, capsules, labels, wine bags and cardboard cartons in the bottling and packaging of our wine and spirits products.  After grape purchases, glass bottle costs are the largest component of our cost of product sold.  In the U.S. and Canada, the glass bottle industry is highly concentrated with only a small number of producers.  We have traditionally obtained, and continue to obtain, our glass requirements from a limited number of producers under long-term supply arrangements.  Currently, one producer supplies most of our glass container requirements for our U.S. operations and a portion of our glass container requirements for our Canadian operations, with the remaining portion for our Canadian operations supplied by another producer.  We have been able to satisfy our requirements with respect to the foregoing and consider our sources of supply to be adequate at this time.

Government Regulation

We are subject to a range of laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate.  Where we produce products, we are subject to environmental laws and regulations, and may be required to obtain environmental and alcohol beverage permits and licenses to operate our facilities.  Where we market and sell products, we may be subject to laws and regulations on brand registration, packaging and labeling, distribution methods and relationships, pricing and price changes, sales promotions, advertising and public relations.  We are also subject to rules and regulations relating to changes in officers or directors, ownership or control.

We believe we are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable governmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate.  We also believe that the cost of administration and compliance with, and liability under, such laws and regulations does not have, and is not expected to have, a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Seasonality

The beverage alcohol industry is subject to seasonality in each major category.  As a result, in response to wholesaler and retailer demand which precedes consumer purchases, our imported beer sales are typically highest during the first and second quarters of our fiscal year, which correspond to the Spring and Summer periods in the U.S.  Our wine and spirits sales are typically highest during the third quarter of our fiscal year, primarily due to seasonal holiday buying.

Employees

As of the end of March 2014, we had approximately

6,300

employees.  Approximately

3,300

employees were in the U.S. and approximately

3,000

employees were outside of the U.S., primarily in Canada and Mexico.  We may employ additional workers during the grape crushing seasons.  We consider our employee relations generally to be good.

Item 1A.  Risk Factors.

In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors which could materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.  The risks described below are not the only risks we face.  Additional factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition or results of operations in future periods.

Worldwide and domestic economic trends and financial market conditions

We are subject to risks associated with adverse economic conditions, including economic slowdown, inflation, and the disruption, volatility and tightening of credit and capital markets.  Unfavorable global or regional economic conditions could adversely impact our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.  Unemployment, tax increases, governmental spending cuts or a return of high levels of inflation could affect consumer spending patterns and purchases of our products.  These could also create or exacerbate credit issues, cash flow issues and other financial hardships for us and our suppliers, distributors, retailers and consumers.  The inability of suppliers, distributors and retailers to access liquidity could impact our ability to produce and distribute our products.  We have a committed credit facility and additional liquidity facilities available to us.  While to date we have not experienced problems with accessing these facilities, to the extent that the financial institutions that participate in these facilities were to default on their obligation to fund, those funds would not be available to us.

Global operations, currency rate fluctuations, interest rate fluctuations, and geopolitical uncertainty

Our products are produced and sold in numerous countries throughout the world, and we have announced plans to enter into certain emerging markets over time.  As a result of the Beer Business Acquisition, we also have operations in Mexico.

Risks associated with international operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, include:

•

changes in local political, economic, social and labor conditions;

•

potential disruption from socio-economic violence, including terrorism and drug-related violence;

•

restrictions on foreign ownership and investments or on repatriation of cash earned in countries outside the U.S.;

•

changes in laws, governmental regulations and policies in many countries outside the U.S.;

•

import and export requirements;

•

currency exchange rate fluctuations;

•

a less developed and less certain legal and regulatory environment, which among other things can create uncertainty with regard to liability issues;

•

laws regarding the enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights;

•

inadequate levels of compliance with applicable anti-bribery laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; and

•

other challenges caused by distance, language, and cultural differences.

Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to overcome the challenges we encounter with respect to these factors and other matters generally affecting U.S. companies with global operations.  Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including anti-corruption laws, there can be no assurance that our employees, business partners or agents will not violate our policies or take action determined to be in violation of the law.  Any determination that our operations or activities were not in compliance with applicable U.S. or foreign laws or regulations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties, interruptions of business, terminations of necessary licenses and permits, and other legal and equitable sanctions.

We are also exposed to risks associated with currency fluctuations and risks associated with interest rate fluctuations.  Currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies in the markets in which we do business have fluctuated in recent years and are likely to continue to do so in the future.  We manage our exposure



to foreign currency and interest rate risks utilizing derivative instruments and other means to reduce those risks.  We could experience changes in our ability to hedge against or manage fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates and, accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in reducing those risks.  We could also be affected by nationalization of our international operations, unstable governments, unfamiliar or biased legal systems or intergovernmental disputes.  These currency, economic and political uncertainties may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, especially to the extent these matters, or the decisions, policies or economic strength of our suppliers and distributors, affect our global operations.

Competition

We are in a highly competitive industry and the dollar amount and unit volume of our sales could be negatively affected by numerous factors including:

•

our inability to maintain or increase prices;

•

new entrants in our markets or categories;

•

a general decline in beverage alcohol consumption; or

•

the decision of wholesalers, retailers or consumers to purchase a competitor’s products instead of ours.

Unit volume and dollar amount of sales could also be affected by pricing, purchasing, financing, operational, advertising or promotional decisions made by wholesalers, state and provincial agencies, and retailers which could affect their supply of, or consumer demand for, our products.  We could also experience higher than expected selling, general and administrative expenses if we find it necessary to increase the number of our personnel or our advertising or marketing expenditures to maintain our competitive position or for other reasons.

Acquisition, divestiture and joint venture strategy

We have made a number of acquisitions and divestitures and may, from time to time, acquire additional businesses, assets or securities of companies that we believe would provide a strategic fit with our business.  We may also divest ourselves of businesses, assets or securities of companies that we believe no longer provide a strategic fit with our business.  We will need to integrate acquired businesses with our existing operations; our overall internal control over financial reporting processes; and our financial, operations and information systems.  If the financial performance of our business, as supplemented by the assets and businesses acquired, does not meet our expectations, it may make it more difficult for us to service our debt obligations and our results of operations may fail to meet market expectations.

We cannot assure you that we will realize the expected benefits of acquisitions, such as revenue, earnings or operating efficiency, and we may not effectively assimilate the business or product offerings of acquired companies into our business successfully or within the anticipated costs or timeframes.  Complications with on-going integration of any acquisition, including our Beer Business Acquisition, could result from the following circumstances, among others:

•

failure to implement our business plan for the combined business;

•

unanticipated issues in integrating manufacturing, logistics, information, communications, financial, internal control and other systems;

•

failure to retain key customers and suppliers;

•

unanticipated changes in applicable laws and regulations;

•

failure to retain key employees;

•

operating risks inherent in the acquired businesses and assets and our business;

•

unanticipated issues, expenses and liabilities;

•

failure to realize fully anticipated cost savings, growth opportunities and other potential synergies; and

•

unfamiliarity with operating in new locations.



The integration of the Beer Business Acquisition can be further impacted by the following circumstances:

•

failure to expand the Brewery under the timeline imposed by the DOJ pursuant to the final judgment;

•

Brewery operations will be dependent upon the operational experience of employees who are relatively new to our organization; and

•

our ability to secure or expand Brewery capacity beyond the initial Brewery expansion in order to support the future growth of our beer business.

If these events were to occur with respect to any of our acquisitions, including our Beer Business Acquisition, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be negatively impacted.

We may provide various indemnifications in connection with the sale of assets or portions of our business.  Additionally, our final determinations and appraisals of the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in our acquisitions may vary materially from earlier estimates.  We cannot assure you that the fair value of acquired businesses will remain constant.

We have entered into joint ventures and we may enter into additional joint ventures.  We share control of our joint ventures.  We have also acquired or retained ownership interests in companies which we do not control. Our joint venture partners or the other parties that hold the remaining ownership interests in companies which we do not control may at any time have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our goals or the goals of the joint ventures or those companies.  Our joint venture arrangements and the arrangements through which we acquired or hold our other equity or membership interests may require us, among other matters, to pay certain costs, to make capital investments, to fulfill alone our joint venture partners’ obligations, or to purchase other parties’ interests.  Our failure to adequately manage the risks associated with any acquisition, or the failure of an entity in which we have an equity or membership interest, could adversely affect our financial condition or our valuation of these types of investments.

We cannot assure you that any of our acquisitions, investments or joint ventures will be profitable or that forecasts regarding acquisition, divestiture, joint venture or investment activities will be accurate.

Indebtedness

In recent years, we have incurred substantial indebtedness to finance our acquisitions, repurchase shares of our common stock and fund the Beer Business Acquisition.  In the future, we may continue to incur substantial additional indebtedness to finance acquisitions, repurchase shares of our stock and fund other general corporate purposes, including our Brewery expansion.  We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet all of our debt service requirements and to fund our general corporate capital requirements.

Our ability to satisfy our debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance.  We do not have complete control over our future operating performance because it is subject to prevailing economic conditions, levels of interest rates and financial, business and other factors.

Our current and future debt service obligations and covenants could have important consequences.  These consequences include, or may include, the following:

•

our ability to obtain financing for future working capital needs or acquisitions or other purposes may be limited;

•

our funds available for operations, expansion or distributions may be reduced because we dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness;

•

our ability to conduct our business could be limited by restrictive covenants; and

•

our vulnerability to adverse economic conditions may be greater than less leveraged competitors and, thus, our ability to withstand competitive pressures may be limited.



Restrictive covenants in our senior credit facility and in our indentures place limits on our ability to conduct our business.  Covenants in our senior credit facility include those that restrict our ability to make acquisitions, incur debt, encumber or sell assets, pay dividends, engage in mergers and consolidations, enter into transactions with affiliates, make investments and permit our subsidiaries to enter into certain restrictive agreements.  It additionally contains certain financial covenants, including a debt ratio test and an interest coverage ratio test.  Covenants in our indentures are generally less restrictive than those in our senior credit facility but nevertheless, among other things, limit our ability under certain circumstances to create, encumber or enter into sale-leaseback transactions and impose conditions on our ability to engage in mergers, consolidations and sales of all or substantially all of our assets.

These agreements also contain certain change of control provisions which, if triggered, may result in an acceleration of our obligation to repay the debt.  If we fail to comply with the obligations contained in the senior credit facility, our existing or future indentures or other loan agreements, we could be in default under such agreements, which could require us to immediately repay the related debt and also debt under other agreements that may contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions.

Control by the Sands Family

Our Class B Common Stock is principally held by members of the Sands family, either directly or through entities controlled by members of the Sands family.  Holders of Class A Common Stock are entitled to one vote per share and holders of Class B Common Stock are entitled to 10 votes per share.  Holders of Class 1 Common Stock generally do not have voting rights.  The stock ownership of the Sands family and entities controlled by members of the Sands family represents a majority of the combined voting power of all classes of our common stock as of

April 22, 2014

, voting as a single class.  As a result, the Sands family has the power to elect a majority of our directors and approve actions requiring the approval of the stockholders of the Company voting as a single class.

Potential decline in the consumption of products we sell

We rely on consumers’ demand for our products.  Consumer preferences may shift due to a variety of factors, including changes in demographic or social trends, public health policies, and changes in leisure, dining and beverage consumption patterns.  Our continued success will require us to anticipate and respond effectively to shifts in consumer behavior and drinking tastes.  If consumer preferences were to move away from our premium brands in any of our major markets, our financial results might be adversely affected.

While over the past several years there have been modest increases in consumption of beverage alcohol in most of our product categories and geographic markets, there have been periods in the past in which there were substantial declines in the overall per capita consumption of beverage alcohol products in the U.S. and other markets in which we participate.  A limited or general decline in consumption in one or more of our product categories could occur in the future due to a variety of factors, including:

•

a general decline in economic or geopolitical conditions;

•

concern about the health consequences of consuming beverage alcohol products and about drinking and driving;

•

a general decline in the consumption of beverage alcohol products in on-premise establishments, such as may result from smoking bans and stricter laws related to driving while under the influence of alcohol;

•

consumer dietary preferences favoring lighter, lower calorie beverages such as diet soft drinks, sports drinks and water products;

•

the increased activity of anti-alcohol groups;

•

increased federal, state, provincial or foreign excise or other taxes on beverage alcohol products and possible restrictions on beverage alcohol advertising and marketing;

•

increased regulation placing restrictions on the purchase or consumption of beverage alcohol products or increasing prices due to the imposition of duties or excise tax;

•

inflation;

•

wars, pandemics, weather, and natural or man-made disasters; and

•

cost of gasoline and other petroleum-based products.



In addition, our continued success depends, in part, on our ability to develop new products.  The launch and ongoing success of new products are inherently uncertain especially with regard to their appeal to consumers.  The launch of a new product can give rise to a variety of costs and an unsuccessful launch, among other things, can affect consumer perception of existing brands and our reputation.  Unsuccessful implementation or short-lived popularity of our product innovations may result in inventory write-offs and other costs.

Reliance on wholesale distributors, major retailers and government agencies

Local market structures and distribution channels vary worldwide.  Within our primary market in the U.S., we offer a range of beverage alcohol products across the imported beer, branded wine and spirits categories, with separate distribution networks utilized for our imported beer portfolio and our wine and spirits portfolio.  In the U.S., we sell our products principally to wholesalers for resale to retail outlets including grocery stores, club and discount stores, package liquor stores and restaurants and also directly to government agencies, while in Canada, we sell our products principally to government agencies.  In the U.S., we have entered into exclusive arrangements with certain wholesalers that generate a large portion of our U.S. wine and spirits sales.  The replacement or poor performance of our major wholesalers, retailers or government agencies could result in temporary or longer-term sales disruptions or could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition for a particular period.  Our inability to collect accounts receivable from our major wholesalers, retailers or government agencies could also materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

Our industry is being affected by the trend toward consolidation in the wholesale and retail distribution channels, particularly in the U.S.  If we are unable to adapt successfully to this changing environment, our net income, market share and volume growth could be negatively affected.  In addition, wholesalers and retailers of our products offer products which compete directly with our products for retail shelf space, promotional support and consumer purchases.  Accordingly, wholesalers or retailers may give higher priority to products of our competitors.

Dependence on sales of our Mexican Beer Brands

Since the Beer Business Acquisition, sales of the Mexican Beer Brands in the U.S. have become a more significant portion of our business.  Accordingly, if the growth rate, amount or profitability of our sales of the Mexican Beer Brands in the U.S. declines, our business could be more adversely affected than as compared to a time prior to the Beer Business Acquisition.  Further, consumer preferences and tastes may shift away from the Mexican Beer Brands, the categories in which they compete, or beer generally due to, among other reasons, changing taste preferences, demographics or perceived value.  Consequently, any material shift in consumer preferences and taste away from the Mexican Beer Brands, or from the categories in which they compete, could have a material adverse effect on our business, our financial condition and results of operations.

Reliance upon complex information systems and third party global networks

We depend on information technology to enable us to operate efficiently and interface with customers and suppliers, as well as maintain financial accuracy and efficiency.  If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure, we could be subject to transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, the loss of customers, business disruptions, or the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach.  We recognize that many groups on a world-wide basis have experienced increases in cyber attacks and other hacking activity.  We have dedicated internal and external resources to review and address such threats.  However, as with all large information technology systems, our systems could be penetrated by outside parties intent on extracting confidential or proprietary information, corrupting our information, disrupting our business processes, or engaging in the unauthorized use of strategic information about us or our employees, customers or consumers.  Such unauthorized access could disrupt our business operations and could result in the loss of assets or revenues, litigation, remediation costs, damage to our reputation, or the failure by us to retain or attract customers following such an event.  Such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.



We have outsourced various functions to third-party service providers and may outsource other functions in the future.  We rely on those third-party service providers to provide services on a timely and effective basis.  Although we believe we have robust service level agreements with such third parties, closely monitor their performance and maintain contingency plans in case they are unable to perform as agreed, we do not ultimately control their performance.  Their failure to perform as expected or as required by contract could result in significant disruptions and costs to our operations, which could materially affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow, and could impair our ability to make required filings with various reporting agencies on a timely or accurate basis.

In connection with the Beer Business Acquisition, we currently receive various services pursuant to our transition services agreement with ABI.  These currently include the following services which are available for the time periods as set forth in the transition services agreement:

•

consulting services in logistical matters, materials resource planning and advisory services on procurement matters in connection with the transitioning of the operations of our Brewery;

•

general administrative services currently provided at our Brewery, including information technology (IT Service), finance and regulatory compliance, certain services related to the testing of products and packaging, human resources and certain promotional, retail and licensing services;

•

services relating to expansion of our Brewery; and

•

supply of aluminum cans, glass, malt, crowns and caps, hops, corn starch, can lids, cartons and yeast.

The failure of ABI (or any third party that ABI is permitted to outsource to) to perform as expected or as required by our contract could result in significant disruptions and costs to our operations, and could also materially affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow, and could impair our ability to make required filings with various reporting agencies on a timely or accurate basis.

Supply of Mexican Beer Brands

In order to fulfill our current and projected Mexican Beer Brands product requirements, we are currently dependent on our Brewery which is a single facility located in Nava, Coahuila, Mexico, and an interim supply agreement for our supply of Mexican Beer Brands through calendar year 2016.  Although we are assessing options for additional capacity requirements and sources of supply after the initial Brewery expansion is completed, our Brewery may become our sole source of supply for our Mexican Beer Brands.  The Brewery currently has the capacity to fill approximately

55%

of our current projected product requirements.  We intend to expand the Brewery's capacity over a three-year period ending in calendar year 2016 and thus we have entered into an interim supply agreement for a supply of additional Mexican Beer Brands products for an initial period of three years.  This agreement also provides for up to two one-year extensions.  However, the United States, acting though the DOJ, will have a right of approval, in its sole discretion, of any extension of the term of this interim supply agreement beyond three years.  There can be no assurance that any requested extension would be granted.

We may not be able to satisfy all of our product supply requirements for the Mexican Beer Brands in the event of a significant partial destruction or the total destruction of the Brewery or our interim supplier’s breweries.  Also, if the contemplated expansion of our Brewery is not completed within three years after consummation of the Beer Business Acquisition, the Brewery may not be able to produce sufficient Mexican Beer Brands to satisfy our needs.  Under such circumstances, we may be unable to obtain Mexican Beer Brands at a reasonable price from another source, if at all.  A significant disruption at the Brewery or at our supplier’s breweries, even on a short-term basis, could impair our ability to produce and ship products to the market on a timely basis.  Alternative facilities with sufficient capacity or capabilities may not readily be available, may cost substantially more or may take a significant time to start production, any of which could negatively affect our business and financial performance.  Additionally, our general insurance policies may not cover certain types of catastrophes that might affect our supply of the Mexican Beer Brands.  A major uninsured catastrophe could result in significant unrecoverable losses.



Supply of quality water, agricultural and other raw materials

The quality and quantity of water available for use is important to the supply of our agricultural raw materials and our ability to operate our business.  Water is a limited resource in many parts of the world and if climate patterns change and droughts become more severe, there may be a scarcity of water or poor water quality which may affect our production costs or impose capacity constraints.  We are dependent on sufficient amounts of quality water for operation of the Brewery, our wineries and our distillery, as well as to irrigate our vineyards.  The suppliers of the agricultural raw materials we purchase are also dependent upon sufficient supplies of quality water for their vineyards and fields.  Our Brewery receives allotments of water originating from a mountain aquifer.  Although we anticipate receiving allotments adequate to support the Brewery’s on-going requirements, including as a result of the anticipated expansion, there is no guarantee that its allotments or requirements will not change materially in the future.  If water available to our operations or the operations of our suppliers becomes scarcer or the quality of that water deteriorates, we may incur increased production costs or face manufacturing constraints which could negatively affect our business and financial performance.  Even if quality water is widely available to the Brewery, our wineries, our distillery and our vineyards, water purification and waste treatment infrastructure limitations could increase costs or constrain operation of our production facilities and vineyards.  Any of these factors could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

The Brewery, our wineries and our distillery also use a large volume of agricultural and other raw materials to produce their products.  As to the Brewery, these include corn starch, malt, hops and water; the wineries use large amounts of grapes and water; and the distillery uses large amounts of grain and water.  The Brewery, our wineries and our distillery all use large amounts of various packaging materials, including glass, aluminum, cardboard and other paper products.  Our production facilities also use a significant amount of energy in their operations.  The supply and price of these raw materials and energy can be affected by a number of factors beyond our control, including market demand, global geopolitical events (especially as to their impact on crude oil prices), droughts and other weather conditions, economic factors affecting growth decisions, inflation, plant diseases and theft.  To the extent any of the foregoing factors affect the prices of ingredients or packaging or we do not effectively or completely hedge changes in commodity price risks, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted.

Catastrophic loss to wineries, production facilities or distribution systems

Throughout the years, we have consolidated several of our winery and production facility operations.  Three of our largest wineries are the Woodbridge Winery in Acampo, CA, the Mission Bell Winery in Madera, CA, and the Canandaigua Winery in Canandaigua, NY.  These three facilities produce approximately 34.5 million cases (or approximately 52.9%) of our global wine and spirits product annually.  Additionally, many of our vineyards and production and distribution facilities, such as our California wineries and our Lodi Distribution Center in Lodi, CA, are located in areas which are prone to seismic activity.  If any of these vineyards and facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue, and result in potentially significant expenses to repair or replace the vineyard or facility.  If such a disruption were to occur, we could breach agreements, our reputation could be harmed, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected.  In addition, since we have consolidated certain of our operations and various production and distribution facilities, we are more likely to experience an interruption of our operations in the event of a catastrophic event in any one location, such as through acts of war or terrorism, fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes or other natural or man-made disasters.  Although we carry insurance for property damage and business interruption, certain catastrophes are not covered by our insurance policies as we believe this to be a prudent financial decision.  Economic conditions and uncertainties in global markets may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain insurance.  If our insurance coverage is adversely affected, or to the extent we have elected to self-insure, we may be at greater risk that we may experience an adverse impact to our financial results.  We take steps to minimize the damage that would be caused by a catastrophic event, but there is no certainty that our efforts would prove successful.  If one or more significant uninsured events occur, we could suffer a major financial loss.



Raw materials purchased under short-term supply contracts and limited group of suppliers of glass bottles

Our business is heavily dependent upon raw materials, such as grapes, grape juice concentrate, grains, alcohol and packaging materials from third-party suppliers.  We could experience raw material supply, production or shipment difficulties that could adversely affect our ability to supply goods to our customers.  Increases in the costs of raw materials also directly affect us.  The prices for raw materials and packaging materials from third-party suppliers fluctuate depending upon market conditions.  For example, in the past, we have experienced dramatic increases in the cost of grapes.  Although we believe we have adequate sources of grape supplies, we could experience shortages if the demand for particular wine products exceeds expectations.

The wine industry swings between cycles of grape oversupply and undersupply.  In a severe oversupply environment, the ability of wine producers, including ourselves, to raise prices is limited, and, in certain situations, the competitive environment may put pressure on producers to lower prices.  Further, although an oversupply may enhance opportunities to purchase grapes at lower costs, a producer’s selling and promotional expenses associated with the sale of its wine products can rise in such an environment.  Substantial increases in the prices of raw materials and packaging materials, including those from third-party suppliers, to the extent they cannot be recouped through increases in the price of our finished products, would increase our operating costs and could decrease our profitability.  Our net sales could be impacted negatively if our customers cannot afford our products.

Glass bottle costs are one of our largest components of cost of product sold.  We currently purchase from ABI all of the glass bottles for our Mexican Beer Brands.  In the U.S. and Canada, glass bottles have only a small number of producers.  Currently, one producer supplies most of our glass container requirements for our U.S. operations and a portion of our glass container requirements for our Canadian operations, with the remaining portion of our glass container requirements for our Canadian operations supplied by another producer.  The inability of any of our glass bottle suppliers to satisfy our requirements could adversely affect our business.

Various diseases, pests and certain weather conditions

Various diseases, pests, fungi, viruses, drought, frosts and certain other weather conditions could affect the quality and quantity of grapes and other agricultural raw materials available, decreasing the supply of our products and negatively impacting profitability.  We cannot guarantee that our grape suppliers or our suppliers of other agricultural raw materials will succeed in preventing contamination in existing vineyards or fields or that we will succeed in preventing contamination in our existing vineyards or future vineyards we may acquire.  Future government restrictions regarding the use of certain materials used in growing grapes or other agricultural raw materials may increase vineyard costs and/or reduce production of grapes or other crops.  Growing agricultural raw materials also requires adequate water supplies.  A substantial reduction in water supplies could result in material losses of grape crops and vines or other crops, which could lead to a shortage of our product supply.

Climate change, or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change

Our business depends upon agricultural activity and natural resources.  There has been much public discussion related to concerns that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters.  Severe weather events, such as the recent drought in California and prolonged cold winter in New York, and climate change may negatively affect agricultural productivity in the regions from which we presently source our various agricultural raw materials.  Decreased availability of our raw materials may increase the cost of goods for our products.  Severe weather events or changes in the frequency or intensity of weather events can also disrupt our supply chain, which may affect production operations, insurance cost and coverage, as well as delivery of our products to wholesalers, retailers and consumers.

Import and excise duties or other taxes or government

The U.S., Canada and other countries in which we operate impose import and excise duties and other taxes on beverage alcohol products in varying amounts which are subject to change.  Significant increases in import and



excise duties or other taxes on beverage alcohol products could materially and adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.  The U.S. federal budget and individual state, provincial or local municipal budget deficits could result in increased taxes on our products, business, customers or consumers.  Various proposals to increase taxes on beverage alcohol products have been made at the federal and state or provincial level in recent years.  Many U.S. states have considered proposals to increase, and some of these states have increased, state alcohol excise taxes.  There may be further consideration by federal, state, provincial, local and foreign governmental entities to increase taxes upon beverage alcohol products as governmental entities explore available alternatives for raising funds during the current macroeconomic climate.  In addition, federal, state, provincial, local and foreign governmental agencies extensively regulate the beverage alcohol products industry concerning such matters as licensing, warehousing, trade and pricing practices, permitted and required labeling, advertising and relations with wholesalers and retailers.  Certain federal, state or provincial regulations also require warning labels and signage.  New or revised regulations or increased licensing fees, requirements or taxes could also have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.

Benefit cost increases

Our profitability is affected by employee medical costs and other employee benefits.  In recent years, employee medical costs have increased due to factors such as the increase in health care costs in the U.S.  These factors, plus the enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in March 2010, are expected to continue to put pressure on our business and financial performance due to higher employee benefit costs.  Although we actively seek to control increases in employee benefit costs and encourage employees to maintain healthy lifestyles to reduce future potential medical costs, there can be no assurance that we will succeed in limiting future cost increases.  Continued employee benefit cost increases could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

Intangible assets, such as goodwill and trademarks

We continue to have a significant amount of intangible assets such as goodwill and trademarks and may acquire more intangible assets in the future.  Intangible assets are subject to a periodic impairment evaluation under applicable accounting standards.  The write-down of any of these intangible assets could materially and adversely affect our net income.

Class action or other litigation relating to alcohol abuse, the misuse of alcohol, product liability, or marketing or sales practices

There has been public attention directed at the beverage alcohol industry, which we believe is due to concern over problems related to harmful use of alcohol, including drinking and driving, underage drinking and health consequences from the misuse of alcohol.  We also could be exposed to lawsuits relating to product liability or marketing or sales practices.  Adverse developments in lawsuits concerning these types of matters or a significant decline in the social acceptability of beverage alcohol products that may result from lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Damage to our reputation

Maintaining a good reputation is critical to selling our branded products.  Product contamination or tampering or the failure to maintain our standards for product quality, safety and integrity, including with respect to raw materials obtained from suppliers, may reduce demand for our products or cause production and delivery disruptions.  Although we maintain standards for the materials and product components we receive from our suppliers, and we also audit our suppliers’ compliance with our standards, it is possible that a supplier may not provide materials or product components which meet our required standards or may falsify documentation associated with the fulfillment of those requirements.  If any of our products becomes unfit for consumption, is misbranded or causes injury, we may have to engage in a product recall and/or be subject to liability and incur additional costs.  A widespread product recall or a significant product liability judgment could cause our products to be unavailable for a period of time, which could further reduce consumer demand and brand equity.  Our reputation



could be impacted negatively by public perception, adverse publicity (whether or not valid), negative comments in social media, or our responses relating to:

•

a perceived failure to maintain high ethical, social and environmental standards for all of our operations and activities;

•

a perceived failure to address concerns related to the quality, safety or integrity of our products;

•

our environmental impact, including use of agricultural materials, packaging, water and energy use and waste management; or

•

efforts that are perceived as insufficient to promote the responsible use of alcohol.

Failure to comply with local laws and regulations, to maintain an effective system of internal controls, to provide accurate and timely financial statement information, or to protect our information systems against service interruptions, misappropriation of data or breaches of security, could also hurt our reputation.  Damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence in our products for any of these or other reasons could result in decreased demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation, competitive position and brand equity.

Dependence upon trademarks and proprietary rights, failure to protect our intellectual property rights

Our future success depends significantly on our ability to protect our current and future brands and products and to defend our intellectual property rights.  We have been granted numerous trademark registrations covering our brands and products and have filed, and expect to continue to file, trademark applications seeking to protect newly-developed brands and products.  We cannot be sure that trademark registrations will be issued with respect to any of our trademark applications.  There is also a risk that we could, by omission, fail to timely renew or protect a trademark or that our competitors will challenge, invalidate or circumvent any existing or future trademarks issued to, or licensed by, us.

Contamination

The success of our brands depends upon the positive image that consumers have of those brands.  Contamination, whether arising accidentally or through deliberate third-party action, or other events that harm the integrity or consumer support for our brands, could adversely affect their sales.  Contaminants in raw materials purchased from third parties and used in the production of our beer, wine or spirits products or defects in the fermentation or distillation process could lead to low beverage quality as well as illness among, or injury to, consumers of our products and may result in reduced sales of the affected brand or all of our brands.

Cost of energy or environmental regulatory compliance

We have experienced increases in energy costs, and energy costs could continue to rise, which would result in higher transportation, freight and other operating costs.  We may experience significant future increases in the costs associated with environmental regulatory compliance, including fees, licenses, and the cost of capital improvements to our operating facilities in order to meet environmental regulatory requirements.  Our future operating expenses and margins will be dependent on our ability to manage the impact of cost increases.  We cannot guarantee that we will be able to pass along increased energy costs or increased costs associated with environmental regulatory compliance to our customers through increased prices.

In addition, we may be party to various environmental remediation obligations arising in the normal course of our business or in connection with historical activities of businesses we acquire.  Due to regulatory complexities, uncertainties inherent in litigation and the risk of unidentified contaminants in our current and former properties, the potential exists for remediation, liability and indemnification costs to differ materially from the costs that we have estimated.  We cannot assure you that our costs in relation to these matters will not exceed our projections or otherwise have an adverse effect upon our business reputation, financial condition or results of operations.

Item 3.  Legal Proceedings.

In the ordinary course of their business, the Company and its subsidiaries are subject to lawsuits, arbitrations, claims and other legal proceedings in connection with their business.  Some of the legal actions include claims for substantial or unspecified compensatory and/or punitive damages.  A substantial adverse judgment or other unfavorable resolution of these matters could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  Management believes that the Company has adequate legal defenses with respect to the legal proceedings to which it is a defendant or respondent and that the outcome of these pending proceedings is not likely to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations or cash flows of the Company.  However, the Company is unable to predict the outcome of these matters.

Regulatory Matters – The Company and its subsidiaries are in discussions with various governmental agencies concerning matters raised during regulatory examinations or otherwise subject to such agencies’ inquiry.  These matters could result in censures, fines or other sanctions.  Management believes the outcome of any pending regulatory matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.  However, the Company is unable to predict the outcome of these matters.

As previously reported in the Company’s Forms 10-Q for the fiscal quarters ended May 31, 2013, August

31, 2013 and November 30, 2013, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia (“District Court”) signed the Stipulation and Order filed by the DOJ, permitting the Company and ABI to consummate the Beer Business Acquisition.  After expiration of the 60-day public comment period as required under the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, the DOJ moved the District Court for entry of the Final Judgment. The Final Judgment was signed on October 21, 2013, and entered into the District Court’s docket on October 24, 2013, without modification to the terms included in the Proposed Final Judgment.  The Company is operating in accordance with the requirements of the Final Judgment.

As previously reported in the Company’s Forms 10-Q for the fiscal quarters ended May 31, 2013, August

31, 2013, and November 30, 2013, an action had been filed by private parties against the Company, ABI, and Modelo alleging certain antitrust claims and seeking to enjoin the proposed transaction between ABI and Modelo.  On June 4, 2013, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California denied plaintiff’s Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order and the transaction between ABI and Modelo was consummated June 7, 2013.  Plaintiffs’ Second Amended and Supplemental Complaint was filed June 25, 2013, and dismissed by the Court on September 13, 2013, and the district judge denied plaintiffs’ other procedural motions.  Plaintiffs’ filed their Motion for Relief from Judgment Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e) or 60(b), or in the alternative, Rule 60(d) on November 11, 2013 and was denied by the Court on January 24, 2014.  Plaintiffs filed their Notice of Appeal on February 21, 2014.  Management believes that this action is baseless and without merit and the Company intends to continue to defend itself vigorously against this claim.

Item 4.  Mine Safety Disclosures.

Item 7.  Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Introduction

This MD&A, which should be read in conjunction with our Financial Statements, provides additional information on our businesses, current developments, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.  It is organized as follows:

•

Overview.

This section provides a general description of our business, which we believe is important in understanding the results of our operations, financial condition and potential future trends.

•

Strategy.

This section provides a description of our strategy on a business segment basis and discussion of recent acquisitions.

•

Results of operations.

This section provides an analysis of our results of operations presented on a business segment basis.  In addition, a brief description of transactions and other items that affect the comparability of the results is provided.

•

Financial liquidity and capital resources.

This section provides an analysis of our cash flows and our outstanding debt and commitments.  Included in the analysis of outstanding debt is a discussion of the amount of financial capacity available to fund our ongoing operations and future commitments, as well as a discussion of other financing arrangements.

•

Critical accounting estimates.

This section identifies those accounting policies that are considered important to our results of operations and financial condition, require significant judgment and involve significant management estimates.  Our significant accounting policies, including those considered to be critical accounting policies, are summarized in Note 1 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.

Overview

We are a leading international beverage alcohol company with a broad portfolio of consumer-preferred premium imported beer, wine and spirits brands complemented by other select beverage alcohol products.  We are the third-largest producer and marketer of beer for the U.S. market and the world’s leading premium wine company.  We are the largest Multi-category Supplier of beverage alcohol in the U.S., the leading producer and marketer of wine in Canada, and a leading producer and exporter of wine from New Zealand and Italy.

Our internal management financial reporting consists of

two

business divisions:  (i)  Beer and (ii)  Wine and Spirits, and we report our operating results in

three

segments:  (i)  Beer (imported beer), (ii)  Wine and Spirits (wine and spirits), and (iii)  Corporate Operations and Other.  The business segments reflect how our operations are managed, how operating performance is evaluated by senior management and the structure of our internal financial reporting.  Amounts included in the Corporate Operations and Other segment consist of costs of executive management, corporate development, corporate finance, human resources, internal audit, investor relations, legal, public relations and global information technology.  The amounts included in the Corporate Operations and Other segment are general costs that are applicable to the consolidated group and are therefore not allocated to the other reportable segments.  All costs reported within the Corporate Operations and Other segment are not included in our chief operating decision maker’s evaluation of the operating income performance of the other reportable segments.



Strategy

Our business strategy in the Beer segment is twofold:  (i)  continued focus on growing the premium Mexican beer portfolio in the U.S. through expanding distribution for key brands, as well as new product development and innovation within the existing portfolio of brands, and (ii)  completion of the required Brewery expansion in Mexico by December 31, 2016, with a goal to complete the expansion within three years from the date of acquisition (see additional discussion below under “Acquisitions

-

Beer Business Acquisition”).

Our business strategy in the Wine and Spirits segment is centered on continued focus on consumer-preferred premium wine brands, complemented by premium spirits.  In this segment, we continue to focus on growing premium product categories.  We have consolidated our U.S. distribution network in markets where it was feasible, which currently represents about 70% of our branded wine and spirits volume in the U.S., in order to obtain dedicated selling resources which focus on our U.S. wine and spirits portfolio to drive organic growth.  Throughout the terms of these contracts, we generally expect shipments on an annual basis to these distributors (“Shipments”) to essentially equal the distributors’ shipments to retailers (“Depletions”).  In addition, we dedicate a large share of our sales and marketing resources to our U.S. Focus Brands as they represent a majority of our U.S. wine and spirits revenue and profitability, and have strong positions in their respective price segments.

We believe the current overall supply of wine is generally in balance with demand within the U.S.  The calendar 2013 U.S. grape harvest overall yield came in similar to the calendar 2012 U.S. grape harvest.  Accordingly, we expect that the calendar 2013 U.S. grape harvest may continue to provide some relief from the recent tightening of supply within certain U.S. varietals due to relatively smaller U.S. grape harvests in calendar 2011 and calendar 2010.

We remain committed to our long-term financial model of growing sales, expanding margins and increasing cash flow in order to achieve earnings per share growth and reduce borrowings.

Marketing, sales and distribution of our products are managed on a geographic basis in order to fully leverage leading market positions.  In addition, market dynamics and consumer trends vary across each of our markets.  Within our primary market in the U.S., we offer a range of beverage alcohol products across the imported beer, branded wine and spirits categories, with separate distribution networks utilized for our imported beer portfolio and our wine and spirits portfolio.  Within our next largest market in Canada, we offer a range of beverage alcohol products primarily across the branded wine category.  The environment for our products is competitive in each of our markets.

Acquisitions

Beer Business Acquisition

In June 2013, we completed the Beer Business Acquisition for an aggregate purchase price of

$5,226.4 million

.  The Beer Business Acquisition resulted in the acquisition of:

•

the remaining

50%

equity interest in Crown Imports;

•

all of the equity interests of a company which owns and operates the Brewery and of a company which provides personnel and services for the operation and maintenance of the Brewery; and

•

an irrevocable, fully-paid license to produce in Mexico (or worldwide under certain circumstances) and exclusively import, market and sell Modelo’s Mexican beer portfolio sold in the U.S. and Guam as of the date of the acquisition, and certain extensions.

In connection with the Beer Business Acquisition, we are required to build out and expand the Brewery to a nominal capacity of at least 20 million hectoliters of packaged beer annually by December 31, 2016.  In addition, an interim supply agreement and a transition services agreement were entered into in association with the Beer Business Acquisition.  The interim supply agreement obligates the supplier to provide us with a supply of product not produced by the Brewery and the transition services agreement provides for certain specified services and production materials, both for a specified period of time.  The associated agreements provide, among other things,



that the United States will have approval rights, in its sole discretion, for amendments or modifications to the associated agreements and the United States will have a right of approval, in its sole discretion, of any extension of the term of the interim supply agreement beyond three years.  The Beer Business Acquisition has positioned us as the third-largest producer and marketer of beer for the U.S. market and the largest Multi-category Supplier of beverage alcohol in the U.S.

The results of operations of the Beer Business Acquisition are reported in the Beer segment and are included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition.  It is a significant acquisition that has had and will continue to have a material impact on our future results of operations, financial position and cash flows.

Mark West

In July 2012, we acquired Mark West for

$159.3 million

.  The transaction primarily includes the acquisition of the Mark West trademark, related inventories and certain grape supply contracts.  The results of operations of Mark West are reported in the Wine and Spirits segment and are included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition.

Ruffino

In October 2011, we acquired the remaining 50.1% equity interest in Ruffino (which we did not previously own) for €50.3 million ($68.6 million).  As a result of this acquisition, we assumed indebtedness of Ruffino, net of cash acquired, of €54.2 million ($73.1 million).  The results of operations of the Ruffino business are reported in the Wine and Spirits segment and are included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition.

For more information on these acquisitions see Note 3 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.

Results of Operations

Financial Highlights

Financial Highlights for

Fiscal 2014

:

•

Our Beer Business Acquisition solidified our position in the U.S. beer market for the long term and makes us the third-largest brewer and seller of beer for the U.S. market.  Combining this with our strong position in wine and spirits makes us the largest Multi-category Supplier of beverage alcohol in the U.S.  In addition, the Beer Business Acquisition resulted in the realization of operating efficiencies and the strengthening of relationships with wholesalers and distributors.

•

Our net sales increased

74%

primarily due to the Beer Business Acquisition and strong consumer demand within the Mexican beer portfolio.

•

Operating income increased significantly primarily due to a nontaxable gain on the remeasurement to fair value of our preexisting 50% equity interest in Crown Imports combined with the benefit from the Beer Business Acquisition, partially offset by an impairment of nondeductible goodwill and intangible assets for the Wine and Spirits segment’s Canadian reporting unit.

•

Net income also increased significantly primarily due to the items discussed above, partially offset by lower equity in earnings (Crown Imports) and an increase in interest expense, net, driven largely by financing for the Beer Business Acquisition.

•

The significant increase in our diluted earnings per share resulted largely from the Beer Business Acquisition.



References to organic throughout the following discussion exclude the impact of branded wine acquired in the acquisitions of Mark West and Ruffino, as appropriate.

Unusual items

Management excludes items that affect comparability (“Unusual Items”) from its evaluation of the results of each operating segment as these Unusual Items are not reflective of continuing operations of the segments.  Segment operating performance and segment management compensation is evaluated based upon continuing segment operating income.  As such, the performance measures for incentive compensation purposes for segment management do not include the impact of these items.

As more fully described herein and in the related Notes to the Financial Statements, the Unusual Items that impacted comparability in our results for each period are as follows:

Cost of Product Sold

Inventory Step-Up

In connection with acquisitions, the allocation of purchase price in excess of book value for certain inventory on hand at the date of acquisition is referred to as inventory step-up.  Inventory step-up represents an assumed manufacturing profit attributable to the acquired company prior to acquisition.  For

Fiscal 2014

,

Fiscal 2013

and

Fiscal 2012

, flow through of inventory step-up was primarily related to the Beer Business Acquisition, the Mark West acquisition and the Ruffino acquisition, respectively.

Favorable Interim Supply Agreement

In connection with the Beer Business Acquisition, a temporary supply agreement was negotiated under a favorable pricing arrangement for the required volume of beer needed to fulfill U.S. demand in excess of the Brewery’s capacity until the Brewery acquires the necessary capacity to fulfill 100% of the U.S. demand.  For

Fiscal 2014

, amortization of favorable interim supply agreement reflects amounts associated with non-Brewery product purchased from the date of acquisition which has been sold to our U.S. customers during

Fiscal 2014

.



Other Costs

For

Fiscal 2014

, other costs represent unrealized gains from the mark to fair value of undesignated commodity swap contracts which are reported outside of segment operating results until such time that the underlying exposure is realized in the segment operating results.  At that time, the realized gains or losses from the mark to fair value of the undesignated commodity swap contracts are reported in the appropriate operating segment, allowing our operating segments to realize the economic effects of the commodity swap contracts without the resulting unrealized mark to fair value volatility.

For

Fiscal 2012

, other costs represent amounts recognized in connection with certain of our restructuring activities.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

Transaction and Related Costs Associated With Pending and Completed Acquisitions

For

Fiscal 2014

and

Fiscal 2013

, transaction and related costs were associated primarily with the Beer Business Acquisition.

Deferred Compensation

For Fiscal 2014, deferred compensation relates to a prior period correction of previously unrecognized deferred compensation costs that were associated with certain employment agreements.

Restructuring Charges and Other

For

Fiscal 2014

,

Fiscal 2013

and Fiscal 2012, restructuring charges and other consist primarily of restructuring and related charges associated with previously announced restructuring plans as well as certain (gains) losses on prior period acquisitions and divestitures.

Impairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets

For

Fiscal 2014

, we recorded impairment losses of

$300.9 million

for the second quarter consisting of impairments of goodwill and certain trademarks of

$278.7 million

and

$22.2 million

, respectively, related to our Wine and Spirits segment’s Canadian reporting unit.  No such impairments were recorded for Fiscal 2013.  For Fiscal 2012, we recorded an impairment loss for the fourth quarter consisting of impairments of certain trademarks related to our Wine and Spirits segment’s Canadian business.

Gain on Remeasurement to Fair Value of Equity Method Investment

Prior to the Beer Business Acquisition, we accounted for our investment in Crown Imports under the equity method of accounting.  In applying the acquisition method of accounting, our preexisting 50% equity interest was remeasured to its estimated fair value of

$1,845.0 million

, and we recognized a gain of

$1,642.0 million

for the second quarter of Fiscal 2014 in connection with the Beer Business Acquisition.

Loss on Write-off of Financing Costs

We recorded a loss on the write-off of financing costs for Fiscal 2013 primarily in connection with the redemption of the August 2012 Senior Notes.



Fiscal 2014

Compared to

Fiscal 2013

Net Sales

The following table sets forth net sales for each of our reportable segments for

Fiscal 2014

and

Fiscal 2013

.

Net sales

increased

to

$4,867.7 million

for

Fiscal 2014

from

$2,796.1 million

for

Fiscal 2013

,

an increase

of

$2,071.6 million

, or

74%

.  This

increase

resulted primarily from

$2,022.2 million

of net sales of products acquired in the Beer Business Acquisition.  Prior to the Beer Business Acquisition, the results of operations of the Beer segment were eliminated in consolidation as our preexisting 50% equity interest in Crown Imports was accounted for under the equity method of accounting.

Beer

(1)

Depletions are based on third party data.

The

increase

in net sales for the Beer segment resulted primarily from volume growth within the Mexican beer portfolio which benefited from continued consumer demand and increased advertising spend, combined with a favorable impact from pricing in select markets.



Wine and Spirits

The increase in net sales for the Wine and Spirits segment is due primarily to

an increase

in wine net sales of

$58.4 million

, or

2%

.  This

increase

resulted primarily from organic branded wine volume growth (predominantly in the U.S.) and $18.6 million of net sales of branded wine acquired in the acquisition of Mark West, partially offset by higher promotional expense and unfavorable product mix (predominantly within the organic U.S. branded wine portfolio) and an unfavorable year-over-year foreign currency translation impact of $18.5 million.  Spirits net sales

decreased

$9.0 million

, or

(3%)

, primarily due to lower bulk spirits net sales and higher promotional expense.

For the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we expect a low-to-mid single-digit percent decrease in wine and spirits net sales from the first quarter of fiscal 2014 as we work with one of our exclusive distributors to reduce their inventory levels.  However, gross profit for the first quarter of fiscal 2015 is not expected to be significantly impacted as a result of this inventory reduction as the distributor is contractually required to pay us an amount approximately equal to the profit lost on the reduced sales.

Gross Profit

Gross profit

increased

to

$1,991.7 million

for

Fiscal 2014

from

$1,108.3 million

for

Fiscal 2013

,

an increase

of

$883.4 million

, or

80%

.  This

increase

is primarily due to gross profit from the Beer Business Acquisition of

$890.6 million

, partially offset by

an increase

in Unusual Items of

$8.2 million

.

The Beer segment’s gross profit

increased

$376.7 million

, or

50%

, primarily due to incremental gross profit from the Brewery Purchase, the favorable impact from pricing in select markets and the volume growth.

Wine and Spirits’ gross profit increased slightly, primarily due to the organic branded wine volume growth, partially offset by the higher promotional expense and higher branded wine product costs.

Gross profit as a percent of net sales

increased

to

40.9%

for

Fiscal 2014

compared to

39.6%

for

Fiscal 2013

primarily due to the benefit from the Beer Business Acquisition, partially offset by the higher wine and spirits promotional expense and the

increase

in Unusual Items.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

Selling, general and administrative expenses

increased

to

$895.1 million

for

Fiscal 2014

from

$585.4 million

for

Fiscal 2013

,

an increase

of

$309.7 million

, or

53%

.  This

increase

is due to

$260.3 million

of selling, general and administrative expenses from the Beer Business Acquisition, combined with increases in (i)  Unusual



items of

$29.7 million

, (ii)  Wine and Spirits of

$13.4 million

and (iii)  Corporate Operations and Other of

$6.3 million

.

The Beer segment’s selling, general and administrative expenses

increased

$51.8 million

, or

17%

, primarily due to increases in general and administrative expenses, advertising expenses and selling expenses.  The increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily attributable to higher allocated information technology expense in the Beer segment (which was offset by a decrease in allocated information technology expense in the Wine and Spirits segment) and higher compensation and benefit costs associated largely with higher annual management incentive expense.  Information technology expense is allocated to each of our segments to reflect utilization of central support services and costs associated with our information technology systems.  The reallocation of information technology expense resulted from the Beer Business Acquisition and the associated consolidation of the Beer segment’s results of operations.  The increase in advertising expenses is due largely to planned investment behind the Mexican beer portfolio.  The increase in selling expenses is due largely to increased headcount to support the Beer segment’s growth.

The

increase

in Wine and Spirits’ selling, general and administrative expenses is primarily due to an increase in selling expenses of $15.4 million and advertising expenses of $4.4 million, partially offset by a decrease in general and administrative expenses of $6.4 million.  The increase in selling and advertising expenses is driven largely by a planned increase in spend behind the segment’s branded wine and spirits portfolio.  The decrease in general and administrative expenses is primarily attributable to the lower allocated information technology expense discussed above, partially offset by a number of smaller increases in certain general and administrative expenses supporting the Wine and Spirits’ branded portfolio.

The

increase

in Corporate Operations and Other’s selling, general and administrative expenses is primarily due to an increase in general and administrative expenses primarily attributable to higher compensation and benefit costs associated largely with higher annual management incentive expense.

Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales

decreased

to

18.4%

for

Fiscal 2014

as compared to

20.9%

for

Fiscal 2013

primarily due to the Beer Business Acquisition and the associated lower fixed overhead, partially offset by the higher Unusual Items.

Operating Income

The following table sets forth operating income (loss) for each of our reportable segments for

Fiscal 2014

and

Fiscal 2013

.

NM = Not Meaningful

As a result of the factors discussed above, consolidated operating income

increased

to

$2,437.7 million

for

Fiscal 2014

from

$522.9 million

for

Fiscal 2013

,

an increase

of

$1,914.8 million

is primarily due to lower equity in earnings of Crown Imports as a result of the Beer Business Acquisition and the consolidation of Crown Imports’ results of operations from the date of acquisition.

Interest Expense, Net

Interest expense, net of interest income of

$7.7 million

and

$6.8 million

for

Fiscal 2014

and

Fiscal 2013

, respectively,

increased

to

$323.2 million

for

Fiscal 2014

from

$227.1 million

for

Fiscal 2013

,

an increase

of

$96.1 million

, or

42%

.  The

increase

was driven largely by higher average borrowings, partially offset by a lower weighted average interest rate on outstanding borrowings, both due primarily to the issuance of the May 2013 Senior Notes and borrowings under the 2013 Credit Agreement.

Provision for Income Taxes

Our effective tax rate for

Fiscal 2014

and

Fiscal 2013

was

11.8%

and

24.9%

, respectively.  Our effective tax rate for

Fiscal 2014

was favorably impacted by the Beer Business Acquisition, primarily attributable to the recognition of the nontaxable gain on the remeasurement to fair value of our preexisting 50% equity interest in Crown Imports of

$1,642.0 million

, partially offset by the write-off of nondeductible goodwill of

$278.7 million

.  Our effective tax rate for

Fiscal 2013

was substantially impacted by the benefit from additional foreign tax credits.

We expect our effective tax rate for each of the next three fiscal years to be in the range of 30% to 32% primarily attributable to the Beer Business Acquisition.

Net Income

As a result of the above factors, net income

increased

to

$1,943.1 million

for

Fiscal 2014

from

$387.8 million

for

Fiscal 2013

, an increase of

$1,555.3 million

Net Sales

The following table sets forth net sales for each of our reportable segments for

Fiscal 2013

and

Fiscal 2012

.

Net sales

increased

to

$2,796.1 million

for

Fiscal 2013

from

$2,654.3 million

for

Fiscal 2012

,

an increase

of

$141.8 million

, or

5%

.  This

increase

resulted primarily from (i)  organic U.S. branded wine and spirits volume growth, (ii)  $55.5 million of net sales of branded wine acquired in the acquisitions of Mark West and Ruffino and (iii)  favorable product mix shift in the organic branded wine and spirits portfolio (predominately in the U.S.), partially offset by higher promotional spend (predominately within the organic U.S. branded wine portfolio).



Beer

(1)

Depletions are based on third party data.

The

increase

in net sales for the Beer segment resulted primarily from volume growth within the Mexican beer portfolio which benefited from continued consumer demand and increased advertising spend, partially offset by the loss of the St. Pauli Girl brand volume.

Wine and Spirits

The increase in net sales for the Wine and Spirits segment is due to

an increase

in wine net sales of

$109.0 million

, or

5%

, and

an increase

in spirits net sales of

$32.8 million

, or

12%

.  The

increase

in wine net sales resulted primarily from (i)  organic U.S. branded wine volume growth, (ii)  $55.5 million of net sales of branded wine acquired in the acquisitions of Mark West and Ruffino, and (iii)  favorable product mix shift in the organic branded wine portfolio (predominately in the U.S.), partially offset by higher promotional spend (predominantly within the organic U.S. branded wine portfolio).  The

increase

in spirits net sales resulted primarily from favorable product mix shift and volume growth within the branded spirits portfolio, combined with higher bulk spirits net sales.

Gross Profit

Gross profit

increased

to

$1,108.3 million

for

Fiscal 2013

from

$1,062.1 million

for

Fiscal 2012

,

an increase

of

$46.2 million

, or

4%

.  The increase in gross profit is due to an increase in Wine and Spirits gross profit of

$52.1 million

, partially offset by

an increase

in Unusual Items of

$5.9 million

.

The

increase

in Wine and Spirits gross profit is primarily due to (i)  gross profit of $34.2 million from the acquisitions of Ruffino and Mark West, (ii)  favorable product mix shift in the organic branded wine and spirits portfolio, and (iii)  higher volumes in the organic U.S. branded wine and spirits portfolio, partially offset by the higher promotional spend.



The Beer segment’s gross profit increased

$34.4 million

, or

5%

, primarily due to volume growth within the Mexican beer portfolio.

Gross profit as a percent of net sales

decreased

slightly to

39.6%

for

Fiscal 2013

from

40.0%

for

Fiscal 2012

primarily due to the factors discussed above.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

Selling, general and administrative expenses

increased

to

$585.4 million

for

Fiscal 2013

from

$537.5 million

for

Fiscal 2012

,

an increase

of

$47.9 million

, or

9%

.  This

increase

is due to increases in (i)  the Wine and Spirits segment of

$23.8 million

, (ii)  Unusual Items of

$12.5 million

and (iii)  the Corporate Operations and Other segment of

$11.6 million

.

The

increase

in Wine and Spirits’ selling, general and administrative expenses is primarily due to increases in general and administrative expenses of $12.2 million, advertising expenses of $5.9 million and selling expenses of $5.7 million.  The increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to an overlap of a prior year favorable legal settlement in the U.S. related to the use of a certain intangible asset, combined with an increase in general and administrative expenses associated with the acquisition of Ruffino.  The increases in advertising and selling expenses is primarily due to a planned increase in spend behind the segment’s branded wine and spirits portfolio.

The increase in Corporate Operations and Other’s selling, general and administrative expenses is due to an increase in general and administrative expenses driven largely by an increase in higher compensation and benefits and other costs related to our initiative to implement a comprehensive, multi-year program to strengthen and enhance our global business capabilities and processes through the creation of an integrated technology platform, and an overlap of prior year net gains in connection with the early redemption of certain AFS debt securities from Accolade.

The Beer segment’s selling, general and administrative expenses increased $17.4 million, or 6%, primarily due to increases in advertising expenses and general and administrative expenses.  The increase in advertising expenses is due largely to planned investment behind the Mexican beer portfolio.  The increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to higher compensation and benefit costs, partially offset by a gain recognized in the second quarter of fiscal 2013 in connection with the receipt of a payment terminating the right to distribute the St. Pauli Girl beer brand.

Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales

increased

to

20.9%

for

Fiscal 2013

as compared to

20.3%

for

Fiscal 2012

primarily due to the factors discussed above, combined with the higher promotional spend.

Operating Income

The following table sets forth operating income (loss) for each of our reportable segments for

Fiscal 2013

and

Fiscal 2012

.



As a result of the factors discussed above, consolidated operating income

increased

to

$522.9 million

for

Fiscal 2013

from

$486.5 million

for

Fiscal 2012

, an increase of

$36.4 million

Equity in Earnings of Equity Method Investees

Our equity in earnings of equity method investees

increased

to

$233.1 million

for

Fiscal 2013

from

$228.5 million

for

Fiscal 2012

,

an increase

of

$4.6 million

, or

2%

.  This

increase

is primarily due to higher equity in earnings of our then existing Crown Imports joint venture, and our Opus One equity method investment, partially offset by lower equity in earnings from Ruffino as a result of the acquisition of Ruffino and the consolidation of Ruffino’s results of operations from the date of acquisition.

Interest Expense, Net

Interest expense, net of interest income of

from

$181.0 million

for

Fiscal 2012

,

an increase

of

$46.1 million

, or

25%

.  The

increase

was driven largely by higher average borrowings as we positioned ourselves for the expected funding of the then pending beer business acquisition.

Provision for Income Taxes

Our effective tax rate for

Fiscal 2013

and

Fiscal 2012

was

24.9%

and

16.7%

, respectively.  Our effective tax rate for

Fiscal 2013

was substantially impacted by the benefit from additional foreign tax credits.  Our effective tax rate for

Fiscal 2012

reflects decreases in uncertain tax positions of $85.2 million and other tax adjustments of $42.5 million in connection with the completion of various income tax examinations during

Fiscal 2012

and a change in the method of filing certain state income tax returns.

Net Income

As a result of the above factors, net income

decreased

Financial Liquidity and Capital Resources

General

Our principal use of cash in our operating activities is for purchasing and carrying inventories and carrying seasonal accounts receivable.  Our primary source of liquidity has historically been cash flow from operations, except during annual grape harvests when we have relied on short-term borrowings.  In the U.S., Canada and Italy, the annual grape crush normally begins in August and runs through October.  In New Zealand, the annual grape crush normally begins in February and runs through May.  We generally begin taking delivery of grapes at the beginning of the crush season with the majority of payments for such grapes coming due within 90 days.  Our short-term borrowings to support such purchases generally reach their highest levels one to two months after the crush season has ended.  Historically, we have used cash flow from operating activities to repay our short-term borrowings and fund capital expenditures.  We will continue to use our short-term borrowings, including our accounts receivable securitization facilities (see additional discussion below under “Accounts Receivable Securitization Facilities”), to support our working capital requirements.

We have maintained adequate liquidity to meet working capital requirements, fund capital expenditures and repay scheduled principal and interest payments on debt.  Absent deterioration of market conditions, we believe that cash flows from operating activities and financing activities, primarily short-term borrowings, will provide adequate resources to satisfy our working capital, scheduled principal and interest payments on debt, and anticipated capital expenditure requirements for both our short-term and long-term capital needs.



As of

April 22, 2014

, we had a borrowing capacity of

$835.2 million

available under our 2013 Credit Agreement.  The member financial institutions participating in our 2013 Credit Agreement have complied with prior funding requests and we believe the member financial institutions will comply with ongoing funding requests.  However, there can be no assurances that any particular financial institution will continue to do so in the future.  In addition, the CBI SPV and the Crown SPV have borrowing capacity available under their respective accounts receivable securitization facilities.

Cash Flows

Cash and cash investments (decreased) increased

($267.6) million

,

$245.7 million

and

$76.6 million

for

Fiscal 2014

,

Fiscal 2013

and

Fiscal 2012

, respectively.  Components of these changes are discussed in more detail below.

Operating Activities

Fiscal 2014

The net noncash items consisted primarily of the gain on remeasurement to fair value of our preexisting 50% equity interest in Crown Imports, partially offset by the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets and depreciation expense.  The net cash used in the net change in our operating assets and liabilities resulted primarily from a decrease in accounts payable of

$49.3 million

and an increase in inventories of

$41.1 million

, partially offset by an increase in other accrued expenses and liabilities of

$58.1 million

and a decrease in accounts receivable, net, of

$36.5 million

.  The decrease in accounts payable is primarily due to the timing of payments.  The increase in inventories is primarily due to higher U.S. wine inventory levels resulting largely from an above average calendar 2013 U.S. grape harvest combined with unfavorable product mix in net sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, partially offset by lower beer inventory levels due largely to timing as early June inventory levels from the Beer Business Acquisition were at higher levels (as compared to the end of February) to support the strong summer selling season for beer.  The increase in other accrued expenses and liabilities is largely due to increases in income taxes payable, accrued salaries and benefits, and accrued advertising and promotions.  The increase in income taxes payable is primarily due to higher taxable income driven by the Beer Business Acquisition.  The increase in accrued salaries and benefits is primarily due to higher annual management incentive expense.  The increase in accrued promotions and advertising is driven primarily by the increased U.S. promotional expense.  The decrease in accounts receivable, net, is due largely to timing as early June accounts receivable, net, levels from the Beer Business Acquisition were at higher levels (as compared to the the end of February) due to seasonality of the Beer segment’s net sales.

Fiscal 2013

The net noncash items consisted primarily of depreciation expense, stock-based compensation expense, and deferred tax provision.  Other, net, consisted primarily of an increase in deferred revenue.  The net cash used in the net change in our operating assets and liabilities resulted primarily from increases in inventories of

$90.0 million

and accounts receivable, net, of

$38.9 million

combined with an increase in Fiscal 2013 income tax payments of $86.7 million; partially offset by increases in accounts payable of

$76.9 million

, accrued interest of $33.7 million and accrued advertising and promotions of $20.6 million.  The increase in inventories is primarily due to increased purchases of bulk product to offset the lower harvests from recent years combined with higher grape costs.  The



increase in accounts payable is primarily due to timing of payments as well as increased purchasing of bulk inventory.  The increase in income tax payments is due largely to the receipt of an $85.5 million refund in the prior year associated with tax benefits recognized in connection with the CWAE Divestiture.  The increase in accounts receivable, net, is due largely to the net sales volume growth in the U.S branded wine and spirits portfolio, including the impact of the net sales from the acquisition of Mark West.  The increase in accrued interest is primarily due to timing of payments combined with higher average borrowings.  The increase in accrued promotions and advertising is driven primarily by the increased U.S. promotional spend.

Fiscal 2012

The net noncash items consisted primarily of depreciation expense, deferred tax provision, stock-based compensation expense and an impairment of intangible assets.  The net cash provided by the net change in our operating assets and liabilities resulted primarily from a decrease in inventories of

$51.5 million

and an increase in other accrued expenses and liabilities of

$44.6 million

.  The decrease in inventories is due primarily to a decrease in U.S. inventory levels driven largely by net sales volume growth during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 in the U.S. branded wine portfolio, combined with the lower U.S. calendar 2011 grape harvest.  The increase in other accrued expenses and liabilities is due largely to an increase in current income taxes payable due primarily to a refund of $85.5 million received in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 associated with the recognition of income tax benefits in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 in connection with the CWAE Divestiture.

Investing Activities

Purchase of business, net of cash acquired, for

Fiscal 2014

,

Fiscal 2013

and

Fiscal 2012

consist of net cash paid for the Beer Business Acquisition, the Mark West acquisition and the Ruffino acquisition, respectively.  Purchases of property, plant and equipment increased significantly in

Fiscal 2014

in connection with the Beer Business Acquisition and the associated Brewery expansion.

Financing Activities

For

Fiscal 2014

, proceeds from issuance of long-term debt include proceeds of $2,175.0 million and $1,550.0 million from term loan borrowings under the 2013 Credit Agreement and issuance of the May 2013 Senior Notes, respectively.  These proceeds were used to fund a portion of the Beer Business Acquisition.  For

Fiscal 2013

, proceeds from issuance of long-term debt include proceeds from the April 2012 Senior Notes and the August 2012 Senior Notes of $600.0 million and $650.0 million, respectively, combined with $800.0 million of proceeds from



term loan borrowings under our then existing senior credit facility.  A portion of the proceeds from the April 2012 Senior Notes and the term loan borrowings were used to repay the outstanding obligations under our then existing senior credit facility.  Proceeds from the August 2012 Senior Notes were intended to be used to fund a portion of the Beer Business Acquisition; however, due to differences between the terms of the initial June 2012 purchase agreement and an amended February 2013 purchase agreement, we determined that the conditions for the release of the previously escrowed proceeds could not be satisfied and we redeemed the August 2012 Senior Notes in February 2013.

For

Fiscal 2013

, principal payments of long-term debt consist primarily of the aforementioned repayment of outstanding obligations under our then existing senior credit facility and the redemption of the August 2012 Senior Notes.  For

Fiscal 2012

, principal payments of long-term debt consist primarily of a prepayment of $400.0 million of outstanding term loan facility under our then existing senior credit facility.

For

Fiscal 2013

and

Fiscal 2012

, purchases of treasury stock consist of share repurchases under our 2013 Authorization and 2012 Authorization (as further discussed below under “Share Repurchase Programs”).

Share Repurchase Programs

Our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $500.0 million of the Company’s Class A Common Stock and Class B Convertible Common Stock in April 2011 (the “2012 Authorization”) and the repurchase of up to $1.0 billion of the Company’s Class A Common Stock and Class B Convertible Common Stock in April 2012 (the “2013 Authorization”).  The results of those share repurchase programs are summarized in the following table.  The repurchased shares have become treasury shares.

For further information, refer to Note 15 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.

Debt

Total debt outstanding as of

February 28, 2014

, amounted to

$7,020.5 million

, an increase of

$3,715.1 million

from

February 28, 2013

.  This increase was due largely to the issuance of the $1,550.0 million May 2013 Senior Notes and $2,175.0 million in term loan borrowings under the 2013 Credit Agreement to fund a portion of the purchase price for the Beer Business Acquisition.  The following outlines our main components of debt and credit arrangements.  For further information, refer to Note 12 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.

Senior Credit Facility

In connection with the Beer Business Acquisition, in May 2013, we, together with our wholly-owned subsidiary, CIH, and the Lenders, entered into a Restatement Agreement that amended and restated our prior senior credit facility.  The Restatement Agreement, which had an effective date of June 7, 2013, was entered into to arrange a portion of the debt to finance the Beer Business Acquisition.  Our 2013 Credit Agreement is our senior credit facility as amended and restated by the Restatement Agreement.



The 2013 Credit Agreement provides for aggregate credit facilities of

$3,787.5 million

, consisting of the following:

(1)

Contractual interest rate varies based on our debt ratio and is a function of LIBOR plus a margin; or the base rate plus a margin.

(2)

Contractual interest rate varies based on our debt ratio and is a function of LIBOR, subject to a minimum rate of 0.75%, plus a margin; or the base rate, subject to a minimum rate of 1.75%, plus a margin.

(3)

Includes a sub-facility for letters of credit of up to $200.0 million.

The principal changes to our prior senior credit facility effected by the 2013 Credit Agreement are (i)  changes to the rate and term of the revolving credit facility and outstanding term loan facilities and a new

$675.0 million

delayed draw U.S. Term A-2 Facility that replaced the former delayed draw term A-2 facility, and (ii)  the creation of a

$1,500.0 million

delayed draw European term loan facility consisting of the

$500.0 million

European Term A Facility and the

$1,000.0 million

European Term B Facility.  We are the borrower under the U.S. term loan facilities.  CIH is the borrower under the European term loan facilities.  The 2013 Credit Agreement also modified the maximum net debt coverage ratio financial covenant.

The U.S. obligations under the 2013 Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain of our U.S. subsidiaries.  These obligations are also secured by a pledge of (i)

100%

of the ownership interests in certain of our U.S. subsidiaries and (ii)

65%

of the ownership interests in certain of our foreign subsidiaries.  We guarantee the European obligations under the 2013 Credit Agreement.  These obligations are also secured by a pledge of (i)

100%

of certain interests in certain of CIH’s subsidiaries and (ii)

100%

of the ownership interests in certain of our U.S. subsidiaries and

65%

of the ownership interests in certain of our foreign subsidiaries.

We and our subsidiaries are also subject to covenants that are contained in the 2013 Credit Agreement, including those restricting the incurrence of additional indebtedness (including guarantees of indebtedness), additional liens, mergers and consolidations, the payment of dividends, the making of certain investments, prepayments of certain debt, transactions with affiliates, agreements that restrict our non-guarantor subsidiaries from paying dividends, and dispositions of property, in each case subject to numerous conditions, exceptions and thresholds.  The financial covenants are limited to a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum net debt coverage ratio.

As of

February 28, 2014

, and

April 22, 2014

, information with respect to the Revolving Credit Facility under the 2013 Credit Agreement is as follows:



As of

February 28, 2014

, and

April 22, 2014

, outstanding borrowings and applicable interest rates under the term loans of the 2013 Credit Agreement are as follows:

As of

February 28, 2014

, the required principal repayments under the term loans of the 2013 Credit Agreement for each of the five succeeding fiscal years and thereafter are as follows:

In June 2010, we entered into a

five

year delayed start interest rate swap agreement effective September 1, 2011, which was designated as a cash flow hedge for

$500.0 million

of our floating LIBOR rate debt.  It fixes the interest rates on

$500.0 million

of our floating LIBOR rate debt at an average rate of

2.9%

(exclusive of borrowing margins) through September 1, 2016.  In April 2012, we transitioned our interest rate swap agreement to a

one-month LIBOR base rate

versus the then existing

three-month LIBOR base rate

by entering into a new interest rate swap agreement which was designated as a cash flow hedge for

$500.0 million

of our floating LIBOR rate debt.  In addition, the then existing interest rate swap agreement was dedesignated as a hedge.  We also entered into an additional interest rate swap agreement for

$500.0 million

that was not designated as a hedge to offset the prospective impact of the newly undesignated interest rate swap agreement.  As a result of these hedges, we have fixed our interest rates on

$500.0 million

of our floating LIBOR rate debt at an average rate of

2.8%

(exclusive of borrowing margins) through September 1, 2016.  The unrealized losses in AOCI related to the dedesignated interest rate swap agreement are being reclassified from AOCI ratably into earnings in the same period in which the original hedged item is recorded in income.  For

Fiscal 2014

,

Fiscal 2013

and

Fiscal 2012

, we reclassified net losses of

$8.2 million

,

$8.0 million

, and

$3.8 million

, net of income tax effect, respectively, from AOCI to interest expense, net.



Senior Notes

The following table presents information with respect to our Senior Notes outstanding as of

February 28, 2014

, and

February 28, 2013

:

(1)

The senior notes described above are redeemable, in whole or in part, at our option at any time at a redemption price equal to

100%

of the outstanding principal amount plus a make whole payment based on the present value of the future payments at the adjusted Treasury Rate plus


basis points.

(2)

Amounts are net of unamortized discounts, where applicable.

Indentures

Our indentures relating to our outstanding senior notes contain certain covenants, including, but not limited to:  (i)  a limitation on liens on certain assets; (ii)  a limitation on certain sale and leaseback transactions; and (iii)  restrictions on mergers, consolidations and the transfer of all or substantially all of our assets to another person.

Subsidiary Credit Facilities

We have additional credit arrangements totaling

$373.9 million

and

$371.5 million

as of

February 28, 2014

, and

February 28, 2013

, respectively.  These arrangements primarily support the financing needs of our domestic and foreign subsidiary operations.  Interest rates and other terms of these borrowings vary from country to country, depending on local market conditions.  As of

February 28, 2014

, and

February 28, 2013

, amounts outstanding under these arrangements were

$89.2 million

and

$46.9 million

, respectively.

Accounts Receivable Securitization Facilities

In December 2012, we entered into the CBI Facility, a


-day revolving trade accounts receivable securitization facility.  Under the CBI Facility, trade accounts receivable generated by us and certain of our subsidiaries are sold by us to our wholly-owned bankruptcy remote single purpose subsidiary, the CBI SPV, which is consolidated by us for financial reporting purposes.  Such receivables have been pledged by the CBI SPV to secure borrowings under the CBI Facility.  We service the receivables for the CBI Facility.  The receivable balances related to the CBI Facility are reported as accounts receivable on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, but the receivables are at all times owned by the CBI SPV and are included on our financial statements as required by generally accepted accounting principles.

In October 2013, the Company and the CBI SPV amended and restated the CBI Facility, effectively extending the CBI Facility through September 30, 2014.  The Amended CBI Facility provides borrowing capacity of

$190.0 million

up to

$290.0 million

to account for the seasonality of our business, subject to further limitations based upon various pre-agreed formulas.  As of

February 28, 2014

, the CBI SPV had

no

aggregate outstanding borrowings under the Amended CBI Facility.  As of

February 28, 2014

, the Company had

$275.0 million

available under the Amended CBI Facility.



Also, in October 2013, Crown Imports entered into the Crown Facility, a


-day revolving trade accounts receivable securitization facility.  Under the Crown Facility, trade accounts receivable generated by Crown Imports are sold to its wholly-owned bankruptcy remote single purpose subsidiary, the Crown SPV, which is consolidated by us for financial reporting purposes.  Such receivables have been pledged by the Crown SPV to secure borrowings under the Crown Facility.  Crown Imports services the receivables for the Crown Facility.  The receivable balances related to the Crown Facility are reported as accounts receivable on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, but the receivables are at all times owned by the Crown SPV and are included on our financial statements as required by generally accepted accounting principles.  The Crown Facility provides borrowing capacity of

$100.0 million

up to

$160.0 million

to account for the seasonality of Crown Imports’ business.  As of

February 28, 2014

, the Crown SPV had aggregate outstanding borrowings under the Crown Facility of

$19.2 million

bearing a weighted average interest rate of

1.1%

.  As of

February 28, 2014

, the Company had

$80.8 million

available under the Crown Facility.

Contractual Obligations and Commitments

The following table sets forth information about our long-term contractual obligations outstanding at

February 28, 2014

.  It brings together data for easy reference from our balance sheet and Notes to the Financial Statements.  See Notes 11, 12, 13 and 14 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for a detailed discussion of the items noted in the following table.

(1)

Interest rates on long-term debt obligations range from

2.2%

to

8.4%

as of

February 28, 2014

.  Interest payments on long-term debt obligations include amounts associated with our outstanding interest rate swap agreements to fix LIBOR interest rates on

$500.0 million

of our floating LIBOR rate debt.  Interest payments on long-term debt do not include interest related to capital lease obligations or certain foreign credit arrangements, which represent approximately

0.7%

of our total long-term debt, as amounts are not material.

(2)

Other long-term liabilities include $18.9 million associated with expected payments for unrecognized tax benefit liabilities as of

February 28, 2014

, $2.6 million of which is expected to be paid in the less than one year period.  The payments are reflected in the period in which we believe they will ultimately be settled based on our experience in these matters.  Other long-term liabilities do not include payments for unrecognized tax benefit liabilities of $82.6 million due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with these unrecognized tax benefit liabilities.  In addition, other long-term liabilities do not include expected payments for interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefit liabilities as amounts are not material.  See Note 13 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for a detailed discussion of these items.

(3)

Total purchase obligations consist of $

1,744.4 million

Total long-term contractual obligations exclude payment of

$558.0 million

for the additional purchase price of $543.3 million and imputed interest of $14.7 million in connection with the Beer Business Acquisition.  This amount is expected to be paid in the second quarter of fiscal 2015.



Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that either have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.

Capital Expenditures

During

Fiscal 2014

, we incurred

$223.5 million

for capital expenditures, including

$123.5 million

for the Brewery expansion.  Management reviews the capital expenditure program periodically and modifies it as required to meet current business needs.  We plan to spend from

$575 million

to

$625 million

for capital expenditures for Fiscal 2015, including from

$450 million

to

$500 million

for the Beer segment associated primarily with the Brewery expansion.  The remaining amounts consist of improvements of existing operating facilities and replacements of existing equipment and/or buildings.  In total, over the next

two

fiscal year periods, we expect to spend between

$775 million

to

$975 million

for capital expenditures associated with the Brewery expansion in connection with the Beer Business Acquisition.  The total Brewery expansion is estimated to be from

$900 million

to

$1.1 billion

.

Effects of Inflation and Changing Prices

Our results of operations and financial condition have not been significantly affected by inflation and changing prices.  We intend to pass along rising costs through increased selling prices, subject to normal competitive conditions.  There can be no assurances, however, that we will be able to pass along rising costs through increased selling prices.  In addition, we continue to identify on-going cost savings initiatives.

Critical Accounting Estimates

Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 of our Notes to the Financial Statements.  However, certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by management; as a result, they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty.  In applying those policies, management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates.  Those estimates are based on our historical experience, our observance of trends in the industry, information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate.  On an ongoing basis, we review our estimates to ensure that they appropriately reflect changes in our business.  Our critical accounting estimates include:

•

Goodwill and other intangible assets.

We account for goodwill and other intangible assets by classifying intangible assets into three categories:  (i)  intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization; (ii)  intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization; and (iii)  goodwill.  For intangible assets with definite lives, impairment testing is required if conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.  For intangible assets with indefinite lives and for goodwill, impairment testing is required at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that these assets might be impaired.  We perform annual impairment tests and re-evaluate the useful lives of other intangible assets with indefinite lives at the annual impairment test measurement date of January 1 or when circumstances arise that indicate a possible impairment might exist.  The guidance for goodwill impairment testing allows an entity to assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or to proceed directly to performing the two-step impairment test.  In the first step, the estimated fair value of each reporting unit is compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill.  The estimate of fair value of the reporting unit is generally determined on the basis of discounted future cash flows supplemented by the market approach.  If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, a second step is performed to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment we should record.  In the second step, an implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is determined by allocating the reporting unit’s fair value to all of its assets and liabilities other



than goodwill (including any unrecognized intangible assets).  The resulting implied fair value of the goodwill is compared to the carrying value of goodwill.  The amount of impairment charge for goodwill is equal to the excess of the carrying value of the goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill.  Our reporting units include the Beer segment and U.S., Canada, New Zealand and Italy for the Wine and Spirits segment.  In estimating the fair value of the reporting units, management must make assumptions and projections regarding such items as future cash flows, future revenues, future earnings and other factors.  The assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are consistent with historical trends and the projections and assumptions that are used in current strategic operating plans.  These assumptions reflect management’s estimates of future economic and competitive conditions and are, therefore, subject to change as a result of changing market conditions.  If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record an impairment loss for these assets.  The recording of any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial statements.

The most significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flows calculation to determine the fair value of our reporting units in connection with impairment testing are:  (i)  the discount rate, (ii)  the expected long-term growth rate and (iii)  the annual cash flow projections.  If we used a discount rate that was 50 basis points higher or used an expected long-term growth rate that was 50 basis points lower or used annual cash flow projections that were 100 basis points lower in its impairment testing of goodwill, then the changes individually would not have resulted in the carrying value of the respective reporting unit’s net assets, including its goodwill, exceeding its fair value, which would indicate the potential for impairment and the requirement to measure the amount of impairment, if any.

In the fourth quarter of

fiscal 2014

, we performed our annual goodwill impairment analysis.  No indication of impairment was noted for any of our reporting units, as the fair value of each of our reporting units with goodwill exceeded their carrying value.  Based on this analysis, of all of the Wine and Spirits segment’s reporting units, the reporting unit with the lowest amount of fair value in excess of its carrying value was the Canadian reporting unit by approximately

22%

.  The fair value of the Beer reporting unit approximated its carrying value as we closed the Beer Business Acquisition on June 7, 2013.  We had previously recorded an impairment loss of

$278.7 million

, which is included in impairment of goodwill and intangible assets on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, for the second quarter of

fiscal 2014

, in connection with the Wine and Spirits segment’s Canadian reporting unit.  In both the fourth quarter of

fiscal 2013

and the fourth quarter of

fiscal 2012

, as a result of our annual goodwill impairment analysis, we concluded that there were no indications of impairment for any of our reporting units.

Our other intangible assets consist primarily of customer relationships and trademarks obtained through business acquisitions.  Customer relationships are amortized over their estimated useful lives.  The useful lives of existing trademarks that were determined to be indefinite are not amortized.  The guidance for indefinite lived intangible asset impairment testing allows an entity to assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired or to proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test.  Our trademarks are evaluated for impairment by comparing the carrying value of the trademarks to their estimated fair value.  The estimated fair value of trademarks is calculated based on an income approach using the relief from royalty methodology.  The estimated fair value of trademarks is generally determined on the basis of discounted cash flows.  The estimate of fair value is then compared to the carrying value of each trademark.  If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value of the trademark, then an impairment charge is recorded by us to reduce the carrying value of the trademark to its estimated fair value.  In estimating the fair value of the trademarks, management must make assumptions and projections regarding future cash flows based upon future revenues and other factors.  The assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are consistent with historical trends and the projections and assumptions that are used in current strategic operating plans.  These assumptions reflect management’s estimates of future economic and competitive conditions and are, therefore, subject to change as a result of changing market conditions.  If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record an impairment loss for these assets.  The recording of any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial statements.



The most significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flows calculation to determine the fair value of intangible assets with indefinite lives in connection with impairment testing are:  (i)  the estimated royalty rate, (ii)  the discount rate, (iii)  the expected long-term growth rate and (iv)  the annual cash flow projections.  If we used a royalty rate that was 50 basis points lower or used a discount rate that was 50 basis points higher or used an expected long-term growth rate that was 50 basis points lower or used annual cash flow projections that were 100 basis points lower in its impairment testing of intangible assets with indefinite lives, then each change individually would not have resulted in any unit of accounting’s carrying value exceeding its fair value, except for the trademarks associated with the Wine and Spirits segment’s Canadian business.

In the fourth quarter of

fiscal 2014

, we performed our annual review of indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment.

No

indication of impairment was noted for any of our indefinite lived intangible assets as a result of our review.  If we used a royalty rate that was reduced by an additional 50 basis points, then we would have recorded an impairment loss for the Wine and Spirits segment’s Canadian trademarks of approximately

$9.7 million

.  If we used a discount rate that was 50 basis points higher, then we would have recorded an impairment loss for the Wine and Spirits segment’s Canadian trademarks of approximately

$1.7 million

.  If we used an expected long-term growth rate that was 50 basis points lower, then we would have recorded an impairment loss for the Wine and Spirits segment’s Canadian trademarks of approximately

$0.6 million

.  No impairment loss would have been recorded for the Wine and Spirits segment’s Canadian trademarks if we used annual cash flow projections that were 100 basis points lower.  We had previously recorded an impairment loss of

$22.2 million

, which is included in impairment of goodwill and intangible assets on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, for the second quarter of

fiscal 2014

, in connection with certain trademarks associated with the Wine and Spirits segment’s Canadian business.  No indication of impairment was noted for any of our indefinite lived intangible assets for Fiscal 2013.  In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, we recorded an impairment loss of $38.1 million, which is included in impairment of goodwill and intangible assets on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, in connection with certain trademarks associated with the Wine and Spirits segment’s Canadian business.

•

Accounting for promotional activities.

Sales reflect reductions attributable to consideration given to customers in various customer incentive programs, including pricing discounts on single transactions, volume discounts, promotional and advertising allowances, coupons, and rebates.  Certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the cost of those programs.  The accrued liability for these programs is determined through analysis of programs offered, historical trends, expectations regarding customer and consumer participation, sales and payment trends, and experience with payment patterns associated with similar programs that have been offered previously.  If assumptions included in our estimates were to change or market conditions were to change, then material incremental reductions to revenue could be required, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial statements.

•

Accounting for stock-based compensation.

Stock-based compensation cost is calculated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense, net of estimated pre-vesting forfeitures, ratably over the vesting period of the award.  We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to calculate the grant-date fair value of our option and purchase right awards.  We use the Monte Carlo Simulation model to calculate the grant-date fair value of our performance share unit awards which contain a market condition.  The calculation of fair value of stock-based awards requires the input of assumptions, including the expected term of the stock-based awards and the associated stock price volatility.  The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock-based awards represent our best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment. As a result, if factors change and we use different assumptions, then stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.  If we used an expected term for our stock-based awards that was one year longer, the fair value of stock-based awards granted during

Fiscal 2014

,

Fiscal 2013

and

Fiscal 2012

and for the years ended

February 28, 2011

(“

Fiscal 2011

”), and

February 28, 2010

(“

Fiscal 2010

”), would have increased by

$8.9 million

, resulting in an increase of

$1.4 million

of stock-based compensation expense for

Fiscal 2014

.  If we used an expected term of our stock-based awards that was one year shorter, the fair value of our stock-based awards granted during

Fiscal 2014

,

Fiscal 2013

,

Fiscal 2012

,

Fiscal 2011

and

Fiscal 2010

would have



decreased by

$9.2 million

, resulting in a decrease of

$1.8 million

of stock-based compensation expense for

Fiscal 2014

.

•

Accounting for income taxes.

We estimate our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits based upon various factors including, but not limited to, historical pretax operating income, future estimates of pretax operating income, differences between book and tax treatment of items of income and expense and tax planning strategies.  We are subject to income taxes in Canada, Luxembourg, Mexico, New Zealand, the U.S. and other jurisdictions.  We recognize our deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon the expected future tax outcome of amounts recognized in our

Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income

.  If necessary, we record a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets if the realization of the asset appears doubtful.  We believe that all tax positions are fully supported; however, we record tax liabilities in accordance with the FASB’s guidance for income tax accounting.  We recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination.  Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities.  In addition, changes in existing tax laws or rates could significantly change our current estimate of our tax liabilities.  These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined.  Changes in current estimates, if significant, could have a material adverse impact on our financial statements.

•

Accounting for business combinations.

The acquisition of businesses is an important element of our strategy.  Under the acquisition method, we are required to record the net assets acquired at the estimated fair value at the date of acquisition.  The determination of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our financial statements.  For example, our acquisitions typically result in the recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets; the value and estimated life of those assets may affect the amount of future period amortization expense for intangible assets with finite lives as well as possible impairment charges that may be incurred.

Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted

Accounting guidance adopted on March 1, 2014, did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  For further information on Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted refer to Note 22 in our Notes to the Financial Statements.

Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

As a result of our global operating, acquisition and financing activities, we are exposed to market risk associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates.  To manage the volatility relating to these risks, periodically, we purchase and/or sell derivative instruments including foreign currency forward and option contracts, commodity swap agreements and interest rate swap agreements.  We use derivative instruments solely to reduce the financial impact of these risks.  We do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

Foreign Currency and Commodity Price Risk

Foreign currency derivative instruments are or may be used to hedge existing foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities, forecasted foreign currency denominated sales/purchases to/from third parties as well as intercompany sales/purchases, intercompany principal and interest payments, and in connection with acquisitions or joint venture investments outside the U.S.  As of

February 28, 2014

, we had exposures to foreign currency risk primarily related to the Mexican peso, euro, New Zealand dollar and Canadian dollar.  Approximately

64.0%

of our balance sheet exposures and forecasted transactional exposures for the year ending February 28, 2015, were hedged as of

February 28, 2014

.



Commodity derivative instruments are or may be used to hedge forecasted commodity purchases from third parties as either economic hedges or accounting hedges.  As of

February 28, 2014

, exposures to commodity price risk which we are currently hedging include diesel fuel, corn and natural gas.  Approximately

54.0%

of our forecasted transactional exposures for these commodities for the year ending February 28, 2015, were hedged as of

February 28, 2014

.

We have performed a sensitivity analysis to estimate our exposure to market risk of foreign exchange rates and commodity prices reflecting the impact of a hypothetical 10% adverse change in the applicable market.  The volatility of the applicable rates and prices is dependent on many factors which cannot be forecasted with reliable accuracy.  Losses or gains from the revaluation or settlement of the related underlying positions would substantially offset such gains or losses on the derivative instruments.  The absolute notional value, estimated fair value and sensitivity analysis for our open foreign currency and commodity derivative instruments are summarized as follows:

Interest Rate Risk

The estimated fair value of our fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk, credit risk and foreign currency risk.  In addition, we also have variable interest rate debt outstanding (primarily LIBOR-based), certain of which includes a fixed margin subject to the same risks identified for our fixed interest rate debt.

As of

February 28, 2014

, and

February 28, 2013

, we had an outstanding cash flow designated interest rate swap agreement which fixed LIBOR interest rates (to minimize interest rate volatility) on

$500.0 million

of our floating LIBOR rate debt at an average rate of

2.8%

(exclusive of borrowing margins) through September 1, 2016.  In addition, we had offsetting undesignated interest rate swap agreements.

We have performed a sensitivity analysis to estimate our exposure to market risk of interest rates reflecting the impact of a hypothetical 1% increase in the prevailing interest rates.  The volatility of the applicable rates is dependent on many factors which cannot be forecasted with reliable accuracy.  The absolute notional value, estimated fair value and sensitivity analysis for our outstanding fixed and variable interest rate debt, including current maturities, and open interest rate derivative instruments are summarized as follows:

INDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FEBRUARY 28, 2014

The following information is presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K:



Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Constellation Brands, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Constellation Brands, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of

February 28, 2014

and

February 28, 2013

, and the related

consolidated statements of comprehensive income

, changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended

February 28, 2014

.  These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Constellation Brands, Inc. and subsidiaries as of

February 28, 2014

and

February 28, 2013

, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended

February 28, 2014

, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Constellation Brands, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of

February 28, 2014

, based on criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework (1992)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Constellation Brands, Inc.:

We have audited Constellation Brands, Inc.’s (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of

February 28, 2014

, based on criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework (1992)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).  Constellation Brands, Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.  Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.  Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.  We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)  pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)  provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Constellation Brands, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of

February 28, 2014

, based on criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework (1992)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

The scope of management’s assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting excluded the internal control over financial reporting of the Brewery Business acquired in connection with the Beer Business Acquisition, which the Company acquired on June 7, 2013.  The Brewery Business represented approximately 5% of the Company’s consolidated total assets and less than 1% of the Company’s consolidated net sales as of and for the year ended

February 28, 2014

.  Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of Constellation Brands, Inc. also excluded an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of the Brewery Business.



We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Constellation Brands, Inc. and subsidiaries as of

February 28, 2014

and

February 28, 2013

, and the related

consolidated statements of comprehensive income

, changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management of Constellation Brands, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting.  This system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)  pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii)  provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii)  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Further, because of changes in conditions, effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting may vary over time.

Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the system of internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework (1992)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway Commission.  Based on that evaluation, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of

February 28, 2014

.

In accordance with guidance issued by the SEC, this evaluation excluded the internal control over financial reporting of the Brewery Business acquired in connection with the Beer Business Acquisition, which the Company acquired on June 7, 2013.  The Beer Business Acquisition and the Brewery Business are more fully discussed in Note 3 of the Notes to the Financial Statements as of and for the year ended

February 28, 2014

.  The Brewery Business represented approximately 5% of the Company’s consolidated total assets and less than 1% of the Company’s consolidated net sales as of and for the year ended

February 28, 2014

.

The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FEBRUARY 28, 2014

1.

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS, BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Description of business –

Constellation Brands, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) operate primarily in the beverage alcohol industry.  The Company is a leading international producer and marketer of beverage alcohol with a broad portfolio of consumer-preferred imported beer, premium wine and spirits brands complemented by other select beverage alcohol products.  The Company is a leading producer and marketer of beer in the United States (“U.S.”) and has a leading premium wine business in the world.  The Company is a leading producer and marketer of wine in the U.S.; a leading producer and marketer of wine in Canada; and a leading producer and exporter of wine from both New Zealand and Italy.  The Company is a leading multi-category supplier (beer, wine and spirits) of beverage alcohol in the U.S.  In North America, the Company’s products are primarily sold to wholesale distributors as well as state and provincial alcohol beverage control agencies.  In New Zealand, the Company’s products are primarily sold to retailers, wholesalers and importers.  In Italy, the Company’s products are primarily sold to retailers, wholesalers and importers, as well as direct to on-premise.

Basis of presentation –

Principles of consolidation:

The consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of the Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries and entities in which the Company has a controlling financial interest after the elimination of intercompany accounts and transactions.  The Company has a controlling financial interest if the Company owns a majority of the outstanding voting common stock or has significant control over an entity through contractual or economic interests in which the Company is the primary beneficiary.

Management’s use of estimates:

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Equity method investments:

If the Company is not required to consolidate its investment in another entity, the Company uses the equity method if the Company (i)  can exercise significant influence over the other entity and (ii)  holds common stock and/or in-substance common stock of the other entity.  Under the equity method, investments are carried at cost, plus or minus the Company’s equity in the increases and decreases in the investee’s net assets after the date of acquisition and certain other adjustments.  The Company’s share of the net income or loss of the investee is included in equity in earnings of equity method investees on the Company’s

Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income

.  Dividends received from the investee reduce the carrying amount of the investment.

Equity method investments are also reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investments may not be recoverable.

No

instances of impairment were noted on the Company’s equity method investments for the years ended

February 28, 2014

,

February 28, 2013

, and

February 29, 2012

.

Other:

Certain February 28, 2013, and February 29, 2012, balances have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.



Summary of significant accounting policies –

Revenue recognition:

Sales are recognized when title and risk of loss pass to the customer, which is generally when the product is shipped.  Amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling are classified as sales.  Sales reflect reductions attributable to consideration given to customers in various customer incentive programs, including pricing discounts on single transactions, volume discounts, promotional and advertising allowances, coupons, and rebates.

Cost of product sold:

The types of costs included in cost of product sold are raw materials, packaging materials, manufacturing costs, plant administrative support and overheads, and freight and warehouse costs (including distribution network costs).  Distribution network costs include inbound freight charges and outbound shipping and handling costs, purchasing and receiving costs, inspection costs, warehousing and internal transfer costs.

Selling, general and administrative expenses:

The types of costs included in selling, general and administrative expenses consist predominately of advertising and non-manufacturing administrative and overhead costs.  Distribution network costs are not included in the Company’s selling, general and administrative expenses, but are included in cost of product sold as described above.  The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred, shown or distributed.  Prepaid advertising costs at

February 28, 2014

, and

February 28, 2013

, were not material.  Advertising expense for the years ended

February 28, 2014

,

February 28, 2013

, and

February 29, 2012

, was

$278.5 million

,

$121.9 million

and

$116.0 million

, respectively.

Foreign currency translation:

The “functional currency” of the Company’s subsidiaries outside the U.S. is generally in the respective local currency.  The translation from the applicable foreign currencies to U.S. dollars is performed for balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using a weighted average exchange rate for the period.  The resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (“AOCI”).  Gains or losses resulting from foreign currency denominated transactions are included in selling, general and administrative expenses on the Company’s

Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income

.  The Company engages in foreign currency denominated transactions with customers and suppliers, as well as between subsidiaries with different functional currencies.  Aggregate foreign currency transaction net gains (losses) were

$5.3 million

,

$3.7 million

and

($0.7) million

for the years ended

February 28, 2014

,

February 28, 2013

, and

February 29, 2012

, respectively.

Cash investments:

Cash investments consist of highly liquid investments with an original maturity when purchased of

three months

or less and are stated at cost, which approximates fair value.

Allowance for doubtful accounts:

The Company records an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments.  The majority of the accounts receivable balance is generated from sales to independent distributors with whom the Company has a predetermined collection date arranged through electronic funds transfer.  The allowance for doubtful accounts was

$1.8 million

and

$1.9 million

as of

February 28, 2014

, and

February 28, 2013

, respectively.

Fair value of financial instruments:

The Company calculates the fair value of financial instruments using quoted market prices whenever available.  When quoted market prices are not available, the Company uses standard pricing models for various types of financial instruments (such as forwards, options, swaps, etc.) which take into account the present value of estimated future cash flows (see Note 7).

Derivative instruments:

As a multinational company, the Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates that could affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.  The amount of volatility realized will vary based upon the effectiveness and level of derivative



instruments outstanding during a particular period of time, as well as the currency, commodity and interest rate market movements during that same period.

The Company enters into derivative instruments, primarily foreign currency forward and option contracts, commodity pricing swaps and interest rate swaps, to manage foreign currency, commodity pricing and interest rate risks, respectively.  The Company recognizes all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on its Consolidated Balance Sheets and measures those instruments at fair value (see Note 6, Note 7).  The fair values of the Company’s derivative instruments change with fluctuations in currency rates, commodity prices and/or interest rates and are expected to offset changes in the values of the underlying exposures.  The Company’s derivative instruments are held solely to hedge economic exposures.  The Company follows strict policies to manage foreign currency, commodity pricing and interest rate risks, including prohibitions on derivative market-making or other speculative activities.

To qualify for hedge accounting treatment under the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) guidance for derivatives and hedging, the details of the hedging relationship must be formally documented at inception of the arrangement, including the risk management objective, hedging strategy, hedged item, specific risk that is being hedged, the derivative instrument, how effectiveness is being assessed and how ineffectiveness will be measured.  The derivative must be highly effective in offsetting either changes in the fair value or cash flows, as appropriate, of the risk being hedged.  Effectiveness is evaluated on a retrospective and prospective basis based on quantitative and qualitative measures.

Furthermore, when the Company determines that a derivative instrument which qualified for hedge accounting treatment has ceased to be highly effective as a hedge, the Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively.  The Company also discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when (i)  a derivative expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised; (ii)  it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur; or (iii)  management determines that designating the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriate.

Certain of the Company’s derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under the FASB guidance for derivatives and hedging; for others, the Company chooses not to maintain the required documentation to apply hedge accounting treatment.  These undesignated instruments are primarily used to economically hedge the Company’s exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currency denominated receivables and payables; foreign currency investments, primarily consisting of loans to subsidiaries, and cash flows related primarily to the repatriation of those loans or investments; and commodity prices, primarily consisting of diesel fuel, corn and natural gas prices.  Foreign currency contracts, generally less than

12 months

in duration, and commodity swap contracts, generally less than

36 months

in duration, are used to hedge some of these risks.  The Company’s derivative policy permits the use of undesignated derivatives as approved by senior management.

For these undesignated instruments, the mark to fair value is reported currently through earnings on the Company’s

Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income

.  For purposes of measuring segment operating performance, the unrealized gains or losses from the mark to fair value of the Company’s undesignated commodity swap contracts are reported outside of segment operating results until such time that the underlying exposure is realized in the segment operating results.  At that time, the realized gains or losses from the mark to fair value of the undesignated commodity swap contracts are reported in the appropriate operating segment, allowing the Company’s operating segments to realize the economic effects of the commodity swap contracts without the resulting unrealized mark to fair value volatility.  The net unrealized gain reported outside of segment operating results for the year ended

February 28, 2014

, was not material.  There were

no

amounts reported outside of segment operating results for the years ended

February 28, 2013

, and

February 29, 2012

.

The Company had undesignated foreign currency contracts outstanding with an absolute notional value of

$643.8 million

and

$355.1 million

as of

February 28, 2014

, and

February 28, 2013

, respectively, and undesignated commodity swap contracts outstanding with an absolute notional value of

$88.0 million

as of

February 28, 2014

.  The Company had

no

undesignated commodity swap contracts outstanding as of

February 28, 2013

.  In addition, the Company had offsetting undesignated interest rate swap agreements outstanding with an absolute notional value of

$1.0 billion

as of

February 28, 2014

, and

February 28, 2013

(see Note 12).



Cash flow hedges:

The Company is exposed to foreign denominated cash flow fluctuations in connection with third party and intercompany sales and purchases and, historically, third party financing arrangements.  The Company primarily uses foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge certain of these risks.  In addition, the Company utilizes commodity swap contracts to manage its exposure to changes in commodity prices and interest rate swap contracts to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates.  Derivatives managing the Company’s cash flow exposures generally mature within

three years

or less, with a maximum maturity of

five years

.  Throughout the term of the designated cash flow hedge relationship on at least a quarterly basis, a retrospective evaluation and prospective assessment of hedge effectiveness is performed.  All components of the Company’s derivative instruments’ gains or losses are included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness.  In the event the relationship is no longer effective, the Company recognizes the change in the fair value of the hedging derivative instrument from the date the hedging derivative instrument became no longer effective immediately on the Company’s

Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income

.  In conjunction with its effectiveness testing, the Company also evaluates ineffectiveness associated with the hedge relationship.  Resulting ineffectiveness, if any, is recognized immediately on the Company’s

Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income

.

The Company records the fair value of its foreign currency contracts, commodity swap contracts and interest rate swap contracts qualifying for cash flow hedge accounting treatment on its Consolidated Balance Sheets with the effective portion of the related gain or loss on those contracts deferred in stockholders’ equity (as a component of AOCI).  These deferred gains or losses are recognized on the Company’s

Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income

in the same period in which the underlying hedged items are recognized and on the same line item as the underlying hedged items.  However, to the extent that any derivative instrument is not considered to be highly effective in offsetting the change in the value of the hedged item, the hedging relationship is terminated and the amount related to the ineffective portion of such derivative instrument is immediately recognized on the Company’s

Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income

.

The Company had cash flow designated foreign currency contracts outstanding with an absolute notional value of

$636.6 million

and

$220.3 million

as of

February 28, 2014

, and

February 28, 2013

, respectively; cash flow designated commodity swap contracts outstanding with an absolute notional value of

$17.4 million

as of

February 28, 2013

; and a cash flow designated interest rate swap agreement outstanding with a notional value of

$500.0 million

as of

February 28, 2014

, and

February 28, 2013

(see Note 12).  The Company had

no

cash flow designated commodity swap contracts outstanding as of

February 28, 2014

.  The Company expects

$3.1 million

of net losses, net of income tax effect, to be reclassified from AOCI to earnings within the next 12 months.

Fair value hedges:

Fair value hedges are hedges that offset the risk of changes in the fair values of recorded assets and liabilities, and firm commitments.  The Company records changes in fair value of derivative instruments, which are designated and deemed effective as fair value hedges, in earnings offset by the corresponding changes in the fair value of the hedged items.  The Company did not designate any derivative instruments as fair value hedges for the years ended

February 28, 2014

,

February 28, 2013

, and

February 29, 2012

.

Net investment hedges:

Net investment hedges are hedges that use derivative instruments or non-derivative instruments to hedge the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation.  Historically, the Company has managed currency exposures resulting from certain of its net investments in foreign subsidiaries principally with debt denominated in the related foreign currency.  Accordingly, gains and losses on these instruments were recorded as foreign currency translation adjustments in AOCI.  The Company did not designate any derivative or non-derivative instruments as net investment hedges for the years ended

February 28, 2014

,

February 28, 2013

, and

February 29, 2012

.

Credit risk:

The Company enters into master agreements with its bank derivative trading counterparties that allow netting of certain derivative positions in order to manage credit risk.  The Company’s derivative instruments are not subject to credit rating contingencies or collateral requirements.  As of

February 28, 2014

, the fair value of derivative instruments in a net liability position due to counterparties was

$30.4 million

.  If the Company were



required to settle the net liability position under these derivative instruments on

February 28, 2014

, the Company would have had sufficient availability under its revolving credit facility to satisfy this obligation.

Counterparty credit risk:

Counterparty credit risk relates to losses the Company could incur if a counterparty defaults on a derivative contract.  The Company manages exposure to counterparty credit risk by requiring specified minimum credit standards and diversification of counterparties.  The Company enters into master agreements with its bank derivative trading counterparties that allow netting of certain derivative positions in order to manage counterparty credit risk.  As of

February 28, 2014

, all of the Company’s counterparty exposures are with financial institutions which have investment grade ratings.  The Company has procedures to monitor counterparty credit risk for both current and future potential credit exposures.  As of

February 28, 2014

, the fair value of derivative instruments in a net receivable position due from counterparties was

$17.0 million

.

Inventories:

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (computed in accordance with the first-in, first-out method) or market.  Elements of cost include materials, labor and overhead and are classified as follows:

Bulk wine inventories are included as in-process inventories within current assets, in accordance with the general practices of the wine industry, although a portion of such inventories may be aged for periods greater than

one year

.  A substantial portion of barreled whiskey and brandy will not be sold within one year because of the duration of the aging process.  All barreled whiskey and brandy are classified as in-process inventories and are included in current assets, in accordance with industry practice.  Warehousing, insurance, ad valorem taxes and other carrying charges applicable to barreled whiskey and brandy held for aging are included in inventory costs.

The Company assesses the valuation of its inventories and reduces the carrying value of those inventories that are obsolete or in excess of the Company’s forecasted usage to their estimated net realizable value.  The Company estimates the net realizable value of such inventories based on analyses and assumptions including, but not limited to, historical usage, future demand and market requirements.  Reductions to the carrying value of inventories are recorded in cost of product sold.  If the future demand for the Company’s products is less favorable than the Company’s forecasts, then the value of the inventories may be required to be reduced, which could result in additional expense to the Company and affect its results of operations.

Property, plant and equipment:

Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost.  Major additions and betterments are charged to property accounts, while maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred.  The cost of properties sold or otherwise disposed of and the related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts at the time of disposal and resulting gains and losses are included as a component of operating income.



Depreciation:

Depreciation is computed primarily using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:

Goodwill and other intangible assets:

The Company reviews its goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets annually for impairment, or sooner, if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.  The Company uses January 1 as its annual impairment test measurement date.  Indefinite lived intangible assets consist principally of trademarks.  Intangible assets determined to have a finite life, primarily customer relationships and a favorable interim supply agreement (see Note 3), are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are subject to review for impairment in accordance with the FASB guidance for property, plant and equipment.  Note 9 provides a summary of intangible assets segregated between amortizable and nonamortizable amounts.

In the fourth quarter of

fiscal 2014

, pursuant to the Company’s accounting policy, the Company performed its annual goodwill impairment analysis.

No

indication of impairment was noted for any of the Company’s reporting units as the estimated fair value of each of the Company’s reporting units with goodwill exceeded their carrying value.  The Company had previously recorded an impairment loss of

$278.7 million

, which is included in impairment of goodwill and intangible assets on the Company’s

Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income

, for the second quarter of

fiscal 2014

, in connection with the Wine and Spirits (formerly Constellation Wines and Spirits) segment’s Canadian reporting unit (Level 3 fair value measurement – see Note 7).  In the fourth quarters of

fiscal 2013

and

fiscal 2012

, pursuant to the Company’s accounting policy, the Company performed its annual goodwill impairment analysis.

No

indication of impairment was noted for any of the Company’s reporting units for the years ended

February 28, 2013

, and

February 29, 2012

, as the estimated fair value of each of the Company’s reporting units with goodwill exceeded their carrying value.

In the fourth quarter of

fiscal 2014

, pursuant to the Company’s accounting policy, the Company performed its annual review of indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment.

No

indication of impairment was noted for any of the Company’s indefinite lived intangible assets.  The Company had previously recorded an impairment loss of

$22.2 million

, which is included in impairment of goodwill and intangible assets on the Company’s

Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income

, for the second quarter of

fiscal 2014

, in connection with certain trademarks associated with the Wine and Spirits segment’s Canadian business (Level 3 fair value measurement – see Note 7).  In the fourth quarters of

fiscal 2013

and

fiscal 2012

, pursuant to the Company’s accounting policy, the Company performed its annual review of indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment.

No

indication of impairment was noted for any of the Company’s indefinite lived intangible assets for the year ended

February 28, 2013

.  The Company recorded an impairment loss of

$38.1 million

, which is included in impairment of goodwill and intangible assets on the Company’s

Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income

for the year ended

February 29, 2012

, in connection with certain trademarks associated with the Wine and Spirits segment’s Canadian business (Level 3 fair value measurement – see Note 7).

Other assets:

Other assets include the following:  (i)  investments in equity method investees which are carried under the equity method of accounting (see Note 10); (ii)  deferred financing costs which are stated at cost, net of accumulated amortization, and are amortized on an effective interest basis over the term of the related debt; (iii)  an investment in Accolade (as defined in Note 10) consisting of cost method investments which are carried at cost and available-for-sale (“AFS”) debt securities which are carried at fair value (see Note 10); (iv)  deferred tax assets which are stated net of valuation allowances (see Note 13); and (v)  derivative assets which are stated at fair value.



Amortization of deferred financing costs is included in interest expense, net, on the Company’s

Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income

.

Long-lived assets impairment:

The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.  Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset.  If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value.  Assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell and are no longer depreciated.  There were

no

assets classified as held for sale as of

February 28, 2014

, and

February 28, 2013

.  There were

no

impairment losses recorded for any of the Company’s long-lived assets for the years ended

February 28, 2014

,

February 28, 2013

, and February 29, 2012.

Indemnification liabilities:

The Company has indemnified respective parties against certain liabilities that may arise in connection with certain acquisitions and divestitures.  The carrying values of the indemnification liabilities are included in other liabilities on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets (see Note 14).

Income taxes:

The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes.  This method accounts for deferred income taxes by applying statutory rates in effect at the balance sheet date to the difference between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities.

Environmental:

Environmental expenditures that relate to current operations or to an existing condition caused by past operations, and which do not contribute to current or future revenue generation, are expensed.  Liabilities for environmental risks or components thereof are recorded when environmental assessments and/or remedial efforts are probable, and the cost can be reasonably estimated.  Generally, the timing of these accruals coincides with the completion of a feasibility study or the Company’s commitment to a formal plan of action.  Liabilities for environmental costs were not material at

February 28, 2014

, and

February 28, 2013

.

Earnings per common share:

The Company has

two

classes of outstanding common stock:  Class A Common Stock and Class B Convertible Common Stock (see Note 15).  In addition, the Company has another class of common stock consisting of shares of Class 1 Common Stock (see Note 15).  With respect to dividend rights, the Class A Common Stock is entitled to cash dividends of at least

ten

percent greater than those declared and paid on the Class B Convertible Common Stock.  Accordingly, the Company uses the two-class computation method for the computation of earnings per common share – basic and earnings per common share – diluted.  The two-class computation method for each period reflects the amount of allocated undistributed earnings per share computed using the participation percentage which reflects the minimum dividend rights of each class of stock.

Earnings per common share – basic excludes the effect of common stock equivalents and is computed using the two-class computation method.  Earnings per common share – diluted for Class A Common Stock reflects the potential dilution that could result if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock.  Earnings per common share – diluted for Class A Common Stock has been computed using the more dilutive of the if-converted or two-class computation method.  Using the if-converted method, earnings per common share – diluted for Class A Common Stock assumes the exercise of stock options using the treasury stock method and the conversion of Class B Convertible Common Stock.  Using the two-class computation method, earnings per common share – diluted for Class A Common Stock assumes the exercise of stock options using the treasury stock method and no conversion of Class B Convertible Common Stock.  For the years ended

February 28, 2014

,

February 28, 2013

, and

February 29, 2012

, earnings per common share – diluted for Class A Common Stock has been calculated using the if-converted method.  For the years ended

February 28, 2014

,

February 28, 2013

, and

February 29, 2012

, earnings per common share – diluted for Class B Convertible Common Stock is presented



without assuming conversion into Class A Common Stock and is computed using the two-class computation method.

Stock-based employee compensation plans:

The Company has

two

material stock-based employee compensation plans (see Note 16).  The Company applies a grant date fair-value-based measurement method in accounting for its stock-based payment arrangements and records all costs resulting from stock-based payment transactions ratably over the requisite service period in its consolidated financial statements.  Stock-based awards granted by the Company are subject to specific vesting conditions, generally time vesting, or upon retirement, disability or death of the employee (as defined by the stock option plan), if earlier.  The Company recognizes compensation expense immediately for awards granted to retirement-eligible employees or ratably over the period from the date of grant to the date of retirement-eligibility if that is expected to occur during the requisite service period, when appropriate.

2.    RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE:

Disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities –

Effective March 1, 2013, the Company adopted the FASB amended guidance creating new disclosure requirements about the nature of an entity’s rights of setoff and related arrangements associated with its financial instruments and derivative instruments.  In addition, this amended guidance requires retrospective application.  The adoption of this amended guidance on March 1, 2013, did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Goodwill and other intangible assets –

Effective March 1, 2013, the Company adopted the FASB amended guidance for indefinite lived intangible asset impairment testing.  The amended guidance allows an entity to assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that an indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired.  If an entity concludes it is not more likely than not that an indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired, the entity is not required to take further action.  If an entity concludes otherwise, then the entity would be required to determine the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset and compare the fair value with the carrying amount of the indefinite lived intangible asset.  The adoption of this amended guidance on March 1, 2013, did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Comprehensive income –

Effective March 1, 2013, the Company adopted the amended guidance for reporting of amounts reclassified out of AOCI.  The amended guidance requires an entity to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of AOCI by component.  In addition, an entity is required to present significant amounts reclassified out of AOCI by the respective line items of net income, or, for amounts not required to be reclassified in their entirety to net income under generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S., an entity is required to cross-reference to other disclosures required under generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. that provide additional detail about those amounts.  The adoption of this amended guidance on March 1, 2013, did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Derivative instruments –

Effective July 17, 2013, the Company adopted the amended guidance for inclusion of the Federal Funds Effective Swap Rate as a U.S. benchmark interest rate for hedge accounting purposes, in addition to the interest rate on direct Treasury obligations of the U.S. Government and the London Interbank Offered Rate.  The amended guidance also allows for the use of different benchmark rates for similar hedging relationships.  The amended guidance is effective prospectively, for qualifying new or redesignated hedging relationships entered into on or after the effective date.  The adoption of this amended guidance on July 17, 2013, did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.



3.    ACQUISITIONS:

Beer Business Acquisition –

On June 7, 2013, the Company acquired (i)  the remaining

50%

equity interest in Crown Imports (as defined in Note 10) (the “Crown Acquisition”) and (ii)(a)  all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of Compañía Cervecera de Coahuila, S. de R.L. de C.V. (the “Brewery Company”), which owns and operates a brewery located in Nava, Coahuila, Mexico (the “Brewery”), (ii)(b)  all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of Servicios Modelo de Coahuila, S. de R.L. de C.V., which provides personnel and services for the operation and maintenance of the Brewery (the “Service Company”), and (ii)(c)  an irrevocable, fully-paid license to produce in Mexico (or worldwide under certain circumstances) and exclusively import, market and sell the Mexican Beer Brands (as defined in Note 10) as of the date of acquisition, and certain extensions (all collectively referred to as the “Brewery Purchase”).  The business of the Brewery Company and Service Company acquired by the Company is referred to as the “Brewery Business.”  The Crown Acquisition and the Brewery Purchase are collectively referred to as the “Beer Business Acquisition.”  In connection with the Beer Business Acquisition, the Company is required to build out and expand the Brewery to a nominal capacity of at least 20.0 million hectoliters of packaged beer annually by December 31, 2016.  In addition, an interim supply agreement and a transition services agreement were entered into in association with the Beer Business Acquisition.  The interim supply agreement obligates the supplier to provide Crown Imports with a supply of product not produced by the Brewery and the transition services agreement provides for certain specified services and production materials, both for a specified period of time.  The associated agreements provide, among other things, that the United States will have approval rights, in its sole discretion, for amendments or modifications to the associated agreements and the United States will have a right of approval, in its sole discretion, of any extension of the term of the interim supply agreement beyond three years.  The aggregate purchase price of

$5,226.4 million

consists of cash paid at closing of

$4,745.0 million

, net of cash acquired of

$106.8 million

, plus the estimated fair value of an additional purchase price for the finalization of the Final EBITDA Amount (as defined in the stock purchase agreement) of

$543.3 million

, as well as additional estimated cash payments for certain working capital adjustments.  The fair value of the additional purchase price related to the Final EBITDA Amount was estimated by discounting future cash flows.  In the third quarter of fiscal 2014, the calculation of the Final EBITDA Amount was finalized requiring the Company to make a payment of

$558.0 million

no later than June 7, 2014, consisting of the additional purchase price of

$543.3 million

plus imputed interest of

$14.7 million

.

The aggregate cash paid at closing was financed with:

•

The proceeds from the issuance of

$1,550.0 million

aggregate principal amount of May 2013 Senior Notes (as defined in Note 12);

•

$1,500.0 million

in term loans consisting of a

$500.0 million

European Term A Facility (as defined in Note 12) and a

$1,000.0 million

European Term B Facility (as defined in Note 12) under the 2013 Credit Agreement (as defined in Note 12);

•

$675.0 million

in term loans under the U.S. Term A-2 Facility (as defined in Note 12) under the 2013 Credit Agreement;

•

$208.0 million

in proceeds of borrowings under the Company’s then existing accounts receivable securitization facility;

•

$580.0 million

in borrowings under the revolving credit facility under the 2013 Credit Agreement; and

•

Approximately

$232.0 million

of cash on hand (inclusive of

$13.0 million

of borrowings under a subsidiary working capital facility).

As a result of the closing of the Beer Business Acquisition without utilizing any of the commitments under an amended and restated bridge financing, this agreement terminated pursuant to its terms on June 7, 2013.

Prior to the Beer Business Acquisition, the Company accounted for its investment in Crown Imports under the equity method of accounting.  In connection with the acquisition method of accounting, the Company’s preexisting

50%

equity interest was remeasured to its estimated fair value of

$1,845.0 million

, and the Company recognized a gain of

$1,642.0 million

on its

Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income

for the second quarter of fiscal 2014.  The estimated fair value of the Company’s preexisting

50%

equity interest was based upon the estimated fair value of the acquired

50%

equity interest in Crown Imports.



The aggregate purchase price of the Beer Business Acquisition and the estimated fair value of the Company’s preexisting

50%

equity interest in Crown Imports have been allocated to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based upon the estimated fair value of each as of the acquisition date.  The following table summarizes the allocation of the estimated fair value of the Beer Business Acquisition to the separately identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of June 7, 2013:

The acquired accounts receivable consist primarily of trade receivables, all of which have been collected.  The acquired inventory was all sold during the second quarter of fiscal 2014.  The intangible assets consist of definite lived customer relationships with an estimated fair value of

$22.5 million

which are being amortized over a life of


years; definite lived copyrights with an estimated fair value of

$6.5 million

which are being amortized over a life of


years; a definite lived distribution agreement with an estimated fair value of

$0.4 million

which is being amortized over a life of

1.6

years; a definite lived favorable interim supply agreement with an estimated fair value of

$68.3 million

which is being amortized over a life of


years; and a perpetual right to use trademarks with an estimated fair value of

$2,305.5 million

which is indefinite lived and therefore not subject to amortization.

In determining the purchase price allocation, the Company considered, among other factors, market participants’ intentions to use the acquired assets and the historical and estimated future demand for the acquired Mexican Beer Brands.  The estimated fair values for the customer relationships and the copyrights were determined using a cost approach.  The estimated fair value for the distribution agreement was determined using an income approach.  The estimated fair value for the favorable supply contract was determined using an income approach, specifically, the differential method.  The estimated fair value for the trademarks was determined using an income approach, specifically, the relief from royalty method.

The intangible assets are being amortized either on a straight-line basis or an economic consumption basis, which is consistent with the pattern that the economic benefits of the intangible assets are expected to be utilized based upon estimated cash flows generated from such assets.  Goodwill associated with the acquisition is primarily attributable to the distribution of the Mexican Beer Brands in the U.S. as well as complete control over the sourcing of product into the U.S.  Approximately

$1,647.0 million

of the goodwill recognized is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.



The Company has recognized acquisition-related costs of

$78.3 million

through

February 28, 2014

, with

$52.3 million

and

$26.0 million

Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income

.

The results of operations of the Beer Business Acquisition is reported in the Company’s Beer segment (formerly the Crown Imports segment) and has been included in the consolidated results of operations of the Company from the date of acquisition.  The following table sets forth the unaudited pro forma financial information for the years ended

February 28, 2014

, and

February 28, 2013

, respectively.  The unaudited pro forma financial information for the years ended

February 28, 2014

, and

February 28, 2013

, presents consolidated information as if the Beer Business Acquisition had occurred on March 1, 2012.  Because of different fiscal period ends, and in order to present results for comparable periods, the unaudited pro forma financial information for the year ended

February 28, 2014

, combines (i)  the Company’s historical statement of income for the year ended

February 28, 2014

; (ii)  Crown Imports’ historical statement of income for (a)  the

three months ended

March 31, 2013, and (b)  the period from June 1, 2013, through June 6, 2013; and (iii)  the Brewery Business’ carve-out combined income statement for the

three months ended

March 31, 2013.  The unaudited pro forma financial information for the year ended

February 28, 2014

, does not give effect to the Brewery Business’ carve-out combined income statement for the period from June 1, 2013, through June 6, 2013, as it is not significant.  The unaudited pro forma financial information for the year ended

February 28, 2013

, combines (i)  the Company’s historical statement of income for the year ended

February 28, 2013

; (ii)  Crown Imports’ historical statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2012; and (iii)  the Brewery Business’ carve-out combined income statement for the year ended December 31, 2012.  The unaudited pro forma financial information is presented after giving effect to certain adjustments for depreciation, amortization of definite lived intangible assets, interest expense on acquisition financing, amortization of deferred financing costs and related income tax effects.  The unaudited pro forma financial information excludes the gain on the remeasurement to fair value of the Company’s preexisting

50%

equity interest in Crown Imports and the acquisition-related costs noted above as both are nonrecurring amounts directly attributable to the transaction.  The unaudited pro forma financial information is based upon currently available information and upon certain assumptions that the Company believes are reasonable under the circumstances.  The unaudited pro forma financial information does not purport to present what the Company’s results of operations would actually have been if the aforementioned transaction had in fact occurred on such date or at the beginning of the period indicated, nor does it project the Company’s financial position or results of operations at any future date or for any future period.



Mark West –

In July 2012, the Company acquired Mark West for

$159.3 million

.  The transaction primarily includes the acquisition of the Mark West trademark, related inventories and certain grape supply contracts (“Mark West”).  The purchase price was financed with revolver borrowings under the Company’s then existing senior credit facility.  In accordance with the acquisition method of accounting, the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed have been measured at their acquisition-date fair values.  The acquisition of Mark West was not material for purposes of supplemental disclosure pursuant to the FASB guidance on business combinations.  The results of operations of Mark West are reported in the Wine and Spirits segment and are included in the consolidated results of operations of the Company from the date of acquisition.

Ruffino –

In connection with the Company’s December 2004 investment in Ruffino S.r.l. (“Ruffino”), the well-known Italian fine wine company, the Company granted separate irrevocable and unconditional options to

two

other shareholders of Ruffino to put to the Company all of the ownership interests held by these shareholders for a price as calculated in the joint venture agreement.  Each option was exercisable during the period

starting from January 1, 2010, and ending on December 31, 2010

.  During the year ended February 28, 2010, the

9.9%

shareholder of Ruffino exercised its option to put its entire equity interest in Ruffino to the Company.  In May 2010, the Company settled this put option, thereby increasing the Company’s equity interest in Ruffino from

40.0%

to

49.9%

.  In December 2010, the Company received notification from the

50.1%

shareholder of Ruffino that it was exercising its option to put its entire equity interest in Ruffino to the Company.

In October 2011, the Company acquired the remaining

50.1%

shareholder’s equity interest in Ruffino, for

€50.3 million

(

$68.6 million

).  As a result of this acquisition, the Company assumed indebtedness of Ruffino, net of cash acquired, of

€54.2 million

(

$73.1 million

).  The purchase price was financed with revolver borrowings under the Company’s then existing senior credit facility.  In accordance with the acquisition method of accounting, the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed have been measured at their acquisition-date fair values.  The acquisition of Ruffino was not material for purposes of supplemental disclosure pursuant to the FASB guidance on business combinations.  The results of operations of the Ruffino business are reported in the Wine and Spirits segment and are included in the consolidated results of operations of the Company from the date of acquisition.

The major components of prepaid expenses and other are as follows:



5.    PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT:

The major components of property, plant and equipment are as follows:



6.    DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS:

The estimated fair value and location of the Company’s derivative instruments on its Consolidated Balance Sheets are as follows (see Note 7):



The effect of the Company’s derivative instruments designated in cash flow hedging relationships on its

Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income

, as well as its Other Comprehensive Income (“OCI”), net of income tax effect, is as follows:



The effect of the Company’s undesignated derivative instruments on its

Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income

is as follows:

7.    FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS:

The carrying amount and estimated fair value of the Company’s financial instruments are summarized as follows:



The following methods and assumptions are used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments:

Cash and cash investments, accounts receivable and accounts payable:

The carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments (Level 1 fair value measurement).

AFS debt securities

:  The fair value is estimated by discounting cash flows using market-based inputs (see “Fair value measurements” below) (Level 3 fair value measurement).

Foreign currency contracts:

The fair value is estimated using market-based inputs, obtained from independent pricing services, into valuation models (see “Fair value measurements” below) (Level 2 fair value measurement).

Interest rate swap contracts:

The fair value is estimated based on quoted market prices from respective counterparties (see “Fair value measurements” below) (Level 2 fair value measurement).

Commodity swap contracts:

The fair value is estimated based on quoted market prices from respective counterparties (see “Fair value measurements” below) (Level 2 fair value measurement).

Notes payable to banks:

The revolving credit facility under the Company’s senior credit facility is a variable interest rate bearing note which includes a fixed margin which is adjustable based upon the Company’s debt ratio (as defined in the Company’s senior credit facility).  The fair value of the revolving credit facility is estimated by discounting cash flows using LIBOR plus a margin reflecting current market conditions obtained from participating member financial institutions.  The remaining instruments are variable interest rate bearing notes for which the carrying value approximates the fair value (Level 2 fair value measurement).

Long-term debt:

The term loans under the Company’s senior credit facility are variable interest rate bearing notes which include a fixed margin which is adjustable based upon the Company’s debt ratio.  The fair value of the term loans is estimated by discounting cash flows using LIBOR plus a margin reflecting current market conditions obtained from participating member financial institutions.  The fair value of the remaining long-term debt, which is all fixed interest rate, is estimated by discounting cash flows using interest rates currently available for debt with similar terms and maturities (Level 2 fair value measurement).

Fair value measurements –

The FASB guidance on fair value measurements and disclosures defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles, and requires disclosures about fair value measurements.  This guidance emphasizes that fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement, and states that a fair value measurement should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability.  The fair value measurement guidance establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available.  The hierarchy is broken down into three levels: Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2 inputs include data points that are observable such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical assets or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and inputs (other than quoted prices) such as interest rates and yield curves that are observable for the asset and liability, either directly or indirectly; and Level 3 inputs are unobservable data points for the asset or liability, and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability.



The following table presents the Company’s financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis:

The Company’s foreign currency contracts consist of foreign currency forward and option contracts which are valued using market-based inputs, obtained from independent pricing services, into valuation models.  These valuation models require various inputs, including contractual terms, market foreign exchange prices, interest-rate yield curves and currency volatilities.  Interest rate swap fair values are based on quotes from respective counterparties.  Quotes are corroborated by the Company using discounted cash flow calculations based upon forward interest-rate yield curves, which are obtained from independent pricing services.  Commodity swap fair values are based on quotes from respective counterparties.  Quotes are corroborated by the Company using market data.  AFS debt securities are valued using market-based inputs into discounted cash flow models.



The following table presents the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis for which an impairment assessment was performed for the periods presented:

Goodwill:

For the three months ended August 31, 2013, the Company identified certain negative trends within its Wine and Spirits’ Canadian reporting unit which, when combined with recent changes in strategy within the Canadian business, indicated that the estimated fair value of the reporting unit might be below its carrying value.  These negative trends included a reduction in market growth rates for certain segments of the domestic Canadian wine industry as well as the identification that certain improvement initiatives had not materialized in segments of the Canadian business such as refreshments and wine kits.  In addition, imported brands have been experiencing market growth within the Canadian market, and certain of the Company’s non-Canadian branded wine products imported into Canada provide higher margin to the Company on a consolidated basis.  Accordingly, the Company has modified its strategy to capitalize on this trend and shift focus from certain segments of the domestic business to imported brands.  The Canadian reporting unit realizes only a portion of the overall profit attributable to imported brands whereas it realizes all of the profit attributable to the domestic business.  Therefore, the Company performed the two-step process to evaluate goodwill for impairment for the Wine and Spirits’ Canadian reporting unit.  In the first step, the estimated fair value of the Canadian reporting unit was compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill.  The estimate of fair value of the reporting unit was determined on the basis of discounted future cash flows.  As the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, a second step was performed to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment the Company should record.  In the second step, an implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill was determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit with the estimated fair value of the reporting unit’s assets and liabilities other than goodwill (including any unrecognized intangible assets).  In determining the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, the Company considered estimates of future operating results and cash flows of the reporting unit discounted using market based discount rates.  The estimates of future operating results and cash flows were principally derived from the Company’s updated long-term financial forecast, which was developed as part of the Company’s new strategy for the Canadian business.  The decline in the implied fair value of the goodwill and the resulting impairment loss was primarily driven by the updated long-term financial forecasts, which showed lower estimated future operating results primarily due to the change in the Company’s strategy for the Canadian business.  The implied fair value of the Canadian reporting unit’s goodwill of

$159.6 million

compared to the carrying value of the Canadian reporting unit’s goodwill of

$433.9 million

resulted in the recognition of an impairment of

$278.7 million

.  This impairment is included in impairment of goodwill and intangible assets on the Company’s

Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income

.

Trademarks:

For the three months ended August 31, 2013, prior to the goodwill impairment analysis discussed above, the Company performed a review of indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment.  The Company determined that certain trademarks associated with the Wine and Spirits segment’s Canadian business were impaired largely due to lower revenue and profits associated with the related products included in the updated long-term financial forecasts developed as part of the Company’s new strategy for the Canadian business.  Accordingly, trademarks with a



carrying value of

$90.2 million

were written down to their estimated fair value of

$68.3 million

, resulting in an impairment of

$22.2 million

.

For the year ended

February 29, 2012

, pursuant to the Company’s accounting policy, the Company performed its annual review of indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment.  The Company determined that certain trademarks associated with the Wine and Spirits segment’s Canadian business were impaired largely due to lower revenue and profitability associated with products incorporating these assets included in long-term financial forecasts developed as part of the strategic planning cycle conducted during the Company’s fourth quarter.  Accordingly, trademarks with a carrying value of

$134.4 million

, were written down to their estimated fair value of

$96.0 million

, resulting in an impairment of

$38.1 million

.

These impairments are included in impairment of goodwill and intangible assets on the Company’s

Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income

for the respective periods.  For each period, the Company measured the amount of impairment by calculating the amount by which the carrying value of these assets exceeded their estimated fair values.  The estimated fair value was determined based on an income approach using the relief from royalty method, which assumes that, in lieu of ownership, a third party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to exploit the related benefits of trademark assets.  The cash flow projections the Company uses to estimate the fair values of its trademarks involve several assumptions, including (i)  projected revenue growth rates; (ii)  estimated royalty rates; (iii)  calculated after-tax royalty savings expected from ownership of the subject trademarks; and (iv)  discount rates used to derive the present value factors used in determining the estimated fair value of the trademarks.

8.    GOODWILL:

The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill are as follows:

For the year ended February 28, 2013, purchase accounting allocations of

$110.0 million

in the Wine and Spirits segment consist primarily of purchase accounting allocations associated with the acquisition of Mark West.  For the year ended February 28, 2014, purchase accounting allocations of

$3,702.8 million

and

$13.0 million

in the Beer segment and Consolidation and Eliminations, respectively, consist of purchase accounting allocations associated with the Beer Business Acquisition.  For the year ended February 28, 2014, impairment of goodwill in



the Wine and Spirits segment consists of an impairment loss of

$278.7 million

associated with goodwill assigned to the segment’s Canadian reporting unit.

9.    INTANGIBLE ASSETS:

The major components of intangible assets are as follows:

The Company did not incur costs to renew or extend the term of acquired intangible assets during the years ended

February 28, 2014

, and

February 28, 2013

.  The difference between the gross carrying amount and net carrying amount for each item presented is attributable to accumulated amortization.  Amortization expense for intangible assets was

$15.5 million

,

$7.2 million

and

$5.4 million

for the years ended

February 28, 2014

,

February 28, 2013

, and

February 29, 2012

, respectively.  Estimated amortization expense for each of the five succeeding fiscal years and thereafter is as follows:

10.    OTHER ASSETS:

The major components of other assets are as follows:



Investments in equity method investees –

Crown Imports:

Prior to June 7, 2013, Constellation Beers Ltd., an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and Diblo, S.A. de C.V., an entity majority-owned by Grupo Modelo, S.A.B. de C.V. (“Modelo”), each had, directly or indirectly, equal interests in a joint venture, Crown Imports LLC (“Crown Imports”).  Crown Imports had the exclusive right to import, market and sell primarily Modelo’s Mexican beer portfolio sold in the U.S. and Guam (the “Mexican Beer Brands”).

In addition, prior to June 7, 2013, the Company accounted for its investment in Crown Imports under the equity method.  Accordingly, the results of operations of Crown Imports were included in equity in earnings of equity method investees on the Company’s

Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income

through June 6, 2013.  The Company received

$30.3 million

,

$230.2 million

and

$222.0 million

of cash distributions from Crown Imports for the years ended

February 28, 2014

,

February 28, 2013

, and

February 29, 2012

, respectively, all of which represent distributions of earnings.  As of

February 28, 2013

, the Company’s investment in Crown Imports was

$169.3 million

.  As of

February 28, 2013

, the carrying amount of the investment was greater than the Company’s equity in the underlying assets of Crown Imports by

$13.6 million

due to the difference in the carrying amounts of the indefinite lived intangible assets contributed to Crown Imports by each party.

Ruffino:

Prior to the October 2011 acquisition of Ruffino, the Company had a

49.9%

interest in Ruffino.  The Company did not have a controlling interest in Ruffino or exert any managerial control and the Company accounted for its investment in Ruffino under the equity method.  Accordingly, the results of operations of Ruffino were included in equity in earnings of equity method investees on the Company’s

Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income

through the date of acquisition.

Other:

In connection with prior acquisitions, the Company acquired several investments which are being accounted for under the equity method.  The primary investment consists of Opus One Winery LLC (“Opus One”), a

50%

owned joint venture arrangement.  As of

February 28, 2014

, and

February 28, 2013

, the Company’s investment in Opus One was

$63.5 million

and

$59.3 million

, respectively.  The percentage of ownership of the remaining investments ranges from

20%

to

50%

.

The following table presents summarized financial information for the Company’s Crown Imports equity method investment and the other material equity method investments discussed above.  The amounts shown represent

100%

of these equity method investments’ financial position and results of operations for those investments accounted for under the equity method as of

February 28, 2014

.  As the financial position and results of operations of Crown Imports and Ruffino have been included in the Company’s consolidated financial position and results of operations from the dates of acquisition, amounts included for Crown Imports and Ruffino each represent

100%

of the respective equity method investment’s results of operations prior to each of their respective dates of acquisition.



Investment in Accolade –

The Company’s less than

20%

interest in its previously owned Australian and United Kingdom (“U.K.”) business, Accolade Wines (“Accolade”), consists of equity securities and AFS debt securities.  The investment in the equity securities is accounted for under the cost method.  Accordingly

, the Company recognizes earnings only upon the receipt of a dividend from Accolade.  The Company received a return of investment of

$5.9 million

for the year ended

February 28, 2014

, which was recorded as a reduction of the cost of the investment and is included in other investing activities on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Cash

Flows.  The AFS debt securities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis with unrealized holding gains and losses, including foreign currency gains and losses, reported in AOCI until realized (see Note 18).  Interest income is recognized based on the interest rate implicit in the AFS debt securities’ fair value and is reported in interest expense, net, on the Company’s

Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income

.  Interest income recognized for the years ended

February 28, 2014

,

February 28, 2013

, and

February 29, 2012

, was not material.  For the years ended

February 28, 2014

, and

February 29, 2012

, the Company received cash proceeds of

$28.6 million

(proceeds for principal of

$23.4 million

and interest of

$5.2 million

) and

$21.7 million

(proceeds for principal of

$20.2 million

and interest of

$1.5 million

), respectively, in connection with the early redemptions of certain of the AFS debt securities.

No

cash proceeds were received for the year ended

February 28, 2013

.  Amounts reclassified from AOCI to selling, general and administrative expenses on the Company’s

Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income

in connection with the early redemptions for the years ended

February 28, 2014

, and

February 29, 2012

, were not material.  The AFS debt securities contractually mature in January 2023 and can be settled, at the option of the issuer, in cash, equity shares of the issuer, or a combination thereof.



11.    OTHER ACCRUED EXPENSES AND LIABILITIES:

The major components of other accrued expenses and liabilities are as follows:

12.    BORROWINGS:

Borrowings consist of the following:

Senior credit facility –

In connection with the Beer Business Acquisition, on May 2, 2013 (the “Restatement Date”), the Company, CIH International S.à r.l., an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (“CIH” and together with the Company, the “Borrowers”), and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent (the “Administrative Agent”), and certain other lenders (all such parties other than either of the Borrowers are collectively referred to as the “Lenders”) entered into a Restatement Agreement (the “Restatement Agreement”) that amended and restated the Company’s prior senior credit facility (as amended and restated by the Restatement Agreement, the “2013 Credit Agreement”).  The Restatement Agreement was entered into by the Company to arrange a portion of the debt to finance the Beer Business Acquisition.  The effective date of the Restatement Agreement, June 7, 2013, was the date on which all of the conditions to the 2013 Credit Agreement were satisfied, which occurred on the date of the closing of the Beer Business Acquisition (the “Restatement Effective Date”).

The 2013 Credit Agreement provides for aggregate credit facilities of

$3,787.5 million

, consisting of a

$515.6 million

U.S. term loan facility maturing on June 7, 2018 (the “U.S. Term A Facility”), a

$246.9 million

U.S. term loan facility maturing on June 7, 2019 (the “U.S. Term A-1 Facility”), a

$675.0 million

delayed draw U.S. term loan facility maturing on June 7, 2018 (the “U.S. Term A-2 Facility”), a

$500.0 million

delayed draw European term loan facility maturing on June 7, 2018 (the “European Term A Facility”), a

$1,000.0 million

European term loan facility maturing on June 7, 2020 (the “European Term B Facility”), and an

$850.0 million

revolving credit facility (including a sub-facility for letters of credit of up to

$200.0 million

) which terminates on June 7, 2018 (the “Revolving Credit Facility”).  The 2013 Credit Agreement also permits the Company from time to time after the



Restatement Effective Date to elect to increase the Lenders’ revolving credit commitments or add one or more tranches of additional term loans, subject to the willingness of existing or new lenders to fund such increase or term loans and other customary conditions.  The minimum aggregate principal amount of such incremental revolving credit commitment increases or additional term loans may be no less than

$25.0 million

and the maximum aggregate principal amount of all such incremental revolving credit commitment increases and additional term loans, other than term loans the proceeds of which are applied to repay existing term loans, may be no more than

$750.0 million

.  A portion of the borrowings under the 2013 Credit Agreement were used to refinance the outstanding obligations under the Company’s prior senior credit facility with the remainder used to finance a portion of the purchase price for the Beer Business Acquisition and related expenses.  The Company intends to use the remaining availability under the 2013 Credit Agreement for general corporate purposes.

The rate of interest for borrowings, excluding the European Term B Facility, under the 2013 Credit Agreement is a function of LIBOR plus a margin or the base rate plus a margin.  The rate of interest for the European Term B Facility borrowings under the 2013 Credit Agreement is a function of LIBOR, subject to a minimum rate of

0.75%

, plus a margin; or the base rate, subject to a minimum rate of

1.75%

, plus a margin.  The margin is adjustable based upon the Company’s debt ratio (as defined in the 2013 Credit Agreement).  As of

February 28, 2014

, the LIBOR margin for the U.S. Term A Facility, the U.S. Term A-2 Facility, the European Term A Facility and the Revolving Credit Facility was

2.0%

; the LIBOR margin for the U.S. Term A-1 Facility was

2.25%

; and the LIBOR margin for the European Term B Facility was

2.0%

.

The principal changes to the Company’s prior senior credit facility effected by the 2013 Credit Agreement are (i)  changes to the rate and term of the revolving credit facility and outstanding term loan facilities that took effect on the Restatement Effective Date, and a new

$675.0 million

delayed draw U.S. Term A-2 Facility that replaced the former delayed draw term A-2 facility, and (ii)  the creation of a

$1,500.0 million

delayed draw European term loan facility consisting of the

$500.0 million

European Term A Facility and the

$1,000.0 million

European Term B Facility.  The Company is the borrower under the U.S. term loan facilities.  CIH is the borrower under the European term loan facilities.  The 2013 Credit Agreement also modified the maximum net debt coverage ratio financial covenant.

The U.S. obligations under the 2013 Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain of the Company’s U.S. subsidiaries.  These obligations are also secured by a pledge of (i)

100%

of the ownership interests in certain of the Company’s U.S. subsidiaries and (ii)

65%

of the ownership interests in certain of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries.  The European obligations under the 2013 Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the Company.  These obligations are also secured by a pledge of (i)

100%

of certain interests in certain of CIH’s subsidiaries and (ii)

100%

of the ownership interests in certain of the Company’s U.S. subsidiaries and

65%

of the ownership interests in certain of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries.

The Company and its subsidiaries are also subject to covenants that are contained in the 2013 Credit Agreement, including those restricting the incurrence of additional indebtedness (including guarantees of indebtedness), additional liens, mergers and consolidations, the payment of dividends, the making of certain investments, prepayments of certain debt, transactions with affiliates, agreements that restrict the Company’s non-guarantor subsidiaries from paying dividends, and dispositions of property, in each case subject to numerous conditions, exceptions and thresholds.  The financial covenants are limited to a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum net debt coverage ratio.

As of

February 28, 2014

, under the 2013 Credit Agreement, the Company had outstanding borrowings under the U.S. Term A Facility of

$496.3 million

bearing an interest rate of

2.2%

, U.S. Term A-1 Facility of

$245.0 million

bearing an interest rate of

2.4%

, U.S. Term A-2 Facility of

$649.7 million

bearing an interest rate of

2.2%

, European Term A Facility of

$481.3 million

bearing an interest rate of

2.2%

, European Term B Facility of

$992.5 million

bearing an interest rate of

2.8%

, outstanding letters of credit of

$14.0 million

, and

$836.0 million

in revolving loans available to be drawn.



As of

February 28, 2014

, the required principal repayments under the term loans of the 2013 Credit Agreement for each of the five succeeding fiscal years and thereafter are as follows:

In June 2010, the Company entered into a

five

year delayed start interest rate swap agreement effective September 1, 2011, which was designated as a cash flow hedge for

$500.0 million

of the Company’s floating LIBOR rate debt.  Accordingly, the Company fixed its interest rates on

$500.0 million

of the Company’s floating LIBOR rate debt at an average rate of

2.9%

(exclusive of borrowing margins) through September 1, 2016.  In April 2012, the Company transitioned its interest rate swap agreement to a

one-month LIBOR base rate

versus the then existing

three-month LIBOR base rate

by entering into a new interest rate swap agreement which was designated as a cash flow hedge for

$500.0 million

of the Company’s floating LIBOR rate debt.  In addition, the then existing interest rate swap agreement was dedesignated as a hedge.  The Company also entered into an additional interest rate swap agreement for

$500.0 million

that was not designated as a hedge to offset the prospective impact of the newly undesignated interest rate swap agreement.  As a result of these hedges, the Company has fixed its interest rates on

$500.0 million

of the Company’s floating LIBOR rate debt at an average rate of

2.8%

(exclusive of borrowing margins) through September 1, 2016.  The unrealized losses in AOCI related to the dedesignated interest rate swap agreements are being reclassified from AOCI ratably into earnings in the same period in which the original hedged item is recorded in the

Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income

.  For the years ended

February 28, 2014

,

February 28, 2013

, and

February 29, 2012

, the Company reclassified net losses of

$8.2 million

,

$8.0 million

and

$3.8 million

, net of income tax effect, respectively, from AOCI to interest expense, net, on the Company’s

Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income

.

Senior notes –

In August 2006, the Company issued

$700.0 million

aggregate principal amount of

7.25%

Senior Notes due September 2016 at an issuance price of

$693.1 million

On April 17, 2012, the Company issued

$600.0 million

aggregate principal amount of

6%

Senior Notes due May 2022 (the “April 2012 Senior Notes”).  The net proceeds of the offering (

$591.4 million

) were used for general corporate purposes, including, among others, reducing the outstanding indebtedness under the Company’s then existing senior credit facility and common stock share repurchases under the 2013 Authorization (as defined in Note 15).  Interest on the April 2012 Senior Notes is payable semiannually on May 1 and November 1 of each year, beginning November 1, 2012.  As of

$600.0 million

aggregate principal amount of April 2012 Senior Notes.

The senior notes described above are redeemable, in whole or in part, at the option of the Company at any time at a redemption price equal to

100%

of the outstanding principal amount plus a make whole payment based on the present value of the future payments at the adjusted Treasury Rate plus


basis points.  The senior notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment to all existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness of the Company.  Certain of the Company’s U.S. subsidiaries guarantee the senior notes on a senior unsecured basis.

On August 14, 2012, the Company issued

$650.0 million

aggregate principal amount of

4.625%

Senior Notes due March 2023 (the “August 2012 Senior Notes”).  The Company intended to use the net proceeds from the offering (

$640.6 million

) to fund a portion of the original agreement signed by the Company in June 2012 to acquire the remaining

50%

equity interest in Crown Imports for approximately

$1.85 billion

(the “Initial Purchase Agreement”).  In connection with the issuance of the August 2012 Senior Notes, the Company and Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company, as Trustee, escrow agent, and securities intermediary, entered into an agreement (the “August 2012 Escrow Agreement”), pursuant to which an amount equal to

100%

of the principal amount of the August 2012 Senior Notes (collectively, with any other property from time to time held by the escrow agent, the “August 2012 Escrowed Property”) was placed into an escrow account to be released to the Company upon the closing of the Initial Purchase Agreement.  If the Initial Purchase Agreement was terminated or had not been consummated on or prior to December 30, 2013, all of the August 2012 Senior Notes would be redeemed (the “Special Mandatory Redemption”) at a price equal to

100%

of the outstanding principal amount, together with accrued and unpaid interest to the date of the Special Mandatory Redemption.

Because of the differences between the terms relating to a February 2013 amendment of the Initial Purchase Agreement and the Initial Purchase Agreement, the Company determined that the conditions for the release of the August 2012 Escrowed Property to the Company pursuant to the August 2012 Escrow Agreement could not be satisfied.  Accordingly, the Company gave notice to the escrow agent on February 19, 2013, to release the August 2012 Escrowed Property for purposes of effecting the Special Mandatory Redemption.  As a result, the August 2012 Senior Notes were redeemed on February 20, 2013, and the August 2012 Escrow Agreement was terminated in accordance with its terms.

aggregate principal amount of

4.25%

Senior Notes due May 2023 (the “May 2013 Ten Year Senior Notes”) (collectively, the “May 2013 Senior Notes”).  The Company used the net proceeds from the offering (

100%

of the outstanding principal amount plus a make whole payment based on the present value of the future payments at the adjusted Treasury Rate plus


basis points.  The May 2013 Senior Notes are senior unsecured obligations that rank equally with the Company’s other senior unsecured indebtedness.

100%

of the principal amount of the May 2013 Senior Notes (collectively, with any other property from time to time held by the escrow agent, the “May 2013 Escrowed Property”) was placed into an escrow account to be released to the Company upon the closing of the Beer Business Acquisition.

Accounts receivable securitization facilities –

On December 4, 2012, the Company entered into a


-day revolving trade accounts receivable securitization facility (the “CBI Facility”).  Under the CBI Facility, trade accounts receivable generated by the Company and certain of its subsidiaries are sold by the Company to a wholly-owned bankruptcy remote single purpose subsidiary (the “CBI SPV”), which is consolidated with the Company for financial reporting purposes.  Such trade accounts receivable have been pledged by the CBI SPV to secure borrowings under the CBI Facility.  The Company services the trade accounts receivable as servicer for the CBI Facility.  The trade accounts receivable balances related to the CBI Facility are reported as accounts receivable on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets, but the trade accounts receivable are at all times owned by the CBI SPV and are included on the financial statements of the Company to comply with generally accepted accounting principles.  On October 1, 2013, the Company and the CBI SPV effectively extended the CBI Facility through September 30, 2014, by amending and restating the CBI Facility (the “Amended CBI Facility”).  The Amended CBI Facility remains a


-day revolving trade accounts receivable securitization facility.  Under the Amended CBI Facility, there are

two

lenders, one holding

60%

of the aggregate facility and the other holding

40%

of the aggregate facility.  Any borrowings under the Amended CBI Facility are recorded as secured borrowings and bear interest as follows:  (i)

60%

of the borrowings are charged at that lender’s cost of funds plus a margin of


basis points and (ii)

40%

of the borrowings are charged at

one-month LIBOR

plus a margin of


basis points.  The Amended CBI Facility provides borrowing capacity of

$190.0 million

up to

$290.0 million

structured to account for the seasonality of the



Company’s business, subject to further limitations based upon various pre-agreed formulas.  As of

February 28, 2014

, the CBI SPV had

no

aggregate outstanding borrowings under the Amended CBI Facility.  As of

February 28, 2014

, the Company had

$275.0 million

available under the Amended CBI Facility.

Also, on October 1, 2013, Crown Imports entered into a


-day revolving trade accounts receivable securitization facility (the “Crown Facility”).  Under the Crown Facility, trade accounts receivable generated by Crown Imports are sold by Crown Imports to its wholly-owned bankruptcy remote single purpose subsidiary (the “Crown SPV”), which is consolidated with the Company for financial reporting purposes.  Such trade accounts receivable have been pledged by the Crown SPV to secure borrowings under the Crown Facility.  Crown Imports services the trade accounts receivable as servicer for the Crown Facility.  The trade accounts receivable balances related to the Crown Facility are reported as accounts receivable on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets, but the trade accounts receivable are at all times owned by the Crown SPV and are included on the financial statements of the Company to comply with generally accepted accounting principles.  Under the Crown Facility, there are

two

lenders, one holding

60%

of the aggregate facility and the other holding

40%

of the aggregate facility.  Any borrowings under the Crown Facility are recorded as secured borrowings and bear interest as follows:  (i)

60%

of the borrowings are charged at that lender’s cost of funds plus a margin of


basis points and (ii)

40%

of the borrowings are charged at

one-month LIBOR

plus a margin of


basis points.  The Crown Facility provides borrowing capacity of

$100.0 million

up to

$160.0 million

structured to account for the seasonality of Crown Imports’ business.  As of

February 28, 2014

, the Crown SPV had aggregate outstanding borrowings under the Crown Facility of

$19.2 million

bearing a weighted average interest rate of

1.1%

.  As of

February 28, 2014

, the Company had

$80.8 million

available under the Crown Facility.

13.    INCOME TAXES:

Income before income taxes was generated as follows:

The income tax provision (benefit) consisted of the following:



The foreign provision (benefit) for income taxes is based on foreign pretax earnings.  Earnings of foreign subsidiaries would be subject to U.S. income taxation on repatriation to the U.S.  The Company’s consolidated financial statements provide for anticipated tax liabilities on amounts that may be repatriated.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the future income tax effects of temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and are measured using enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income.

Significant components of deferred tax assets (liabilities) consist of the following:

Amounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets consist of:

In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  Management considers the projected reversal of deferred tax liabilities and projected future taxable income in making this assessment.  Based upon this assessment, management believes it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences, net of any valuation allowances.

Operating loss carryforwards totaling

$321.2 million

at

February 28, 2014

, are being carried forward in a number of jurisdictions where the Company is permitted to use tax operating losses from prior periods to reduce



future taxable income.  Of these operating loss carryforwards,

$308.6 million

will expire in 2018 through 2032 and

$12.6 million

of operating losses in certain jurisdictions may be carried forward indefinitely.

The Company is subject to ongoing tax examinations and assessments in various jurisdictions.  Accordingly, the Company provides for additional tax expense based on probable outcomes of such matters.  While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter, the Company believes the reserves reflect the probable outcome of known tax contingencies.  Unfavorable settlement of any particular issue would require the use of cash.  Favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction to the effective tax rate in the year of resolution.  During the year ended

February 28, 2014

, various U.S. Federal, state and international examinations were finalized.  Tax benefits of

$9.2 million

were recorded related to the resolution of certain tax positions in connection with those examinations and the expiration of statutes of limitation.

A reconciliation of the total tax provision (benefit) to the amount computed by applying the statutory U.S. Federal income tax rate to income before provision for (benefit from) income taxes is as follows:

For the years ended February 28, 2014, and February 28, 2013, the state and local income taxes, net of federal income tax benefit, includes benefits resulting from adjustments to the current and deferred state effective tax rates.  For the year ended February 29, 2012, the state and local income taxes, net of federal income tax benefit, includes benefits resulting from a change in the method of filing certain state income tax returns.  These benefits consist of the recognition of prior period income tax refunds, decreases in uncertain tax positions and adjustments to the current and deferred state effective tax rates.  The effect of earnings of foreign subsidiaries includes the difference between the U.S. statutory rate and local jurisdiction tax rates, as well as the provision for incremental U.S. taxes on unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries offset by foreign tax credits and other foreign adjustments.



As of

February 28, 2014

,

February 28, 2013

, and

February 29, 2012

, the liability for income taxes associated with uncertain tax positions, excluding interest and penalties, was

$101.5 million

,

$100.6 million

and

$92.0 million

, respectively.  A reconciliation of the beginning and ending unrecognized tax benefit liabilities is as follows:

As of

February 28, 2014

, and

February 28, 2013

, the Company has

$94.2 million

and

$90.3 million

, respectively, of non-current unrecognized tax benefit liabilities, including interest and penalties, recorded on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.  These liabilities are recorded as non-current as payment of cash is not anticipated within one year of the balance sheet date.

As of

February 28, 2014

, and

February 28, 2013

, the Company has

$101.5 million

and

$100.6 million

, respectively, of unrecognized tax benefit liabilities that, if recognized, would decrease the effective tax rate.

In accordance with the Company’s accounting policy, the Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefit liabilities as a component of the provision for income taxes on the Company’s

Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income

.  For the years ended

February 28, 2014

,

February 28, 2013

, and

February 29, 2012

, the Company recorded

$1.4 million

,

$0.4 million

and

($3.7) million

of net interest expense (income), net of income tax effect, and penalties, respectively.  As of

February 28, 2014

, and

February 28, 2013

,

$9.7 million

, net of income tax effect, and

$8.3 million

, net of income tax effect, respectively, were included in the liability for uncertain tax positions for the possible payment of interest and penalties.

Various U.S. Federal, state and foreign income tax examinations are currently in progress.  It is reasonably possible that the liability associated with the Company’s unrecognized tax benefit liabilities will increase or decrease within the next twelve months as a result of these examinations or the expiration of statutes of limitation.  As of

February 28, 2014

, the Company estimates that unrecognized tax benefit liabilities could change by a range of

$2 million

to

$43 million

.  The Company files U.S. Federal income tax returns and various state, local and foreign income tax returns.  Major tax jurisdictions where the Company is subject to examination by tax authorities include Canada, Luxembourg, Mexico, New Zealand and the U.S.  With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. Federal, state, local or foreign income tax examinations for fiscal years prior to February 28, 2009.

14.    COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES:

Operating leases –

Step rent provisions, escalation clauses, capital improvement funding and other lease concessions, when present in the Company’s leases, are taken into account in computing the minimum lease payments.  The minimum lease payments for the Company’s operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the minimum lease term.



Future payments under noncancelable operating leases having initial or remaining terms of one year or more are as follows for each of the five succeeding fiscal years and thereafter:

Rental expense was

$65.1 million

,

$60.4 million

and

$73.7 million

for the years ended

February 28, 2014

,

February 28, 2013

, and

February 29, 2012

, respectively.

Purchase commitments and contingencies –

In connection with prior acquisitions, the Company has assumed grape purchase contracts with certain growers and suppliers.  In addition, the Company has entered into other grape purchase contracts with various growers and suppliers in the normal course of business.  Under the grape purchase contracts, the Company is committed to purchase grape production yielded from a specified number of acres for a period of time from

one

to

fourteen

years.  The actual tonnage and price of grapes that must be purchased by the Company will vary each year depending on certain factors, including weather, time of harvest, overall market conditions and the agricultural practices and location of the growers and suppliers under contract.  Based on current production yields and published grape prices, the aggregate minimum purchase obligations under these contracts are estimated to be

$1,744.4 million

over the remaining terms of the contracts which extend

through December 2027

.

The Company’s aggregate minimum purchase obligations under certain raw material purchase contracts are estimated to be

$313.5 million

over the remaining terms of the contracts which extend

through December 2016

.  The Company’s aggregate minimum purchase obligations under bulk wine purchase contracts are estimated to be

$63.8 million

over the remaining terms of the contracts which extend

through December 2016

.

The Company has entered into certain processing and warehousing contracts which commit the Company to utilize outside services to process, package and/or store a minimum volume quantity.  The Company’s aggregate minimum contractual obligations under these processing and warehousing contracts are estimated to be

$85.7 million

through March 2019

.

In connection with the Beer Business Acquisition and the associated interim supply agreement, the Company’s minimum purchase obligation under the interim supply agreement for finished goods is estimated to be

$166.1 million

for the first quarter of fiscal 2015

.

Indemnification liabilities –

In connection with a prior divestiture, the Company indemnified respective parties against certain liabilities that may arise related to certain contracts with certain investees of the divested business, a certain facility in the U.K. and certain income tax matters.  As of

February 28, 2014

, and

February 28, 2013

, the carrying amount of these indemnification liabilities was

$11.6 million

and

$15.1 million

, respectively.  If the indemnified party were to incur a liability, pursuant to the terms of the indemnification, the Company would be required to reimburse the indemnified party.  As of

February 28, 2014

, the Company estimates that these indemnifications could require the Company to make potential future payments of up to

$292.7 million

under these indemnifications with

$278.9 million

of this amount able to be recovered by the Company from third parties under recourse provisions.  The Company does not expect to be required to make material payments under the indemnifications and the Company believes that the likelihood is remote that the indemnifications could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, cash flows or liquidity.



In addition, prior to June 7, 2013, the Company was jointly and severally liable with Modelo to indemnify a third party for lease payments over the term of a lease contract between Crown Imports and the third party for the lease of certain office facilities.

The carrying amount of this indemnification liability was not material.  In connection with the Beer Business Acquisition, this indemnification liability was released to selling, general and administrative expenses on the Company’s

Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income

.

Employment contracts –

The Company has employment contracts with its executive officers and certain other management personnel with either automatic

one

year renewals after an initial term or an

indefinite

term of employment unless terminated by either party.  These employment contracts provide for minimum salaries, as adjusted for annual increases, and may include incentive bonuses based upon attainment of specified management goals.  These employment contracts may also provide for severance payments in the event of specified termination of employment.  In addition, the Company has employment arrangements with certain other management personnel which provide for severance payments in the event of specified termination of employment.  As of

February 28, 2014

, the aggregate commitment for future compensation and severance, excluding incentive bonuses, was

$37.3 million

, of which

$8.0 million

was accrued.

Employees covered by collective bargaining agreements –

Approximately

13%

of the Company’s employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements at

February 28, 2014

.  Agreements expiring within one year cover approximately

5%

of the Company’s employees.

Legal matters –

In the course of its business, the Company is subject to litigation from time to time.  Although the amount of any liability with respect to such litigation cannot be determined, in the opinion of management, such liability will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

15.    STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY:

Common stock –

The Company has

two

classes of outstanding common stock:  Class A Common Stock and Class B Convertible Common Stock.  Class B Convertible Common Stock shares are

convertible into shares of Class A Common Stock on a one-to-one basis

at any time at the option of the holder.  Holders of Class B Convertible Common Stock are entitled to

ten votes per share

.  Holders of Class A Common Stock are entitled to

one vote per share

and a cash dividend premium.  If the Company pays a cash dividend on Class B Convertible Common Stock, each share of Class A Common Stock will receive an amount at least

ten

percent greater than the amount of the cash dividend per share paid on Class B Convertible Common Stock.  In addition, the Board of Directors may declare and pay a dividend on Class A Common Stock without paying any dividend on Class B Convertible Common Stock.  However, the Company’s senior credit facility limits the cash dividends that can be paid by the Company on its common stock to an amount determined in accordance with the terms of the 2013 Credit Agreement.

In addition, the Company has a class of common stock consisting of shares of Class 1 Common Stock.  Shares of Class 1 Common Stock

generally have no voting rights

.  Class 1 Common Stock shares are

convertible into shares of Class A Common Stock on a one-to-one basis

at any time at the option of the holder, provided that the holder immediately sells the Class A Common Stock acquired upon conversion.  Because shares of Class 1 Common Stock are convertible into shares of Class A Common Stock, for each share of Class 1 Common Stock issued, the Company must reserve one share of Class A Common Stock for issuance upon the conversion of the share of Class 1 Common Stock.  Holders of Class 1 Common Stock do not have any preference as to dividends, but may participate in any dividend if and when declared by the Board of Directors.  If the Company pays a cash dividend on Class 1 Common Stock, each share of Class A Common Stock will receive an amount at least

ten

percent greater than the amount of cash dividend per share paid on Class 1 Common Stock.  In addition, the Board of Directors may declare and pay a dividend on Class A Common Stock without paying a dividend on Class 1 Common Stock.  The cash dividends declared and paid on Class B Convertible Common Stock and Class 1 Common Stock must always be the same.



At

February 28, 2014

, the number of authorized shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock, Class B Convertible Common Stock and Class 1 Common Stock were

Stock repurchases –

In April 2011, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to

21,234,266

shares of Class A Common Stock pursuant to the 2012 Authorization at an aggregate cost of

In April 2012, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to

$1.0 billion

of the Company’s Class A Common Stock and Class B Convertible Common Stock (the “2013 Authorization”).  The Board of Directors did not specify a date upon which the 2013 Authorization would expire.  Share repurchases under the 2013 Authorization may be accomplished at management’s discretion from time to time based on market conditions, the Company’s cash and debt position, and other factors as determined by management.  Shares may be repurchased through open market or privately negotiated transactions.  The Company may fund future share repurchases with cash generated from operations, proceeds from borrowings under the accounts receivable securitization facilities or proceeds from revolver borrowings under its senior credit facility.  Any repurchased shares will become treasury shares.

The Company used proceeds from the April 2012 Senior Notes, revolver borrowings under its prior senior credit facilities, and cash generated from operations to pay the purchase price for the repurchased shares.  The repurchased shares have become treasury shares.

16.    STOCK-BASED EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION:

The Company has

two

material stock-based employee compensation plans (as further discussed below).  Total compensation cost and income tax benefits recognized for the Company’s stock-based awards are as follows:



Long-term stock incentive plan –

Under the Company’s Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan, nonqualified stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance share units, and other stock-based awards may be granted to employees, officers and directors of the Company.  The aggregate number of shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock and Class 1 Common Stock available for awards under the Company’s Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan is

108,000,000

shares.  The exercise price, vesting period and term of nonqualified stock options granted are established by the committee administering the plan (the “Committee”).  The exercise price of any nonqualified stock option may not be less than the fair market value of the Company’s Class A Common Stock on the date of grant.  Nonqualified stock options generally vest and become exercisable over a

four

-year period from the date of grant.  Nonqualified stock options expire at the times established by the Committee, but not later than

ten

years after the grant date.

Grants of restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance share units, and other stock-based awards may contain such vesting, terms, conditions and other requirements as the Committee may establish.  Restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards are based on service and generally vest over

one

to

four

years from the date of grant.  Performance share unit awards are based on service and the satisfaction of certain performance conditions, and vest over a required employee service period, generally from

one

to

three

years from the date of grant, which closely matches the performance period.  The performance conditions include the achievement of specified financial or operational performance metrics, or market conditions which require the achievement of specified levels of shareholder return relative to other companies as defined in the applicable performance share unit agreement.  The actual number of shares to be awarded upon vesting of a performance share unit award will range between

0%

and

200%

of the target award, based upon the measure of performance as determined by the Committee.  Performance share unit awards presented in the table below for the years ended

February 28, 2014

,

February 28, 2013

, and

February 29, 2012

, reflect the awards at target.  For the year ended

February 28, 2014

,

309,653

shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock (net of

267,577

shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding requirements) were issued from treasury shares for the vesting of performance share units at

200%

of the target award.

A summary of stock option activity primarily under the Company’s Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan is as follows:



A summary of restricted Class A Common Stock activity under the Company’s Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan is as follows:



The following table summarizes information about stock options outstanding at

February 28, 2014

:

Other information pertaining to stock options is as follows:



The fair value of stock options is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions:

For the years ended

February 28, 2014

,

February 28, 2013

, and

February 29, 2012

, the Company used a projected expected life for each stock option award granted based on historical experience of employees’ exercise behavior for similar type awards.  Expected volatility for the years ended

February 28, 2014

,

February 28, 2013

, and

February 29, 2012

, is based primarily on historical volatility levels of the Company’s Class A Common Stock.  The risk-free interest rate for the years ended

February 28, 2014

,

February 28, 2013

, and

February 29, 2012

, is based on the implied yield currently available on U.S. Treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life.

The weighted average grant-date fair value of performance share units granted with a market condition for the years ended

February 28, 2014

, and

February 28, 2013

, was

$66.33

and

$38.47

, respectively.  There were

no

performance share units granted with a market condition for the year ended

February 29, 2012

.  The fair value of performance share units granted with a market condition is estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo Simulation model with the following weighted average assumptions:

For the years ended

February 28, 2014

, and

February 28, 2013

, the Company based expected volatility primarily on historical volatility levels of the Company’s Class A Common Stock.  The risk-free interest rate for the years ended

February 28, 2014

, and

February 28, 2013

, is based on the implied yield currently available on U.S. Treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the performance period.

Employee stock purchase plan –

The Company has a stock purchase plan (the “Employee Stock Purchase Plan”) under which

9,000,000

shares of Class A Common Stock may be issued.  Under the terms of the plan, eligible employees may purchase shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock through payroll deductions.  The purchase price is the lower of

85%

of the fair market value of the stock on the first or last day of the purchase period.  For the years ended

February 28, 2014

,

February 28, 2013

, and

February 29, 2012

, employees purchased

163,817

shares,

210,895

shares and

272,560

shares, respectively, under this plan.  In addition, for the year ended

February 29, 2012

, there were

6,801

shares purchased under an immaterial stock purchase plan for eligible employees and directors of the Company’s U.K. subsidiaries.



The weighted average fair value of purchase rights granted under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan for the years ended

February 28, 2014

,

February 28, 2013

, and

February 29, 2012

, was

$13.90

,

$8.23

and

$4.90

, respectively.  The fair value of purchase rights granted is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions:

As of

February 28, 2014

, there was

$75.4 million

of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock-based compensation arrangements granted under the Company’s stock-based employee compensation plans.  This cost is expected to be recognized in the Company’s

Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income

over a weighted-average period of

2.2 years

.  With respect to the issuance of shares under any of the Company’s stock-based compensation plans, the Company has the option to issue authorized but unissued shares or treasury shares.

17.    EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE:

The computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share is as follows:

For the years ended

February 28, 2014

,

February 28, 2013

, and

February 29, 2012

, stock-based awards, primarily stock options, which could result in the issuance of

0.3 million

shares,

0.3 million

shares and

8.9 million

shares, respectively, of Class A Common Stock were outstanding, but were not included in the computation of earnings per common share – diluted for Class A Common Stock because the effect of including such awards would have been antidilutive.



18.    ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS):

Other comprehensive loss, net of income tax effect, includes the following components:



Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of income tax effect, includes the following components:



19.    SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS AND CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK:

Sales to the Company’s

five largest customers

represented

36.6%

,

57.8%

and

61.0%

of the Company’s sales for the years ended

February 28, 2014

,

February 28, 2013

, and

February 29, 2012

, respectively.  Sales to the Company’s five largest customers are expected to continue to represent a significant portion of the Company’s revenues.  Sales to individual customers which amount to

10% or more of the Company's sales

and associated amounts receivable from these customers as a percentage of the Company’s accounts receivable, net, are as follows:

Sales for the above customers are primarily reported within the Wine and Spirits segment.  The Company’s arrangements with certain of its customers may, generally, be terminated by either party with prior notice.  The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers’ financial position, and management of the Company is of the opinion that any risk of significant loss is reduced due to the diversity of customers and geographic sales area.

20.    CONDENSED CONSOLIDATING FINANCIAL INFORMATION:

The following information sets forth the condensed consolidating balance sheets as of

February 28, 2014

, and

February 28, 2013

, the

condensed consolidating statements of comprehensive income

for the years ended

February 28, 2014

,

February 28, 2013

, and

February 29, 2012

, and the condensed consolidating statements of cash flows for the years ended

February 28, 2014

,

February 28, 2013

, and

February 29, 2012

, for the parent company, the combined subsidiaries of the Company which guarantee the Company’s senior notes (“Subsidiary Guarantors”), the combined subsidiaries of the Company which are not Subsidiary Guarantors (primarily foreign subsidiaries) (“Subsidiary Nonguarantors”) and the Company.  The Subsidiary Guarantors are

100%

owned, directly or indirectly, by the parent company and the guarantees are joint and several obligations of each of the Subsidiary Guarantors.  The guarantees are full and unconditional, as those terms are used in Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X, except that a Subsidiary Guarantor can be automatically released and relieved of its obligations under certain customary circumstances contained in the indentures governing the Company’s senior notes.  These customary circumstances include, so long as other applicable provisions of the indentures are adhered to, the termination or release of a Subsidiary Guarantor’s guarantee of other indebtedness or upon the legal defeasance or covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Company’s senior notes.  Separate financial statements for the Subsidiary Guarantors of the Company are not presented because the Company has determined that such financial statements would not be material to investors.  The accounting policies of the parent company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Subsidiary Nonguarantors are the same as those described for the Company in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Note 1 and include the recently adopted accounting guidance described in Note 2.  There are no restrictions on the ability of the Subsidiary Guarantors to transfer funds to the Company in the form of cash dividends, loans or advances.

In connection with the preparation of the condensed consolidating financial information, the Company made certain immaterial adjustments to the condensed consolidating balance sheet at February 28, 2013, and the condensed consolidating statements of cash flows for the years ended February 28, 2013, and February 29, 2012.  The Company will also make similar adjustments to its condensed consolidating statements of cash flows for comparative prior periods presented in future filings.  These adjustments (i)  did not change the net increase in cash and cash investments for the parent company, the Subsidiary Guarantors or the Subsidiary Nonguarantors and (ii)  had no impact on the consolidated amounts.  The substantial majority of these adjustments had the effect of



(i)  decreasing the parent company’s cash flows from operating activities and increasing the parent company’s cash flows from financing activities and (ii)  increasing the Subsidiary Guarantors’ cash flows from operating activities and decreasing the Subsidiary Guarantors’ cash flows from financing activities.













21.    BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION:

Prior to the Beer Business Acquisition, Crown Imports was a reportable segment of the Company.  In connection with the Beer Business Acquisition and the resulting consolidation of the acquired businesses from the date of acquisition, the Crown Imports segment, together with the Brewery Purchase, is now known as the Beer segment.  Accordingly, the Company’s internal management financial reporting consists of

two

business divisions:  (i)  Beer and (ii)  Wine and Spirits, and the Company reports its operating results in

three

segments:  (i)

Beer (imported beer), (ii)

Wine and Spirits (wine and spirits), and (iii)

Corporate Operations and Other.  The business segments reflect how the Company’s operations are managed, how operating performance within the Company is evaluated by senior management and the structure of its internal financial reporting.  Amounts included in the Corporate Operations and Other segment consist of costs of executive management, corporate development, corporate finance, human resources, internal audit, investor relations, legal, public relations and global information technology.  The amounts included in the Corporate Operations and Other segment are general costs that are applicable to the consolidated group and are therefore not allocated to the other reportable segments.  All costs reported within the Corporate Operations and Other segment are not included in the chief operating decision maker’s evaluation of the operating income performance of the other reportable segments.

In addition, management excludes items that affect comparability (“Unusual Items”) from its evaluation of the results of each operating segment as these Unusual Items are not reflective of continuing operations of the segments.  Segment operating performance and segment management compensation is evaluated based upon continuing segment operating income.  As such, the performance measures for incentive compensation purposes for segment management do not include the impact of these items.



For the years ended

February 28, 2014

,

February 28, 2013

, and

February 29, 2012

, Unusual Items included in consolidated operating income consist of:

The Company evaluates performance based on operating income of the respective business units.  The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described for the Company in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Note 1 and include the recently adopted accounting guidance described in Note 2.

Segment information is as follows:





The Company’s areas of operations are principally in the U.S.  Current operations outside the U.S. are in Mexico for the Beer segment and primarily in Canada, New Zealand and Italy for the Wine and Spirits segment.  Revenues are attributed to countries based on the location of the selling company.

Geographic data is as follows:

22.    ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE NOT YET ADOPTED:

Liabilities –

In February 2013, the FASB issued guidance for the recognition, measurement and disclosure of certain obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements for which the total amount of the obligation is fixed at the reporting date.  The Company is required to adopt this guidance for its annual and interim periods beginning March 1, 2014.  In addition, this guidance requires retrospective application.  The adoption of this guidance on March 1, 2014, did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Foreign currency translation –

In March 2013, the FASB issued amended guidance to clarify the applicable guidance for the release of foreign currency cumulative translation adjustments under generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S.  The amended guidance clarifies when cumulative translation adjustments should be released into net income in connection with (i)  the loss of a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets within a foreign



entity or (ii)  the partial sale of an equity method investment that is a foreign entity.  The amended guidance also clarifies the types of events that result in the sale of an investment in a foreign entity.  The Company is required to adopt this amended guidance for its annual and interim periods beginning March 1, 2014.  The adoption of this amended guidance on March 1, 2014, did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Income taxes –

In July 2013, the FASB issued amended guidance to clarify the presentation of unrecognized tax benefits when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward exists as of the reporting date.  The Company is required to adopt this amended guidance for its annual and interim periods beginning March 1, 2014.  The adoption of this amended guidance on March 1, 2014, did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Discontinued operations –

In April 2014, the FASB issued amended guidance regarding the definition and disclosure of discontinued operations.  Under the amended guidance, a disposal of a component of an entity (or a group of components) is required to be reported in discontinued operations if the disposal represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entity’s operations and financial results when certain criteria are met.  The Company is required to adopt this guidance for its annual and interim periods beginning March 1, 2015.  The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

23.    SELECTED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL INFORMATION (UNAUDITED):

A summary of selected quarterly financial information is as follows:



(1)

The following table identifies these items, net of income tax effect, by quarter and in the aggregate for

Fiscal 2014

:

(2)

The sum of the quarterly earnings per common share for

Fiscal 2014

Fiscal 2013

:



Item 9.  Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.

Not Applicable.

Item 9A.  Controls and Procedures.

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded, based on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this report, that the Company’s “disclosure controls and procedures” (as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (i)  is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and (ii)  is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Internal Control over Financial Reporting

(a)

See page 52 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, which is incorporated herein by reference.

(b)

See page 50 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the attestation report of KPMG LLP, the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, which is incorporated herein by reference.

(c)

The Beer Business Acquisition was significant to the Company and was consummated effective June 7, 2013.  Upon consummation of the Beer Business Acquisition, Crown Imports LLC became a consolidated subsidiary and ceased being accounted for under the equity method.  Although we have included Crown Imports LLC within management’s annual assessment of internal control over financial reporting for the year ended

February 28, 2014

, we are in the process of implementing our internal control over financial reporting structure over the Brewery Business we acquired in connection with the Beer Business Acquisition and expect that this effort will be completed in Fiscal 2015.  In connection with management’s quarterly evaluation of “internal control over financial reporting” (as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)), other than as noted above, no changes were identified in our internal control over financial reporting during our fiscal quarter ended

February 28, 2014

(our fourth fiscal quarter) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Item 9B.  Other Information.
