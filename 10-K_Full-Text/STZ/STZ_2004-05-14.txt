ITEM  1.   BUSINESS
- -------    --------

INTRODUCTION

     Unless  the  context  otherwise  requires,  the  term  "Company"  refers to
Constellation  Brands,  Inc.  and  its  subsidiaries, and all references to "net
sales"  refer to gross sales less promotions, returns and allowances, and excise
taxes to conform with the Company's method of classification.  All references to
"Fiscal  2004",  "Fiscal  2003"  and  "Fiscal 2002" shall refer to the Company's
fiscal  year  ended  the  last  day  of  February  of  the  indicated year.  All
references  to  "Fiscal  2005"  shall  refer to the Company's fiscal year ending
February  28,  2005.

     Market share and industry data disclosed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K
have  been  obtained  from  the  following industry and government publications:
Adams  Liquor  Handbook;  Adams  Wine Handbook; Adams Beer Handbook; Adams Media
Handbook Advance; The U.S. Wine Market: Impact Databank Review and Forecast; The
U.S.  Beer Market: Impact Databank Review and Forecast; The U.S. Spirits Market:
Impact  Databank  Review  and  Forecast;  International  Wine and Spirit Record;
Australian  Wine  and  Brandy  Reports;  NACM;  AC  Nielsen;  IRI; and The Drink
Pocketbook.  The  Company  has  not  independently  verified  this data.  Unless
otherwise  noted,  all  references to market share data are based on unit volume
and unless otherwise noted, the most recent complete industry data available are
for  calendar  2003.

     The  Company  is  a leading international producer and marketer of beverage
alcohol brands with a broad portfolio across the wine, spirits and imported beer
categories.  The  Company  has the largest wine business in the world and is the
largest  multi-category  supplier  of  beverage  alcohol in the United States; a
leading producer and exporter of wine from Australia and New Zealand; and both a
major  producer  and  independent  drinks wholesaler in the United Kingdom.  The
Company's  strong  market  positions  increase its purchasing power and make the
Company  a  supplier  of  choice  to  its  customers.

     With  its  broad  product  portfolio, the Company believes it is distinctly
positioned  to  satisfy  an  array  of  consumer preferences across all beverage
alcohol  categories  and  price  points.  Many  of  the  Company's  products are
recognized  leaders  in  their  respective  categories.  Leading  brands  in the
Company's  portfolio  include Corona Extra, Modelo Especial, Pacifico, St. Pauli
Girl,  Franciscan  Oakville  Estate,  Simi,  Estancia,  Ravenswood,  Blackstone,
Banrock Station, Hardys, Nobilo, Houghton, Leasingham, Almaden, Inglenook, Arbor
Mist,  Vendange,  Alice  White, Stowells, Black Velvet, Fleischmann's, Schenley,
Ten  High  and  Blackthorn.

     The  Company is a Delaware corporation incorporated on December 4, 1972, as
the  successor  to  a business founded in 1945.  Since the Company's founding in
1945  as a producer and marketer of wine products, the Company has grown through
a  combination  of  internal  growth  and  acquisitions.  The Company's internal
growth has been driven by leveraging the Company's existing portfolio of leading
brands, developing new products, new packaging and line extensions, and focusing
on  the  faster  growing  sectors  of  the  beverage  alcohol  industry.

     The Company has successfully integrated a number of major acquisitions that
have  broadened  its  portfolio  and  increased  its  market  share,  net sales,
operating  income  and  cash  flow.  Through these acquisitions, the Company has
become more competitive by: diversifying its portfolio; developing strong market
positions  in  the growing beverage alcohol product categories of varietal table
wine  and  imported  beer;  strengthening  its  relationships  with wholesalers;
expanding  its  distribution  and  enhancing  its  production  capabilities; and
acquiring  additional  management,  operational,  marketing,  and  research  and
development  expertise.

     In  April 2003, the Company completed the acquisition of BRL Hardy Limited,
now  known as Hardy Wine Company Limited ("Hardy"), Australia's largest producer
of  wine,  which  enhanced  the  Company's overall growth prospects and gave the
Company an immediate presence in the Australian domestic and export markets.  As
a  result  of  the acquisition of Hardy, the Company also acquired the remaining
50%  ownership  of  Pacific  Wine  Partners  LLC  ("PWP"), the joint venture the
Company  established  with Hardy in July 2001 that produces, markets and sells a
portfolio  of premium wine in the United States, including a range of Australian
imports.  The  acquisition  of Hardy along with the remaining interest in PWP is
referred  to  together  as the "Hardy Acquisition."  Among the well-known brands
acquired  in  the  Hardy  Acquisition  are Banrock Station, Hardys Nottage Hill,
Hardys  Stamp  and  VR,  Eileen  Hardy,  Sir James, Omni, Nobilo, Leasingham and
Houghton.  For  more  information  about this and other recent acquisitions, see
"Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial Condition and Results of
Operations"  in  Item  7  of  this  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS

     As a result of the Hardy Acquisition, the Company has changed the structure
of its internal organization to consist of two business divisions, Constellation
Wines  and  Constellation Beers and Spirits.  Separate division chief executives
report  directly  to  the  Company's chief operating officer.  Consequently, the
Company  reports  its  operating results in three segments:  Constellation Wines
(branded  wine,  and  U.K. wholesale and other), Constellation Beers and Spirits
(imported  beers  and  distilled  spirits)  and  Corporate  Operations and Other
(primarily  corporate  related  items  and  other).  The  new business segments,
described  more  fully  below,  reflect  how  the Company's operations are being
managed,  how  operating  performance  within  the Company is being evaluated by
senior  management  and  the  structure  of  its  internal  financial reporting.

     Information  regarding net sales, operating income and total assets of each
of the Company's business segments and information regarding geographic areas is
set  forth in Note 22 to the Company's consolidated financial statements located
in  Item  8  of  this  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K.

     CONSTELLATION WINES

     Constellation  Wines  is  the  leading producer and marketer of wine in the
world.  It  sells  a  large  number of wine brands across all categories - table
wine,  dessert  wine and sparkling wine - and across all price points - popular,
premium,  super-premium  and  ultra-premium.  The portfolio of super-premium and
ultra-premium  wines is supported by vineyard holdings in California, Australia,
New  Zealand  and  Chile.  As  the  largest producer and marketer of wine in the
world,  Constellation  Wines  has leading market positions in several countries.
It is the second largest producer and marketer of wine in the United States, the
largest  producer and marketer of wine in Australia, and the largest marketer of
wine  in  the United Kingdom.  In addition, Constellation Wines exports its wine
products  to  the  major  wine  consuming  markets  of  the  world.

     In  the  United States, Constellation Wines sells 18 of the top-selling 100
wine  brands  and  has  one  of the largest fine wine portfolios.  In the United
Kingdom,  it  has  seven  of the top-selling 20 selling table wine brands to the
off-premise  market,  three  of  the  top-selling  10  table  wine brands in the
on-premise  market  and  the  best  selling brand of fortified British wine.  In
Australia,  it  has wine brands across all price points and varieties, including
the most comprehensive range of premium wine brands, and is the largest producer
of  cask  (box)  wines.

     Constellation  Wines'  leading  wine  brands  include  Franciscan  Oakville
Estate, Simi, Estancia, Ravenswood, Blackstone, Banrock Station, Hardys, Nobilo,
Houghton,  Leasingham, Almaden, Inglenook, Arbor Mist, Vendange, Alice White and
Stowells.

     Constellation  Wines is also the leading independent beverage wholesaler to
the  on-premise  trade in the United Kingdom and has more than 16,000 on-premise
accounts.   The  wholesaling  business  is  wine  led,  but  also  involves  the
distribution  of  branded  distilled spirits, cider, beer, RTDs and soft drinks.
While  these  products  are  primarily produced by other major drinks companies,
they  also  include Constellation Wines' branded wine, cider and water products.

     Constellation  Wines  is  also  the second largest producer and marketer of
cider  in  the United Kingdom, with leading cider brands Blackthorn and Gaymer's
Olde  English,  and  produces  and markets Strathmore, the leading bottled water
brand  in  the  United  Kingdom  on-premise  market.

     In  conjunction  with its wine production, Constellation Wines produces and
sells  bulk  wine  and  other  related  products  and  services.

     CONSTELLATION BEERS AND SPIRITS

     Constellation  Beers  and Spirits imports and markets a diversified line of
beer  and produces, bottles, imports and markets a diversified line of distilled
spirits.  It  is  the  largest marketer of imported beer in 25 primarily western
U.S.  states,  where it has exclusive rights to distribute the Mexican brands in
its  portfolio.  Constellation  Beers  and  Spirits  has exclusive rights to the
entire United States for its non-Mexican beer brands.  It distributes six of the
top  22  imported  beer  brands  in  the  United  States:  Corona  Extra, Modelo
Especial,  Pacifico, Corona  Light,  St.  Pauli Girl, and Negra Modelo.  Corona
Extra  is  the  best  selling imported beer in the United States and the seventh
best  selling  beer  overall in the United States.  It also imports the Tsingtao
beer  brand  from  China.

     Constellation  Beers and Spirits is the third largest producer and marketer
of  distilled  spirits in the United States and exports its distilled spirits to
other major distilled spirits consuming markets. Its principal distilled spirits
brands  include  Black  Velvet,  Barton,  Skol,  Fleischmann's,   Canadian  LTD,
Montezuma,  Ten High, Chi-Chi's prepared cocktails, Mr. Boston, Inver House, and
Monte  Alban.  Substantially all of this segment's distilled spirits unit volume
consists  of  products  marketed  in  the value and mid-premium priced category.
Constellation  Beers  and  Spirits  also  sells bulk distilled spirits and other
related  products  and  services.

     CORPORATE OPERATIONS AND OTHER

     The   Corporate  Operations   and   Other   segment  includes   traditional
corporate-related  items.

MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION

     The  Company  employs  full-time,  in-house  marketing,  sales and customer
service  organizations within its segments to maintain a high degree of focus on
each  of  its  product  categories.  The  organizations use a range of marketing
strategies  and  tactics  to  build  brand  equity and increase sales, including
market research, consumer and trade advertising, price promotions, point-of-sale
materials,  event  sponsorship and public relations.  Where opportunities exist,
particularly  with  national  accounts,  the  Company  leverages  its  sales and
marketing  skills  across  the  organization.

     In  North America, the Company's products are primarily distributed by more
than  1,000  wholesale  distributors  as  well as state and provincial alcoholic
beverage  control  agencies.  As  is  the  case  with all other beverage alcohol
companies,  products sold through state or provincial alcoholic beverage control
agencies are subject to obtaining and maintaining listings to sell the Company's
products  in  that  agency's state or province. State and provincial governments
can  affect prices paid by consumers of the Company's products. This is possible
either  through the imposition of taxes or, in states and provinces in which the
government  acts  as  the  distributor  of  the  Company's  products  through an
alcoholic  beverage  control  agency,  by directly setting retail prices for the
Company's  products.  In  the  Company's  other  markets, products are primarily
distributed  either  directly to retailers or through wholesalers and importers.
In  Australasia,  the  distribution  channels are dominated by a small number of
industry  leaders.  Its  U.K.  wholesaling  business  sells  and distributes the
Company's  branded  products and those of other major drinks companies through a
network  of  depots  located  throughout  the  United  Kingdom.

TRADEMARKS AND DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENTS

     Trademarks  are an important aspect of the Company's business.  The Company
sells  its products under a number of trademarks, which the Company owns or uses
under  license.  Throughout  its segments, the Company also has various licenses
and  distribution  agreements  for  the  sale, or the production and sale of its
products  and  products  of  third  parties.  These  licenses  and  distribution
agreements  have varying terms and durations.  Agreements include, among others,
a  long-term  license agreement with Hiram Walker & Sons, Inc., which expires in
2116,  for  the  Ten High, Crystal Palace, Northern Light, Lauder's and Imperial
Spirits  brands,  and  a long-term license agreement with Chi-Chi's, Inc., which
expires  in  2117,  for the production, marketing and sale of beverage products,
alcoholic  and  non-alcoholic,  utilizing  the  Chi-Chi's  brand  name.

     All  of the Company's imported beer products are marketed and sold pursuant
to  exclusive  distribution  agreements  with  the  suppliers of these products.
These  agreements  have  terms that vary and prohibit the Company from importing
other  beer from other producers from the same country.  The Company's agreement
to  distribute Corona Extra and other Mexican beer brands exclusively throughout
25  primarily  western  U.S.  states  expires  in  December 2006 and, subject to
compliance  with  certain  performance  criteria, continued retention of certain
Company  personnel  and  other  terms under the agreement, will be automatically
renewed  for  additional terms of five years.  Changes in control of the Company
or of its subsidiaries involved in importing the Mexican beer brands, changes in
the  position of the Chief Executive Officer of Barton Beers, Ltd., including by
death or disability, or the termination of the President of Barton Incorporated,
may  be  a  basis  for  the  supplier,  unless  it  consents to such changes, to
terminate  the  agreement.  The  supplier's  consent  to such changes may not be
unreasonably withheld.  Prior to their expiration, all of the Company's imported
beer  distribution  agreements  may  be  terminated if the Company fails to meet
certain  performance  criteria.   The  Company  believes  it  is  currently   in
compliance  with  its material imported beer distribution agreements.  From time
to  time, the Company has failed, and may in the future fail, to satisfy certain
performance  criteria  in its distribution agreements.  Although there can be no
assurance  that  the  Company's  material  beer  distribution agreements will be
renewed,  given  the  Company's  long-term relationships with its suppliers, the
Company  expects  that such agreements will be renewed prior to their expiration
and  does  not  believe  that  these  agreements  will  be  terminated.

COMPETITION

     The  beverage alcohol industry is highly competitive.  The Company competes
on  the  basis  of  quality, price, brand recognition and distribution strength.
The  Company's  beverage  alcohol  products  compete  with  other  alcoholic and
nonalcoholic  beverages for consumer purchases, as well as shelf space in retail
stores, restaurant presence and wholesaler attention.  The Company competes with
numerous  multinational producers and distributors of beverage alcohol products,
some  of  which  may  have  greater  resources  than  the  Company.

     Constellation  Wines'  principal  wine  competitors  include:  E  & J Gallo
Winery,  The  Wine  Group,  Beringer  Blass,  The Robert Mondavi Corporation and
Kendall-Jackson  in  the  United  States;  Southcorp  Wines, Orlando Wyndham and
Beringer  Blass  in  Australia; and E & J Gallo Winery, Southcorp Wines, Western
Wines, Halewood Vintners and Pernod-Ricard in the United Kingdom.  Its wholesale
business  competes  with  major  brewers  who also have wholesale operations, in
particular,  Scottish  Courage, Coors, Interbrew and Carlsberg Tetley, and other
independent  national  and regional wholesalers.  Constellation Wines' principal
cider  competitor  is  Scottish  &  Newcastle.

     Constellation  Beers  and  Spirits' principal competitors include: Heineken
USA,  Molson,  Labatt  USA  and  Guinness  Import  Company  in the imported beer
category  as  well  as  domestic  producers  such  as  Anheuser Busch, Coors and
SAB-Miller;  and Diageo, Brown-Forman Beverages, Jim Beam Brands and Heaven Hill
Distilleries  in  the  distilled  spirits  category.

PRODUCTION

     In  the  United  States,  the  Company  operates  17 wineries where wine is
produced  from  many  varieties of grapes grown principally in the Napa, Sonoma,
Monterey  and  San  Joaquin  regions  of  California.  In Australia, the Company
operates  11 wineries where wine is produced from many varieties of grapes grown
in  most  of  the  major viticultural regions. Grapes are crushed at most of the
Company's  wineries  and  stored  as  wine  until  packaged  for  sale under the
Company's  brand  names  or sold in bulk. Most of the Company's wine is packaged
and  sold  within  18  months  after  the grape crush. In the United States, the
Company's  inventories  of  wine are usually at their highest levels in November
and  December  immediately after the crush of each year's grape harvest, and are
substantially  reduced  prior  to  the  subsequent  year's  crush. Similarly, in
Australia, the Company's inventories of wine are usually at their highest levels
in  April  and May immediately after the crush of each year's grape harvest, and
are substantially reduced prior to the subsequent year's crush. The Company also
operates  one  winery  in  Chile  and  two  wineries  in  New  Zealand.

     The  bourbon whiskeys and domestic blended whiskeys marketed by the Company
are  primarily  produced and aged by the Company at its distillery in Bardstown,
Kentucky.  The  Company's  primary  distilled  spirits  bottling facility in the
United States is in Owensboro, Kentucky.  The majority of the Company's Canadian
whisky  requirements  are  produced  and  aged  at  its Canadian distilleries in
Lethbridge,  Alberta,  and  Valleyfield,  Quebec.  The Company's requirements of
Scotch  whisky,  tequila,  mezcal  and  the neutral grain spirits it uses in the
production  of  gin,  vodka  and other spirits products, are primarily purchased
from  various  suppliers.

     The  Company  operates three facilities in the United Kingdom that produce,
bottle and package wine, cider and water.  To produce Stowells, wine is imported
in  bulk  from  various  countries  and  packaged  at  the Company's facility at
Bristol.  The  Bristol  facility  also  produces fortified British wine and wine
style  drinks.  All  cider  production  takes place at the Company's facility at
Shepton Mallet.  The Strathmore brand of bottled water is sourced and bottled in
Forfar,  Scotland.

SOURCES AND AVAILABILITY OF PRODUCTION MATERIALS

     The  principal  components  in  the  production  of  the  Company's branded
beverage  alcohol  products are agricultural products, such as grapes and grain,
and  packaging  materials  (primarily  glass).

     Most  of the Company's annual grape requirements are satisfied by purchases
from  each  year's  harvest  which  normally  begins  in August and runs through
October  in  the  United  States  and begins in February and runs through May in
Australia.  The  Company believes that it has adequate sources of grape supplies
to  meet  its sales expectations.  However, in the event demand for certain wine
products  exceeds  expectations,  the  Company  would  seek  to source the extra
requirements  from  the  bulk  wine  markets,  but  could  experience shortages.

     The  Company  receives grapes from approximately 800 independent growers in
the  United  States  and  1,450  growers  in Australia.  The Company enters into
written  purchase  agreements  with  a  majority  of  these  growers and pricing
generally  varies  year-to-year   based  on   then-current  market  prices.   In
Australia,  approximately  800  of  the 1,450 growers belong to a grape growers'
cooperative.  The  Company  purchases  the  majority  of  its  Australian  grape
requirements from this cooperative under a long-term arrangement.  In the United
Kingdom, the Company produces wine from materials purchased either on a contract
basis  or  on  the  open  market.

     The Company currently owns or leases approximately 14,500 acres of land and
vineyards,  either fully bearing or under development, in California (U.S.), New
York  (U.S.),  Australia,  Chile  and New Zealand.  This acreage supplies only a
small  percentage  of  the Company's overall total wine needs.  However, most of
this  acreage  is  used  to  supply  a  large portion of the grapes used for the
production  of the Company's super-premium and ultra-premium wines.  The Company
continues  to  consider  the  purchase  or  lease  of  additional vineyards, and
additional  land  for  vineyard  plantings,  to  supplement  its  grape  supply.

     The  distilled  spirits   manufactured  by  the  Company   require  various
agricultural  products,  neutral  grain  spirits  and bulk spirits.  The Company
fulfills  its requirements through purchases from various sources by contractual
arrangement and through purchases on the open market.  The Company believes that
adequate  supplies  of  the aforementioned products are available at the present
time.

     In  the  United  Kingdom,  the  Company sources apples for cider production
primarily  through  long-term supply arrangements with owners of apple orchards.
There  are  adequate  supplies  of  apples  at  this  particular  time.

     The  Company  utilizes glass and polyethylene terephthalate ("PET") bottles
and  other  materials  such  as  caps,  corks,  capsules,  labels, wine bags and
cardboard  cartons  in the bottling and packaging of its products.  Glass bottle
costs  are  one of the largest components of the Company's cost of product sold.
In  the  United  States  and  Australia,  the  glass  bottle  industry is highly
concentrated   with  only  a   small  number  of  producers.   The  Company  has
traditionally  obtained,  and continues to obtain, its glass requirements from a
limited  number  of  producers.  Currently,  substantially  all of the Company's
glass  container  requirements  for its United States operations are supplied by
one  producer  and  most  of  the Company's glass container requirements for its
Australian  operations  are  supplied  by another producer.  The Company has not
experienced difficulty in satisfying its requirements with respect to any of the
foregoing  and  considers  its  sources  of supply to be adequate.  However, the
inability  of  any  of  the  Company's  glass  bottle  suppliers  to satisfy the
Company's  requirements  could  adversely  affect  the  Company's  operations.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION

     The  Company is subject to a range of regulations in the countries in which
it  operates.   Where  it  produces  products,   the  Company  is   subject   to
environmental  laws  and  regulations  and may be required to obtain permits and
licenses to operate its facilities.  Where it markets and sells products, it may
be  subject  to  laws  and  regulations  on  trademark  and  brand registration,
packaging  and  labeling,  distribution  methods  and relationships, pricing and
price  changes, sales promotions, advertising and public relations.  The Company
is  also  subject  to  rules  and regulations relating to changes in officers or
directors,  ownership  or  control.

     The  Company believes it is in compliance in all material respects with all
applicable  governmental  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries in which it
operates.  The  Company  also  believes  that  the  cost  of  administration and
compliance  with,  and liability under, such laws and regulations does not have,
and  is  not  expected  to  have,  a  material  adverse  impact on its financial
condition,  results  of  operations  or  cash  flows.

SEASONALITY

     The  beverage  alcohol  industry  is  subject  to seasonality in each major
category.  As  a  result,  in  response  to wholesaler and retailer demand which
precedes  consumer purchases, the Company's wine and spirits sales are typically
highest  during  the third quarter of its fiscal year, primarily due to seasonal
holiday  buying,  and  its  imported beer sales are typically highest during the
first  and second quarters of the Company's fiscal year, which correspond to the
Spring  and  Summer  periods  in  the  United  States.

EMPLOYEES

     As  of the end of April 2004, the Company had approximately 7,800 full-time
employees throughout the world.  Approximately 3,200 full-time employees were in
the  United  States  and approximately 4,600 full-time employees were outside of
the  United States, in countries including Australia, the United Kingdom, Canada
and  New  Zealand.  Additional workers may be employed by the Company during the
peak  and  grape crushing seasons.  The Company considers its employee relations
generally  to  be  good.

ITEM 6.  SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA
- -------  -----------------------



     For  the  years  ended  February  29,  2004,  and  February  28,  2003, see
Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial  Condition and Results of
Operations  under Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the Consolidated
Financial  Statements  and  notes  thereto under Item 8 of this Annual Report on
Form  10-K.

     Effective  March  1,  2002,  the  Company  adopted  Statement  of Financial
Accounting  Standards  No.  142 ("SFAS No. 142"), "Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets."  SFAS No. 142 addresses financial accounting and reporting for acquired
goodwill  and other intangible assets and supersedes Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No. 17, "Intangible Assets." Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill and indefinite
lived  intangible  assets  are  no  longer  amortized  but are reviewed at least
annually  for  impairment.  Intangible  assets  that  are  not deemed to have an
indefinite  life  will  continue to be amortized over their useful lives and are
subject  to  review  for  impairment. Upon adoption of SFAS No. 142, the Company
determined  that  certain  of  its  intangible  assets  met  the  criteria to be
considered  indefinite   lived  and,  accordingly,   ceased  their  amortization
effective  March  1,  2002.  These  intangible  assets  consisted principally of
trademarks.  The Company's trademarks relate to well established brands owned by
the  Company  which  were  previously amortized over 40 years. Intangible assets
determined to have a finite life, primarily distribution agreements, continue to
be  amortized  over  their  estimated  useful lives which were not modified as a
result  of  adopting  SFAS No. 142. The supplemental data section above presents
operating income, income before extraordinary item, net income, and earnings per
share  information  for  the  comparative  periods  as  if  the  nonamortization
provisions  of  SFAS  No.  142  had  been  applied  as  of  March  1,  1999.

     The  consolidated  financial  statements  for  the years ended February 29,
2004,  and  February  28,  2003,  were  audited  by  KPMG LLP.  The consolidated
financial  statements  for the years ended February 28, 2002, February 28, 2001,
and  February  29, 2000, were audited by Arthur Andersen LLP and the reports for
those  years  have  not  been  reissued  by  Arthur  Andersen  LLP.


ITEM 7.   MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION  AND  ANALYSIS  OF  FINANCIAL  CONDITION  AND
- -------   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
          RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
          ---------------------

OVERVIEW
- --------

     The Company generates revenue through the production, marketing and sale of
beverage  alcohol  products,  primarily  in North America, Europe and Australia.
The  Company  has a broad portfolio of brands across the wine, imported beer and
distilled  spirits  categories, and with the acquisition of Hardy in Fiscal 2004
solidified  its  position  as  the  world's  largest  wine  company.

     The  Company's  business  strategy is to remain focused across the beverage
alcohol  industry by offering a broad range of products in each of the Company's
three  major  categories:  wine,  beer and spirits.  The Company intends to keep
its  portfolio  positioned  for  superior  top-line  growth while maximizing the
profitability  of  its  brands.  In  addition, the Company seeks to increase its
relative importance to key customers in major markets by increasing its share of
their  overall  purchasing,  which  is increasingly important in a consolidating
industry.  The  Company's strategy of breadth across categories and geographies,
and  strengthening  scale  in  core  markets,  is  designed to deliver long-term
profitable  growth.  This  strategy  allows the Company more investment choices,
provides  flexibility to address changing market conditions and creates stronger
routes-to-market.

     The  Company's  businesses  fall within one of two areas:  growth or scale.
The  growth  businesses represent approximately 60% of the Company's Fiscal 2004
net  sales and include approximately half of the Company's branded wine business
(specifically premium wines in the U.S. and wines in the U.K.), imported beer in
the  U.S.  and  the  U.K.  wholesale  business.  The  scale businesses represent
approximately  40%  of  Fiscal 2004 net sales and include spirits, the remaining
half  of the Company's branded wine business, cider, and non-branded sales.  The
scale  businesses  are  operated  to maximize profitability and cash flow and to
maintain  strong  routes-to-market.  With a solid foundation of growth and scale
businesses,  the Company expects to continue to be able to leverage sales growth
into  even  higher  growth  in  earnings  and  cash  flow.

     The  U.S.  beer industry has experienced a healthy pricing environment over
the  last  several  years;  however,  this  could change due to market dynamics.
Beginning  January  2004,  the  Company  raised prices to its wholesalers on the
Company's  imported  Mexican  beer  brands.  The  timing  of this price increase
resulted  in  a  shift  in  sales  volume from Fiscal 2005 to Fiscal 2004 due to
wholesaler  buy-in  ahead  of  the price increase. As a result of the wholesaler
buy-in  and  as  retailers  and consumers adapt to the higher price, the Company
expects  a  negative  impact  on  volume  trends  for  Fiscal  2005.

     The  Company  remains committed to its long-term financial model of growing
sales  (both  organically  and  through  acquisitions),  expanding  margins  and
increasing  cash  flow to achieve superior earnings per share growth and improve
return  on  invested  capital.

INTRODUCTION
- ------------

     The  Company  is  a leading international producer and marketer of beverage
alcohol brands with a broad portfolio across the wine, spirits and imported beer
categories.  The  Company  has the largest wine business in the world and is the
largest  multi-category  supplier  of  beverage  alcohol in the United States; a
leading producer and exporter of wine from Australia and New Zealand; and both a
major  producer  and  independent  drinks  wholesaler  in  the  United  Kingdom.

     Through  February  28,  2003, the Company reported its operating results in
five  segments:  Popular  and Premium Wine (branded popular and premium wine and
brandy,  and  other,  primarily grape juice concentrate and bulk wine); Imported
Beer  and  Spirits  (primarily imported beer and distilled spirits); U.K. Brands
and  Wholesale  (branded  wine,  cider,  and  bottled water, and wholesale wine,
distilled  spirits,  cider,  beer,  RTDs  and soft drinks); Fine Wine (primarily
branded  super-premium  and  ultra-premium  wine);  and Corporate Operations and
Other (primarily corporate related items).  As a result of the Hardy Acquisition
(as  defined  below),  the  Company  has  changed  the structure of its internal
organization  to  consist  of  two  business  divisions, Constellation Wines and
Constellation  Beers  and  Spirits.  Separate  division  chief executives report
directly  to  the  Company's chief operating officer.  Consequently, the Company
reports  its  operating results in three segments:  Constellation Wines (branded
wine,  and  U.K. wholesale and other), Constellation Beers and Spirits (imported
beer  and  distilled  spirits)  and  Corporate  Operations  and Other (primarily
corporate  related  items  and  other).   Amounts  included   in  the  Corporate
Operations  and  Other  segment  consist of general corporate administration and
finance expenses.  These amounts include costs of executive management, investor
relations,   internal  audit,  treasury,   tax,  corporate  development,  legal,
financial reporting, professional fees and public relations.  Any costs incurred
at the corporate office that are applicable to the segments are allocated to the
appropriate segment.  The amounts included in the Corporate Operations and Other
segment  are general costs that are applicable to the consolidated group and are
therefore  not  allocated  to the other reportable segments.  All costs reported
within  the Corporate Operations and Other segment are not included in the chief
operating decision maker's evaluation of the operating income performance of the
other  operating  segments.  The new business segments reflect how the Company's
operations  are  being  managed, how operating performance within the Company is
being evaluated by senior management and the structure of its internal financial
reporting.  In  addition, the Company changed its definition of operating income
for  segment  purposes  to exclude restructuring and related charges and unusual
costs  that  affect  comparability.  Accordingly,  the financial information for
Fiscal  2003 and Fiscal 2002 (as defined below) have been restated to conform to
the  new  segment  presentation.

     The  following  discussion  and analysis summarizes the significant factors
affecting  (i)  consolidated  results  of operations of the Company for the year
ended February 29, 2004 ("Fiscal 2004"), compared to the year ended February 28,
2003  ("Fiscal  2003"),  and Fiscal 2003 compared to the year ended February 28,
2002  ("Fiscal  2002"),  and  (ii) financial liquidity and capital resources for
Fiscal  2004. This discussion and analysis also identifies certain restructuring
and related charges expected to affect consolidated results of operations of the
Company  for  the  year ended February 28, 2005 ("Fiscal 2005"). This discussion
and  analysis  should  be  read  in  conjunction with the Company's consolidated
financial  statements  and  notes  thereto  included  herein.

     As  discussed  in  Note  1 to the financial statements, the Company adopted
SFAS  No.  142 on March 1, 2002.  Upon the adoption of SFAS No. 142, the Company
ceased  amortization   of  goodwill  and  indefinite  lived  intangible  assets.
Retroactive  application  of  SFAS  No.  142  is  not  permitted.

ACQUISITIONS IN FISCAL 2004, FISCAL 2003 AND FISCAL 2002 AND JOINT VENTURE

     ACQUISITION OF HARDY

     On  March  27, 2003, the Company acquired control of BRL Hardy Limited, now
known as Hardy Wine Company Limited ("Hardy"), and on April 9, 2003, the Company
completed  its  acquisition  of  all of Hardy's outstanding capital stock.  As a
result  of the acquisition of Hardy, the Company also acquired the remaining 50%
ownership  of  Pacific  Wine Partners LLC ("PWP"), the joint venture the Company
established  with  Hardy  in July 2001.  The acquisition of Hardy along with the
remaining  interest  in  PWP is referred to together as the "Hardy Acquisition."
Through this acquisition, the Company acquired Australia's largest wine producer
with  interests  in  wineries  and  vineyards  in most of Australia's major wine
regions as well as New Zealand and the United States.  Hardy has a comprehensive
portfolio  of  wine  products  across  all  price  points with a strong focus on
premium  wine  production.  Hardy's  wines  are  distributed worldwide through a
network  of marketing and sales operations, with the majority of sales generated
in  Australia,  the  United  Kingdom  and  the  United  States.

     Total  consideration  paid  in  cash  and Class A Common Stock to the Hardy
shareholders  was  $1,137.4  million.  Additionally, the Company recorded direct
acquisition  costs  of  $17.7  million.  The  acquisition  date  for  accounting
purposes  is  March 27, 2003.  The Company has recorded a $1.6 million reduction
in  the  purchase  price  to  reflect  imputed  interest  between the accounting
acquisition  date  and  the  final  payment  of  consideration.  This  charge is
included  as  interest  expense  in the Consolidated Statement of Income for the
year  ended  February  29, 2004.  The cash portion of the purchase price paid to
the  Hardy  shareholders  and optionholders ($1,060.2 million) was financed with
$660.2 million of borrowings under the Company's March 2003 Credit Agreement (as
defined  below)  and  $400.0  million  of  borrowings under the Company's Bridge
Agreement (as defined below).  Additionally, the Company issued 3,288,913 shares
of  the Company's Class A Common Stock, which were valued at $77.2 million based
on  the  simple  average  of  the  closing market price of the Company's Class A
Common  Stock beginning two days before and ending two days after April 4, 2003,
the  day the Hardy shareholders elected the form of consideration they wished to
receive.  The  purchase  price  was  based  primarily  on a discounted cash flow
analysis  that  contemplated,  among  other  things,  the  value  of  a  broader
geographic distribution in strategic international markets and a presence in the
important  Australian   winemaking  regions.   The   Company   and  Hardy   have
complementary  businesses  that  share a common growth orientation and operating
philosophy.  The Hardy Acquisition supports the Company's strategy of growth and
breadth  across  categories  and  geographies,  and  strengthens its competitive
position  in  its  core markets.  The purchase price and resulting goodwill were
primarily based on the growth opportunities of the brand portfolio of Hardy.  In
particular,  the  Company believes there are growth opportunities for Australian
wines  in  the  United  Kingdom,  United  States  and  other wine markets.  This
acquisition  supports  the  Company's  strategy  of driving long-term growth and
positions  the  Company to capitalize on the growth opportunities in "new world"
wine  markets.

     The  results  of  operations  of  Hardy  and  PWP have been reported in the
Company's  Constellation  Wines  segment  as  of  March  27,  2003.

     ACQUISITION OF RAVENSWOOD WINERY

     On  July 2, 2001, the Company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock
of  Ravenswood  Winery,  Inc.  (the "Ravenswood Acquisition"), a leading premium
wine producer based in Sonoma, California.  On June 30, 2002, Ravenswood Winery,
Inc.  was  merged  into Franciscan Vineyards, Inc. (a wholly-owned subsidiary of
the Company).  The Ravenswood business produces, markets and sells super-premium
and  ultra-premium  California  wine, primarily under the Ravenswood brand name.
The  vast majority of the wine the Ravenswood business produces and sells is red
wine,  including  the  number  one super-premium Zinfandel in the United States.
The  results  of  operations  of  the  Ravenswood  business  are reported in the
Constellation  Wines  segment and have been included in the consolidated results
of  operations  of  the  Company  since  the  date  of  acquisition.

ACQUISITION OF THE CORUS ASSETS

     On  March  26,  2001, in an asset acquisition, the Company acquired certain
wine  brands,  wineries,  working  capital  (primarily  inventories),  and other
related  assets  from  Corus  Brands,  Inc.  (the  "Corus  Assets").   In   this
acquisition,  the  Company  acquired  several  well-known  premium  wine  brands
primarily sold in the northwestern United States, including Covey Run, Columbia,
Ste.  Chapelle  and Alice White. In connection with the transaction, the Company
also  entered  into  long-term  grape supply agreements with affiliates of Corus
Brands,  Inc.  covering more than 1,000 acres of Washington and Idaho vineyards.
The  results of operations of the Corus Assets are reported in the Constellation
Wines  segment  and have been included in the consolidated results of operations
of  the  Company  since  the  date  of  acquisition.

     ACQUISITION OF THE TURNER ROAD VINTNERS ASSETS

     On  March  5,  2001,  in an asset acquisition, the Company acquired several
well-known  premium  wine brands, including Vendange, Nathanson Creek, Heritage,
and  Talus, working capital (primarily inventories), two wineries in California,
and  other  related  assets  from  Sebastiani Vineyards, Inc. and Tuolomne River
Vintners  Group  (the "Turner Road Vintners Assets").  The results of operations
of  the  Turner  Road  Vintners  Assets  are reported in the Constellation Wines
segment  and have been included in the consolidated results of operations of the
Company  since  the  date  of  acquisition.

     PACIFIC WINE PARTNERS

     On  July  31, 2001, the Company and Hardy completed the formation of PWP, a
joint  venture  owned  equally  by the Company and Hardy through March 26, 2003.
Pacific  Wine  Partners  LLC  ("PWP") produces, markets and sells a portfolio of
premium wine in the United States, including a range of Australian imports.  PWP
also  exports  certain  of  its  U.S.-produced  wines  to  other  countries.  In
connection  with  the  initial formation of the joint venture, PWP was given the
exclusive  distribution rights in the United States and the Caribbean to several
brands, including Banrock Station, Hardys, Leasingham, Barossa Valley Estate and
Chateau  Reynella  from  Australia;  and Nobilo from New Zealand.  PWP also owns
Farallon, a premium California coastal wine.  In addition, PWP owns a winery and
controls  1,400  acres  of  vineyards  in  Monterey  County,  California.

     On  October 16, 2001, the Company announced that PWP completed the purchase
of  certain  assets of Blackstone Winery, including the Blackstone brand and the
Codera  wine  business  in  Sonoma  County.

     As  a result of the Hardy Acquisition, PWP became a wholly-owned subsidiary
of  the  Company.  Accordingly,  as  noted above, its results of operations have
been  consolidated  and  reported in the Constellation Wines segment since March
27,  2003.  Prior  to  March  27,  2003, the investment in PWP was accounted for
using the equity method; accordingly, the results of operations of PWP from July
31,  2001,  through  March  26, 2003, were included in the equity in earnings of
joint  ventures  line  in  the Consolidated Statements of Income of the Company.


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
- ---------------------

FISCAL 2004 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2003

     NET SALES

     The  following  table sets forth the net sales (in thousands of dollars) by
operating  segment  of  the  Company  for  Fiscal  2004  and  Fiscal  2003.



     Net  sales  for  Fiscal  2004  increased  to $3,552.4 million from $2,731.6
million for Fiscal 2003, an increase of $820.8 million, or 30.0%.  This increase
resulted primarily from the inclusion of $571.4 million of net sales of products
acquired in the Hardy Acquisition as well as increases in imported beer sales of
$86.6  million  and  U.K.  wholesale sales of $61.1 million (on a local currency
basis).  In  addition,  net  sales  benefited  from a favorable foreign currency
impact  of  $74.6  million.

     Constellation Wines

     Net  sales for the Constellation Wines segment for Fiscal 2004 increased to
$2,396.1  million  from  $1,673.3 million for Fiscal 2003, an increase of $722.8
million,  or  43.2%.  Branded wine net sales increased $566.2 million, primarily
due  to  the addition of $548.4 million of net sales of branded wine acquired in
the  Hardy  Acquisition.  Wholesale and other net sales increased $156.5 million
primarily due to a favorable foreign currency impact of $63.1 million, growth in
the  U.K.  wholesale  business of $61.1 million (on a local currency basis), and
the  addition  of  $23.0 million of net sales of bulk wine acquired in the Hardy
Acquisition.  The  net  sales increase in the U.K. Wholesale business on a local
currency  basis  is  primarily due to the addition of new accounts and increased
average  delivery sizes as the Company's national accounts business continues to
grow.  The  Company  continues  to  face  competitive  discounting within select
markets  and  geographies  driven in part by excess grape supplies.  The Company
believes  that  the  grape supply/demand cycle should come into balance over the
next  couple  of  years.  The  Company  has  taken  a strategy of preserving the
long-term  brand  equity of its portfolio and investing its marketing dollars in
the  higher  growth  sectors  of  the  wine  business.

     Constellation Beers and Spirits

     Net  sales  for the Constellation Beers and Spirits segment for Fiscal 2004
increased to $1,147.2 million from $1,058.3 million for Fiscal 2003, an increase
of $88.9 million, or 8.4%. This increase resulted primarily from volume gains on
the  Company's  imported beer portfolio, which increased $86.6 million.  Spirits
net  sales  remained  relatively  flat  as  increased branded spirits sales were
offset  by  lower  bulk  whisky  and  contract  production  sales.

     GROSS PROFIT

     The Company's gross profit increased to $975.8 million for Fiscal 2004 from
$760.7  million  for  Fiscal 2003, an increase of $215.1 million, or 28.3%.  The
Constellation  Wines  segment's  gross profit increased $200.4 million primarily
due  to  gross  profit  on  the  sales  of  branded  wine  acquired in the Hardy
Acquisition.   The  Constellation  Beers  and  Spirits  segment's  gross  profit
increased  $42.5  million  primarily  due  to the volume growth in the segment's
imported beer portfolio.  These increases were partially offset by $27.8 million
of  net  unusual  costs  which  consist  of  certain  items that are excluded by
management  in their evaluation of the results of each operating segment.  These
net  costs  represent  the flow through of inventory step-up associated with the
Hardy  Acquisition  of $22.5 million and the write-down of concentrate inventory
recorded  in  connection  with  the  Company's  decision  to  exit the commodity
concentrate  product  line  of  $16.8  million  (see additional discussion under
"Restructuring  and Related Charges" below), partially offset by the relief from
certain  excise  tax,  duty  and  other  costs  incurred in prior years of $11.5
million,  which  was  recognized  in  the  fourth quarter of fiscal 2004.  Gross
profit  as  a  percent  of net sales decreased slightly to 27.5% for Fiscal 2004
from  27.8%  for Fiscal 2003 as an increase in gross profit margin from sales of
higher margin wine brands acquired in the Hardy Acquisition was more than offset
by  the  net unusual costs discussed above and a decrease in gross profit margin
on  the  Constellation  Wines'  U.K.  wholesale  business.

     SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

     Selling,  general  and  administrative expenses increased to $457.3 million
for  Fiscal  2004  from  $351.0  million  for Fiscal 2003, an increase of $106.3
million,  or  30.3%.  The  Constellation  Wines  segment's  selling, general and
administrative  expenses  increased $76.8 million primarily due to $67.7 million
of  selling,  general and administrative expenses from the addition of the Hardy
and  PWP  businesses.  The  Constellation  Beers  and Spirits segment's selling,
general  and  administrative  expenses  increased  $7.9 million due to increased
imported beer and spirits advertising and selling expenses to support the growth
across  this  segment's  businesses, partially offset by foreign currency gains.
The Corporate Operations and Other segment's general and administrative expenses
increased  $8.9  million  primarily  due  to additional deferred financing costs
associated with the Company's new bank credit facility and increased general and
administrative  expenses to support the Company's growth. In addition, there was
a $12.7 million increase in selling, general and administrative expenses related
to  unusual costs which consist of certain items that are excluded by management
in  their  evaluation  of  the  results  of  each operating segment. These costs
consist  primarily  of  the   additional  amortized   deferred  financing  costs
associated with the bridge financing in connection with the Hardy Acquisition of
$11.6  million. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of net
sales  increased  slightly  to  12.9%  for  Fiscal 2004 as compared to 12.8% for
Fiscal  2003  due  primarily  to the unusual costs and the increased general and
administrative  expenses  within  the  Corporate Operations and Other segment as
discussed  above.

     RESTRUCTURING AND RELATED CHARGES

     The Company recorded $31.2 million of restructuring and related charges for
Fiscal  2004  associated  with the restructuring plan of the Constellation Wines
segment.  Restructuring  and  related  charges  resulted  from (i) $10.0 million
related to the realignment of business operations and (ii) $21.2 million related
to  exiting  the  commodity concentrate product line in the U.S. and selling its
winery  located  in  Escalon,  California.  In total, the Company recorded $38.0
million  of costs associated with exiting the commodity concentrate product line
and  selling  its Escalon facility allocated between cost of product sold ($16.8
million)  and  restructuring  and  related  charges  ($21.2  million).

     The  Company recorded $4.8 million of restructuring and related charges for
Fiscal 2003 associated with an asset impairment charge in connection with two of
Constellation  Wines  segment's  production  facilities.

     In  Fiscal  2005, the Company expects to incur additional restructuring and
related  charges  of $11.6 million associated with the restructuring plan of the
Constellation  Wines  segment.  These  charges  are  expected to consist of $7.2
million  related  to  the  further  realignment  of  business  operations in the
Constellation  Wines  segment and $4.4 million related to renegotiating existing
grape  contracts  as  a result of exiting the commodity concentrate product line
and  selling  the  Escalon  facility.

     Approximately  half  of  the  total  charges in connection with exiting the
commodity concentrate product line and selling the Escalon facility are non-cash
charges.

     OPERATING INCOME

     The following table sets forth the operating income (loss) (in thousands of
dollars)  by  operating  segment of the Company for Fiscal 2004 and Fiscal 2003.



     Restructuring  and  related  charges and unusual costs of $71.6 million and
$4.8  million  for Fiscal 2004 and Fiscal 2003, respectively, consist of certain
costs that are excluded by management in their evaluation of the results of each
operating  segment.  Fiscal  2004  costs represent the flow through of inventory
step-up  and  the  amortization  of deferred financing costs associated with the
Hardy  Acquisition  of  $22.5 million and $11.6 million, respectively, and costs
associated with exiting the commodity concentrate product line and the Company's
realignment  of  its  business  operations  in  the  wine segment, including the
write-down  of  concentrate  inventory  of  $16.8  million and restructuring and
related  charges  of  $31.2 million, partially offset by the relief from certain
excise  taxes,  duty  and  other costs incurred in prior years of $10.4 million.
Fiscal  2003  costs  represent restructuring and related charges associated with
the  Company's realignment of its business operations in the wine segment.  As a
result  of  these  costs  and  the  above factors, consolidated operating income
increased to $487.4 million for Fiscal 2004 from $405.0 million for Fiscal 2003,
an  increase  of  $82.4  million,  or  20.3%.

     GAIN ON CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

     The  Company  entered  into  a foreign currency collar contract in February
2003 in connection with the Hardy Acquisition to lock in a range for the cost of
the  acquisition  in  U.S.  dollars.  As  of  February 28, 2003, this derivative
instrument had a fair value of $23.1 million.  Under SFAS No. 133, a transaction
that  involves  a  business  combination  is  not  eligible for hedge accounting
treatment.  As  such,  the  derivative  was recorded on the balance sheet at its
fair  value  with  the  change  in  the  fair value recognized separately on the
Company's Consolidated Statements of Income.  During the first quarter of fiscal
2004,  the  gain  on  change  in fair value of the derivative instrument of $1.2
million  was  recognized  separately  on the Company's Consolidated Statement of
Income.

     EQUITY IN EARNINGS OF JOINT VENTURES

     The  Company's  equity  in  earnings  of  joint  ventures decreased to $0.5
million  in Fiscal 2004 from $12.2 million in Fiscal 2003 due to the acquisition
of  the  remaining 50% ownership of PWP in March 2003 resulting in consolidation
of  PWP's  results  of  operations  since  the  date  of  acquisition.

     INTEREST EXPENSE, NET

     Interest  expense,  net of interest income of $3.6 million and $0.8 million
for  Fiscal  2004 and Fiscal 2003, respectively, increased to $144.7 million for
Fiscal  2004  from $105.4 million for Fiscal 2003, an increase of $39.3 million,
or  37.3%.  The  increase  resulted  from  higher  average borrowings due to the
financing  of  the  Hardy  Acquisition,  partially  offset  by  a  lower average
borrowing  rate,  and  $1.7  million  of imputed interest expense related to the
Hardy  Acquisition.

     PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES

     The  Company's  effective  tax  rate for Fiscal 2004 declined to 36.0% from
39.3%  for Fiscal 2003 as a result of the Hardy Acquisition, which significantly
increased the allocation of income to jurisdictions with lower income tax rates.

     NET INCOME

     As  a  result  of the above factors, net income increased to $220.4 million
for  Fiscal  2004  from  $203.3  million  for  Fiscal 2003, an increase of $17.1
million,  or  8.4%.


FISCAL 2003 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2002

     NET SALES

     The  following  table sets forth the net sales (in thousands of dollars) by
operating  segment  of  the  Company  for  Fiscal  2003  and  Fiscal  2002.



     Net  sales  for  Fiscal  2003  increased  to $2,731.6 million from $2,606.8
million  for Fiscal 2002, an increase of $124.9 million, or 4.8%.  This increase
resulted  primarily  from  increased sales of imported beer of $49.1 million and
the  impact  of  foreign  currency changes of $50.7 million in the Constellation
Wines  segment.  Also  contributing  to the sales growth were increased sales in
U.K.  wholesale of $28.6 million (on a local currency basis), fine wine sales of
$23.8  million  and  spirits  sales  of $7.6 million, offset by lower bulk wine,
grape juice concentrate sales of $14.7 million, popular and premium branded wine
sales  of  $13.9  million  and  U.K.  branded  sales of $9.4 million (on a local
currency  basis).

     Constellation Wines

     Net  sales for the Constellation Wines segment for Fiscal 2003 increased to
$1,673.3  million  from  $1,605.1  million for Fiscal 2002, an increase of $68.2
million,  or 4.2%.  Branded wines sales increased $20.0 million due to increased
fine wine sales of $23.8 million and a favorable foreign currency impact of $9.3
million  partially  offset  by  lower  popular  and  premium wine sales of $13.9
million.  The  increase  in  fine  wine  sales  resulted from an additional four
months  of sales of the brands acquired in the acquisition of Ravenswood Winery,
Inc.  ("Ravenswood"),  completed  in  July 2001, of $14.1 million, as well as an
increase  of  $9.7  million  due  to  volume  growth  in  the fine wine business
partially  offset  by  higher promotional costs and a shift towards lower priced
fine  wine  brands.  Popular  and  premium  wine sales declined $13.9 million on
lower  volume  offset  slightly  by higher average selling prices.  Volumes were
negatively  impacted  as  a  result  of  increased  promotional  spending in the
industry, which the Company did not participate in heavily.  In this competitive
pricing  environment,  the  Company continues to be selective in its promotional
activities,  focusing  instead   on  growth  areas,  long-term   brand  building
initiatives  and  increased  profitability.  Wholesale and other sales increased
$48.2  million  primarily  due  to  a favorable foreign currency impact of $41.4
million  and a $28.6 million local currency increase in U.K. wholesale sales due
to  the addition of new accounts and increased average delivery sizes, partially
offset  by  lower  bulk  wine,  grape juice concentrate and cider sales of $24.7
million.

     Constellation Beers and Spirits

     Net  sales  for the Constellation Beers and Spirits segment for Fiscal 2003
increased to $1,058.3 million from $1,001.7 million for Fiscal 2002, an increase
of  $56.7  million,  or  5.7%.  This  increase  resulted  primarily from a $49.1
million  increase in imported beer sales.  The growth in imported beer sales was
due  to  a  price  increase  on the Company's Mexican beer portfolio, which took
effect  in  the  first  quarter  of  fiscal  2003.  Spirits sales increased $7.6
million  due  primarily  to  increased bulk whiskey sales of $6.4 million, along
with  a  slight  increase  in  branded  sales  of  $1.2  million.

     GROSS PROFIT

     The Company's gross profit increased to $760.7 million for Fiscal 2003 from
$695.2  million  for  Fiscal  2002,  an increase of $65.6 million, or 9.4%.  The
Constellation  Wines segment's gross profit increased $30.8 million due to lower
wine  costs,  the  additional four months of sales of the brands acquired in the
Ravenswood  Acquisition  (completed  in  July  2001),  a  favorable mix of sales
towards higher margin popular and premium wine, and a favorable foreign currency
impact.  These  increases  were  partially  offset  by lower gross profit on the
segment's  reduced   bulk  wine  and   grape  juice   concentrate   sales.   The
Constellation  Beers  and Spirits segment's gross profit increased $34.8 million
due  to increased gross profit on imported beer sales and increased gross profit
on  spirits  sales.  The  increased  gross  profit  on  imported  beer  sales is
primarily  due to increased average selling prices in the Company's Mexican beer
portfolio  and  the  increased gross profit on the segment's spirits business is
due to a favorable mix of sales towards higher margin products and lower average
spirits  costs.  As  a result of the foregoing, gross profit as a percent of net
sales  increased  to  27.8%  for  Fiscal  2003  from  26.7%  for  Fiscal  2002.

     SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

     Selling,  general  and  administrative expenses decreased to $351.0 million
for Fiscal 2003 from $355.3 million for Fiscal 2002, a decrease of $4.3 million,
or (1.2%).  The Company adopted SFAS No. 142 on March 1, 2002, and, accordingly,
stopped  amortizing  goodwill  and  other  indefinite  lived  intangible assets.
Therefore,  the decrease of $4.3 million consists of a decrease of $27.3 million
of amortization expense from Fiscal 2002 offset by an increase of $23.0 million.
The  Constellation  Wines segment's selling, general and administrative expenses
decreased  $2.6  million  due  to  lower  amortization  expense of $19.1 million
partially  offset  by (i) higher selling costs to support the growth in the U.K.
wholesale  business,  (ii)  increased  selling  and advertising costs on certain
popular  and  premium  wine  brands,  and  (iii)  higher  selling,  general  and
administrative  expenses  to  support the growth in the fine wine business.  The
Constellation  Beers  and  Spirits segment's selling, general and administrative
expenses  decreased  $4.4  million  due  to  lower  amortization expense of $8.2
million  partially  offset  by  increased  selling,  general  and administrative
expenses  to  support  the growth in the imported beer portfolio.  The Corporate
Operations  and  Other  segment's  selling,  general and administrative expenses
increased $2.7 million primarily due to increased personnel costs to support the
Company's  growth.  Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of
net  sales  decreased  to  12.8% for Fiscal 2003 as compared to 13.6% for Fiscal
2002.  This  decrease  was  due  to the reduced amortization expense noted above
partially  offset  by  (i)  the  percent  increase in general and administrative
expenses  growing at a faster rate than the percent increase in net sales across
all  segments,  and  (ii)  the  percent  increase  in  the  Constellation  Wines
segment's  U.K. wholesale and U.K. branded wine selling costs being greater than
the  percent  increase  in  the  U.K. wholesale and U.K. branded wine net sales.

     RESTRUCTURING AND RELATED CHARGES

     The  Company  recorded a property, plant and equipment impairment charge of
$4.8 million in Fiscal 2003 in connection with the planned closure of two of its
production  facilities  within  its  Constellation Wines segment in Fiscal 2004.
During Fiscal 2004, the Company began the realignment of its business operations
within  this  segment  to further improve productivity.  This realignment is not
expected  to  have  an  impact on brand sales.  No such charges were incurred in
Fiscal  2002.

     OPERATING INCOME

     The following table sets forth the operating income (loss) (in thousands of
dollars)  by  operating  segment of the Company for Fiscal 2003 and Fiscal 2002.



     Restructuring  and  related  charges  and unusual costs of $4.8 million for
Fiscal  2003  consist  of certain costs that are excluded by management in their
evaluation  of  the  results  of  each operating segment.  These costs represent
restructuring  and  related charges associated with the Company's realignment of
its  business operations in the wine segment.  As a result of the above factors,
operating income increased to $405.0 million for Fiscal 2003 from $339.9 million
for  Fiscal 2002, an increase of $65.1 million, or 19.1%.  Fiscal 2002 operating
income  for  Constellation  Wines  and  Constellation Beers and Spirits included
amortization  expense  of  $19.1  million  and  $8.2  million,  respectively.

     GAIN ON CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

     In  February  2003,  the  Company  entered  into  a foreign currency collar
contract  in  connection  with  the Hardy Acquisition to lock in a range for the
cost  of  the  acquisition  in  U.S.  dollars.  As  of  February  28, 2003, this
derivative  instrument had a fair value of $23.1 million.  Under SFAS No. 133, a
transaction  that  involves  a  business  combination  is not eligible for hedge
accounting treatment.  As such, the derivative was recorded on the balance sheet
at its fair value with the change in the fair value recognized separately on the
Company's  Consolidated  Statements  of  Income.

     EQUITY IN EARNINGS OF JOINT VENTURES

     The  Company's  equity  in  earnings  of  joint  venture increased to $12.2
million  in  Fiscal 2003 from $1.7 million in Fiscal 2002.  Due to the formation
of the joint venture in July 2001, there were seven months of earnings in Fiscal
2002  versus twelve months of earnings in Fiscal 2003.  In addition, Fiscal 2003
benefited from an additional seven months of earnings due to the joint venture's
purchase  of  certain  assets of the Blackstone Winery, including the Blackstone
brand  and  the  Codera  wine  business in Sonoma County, which was completed in
October  2001.

     INTEREST EXPENSE, NET

     Interest  expense,  net of interest income of $0.8 million and $1.6 million
for  Fiscal  2003 and Fiscal 2002, respectively, decreased to $105.4 million for
Fiscal  2003 from $114.2 million for Fiscal 2002, a decrease of $8.8 million, or
(7.7)%.  The decrease resulted from decreases in both the average borrowings for
the  year  and  the  average  interest  rate  for  the  year.

     PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES

     The  Company's  effective  tax  rate for Fiscal 2003 declined to 39.3% from
40.0%  for  Fiscal  2002 as a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 142 on March 1,
2002.

     NET INCOME

     As  a  result  of the above factors, net income increased to $203.3 million
for  Fiscal  2003  from  $136.4  million  for  Fiscal 2002, an increase of $66.9
million,  or  49.0%.


FINANCIAL LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
- -----------------------------------------

GENERAL

     The  Company's  principal  use  of  cash in its operating activities is for
purchasing  and  carrying inventories and carrying seasonal accounts receivable.
The  Company's  primary source of liquidity has historically been cash flow from
operations,  except  during annual grape harvests when the Company has relied on
short-term  borrowings.  In  the  United States, the annual grape crush normally
begins in August and runs through October.  In Australia, the annual grape crush
normally  begins in February and runs through May.  The Company generally begins
taking delivery of grapes at the beginning of the crush season with payments for
such  grapes  beginning  to  come due one month later.  The Company's short-term
borrowings to support such purchases generally reach their highest levels one to
two months after the crush season has ended.  Historically, the Company has used
cash  flow from operating activities to repay its short-term borrowings and fund
capital  expenditures.   The  Company  will  continue   to  use  its  short-term
borrowings  to  support  its working capital requirements.  The Company believes
that  cash  provided  by  operating  activities  and  its  financing activities,
primarily  short-term borrowings, will provide adequate resources to satisfy its
working  capital,  scheduled  principal and interest payments on debt, preferred
dividend payment requirements, and anticipated  capital expenditure requirements
for both its short-term  and  long-term  capital  needs.

FISCAL 2004 CASH FLOWS

     OPERATING ACTIVITIES

     Net  cash  provided  by  operating  activities  for  Fiscal 2004 was $340.3
million,  which  resulted from $220.4 million of net income, plus $137.9 million
of net noncash items charged to the Consolidated Statement of Income, less $18.0
million  representing  the  net  change  in  the  Company's operating assets and
liabilities.  The  net  non-cash  items  consisted  primarily of depreciation of
property,  plant  and  equipment,  deferred  tax  provision  and amortization of
intangible and other assets.  The net change in operating assets and liabilities
resulted  primarily  from  an  increase in accounts receivable and a decrease in
accounts  payable, partially offset by a decrease in inventories and an increase
in  accrued  advertising  and  promotion.

     INVESTING ACTIVITIES

     Net cash used in investing activities for Fiscal 2004 was $1,158.5 million,
which  resulted  primarily  from  net  cash  paid  of  $1,069.5  million for the
purchases  of  businesses  and  $105.1  million  of  capital  expenditures.

     FINANCING ACTIVITIES

     Net  cash  provided  by  financing  activities  for  Fiscal 2004 was $745.2
million  resulting  primarily from proceeds of $1,600.0 million from issuance of
long-term debt, including $1,060.2 million of long-term debt incurred to acquire
Hardy,  plus  net  proceeds from the 2003 Equity Offerings (as defined below) of
$426.1  million.  This  amount  was  partially  offset  by principal payments of
long-term  debt  of  $1,282.3  million.

FISCAL 2003 CASH FLOWS

     OPERATING  ACTIVITIES

     Net  cash  provided  by  operating  activities  for  Fiscal 2003 was $236.1
million, which resulted from $203.3 million of net income, plus $53.2 million of
net  noncash  items  charged to the Consolidated Statement of Income, less $20.4
million  representing  the  net  change  in  the  Company's operating assets and
liabilities.  The  net  noncash  items  consisted  primarily  of depreciation of
property, plant and equipment and provision for deferred taxes, partially offset
by  a gain on changes in fair value of derivative instrument.  The net change in
operating  assets  and  liabilities  resulted  primarily  from  an  increase  in
inventories  and a reduction in accrued excise taxes and adverse grape contracts
partially  offset  by  increases  in  accrued  income  taxes payable and accrued
advertising  and  promotion  expenses.

     INVESTING ACTIVITIES

     Net  cash  used  in investing activities for Fiscal 2003 was $72.0 million,
which  resulted  primarily  from  $71.6  million  of  capital  expenditures.

     FINANCING ACTIVITIES

     Net  cash  used  in financing activities for Fiscal 2003 was $161.5 million
resulting  primarily from $151.1 million of principal payments of long-term debt
and  $51.9 million of net repayments of notes payable.  These debt payments were
partially  funded  by  $28.7  million  of  proceeds  from  employee stock option
exercises  and  $10.0 million of proceeds from long-term debt which was used for
the  repayment  of  debt  at  one  of  the  Company's  Chilean  subsidiaries.

     During  June  1998,   the  Company's  Board  of  Directors  authorized  the
repurchase  of  up  to  $100.0  million  of its Class A Common Stock and Class B
Common  Stock.  The  repurchase  of shares of common stock will be accomplished,
from  time  to  time,  in  management's  discretion  and  depending  upon market
conditions,  through  open  market  or  privately  negotiated transactions.  The
Company  may  finance such repurchases through cash generated from operations or
through the senior credit facility.  The repurchased shares will become treasury
shares.  As  of  May  14, 2004, the Company  had purchased  a total of 4,075,344
shares  of  Class A Common Stock at an aggregate cost of $44.9 million, or at an
average  cost  of  $11.01  per  share.  Of  this  total  amount,  no shares were
repurchased  during  Fiscal  2004,  Fiscal  2003  or  Fiscal  2002.

DEBT

     Total  debt  outstanding  as  of  February  29,  2004, amounted to $2,047.9
million,  an  increase  of  $782.4 million from February 28, 2003.  The ratio of
total  debt  to total capitalization decreased to 46.3% as of February 29, 2004,
from  51.9%  as  of  February  28,  2003.

     SENIOR CREDIT FACILITY

     Credit Agreement
     ----------------

     In connection with the Hardy Acquisition, on January 16, 2003, the Company,
certain  subsidiaries  of  the  Company,  JPMorgan  Chase  Bank, as a lender and
administrative  agent  (the  "Administrative  Agent"), and certain other lenders
entered  into a new credit agreement (as subsequently amended and restated as of
March 19, 2003, the "March 2003 Credit Agreement"). In October 2003, the Company
entered  into  a  Second  Amended  and  Restated Credit Agreement (the " October
Credit  Agreement")  that  (i) refinanced the then outstanding principal balance
under  the  Tranche  B  Term  Loan facility on essentially the same terms as the
Tranche  B  Term  Loan  facility under the March 2003 Credit Agreement, but at a
lower  Applicable Rate (as such term is defined in the October Credit Agreement)
and  (ii)  otherwise  restated  the terms of the March 2003 Credit Agreement, as
amended.  The  October Credit Agreement was further amended during February 2004
(the "Credit Agreement"). The March 2003 Credit Agreement provided for aggregate
credit  facilities of $1.6 billion consisting of a $400.0 million Tranche A Term
Loan  facility  due  in  February  2008,  an  $800.0 million Tranche B Term Loan
facility  due  in  November  2008 and a $400.0 million Revolving Credit facility
(including  an  Australian Dollar revolving sub-facility of up to A$10.0 million
and  a  sub-facility for letters of credit of up to $40.0 million) which expires
on  February  29, 2008. Proceeds of the March 2003 Credit Agreement were used to
pay  off  the  Company's  obligations under its prior senior credit facility, to
fund  a portion of the cash required to pay the former Hardy shareholders and to
pay  indebtedness  outstanding  under  certain of Hardy's credit facilities. The
Company  uses  the remaining availability under the Credit Agreement to fund its
working  capital  needs  on  an  on-going  basis.

     The  Tranche A Term Loan facility and the Tranche B Term Loan facility were
fully  drawn  on  March 27, 2003.  As of February 29, 2004, the Company has made
$40.0  million  of  scheduled  and  required payments on the Tranche A Term Loan
facility.  In August 2003, the Company paid $100.0 million of the Tranche B Term
Loan  facility.  In  October 2003, the Company paid an additional $200.0 million
of  the  Tranche  B  Term  Loan facility.  As of February 29, 2004, the required
annual  repayments of the Tranche A Term Loan and the Tranche B Term Loan are as
follows:



     The  rate  of  interest  payable, at the Company's option, is a function of
LIBOR  plus  a  margin,  the federal funds rate plus a margin, or the prime rate
plus a margin.  The margin is adjustable based upon the Company's Debt Ratio (as
defined  in  the Credit Agreement) and, with respect to LIBOR borrowings, ranges
between  1.50%  and  2.50%.  As  of  February 29, 2004, the LIBOR margin for the
Revolving  Credit  facility and the Tranche A Term Loan facility is 1.75%, while
the  LIBOR  margin  on  the  Tranche  B  Term  Loan  facility  is  2.00%.

     The  Company's  obligations  are  guaranteed by certain subsidiaries of the
Company  ("Guarantors") and the Company is obligated to pledge collateral of (i)
100% of the capital stock of all of the Company's U.S. subsidiaries and (ii) 65%
of  the  voting  capital  stock  of certain foreign subsidiaries of the Company.

     The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to customary lending covenants
including  those  restricting  additional  liens,  the  incurrence of additional
indebtedness  (including  guarantees  of  indebtedness), the sale of assets, the
payment  of  dividends,  transactions  with affiliates and the making of certain
investments, in each case subject to baskets, exceptions and/or thresholds. As a
result  of  the  prepayment  of  the  Bridge  Loans  (as defined below) with the
proceeds  from  the  2003  Equity Offerings (see Note 16), the requirement under
certain  circumstances  for  the  Company  and  the Guarantors to pledge certain
assets  consisting  of,  among  other things, inventory, accounts receivable and
trademarks  to  secure  the  obligations  under  the Credit Agreement, ceased to
apply.  The  primary  financial  covenants  require  the  maintenance  of a debt
coverage  ratio,  a  senior  debt  coverage  ratio,  a fixed charge ratio and an
interest  coverage ratio.  As of February 29, 2004, the Company is in compliance
with  all  of  its  covenants  under  its  Credit  Agreement.

     As  of  February  29,  2004,  under  the  Credit Agreement, the Company had
outstanding  Tranche  A  Term Loans of $360.0 million bearing a weighted average
interest rate of 2.9%, Tranche B Term Loans of $500.0 million bearing a weighted
average  interest  rate  of  3.2%,  undrawn revolving letters of credit of $18.6
million,  and  $381.4  million  in revolving loans available to be drawn.  There
were  no  outstanding  revolving loans under the Credit Agreement as of February
29,  2004.

     Bridge Agreement
     ----------------

     On  January  16,  2003,  the  Company, certain subsidiaries of the Company,
JPMorgan  Chase  Bank,  as  a lender and Administrative Agent, and certain other
lenders  (such  other  lenders,  together  with  the  Administrative  Agent, are
collectively  referred  to herein as the "Bridge Lenders") entered into a bridge
loan  agreement  which was amended and restated as of March 26, 2003, containing
commitments  of  the Bridge Lenders to make bridge loans (the "Bridge Loans") of
up  to,  in the aggregate, $450.0 million (the "Bridge Agreement").  On April 9,
2003,  the  Company used $400.0 million of the Bridge Loans to fund a portion of
the  cash  required to pay the former Hardy shareholders.  On July 30, 2003, the
Company  used  proceeds from   the  2003 Equity Offerings to  prepay  the $400.0
million  Bridge  Loans  in  their  entirety.

     SUBSIDIARY FACILITIES

     The  Company  has additional line of credit arrangements available totaling
$91.5  million and $44.5 million as of February 29, 2004, and February 28, 2003,
respectively.  These  lines  support  the  borrowing  needs  of  certain  of the
Company's  foreign  subsidiary  operations.  Interest  rates  and other terms of
these  borrowings  vary  from  country  to  country,  depending  on local market
conditions.  As of February 29, 2004, and February 28, 2003, amounts outstanding
under  the  subsidiary  revolving  credit  facilities were $1.8 million and $0.6
million,  respectively.

The  net  proceeds  of the offering ($197.0 million) were used to partially fund
the  acquisition  of  the Turner Road Vintners Assets.  Interest on the February
2001 Senior Notes is payable semiannually on February 15 and August 15.  In July
2001,  the  Company  exchanged  $200.0  million aggregate principal amount of 8%

outstanding  $200.0  million  aggregate principal amount of February 2001 Senior

     The  senior  notes  described above are redeemable, in whole or in part, at
the option of the Company at any time at a redemption price equal to 100% of the
outstanding principal amount and a make whole payment based on the present value
of  the future payments at the adjusted Treasury rate or adjusted Gilt rate plus
50  basis  points.  The  senior  notes are unsecured senior obligations and rank
equally  in  right  of  payment  to  all  existing  and  future unsecured senior
indebtedness  of  the  Company.  Certain  of the Company's significant operating
subsidiaries  guarantee  the  senior  notes,  on  a  senior  basis.

     SENIOR SUBORDINATED NOTES

     On  March  4,  1999,  the Company issued $200.0 million aggregate principal
amount  of 8 1/2% Senior Subordinated Notes due March 2009 ("Senior Subordinated

March  1  and  September 1.  The Senior Subordinated Notes are redeemable at the
option  of  the  Company,  in whole or in part, at any time on or after March 1,

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS

     The  following  table  sets forth information about the Company's long-term
contractual  obligations  outstanding  at February 29, 2004.  It brings together
data  for easy reference from the consolidated balance sheet and from individual
notes to the Company's consolidated financial statements.  See Notes 10, 12, 13,
14  and  15 to the Company's consolidated financial statements located in Item 8

following  table.



EQUITY OFFERINGS

     During  July  2003,  the  Company  completed a public offering of 9,800,000
shares  of  its  Class  A Common Stock resulting in net proceeds to the Company,
after  deducting  underwriting  discounts  and  expenses,  of $261.2 million. In
addition,  the Company also completed a public offering of 170,500 shares of its
5.75%  Series  A  Mandatory  Convertible  Preferred  Stock  ("Preferred  Stock")
resulting in net proceeds to the Company, after deducting underwriting discounts
and  expenses,  of  $164.9  million.  The  Class A Common Stock offering and the
Preferred  Stock  offering   are  referred  to  together  as  the  "2003  Equity
Offerings." The majority of the net proceeds from the 2003 Equity Offerings were
used to repay the Bridge Loans that were incurred to partially finance the Hardy
Acquisition.  The  remaining  proceeds  were  used to repay term loan borrowings
under  the  March  2003  Credit  Agreement.

     During  March  2001,  the  Company completed a public offering of 8,740,000
shares  of  its  Class  A  Common Stock, which was held as treasury stock.  This
resulted  in net proceeds to the Company, after deducting underwriting discounts
and  expenses, of $139.4 million.  The net proceeds were used to repay revolving
loan borrowings under the senior credit facility of which a portion was incurred
to  partially  finance  the  acquisition  of  the  Turner  Road Vintners Assets.

     During  October 2001, the Company sold 645,000 shares of its Class A Common
Stock, which was held as treasury stock, in connection with a public offering of
Class  A  Common  Stock by stockholders of the Company.  The net proceeds to the
Company,  after  deducting underwriting discounts, of $12.1 million were used to
repay  borrowings  under  the  senior  credit  facility.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES

     During  Fiscal  2004,  the  Company  incurred  $105.1  million  for capital
expenditures.  The  Company  plans  to  spend  approximately  $125.0 million for
capital  expenditures  in  Fiscal  2005.  In  addition, the Company continues to
consider  the  purchase,  lease  and  development  of  vineyards  and  may incur
additional  expenditures  for  vineyards if opportunities become available.  See
"Business  -  Sources  and  Availability  of Raw Materials" under Item 1 of this
Annual  Report on Form 10-K.  Management reviews the capital expenditure program
periodically  and  modifies  it  as  required  to  meet  current business needs.

EFFECTS OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES

     The  Company's  results of operations and financial condition have not been
significantly  affected  by inflation and changing prices.  The Company has been
able,  subject  to  normal  competitive  conditions,  to pass along rising costs
through increased selling prices.  There can be no assurances, however, that the
Company  will  continue  to be able to pass along rising costs through increased
selling  prices.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     The  Company's  significant accounting policies are more fully described in
Note  1  to the Company's consolidated financial statements located in Item 8 of
this  Annual  Report on Form 10-K.  However, certain of the Company's accounting
policies  are particularly important to the portrayal of the Company's financial
position  and  results  of operations and require the application of significant
judgment  by  the  Company's  management;  as  a  result  they are subject to an
inherent  degree  of  uncertainty.  In  applying  those  policies, the Company's
management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used
in  the  determination  of  certain estimates.  Those estimates are based on the
Company's  historical  experience,  the  Company's  observance  of trends in the
industry,  information  provided  by  the  Company's  customers  and information
available  from other outside sources, as appropriate.  On an ongoing basis, the
Company  reviews its estimates to ensure that they appropriately reflect changes
in  the Company's business.  The Company's critical accounting policies include:

     -  Accounting  for  promotional   activities.   Sales  reflect   reductions
        attributable  to  consideration  given  to customers in various customer
        incentive  programs, including pricing discounts on single transactions,
        volume  discounts,  promotional and advertising allowances, coupons, and
        rebates.  Certain  customer  incentive  programs  require  management to
        estimate  the  cost  of  those programs. The accrued liability for these
        programs  is determined through analysis of programs offered, historical
        trends,  expectations  regarding  customer  and  consumer participation,
        sales  and   payment  trends,  and  experience  with   payment  patterns
        associated  with  similar  programs that had been previously offered. If
        assumptions included in the Company's estimates were to change or market
        conditions  were  to  change,  then  material  incremental reductions to
        revenue could be required, which would have a material adverse impact on
        the  Company's  financial  statements.  Promotional  costs  were  $336.4
        million,  $231.6 million and $223.9 million for Fiscal 2004, Fiscal 2003
        and  Fiscal  2002,  respectively.

     -  Inventory valuation.   Inventories  are  stated  at the lower of cost or
        market,  cost  being  determined  on the first-in, first-out method. The
        Company  assesses  the  valuation  of  its  inventories  and reduces the
        carrying  value  of  those inventories that are obsolete or in excess of
        the  Company's forecasted usage to their estimated net realizable value.
        The Company estimates the net realizable value of such inventories based
        on  analyses  and  assumptions including, but not limited to, historical
        usage, future demand and market requirements. Reductions to the carrying
        value  of  inventories are recorded in cost of goods sold. If the future
        demand  for  the Company's products is less favorable than the Company's
        forecasts,  then  the  value  of  the  inventories may be required to be
        reduced,  which  could  result  in  material  additional  expense to the
        Company  and  have  a material adverse impact on the Company's financial
        statements.

     -  Accounting for business combinations.   The acquisition of businesses is
        an  important element of  the Company's  strategy.   Under the  purchase
        method, the Company is required to record the net assets acquired at the
        estimated  fair  value  at the date of acquisition. The determination of
        the  fair  value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires
        the  Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the Company's
        financial  statements. For example, the Company's acquisitions typically
        result  in goodwill and other intangible assets; the value and estimated
        life of those assets may affect the amount of future period amortization
        expense  for  intangible  assets  with  finite lives as well as possible
        impairment  charges  that  may  be  incurred.

     -  Impairment of  goodwill and  intangible assets  with  indefinite  lives.
        Intangible  assets with indefinite lives consist primarily of trademarks
        as  well as agency relationships. The Company is required to analyze its
        goodwill  and   other  intangible  assets  with   indefinite  lives  for
        impairment  on  an annual basis as well as when events and circumstances
        indicate  that an impairment may have occurred. Certain factors that may
        occur  and  indicate  that  an  impairment  exists  include, but are not
        limited  to,  operating results that are lower than expected and adverse
        industry  or  market  economic  trends.  The impairment testing requires
        management  to  estimate  the fair value of the assets or reporting unit
        and  record an impairment loss for the excess of the carrying value over
        the  fair  value.  The estimate of fair value of the assets is generally
        determined on the basis of discounted future cash flows. The estimate of
        fair value of the reporting unit is generally determined on the basis of
        discounted  future  cash  flows  supplemented by the market approach. In
        estimating  the  fair  value,  management  must  make   assumptions  and
        projections  regarding such items as future cash flows, future revenues,
        future  earnings and other factors. The assumptions used in the estimate
        of fair value are generally consistent with the past performance of each
        reporting  unit and other intangible assets and are also consistent with
        the  projections  and  assumptions  that  are  used in current operating
        plans.  Such  assumptions  are subject to change as a result of changing
        economic and competitive conditions. If these estimates or their related
        assumptions  change in the future, the Company may be required to record
        an  impairment  loss  for  these  assets. The recording of any resulting
        impairment  loss  could  have a material adverse impact on the Company's
        financial  statements.

ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS NOT YET ADOPTED

     In  December  2003,  the  Financial  Accounting Standards Board issued FASB
Interpretation  No. 46 (revised December 2003) ("FIN No. 46(R)"), "Consolidation
of  Variable  Interest  Entities--an  interpretation  of ARB No. 51", which will
replace  FASB  Interpretation  No. 46 ("FIN No. 46"), "Consolidation of Variable
Interest  Entities,"  upon its effective date. FIN No. 46(R) retains many of the
basic concepts introduced in FIN No. 46; however, it also introduces a new scope
exception for certain types of entities that qualify as a business as defined in
FIN No. 46(R) and revises the method of calculating expected losses and residual
returns  for  determination of primary beneficiaries, including new guidance for
assessing  variable interests. The application of the transition requirements of
FIN  No.  46(R)  with  regard  to special purpose entities and existing variable
interest  entities did not result in any entities requiring consolidation or any
additional  disclosures. The Company is continuing to evaluate the impact of FIN
No.  46(R)  for  its adoption as of May 31, 2004. However, it is not expected to
have  a  material  impact  on  the  Company's consolidated financial statements.

     In December 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of  Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 132 (revised 2003) ("SFAS No. 132(R)"),
"Employers'  Disclosures  about  Pensions  and Other Postretirement Benefits--an
amendment  of  FASB  Statements No. 87, 88, and 106." SFAS No. 132(R) supersedes
Statement  of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.  132  ("SFAS  No. 132"), by
revising  employers'  disclosures  about  pension plans and other postretirement
benefit  plans. SFAS No. 132(R) requires additional disclosures to those in SFAS
No.  132 regarding the assets, obligations, cash flows, and net periodic benefit
cost  of  defined benefit pension plans and other defined benefit postretirement
plans.  SFAS  No.  132(R) also amends Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 28
("APB  Opinion  No.  28"),  "Interim Financial Reporting," to require additional
disclosures  for  interim periods. The Company has adopted certain of the annual
disclosure  provisions  of  SFAS No. 132(R), primarily those related to its U.S.
postretirement  plan,  for the fiscal year ending February 29, 2004. The Company
is required to adopt the remaining annual disclosure provisions, primarily those
related  to its foreign plans, for the fiscal year ending February 28, 2005. The
Company  is  required to adopt the amendment to APB Opinion No. 28 for financial
reports  containing condensed financial statements for interim periods beginning
March  1,  2004.

     In  March  2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a proposed
statement,  "Share-Based  Payment,  an  amendment of FASB Statements No. 123 and
95."  The  objective  of  the proposed statement is to require recognition in an
entity's  financial  statements  of  the  cost  of employee services received in
exchange  for  equity instruments issued, and liabilities incurred, to employees
in share-based payment (or compensation) transactions based on the fair value of
the  instruments  at  the grant date. The proposed statement would eliminate the
alternative  of  continuing to account for share-based payment arrangements with
employees under APB No. 25 and require that the compensation cost resulting from
all  share-based  payment  transactions  be  recognized in an entity's financial
statements.  If  adopted  in  its  current form, the proposed statement would be
effective  for  awards  that  are  granted, modified, or settled in fiscal years
beginning  after December 15, 2004.   Also, if adopted  in its current form, the
proposed  statement  could  result  in  a  significant charge to  the  Company's
Consolidated Statement of Income for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2006.


           CAUTIONARY INFORMATION REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

     This  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K  contains "forward-looking statements"
within  the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E
of  the  Securities  Exchange  Act of 1934. These forward-looking statements are
subject  to  a  number  of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the
Company's  control,  that  could  cause actual results to differ materially from
those  set  forth  in,  or  implied  by,  such  forward-looking statements.  All
statements  other  than  statements  of historical facts included in this Annual
Report on Form 10-K, including the statements under Item 1 "Business" and Item 7
"Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial Condition and Results of
Operations"  regarding  the  Company's  business  strategy,   future   financial
position,  prospects, plans and objectives of management, as well as information
concerning  expected  actions  of  third parties are forward-looking statements.
When  used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the words "anticipate," "intend,"
"expect,"  and  similar  expressions  are  intended  to identify forward-looking
statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain such identifying
words.  All  forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Annual
Report  on  Form 10-K.  The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise
any  forward-looking  statements, whether as a result of new information, future
events  or  otherwise.  Although  the  Company  believes  that  the expectations
reflected  in  the  forward-looking  statements  are  reasonable, it can give no
assurance  that  such expectations will prove to be correct.  In addition to the
risks  and uncertainties of ordinary business operations, important factors that
could  cause  actual  results  to  differ materially from those set forth in, or
implied,  by  the  Company's forward-looking statements contained in this Annual
Report  on  Form  10-K  are  as  follows:

THE COMPANY'S INDEBTEDNESS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS FINANCIAL
HEALTH.

     The  Company   has  incurred   substantial  indebtedness  to   finance  its
acquisitions  and may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future to
finance  further  acquisitions  or for other purposes.  The Company's ability to
satisfy  its debt obligations outstanding from time to time will depend upon the
Company's  future operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic
conditions,  levels of interest rates and financial, business and other factors,
many  of  which  are  beyond  the  Company's control. Therefore, there can be no
assurance  that  the  Company's  cash flow from operations will be sufficient to
meet  all  of  its debt service requirements and to fund its capital expenditure
requirements.

     The  Company's  current  and  future debt service obligations and covenants
could  have important consequences.  These consequences include, or may include,
the  following:

     -  the  Company's  ability  to  obtain financing for future working capital
        needs or acquisitions or other purposes may be limited;
     -  a significant portion of the Company's cash flow from operations will be
        dedicated  to  the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness
        and  dividends  on  its  Series A mandatory convertible preferred stock,
        thereby   reducing  funds   available  for   operations,   expansion  or
        distributions;
     -  the  Company's  ability  to  conduct  its  business  could be limited by
        restrictive covenants; and
     -  the  Company  may be more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions than
        less  leveraged  competitors and, thus, may be limited in its ability to
        withstand competitive pressures.

     The  restrictive  covenants  and  provisions in the Company's senior credit
facility  and its indentures under which its debt securities are issued include,
among  others,  those  restricting  additional liens, additional borrowing,  the
sale  of assets, changes of control, the payment of dividends, transactions with
affiliates,  the  making  of  investments and certain other fundamental changes.
The  senior  credit  facility  also  contains  restrictions  on acquisitions and
certain  financial  ratio  tests  including a debt coverage ratio, a senior debt
coverage  ratio,  a  fixed  charges ratio and an interest coverage ratio.  These
restrictions  could  limit the Company's ability to conduct business.  A failure
to  comply  with  the  obligations  contained in the senior credit facility, its
existing  indentures  or other loan agreements or indentures entered into in the
future  could  result  in an event of default under such agreements, which could
require  the  Company  to immediately repay the related debt and also debt under
other  agreements  that   may  contain   cross-acceleration   or   cross-default
provisions.

THE COMPANY'S ACQUISITION OR JOINT VENTURE STRATEGIES MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL.

     The  Company  has  made  a  number  of  acquisitions,  including the recent
acquisitions  of  Hardy,  Ravenswood,  the  Turner Road Vintners Assets, and the
Corus Assets, and anticipates that it may, from time to time, acquire additional
businesses,  assets  or  securities of companies that the Company believes would
provide  a  strategic  fit  with  its  business.   In  addition, the Company has
entered  joint  ventures and may enter into additional joint ventures.  Acquired
businesses  will  need  to be integrated with the Company's existing operations.
There  can  be  no  assurance  that  the Company will effectively assimilate the
business or product offerings of acquired companies into its business or product
offerings.  Acquisitions  are  also  accompanied  by  risks  such  as  potential
exposure  to  unknown liabilities of acquired companies and the possible loss of
key  employees and customers of the acquired business.  Acquisitions are subject
to  risks  associated  with  the  difficulty  and  expense  of  integrating  the
operations  and personnel of the acquired companies, the potential disruption to
the  Company's business and the diversion of management time and attention.  The
Company  shares control of its existing joint ventures and may not have majority
interest  or control of future joint ventures, and, therefore, there is the risk
that  the  Company's  joint  venture  partners  may  at  any time have economic,
business  or  legal  interests  or goals that are inconsistent with those of the
joint  venture  or  the  Company.  There  is  also risk that the Company's joint
venture  partners  may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations and
that  the  Company  may  be  required  to  fulfill those obligations alone.  The
Company's  failure  or the failure of an entity in which the Company has a joint
venture interest to adequately manage the risks associated with any acquisitions
or  joint  ventures  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on the Company's
financial  condition  or  results  of  operations.

COMPETITION COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS.

     The  Company  is in a highly competitive industry and the dollar amount and
unit  volume  of  its  sales  could  be  negatively affected by its inability to
maintain  or  increase  prices,  changes in geographic or product mix, a general
decline  in  beverage  alcohol  consumption  or  the  decision  of the Company's
wholesale  customers,  retailers  or  consumers to purchase competitive products
instead  of the Company's products. Wholesaler, retailer and consumer purchasing
decisions  are  influenced  by,  among  other  things, the perceived absolute or
relative  overall  value  of  the Company's products, including their quality or
pricing,  compared  to  competitive products. Unit volume and dollar sales could
also  be affected by pricing, purchasing, financing, operational, advertising or
promotional  decisions  made  by wholesalers, state and provincial agencies, and
retailers  which  could  affect  their  supply  of,  or consumer demand for, the
Company's  products.  The  Company  could  also  experience higher than expected
selling,  general  and administrative expenses if the Company finds it necessary
to  increase  the  number  of  its  personnel  or   advertising  or  promotional
expenditures  to  maintain  its  competitive  position  or  for  other  reasons.

AN  INCREASE  IN  EXCISE  TAXES  OR GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL
ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS.

     In  the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and other countries in
which  the  Company operates, the Company is subject to imposition of excise and
other  taxes  on  beverage  alcohol  products in varying amounts which have been
subject  to  change.  Significant increases in excise or other taxes on beverage
alcohol  products  could materially and adversely affect the Company's financial
condition  or  results  of  operations.  Recently,  many  states have considered
proposals  to  increase,  and some of these states have increased, state alcohol
excise taxes.  In addition, the beverage alcohol products industry is subject to
extensive  regulation by federal, state, local and foreign governmental agencies
concerning such matters as licensing, trade and pricing practices, permitted and
required  labeling,  advertising  and  relations with wholesalers and retailers.
Certain  federal  and state regulations also require warning labels and signage.
New  or  revised  regulations or increased licensing fees, requirements or taxes
could  also  have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition
or  results  of  operations.

THE COMPANY RELIES ON THE PERFORMANCE OF WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTORS, MAJOR RETAILERS
AND CHAINS FOR THE SUCCESS OF ITS BUSINESS.

     In  the  United  States,  the  Company  sells  its  products principally to
wholesalers  for  resale  to  retail  outlets  including grocery stores, package
liquor  stores, club and discount stores and restaurants.  In the United Kingdom
and  Australia,  the  Company  sells its products principally to wholesalers and
directly  to major retailers and chains.  The replacement or poor performance of
the Company's major wholesalers, retailers or chains, or the Company's inability
to  collect  accounts receivable from the Company's major wholesalers, retailers
or  chains  could  materially  and  adversely  affect  the  Company's results of
operations  and financial condition.  Distribution channels for beverage alcohol
products  have been consolidating in recent years.  In addition, wholesalers and
retailers  of  the Company's products offer products which compete directly with
the  Company's  products  for  retail  shelf  space  and   consumer   purchases.
Accordingly,  there  is  a  risk  that  wholesalers or retailers may give higher
priority to products of the Company's competitors.  In the future, the Company's
wholesalers and retailers may not continue to purchase the Company's products or
provide  the  Company's  products  with  adequate levels of promotional support.

THE  COMPANY'S  BUSINESS  COULD  BE  ADVERSELY  AFFECTED  BY  A  DECLINE  IN THE
CONSUMPTION OF PRODUCTS THE COMPANY SELLS.

     Although  since  1995  there  have  been modest increases in consumption of
beverage  alcohol  in  most of the Company's product categories, there have been
periods  in the past in which there were substantial declines in the overall per
capita  consumption  of beverage alcohol products in the United States and other
markets  in  which  the  Company  participates.  A limited or general decline in
consumption  in  one  or more of the Company's product categories could occur in
the  future  due  to  a  variety  of  factors,  including:

     -  a general decline in economic conditions;
     -  increased  concern  about  the health consequences of consuming beverage
        alcohol products and about drinking and driving;
     -  a  trend  toward  a  healthier  diet  including  lighter,  lower calorie
        beverages such as diet soft drinks, juices and water products;
     -  increased activity of anti-alcohol consumer groups; and
     -  increased federal, state  or foreign  excise or other taxes  on beverage
        alcohol products.

     THE  COMPANY  GENERALLY  PURCHASES  RAW  MATERIALS  UNDER SHORT-TERM SUPPLY
CONTRACTS  AND  THE  COMPANY  IS  SUBJECT  TO SUBSTANTIAL PRICE FLUCTUATIONS FOR
GRAPES  AND  GRAPE-RELATED  MATERIALS;  AND  THE  COMPANY HAS A LIMITED GROUP OF
SUPPLIERS  OF  GLASS  BOTTLES.

     The  Company's  business  is  heavily dependent upon raw materials, such as
grapes,  grape  juice  concentrate, grains, alcohol and packaging materials from
third-party  suppliers.  The  Company  could  experience  raw  material  supply,
production  or  shipment  difficulties that could adversely affect the Company's
ability to supply goods to its customers.  The Company is also directly affected
by  increases  in  the  costs  of  raw  materials.  In the past, the Company has
experienced  dramatic  increases  in  the  cost of grapes.  Although the Company
believes  it  has  adequate  sources  of grape supplies, in the event demand for
certain  wine  products  exceeds  expectations,  the  Company  could  experience
shortages.

     One  of  the  Company's largest components of cost of goods sold is that of
glass  bottles,  which,  in  the  United States and Australia, have only a small
number  of  producers.  Currently,  substantially  all  of  the  Company's glass
container  requirements  for  its  United  States operations are supplied by one
producer  and  most  of  the  Company's  glass  container  requirements  for its
Australian operations are supplied by another producer.  The inability of any of
the Company's glass bottle suppliers to satisfy its requirements could adversely
affect  the  Company's  business.

THE  COMPANY'S  GLOBAL  OPERATIONS  SUBJECT IT TO RISKS RELATED TO CURRENCY RATE
FLUCTUATIONS  AND  GEOPOLITICAL  UNCERTAINTY WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE
EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS.

     The Company has operations in different countries throughout the world and,
therefore,  is  subject  to  the  risks  associated  with currency fluctuations.
Subsequent  to the Hardy Acquisition, the Company's exposure to foreign currency
risk  has increased significantly as a result of having additional international
operations  in  Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. The Company could
experience  changes  in  its  ability to obtain or hedge against fluctuations in
exchange  rates.  The  Company  could  also  be  affected by nationalizations or
unstable  governments  or  legal  systems  or  intergovernmental disputes. These
currency,  economic  and  political  uncertainties  may  have a material adverse
effect  on  the  Company's results of operations, especially to the extent these
matters,  or  the  decisions,  policies  or  economic  strength of the Company's
suppliers,  affect  the  Company's  global  operations.

THE COMPANY HAS A MATERIAL AMOUNT OF GOODWILL, AND IF THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO
WRITE-DOWN  GOODWILL,  IT  WOULD  REDUCE THE COMPANY'S NET INCOME, WHICH IN TURN
COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

     As  of  February  29,  2004,  goodwill  represented  approximately $1,540.6
million,  or  27.7%  of  the  Company's total assets.  Goodwill is the amount by
which  the  costs  of  an  acquisition  accounted  for using the purchase method
exceeds  the  fair  value  of  the  net  assets  acquired.  The  Company adopted
Statement  of  Financial Accounting Standard No. 142 ("SFAS No. 142"), "Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets," in its entirety, on March 1, 2002.  Under SFAS No.
142,  goodwill  is  no  longer  amortized,  but instead is subject to a periodic
impairment evaluation based on the fair value of the reporting unit.  Reductions
in  the Company's net income caused by a write-down of goodwill could materially
and  adversely  affect  the  Company's  results  of  operations.

THE  TERMINATION  OR  NON-RENEWAL OF IMPORTED BEER DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENTS COULD
HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS.

     All  of the Company's imported beer products are marketed and sold pursuant
to  exclusive  distribution  agreements with the suppliers of these products and
are subject to renewal from time to time.  The Company's agreement to distribute
Corona  Extra  and  its  other  Mexican beer brands in 25 primarily western U.S.
states  expires  in  December  2006  and,  subject  to  compliance  with certain
performance  criteria,  continued retention of certain personnel and other terms
of  the  agreement,  will  be automatically renewed for additional terms of five
years.  Changes  in  control  of  the  Company  or  its subsidiaries involved in
importing  the Mexican beer brands, or changes in the chief executive officer of
such  subsidiaries,  may be a basis for the supplier, unless it consents to such
changes, to terminate the agreement.  The supplier's consent to such changes may
not  be  unreasonably  withheld. Prior to their expiration, all of the Company's
imported  beer distribution agreements may be terminated if the Company fails to
meet certain performance criteria.  The Company believes that it is currently in
compliance  with all of its material imported beer distribution agreements. From
time  to  time  the  Company  has failed, and may in the future fail, to satisfy
certain  performance  criteria  in the Company's distribution agreements.  It is
possible  that  the Company's beer distribution agreements may not be renewed or
may  be  terminated  prior  to  expiration.

THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE THREE FISCAL YEARS ENDED FEBRUARY 28,
2002, WERE AUDITED BY ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP.

     The  Company's consolidated financial statements for the three fiscal years
ended February 28, 2002, were audited by Arthur Andersen LLP, independent public
accountants.

     On  August 31, 2002, Arthur Andersen LLP ceased to practice before the SEC.
Therefore,  Arthur  Andersen LLP did not participate  in the preparation of this
Annual Report on Form 10-K, did not reissue its audit report with respect to the
financial  statements  included  in  this  Form 10-K, and did not consent to the
inclusion  of a copy of its previously issued audit report in this Form 10-K. As
a  result,  holders  of  the  Company's  securities may have no effective remedy
against  Arthur  Andersen  LLP  in  connection  with  a material misstatement or
omission  in  the  financial  statements  to  which its audit report relates. In
addition,  even if such holders were able to assert such a claim, because it has
ceased  operations,  Arthur Andersen LLP may fail or otherwise have insufficient
assets  to satisfy claims made by holders of the Company's securities that might
arise  under  federal  securities  laws  or  otherwise with respect to the audit
report  of  Arthur  Andersen  LLP.

ITEM 7A.   QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
- --------   ----------------------------------------------------------

     The  Company, as a result of its global operating and financing activities,
is  exposed to market risk associated with changes in interest rates and foreign
currency  exchange rates.  To manage the volatility relating to these risks, the
Company  periodically  enters  into  derivative  transactions  including foreign
currency exchange contracts and interest rate swap agreements.  The Company uses
derivative  instruments solely to reduce the financial impact of these risks and
does  not  use  derivative  instruments  for  trading  purposes.

     Foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency options are used to
hedge  existing  foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities, forecasted
foreign currency denominated sales both to third parties as well as intercompany
sales,  and  intercompany  principal  and  interest payments. As of February 29,
2004,  the  Company  had exposures to foreign currency risk primarily related to
the  Australian  Dollar,  Euro,  New  Zealand  Dollar,  British  Pound Sterling,
Canadian Dollar and Mexican Peso.

     As of February 29, 2004, and February 28, 2003, the Company had outstanding
derivative  contracts with a notional value of $735.8 million and $11.6 million,
respectively.   Using  a  sensitivity  analysis based on estimated fair value of
open contracts using forward rates, if the U.S. dollar had been 10% weaker as of
February  29,  2004,  and  February  28,  2003,  the  fair value of open foreign
exchange  contracts  would have been increased by $6.8 million and $2.4 million,
respectively.  Losses or gains from the revaluation or settlement of the related
underlying  positions  would  substantially  offset  such  gains  or  losses.

     The  fair  value  of fixed rate debt is subject to interest rate risk.  The
fair  value of fixed rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease
as  interest  rates rise.  The estimated fair value of the Company's total fixed
rate  debt,  including  current  maturities,  was  $1,274.8 million and $1,138.3
million  as  of  February  29,  2004,  and  February  28, 2003, respectively.  A
hypothetical 1% increase from prevailing interest rates as of February 29, 2004,
and  February 28, 2003, would have resulted in a decrease in fair value of fixed
interest  rate  long-term debt by $52.9 million and $53.1 million, respectively.

     In  addition to the $1.3 billion fair value of fixed rate debt outstanding,
the  Company  also had variable rate debt outstanding (primarily LIBOR based) as
of  February  29,  2004,  and  February  28,  2003, of $860.0 million and $147.4
million,  respectively.  A  hypothetical  1%  increase  from prevailing interest
rates  as  of  February  29,  2004,  and  February  28, 2003, would result in an
increase  in  cash required for interest payments on variable interest rate debt
during  the  next  five  fiscal  years  as  follows:

                        February 29,     February 28,
                            2004             2003
                        ------------     ------------
                2004    $7.4 million     $1.1 million
                2005    $8.3 million     $0.3 million
                2006    $7.3 million     $ -
                2007    $5.9 million     $ -
                2008    $3.9 million     $ -
                2009    $1.4 million     $ -

     The  Company  has on occasion entered into interest rate swap agreements to
reduce its exposure to interest rate changes relative to its variable rate debt.
As of February 29, 2004, and February 28, 2003, the Company had no interest rate
swap  agreements  outstanding.

                          INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Constellation Brands, Inc.:

We  have  audited  the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Constellation
Brands,  Inc. and subsidiaries as of February 29, 2004 and February 28, 2003 and
the  related  consolidated  statements  of income, stockholders' equity and cash
flows  for the years then ended. These consolidated financial statements are the
responsibility  of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion  on  these  consolidated  financial  statements based on our audits. The
February  28,  2002  consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity and
cash  flows of Constellation Brands, Inc. and subsidiaries were audited by other
auditors  who  have  ceased  operations. Those auditors expressed an unqualified
opinion  on  those  consolidated  financial  statements,  before  the  revisions
described in Notes 1, 2, 5, 11 and 22  to the consolidated financial statements,
in their report dated April 9, 2002.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in  the  United  States  of  America.  Those  standards require that we plan and
perform  the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated
financial  statements  are  free  of  material  misstatement.  An audit includes
examining,  on  a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the  consolidated  financial  statements.  An  audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well
as  evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits  provide  a  reasonable  basis  for  our  opinion.

In  our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly,  in  all  material  respects,  the  financial  position of Constellation
Brands, Inc. and subsidiaries as of February 29, 2004 and February 28, 2003, and
the  results  of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended,
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of  America.

As  discussed  above,  the  accompanying   consolidated  statements  of  income,
stockholders'  equity  and   cash  flows   of  Constellation  Brands,  Inc.  and
subsidiaries for the year ended February 28, 2002 were audited by other auditors
who  have  ceased operations. As described in Note 5, the consolidated financial
statements have been revised to include the transitional disclosures required by
Statement  of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.  142,  Goodwill  and  Other
Intangible  Assets, which was adopted by the Company as of March 1, 2002. In our
opinion,  these disclosures for 2002 in Note 5 are appropriate. Additionally, as
described  in  Note  2,  the consolidated statement of income for the year ended
February  28,  2002  has  been  revised  to reflect reclassifications of certain
consumer  and  trade  promotional  expenses  as required by Emerging Issues Task
Force  Issue  No.  01-9,  Accounting  for  Consideration  Given by a Vendor to a
Customer (EITF 01-9), which was also adopted by the Company as of March 1, 2002;
as  described  in  Notes  2  and  11,  the  consolidated statement of income and
disclosure  for  income  taxes  for  the  year ended February 28, 2002 have been
revised to reflect the reclassification of the extraordinary loss, net of income
taxes,  related to the extinguishment of debt by increasing selling, general and
administrative expenses and adjusting the provision for income taxes as required
by  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  No. 145, Rescission of FASB
Statements  No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical
Corrections  (FASB  No. 145), which was fully adopted by the Company as of March
1,  2003;  as  described  in  Note 1, the proforma disclosures of net income and
earnings per common share related to stock-based compensation for the year ended
February  28,  2002 have been adjusted from the amounts originally reported; and
as  described  in Note 22, the Company changed the composition of its reportable
segments, and the amounts in the 2002 consolidated financial statements relating
to  reportable segments have been restated to conform to the current composition
of  reportable segments. We audited the adjustments that were applied to restate
the  2002  consolidated  financial  statements for the adoption of EITF 01-9 and
FASB  No.  145, to restate the disclosure of amounts of pro forma net income and
earnings  per  share  related  to  stock-based  compensation  for the year ended
February  28,  2002  and  to  restate  the  disclosures  for reportable segments
reflected  in  the  2002 consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, such
adjustments are appropriate and have been properly applied. However, we were not
engaged  to  audit,  review,  or  apply  any procedures to the February 28, 2002
consolidated  statements  of  income,  stockholders'  equity  and  cash flows of
Constellation  Brands,  Inc.  and  subsidiaries, other than with respect to such
disclosures  and  adjustments;  accordingly, we do not express an opinion or any
other  form  of  assurance  on  the  February  28,  2002  consolidated financial
statements  taken  as  a  whole.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To Constellation Brands, Inc.:

We  have  audited  the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Constellation
Brands,  Inc.  (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries as of February 28, 2002
and  February  28,  2001,  and  the  related  consolidated statements of income,
changes  in  stockholders'  equity and cash flows for each of the three years in
the  period  ended  February  28,  2002.  These  financial  statements  are  the
responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an
opinion  on  these  financial  statements  based  on  our  audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in  the  United  States.  Those  standards  require that we plan and perform the
audit  to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free  of  material  misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An
audit  also  includes  assessing  the accounting principles used and significant
estimates  made  by  management,  as  well  as  evaluating the overall financial

for  our  opinion.

In  our  opinion,  the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all  material respects, the financial position of Constellation Brands, Inc. and
subsidiaries  as  of February 28, 2002 and February 28, 2001, and the results of
their  operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period

                  CONSTELLATION BRANDS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                                FEBRUARY 29, 2004

1.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

     DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS -
     Constellation  Brands,  Inc.  and  its subsidiaries (the "Company") operate
primarily  in  the  beverage  alcohol  industry.   The  Company  is   a  leading
international  producer  and  marketer  of  beverage alcohol brands with a broad
portfolio  across  the  wine, spirits and imported beer categories.  The Company
has  the  largest  wine  business in the world and is the largest multi-category
supplier  of  beverage alcohol in the United States ("U.S."); a leading producer
and  exporter  of wine from Australia and New Zealand; and both a major producer
and  independent  drinks  wholesaler  in  the United Kingdom ("U.K.").  In North
America,  the  Company  distributes its products through wholesale distributors.
In  Australia,  the  Company  distributes  its  products directly to off-premise
accounts,  such  as major retail chains, on-premise accounts, such as hotels and
restaurants,  and  large  wholesalers.  In the U.K., the Company distributes its
products  directly  to off-premise accounts, such as major retail chains, and to
other  wholesalers.  Through  the Company's U.K. wholesale business, the Company
distributes  its  branded  products and those of other major drinks companies to
on-premise  accounts:  pubs,  clubs,  hotels  and  restaurants.

     PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION -
     The  consolidated  financial statements of the Company include the accounts
of  Constellation  Brands,  Inc.  and all of its subsidiaries.  All intercompany
accounts  and  transactions  have  been  eliminated.

     MANAGEMENT'S USE OF ESTIMATES -
     The  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  conformity  with generally
accepted  accounting  principles  requires  management  to  make  estimates  and
assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of assets and liabilities and
disclosure  of  contingent  assets  and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements  and  the  reported  amounts  of  revenues  and  expenses  during the
reporting  period.  Actual  results  could  differ  from  those  estimates.

     REVENUE RECOGNITION -
     Sales  are recognized when title passes to the customer, which is generally
when  the  product  is  shipped.  Amounts  billed  to customers for shipping and
handling  are  classified  as  sales.  Sales  reflect reductions attributable to
consideration  given  to  customers  in  various  customer  incentive  programs,
including  pricing   discounts  on   single  transactions,   volume   discounts,
promotional  and  advertising  allowances,  coupons,  and  rebates.

     COST OF PRODUCT SOLD -
     The  types  of  costs  included  in cost of product sold are raw materials,
packaging  materials,  manufacturing  costs,  plant  administrative  support and
overheads,  and  freight  and  warehouse  costs  (including distribution network
costs).  Distribution network costs include inbound freight charges and outbound
shipping  and  handling costs, purchasing and receiving costs, inspection costs,
warehousing  and  internal  transfer  costs.

     SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES -
     The types of costs included in selling, general and administrative expenses
consist  predominately  of  advertising and non-manufacturing administrative and
overhead  costs.  Distribution  network  costs are not included in the Company's
selling,  general  and  administrative  expenses,  but  are  included in cost of
product  sold  as  described  above.  The  Company expenses advertising costs as
incurred,  shown or distributed.  Prepaid advertising costs at February 29, 2004
and  February  28,  2003,  were not material.  Advertising expense for the years
ended  February  29,  2004, February 28, 2003, and February 28, 2002, was $116.1
million,  $89.6  million  and  $87.0  million,  respectively.

     FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION -
     The  "functional  currency"  for  translating the accounts of the Company's
operations  outside  the  U.S.  is  the local currency. The translation from the
applicable  foreign  currencies  to  U.S. dollars is performed for balance sheet
accounts  using  exchange  rates  in  effect  at  the balance sheet date and for
revenue  and  expense accounts using a weighted average exchange rate during the
period.  The  resulting  translation  adjustments are recorded as a component of
Accumulated  Other  Comprehensive  Income  (Loss)  ("AOCI").   Gains  or  losses
resulting  from  foreign  currency  denominated  transactions  are  included  in
selling,  general  and  administrative  expenses  in  the Company's Consolidated
Statements  of  Income.  The  Company  engages  in  foreign currency denominated
transactions  with  customers,  suppliers  and  non-U.S. subsidiaries. Aggregate
foreign  currency transaction gains were $16.6 million in Fiscal 2004. Aggregate
foreign  currency  transaction gains were not material in Fiscal 2003 and Fiscal
2002.

     CASH INVESTMENTS -
     Cash  investments  consist  of  highly  liquid investments with an original
maturity  when  purchased  of three months or less and are stated at cost, which
approximates  market  value.  The amounts at February 29, 2004, and February 28,
2003,  are  not  significant.

     ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS -
     The Company records an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses
resulting  from  the  inability of its customers to make required payments.  The
majority  of  the  accounts  receivable  balance  is  generated  from  sales  to
independent  distributors  with  whom the Company has a predetermined collection
date  arranged  through  electronic  funds transfer.  The allowance for doubtful
accounts  was  $17.2  million  and  $13.8  million  as of February 29, 2004, and
February  28,  2003,  respectively.

     FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS -
     To  meet  the  reporting  requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards  No. 107, "Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments," the
Company  calculates  the fair value of financial instruments using quoted market
prices  whenever  available.  When  quoted  market prices are not available, the
Company  uses standard pricing models for various types of financial instruments
(such  as  forwards,  options,  swaps, etc.) which take into account the present
value  of  estimated  future  cash  flows.

     The  carrying  amount  and  estimated fair value of the Company's financial
instruments  are  summarized  as  follows:



     The  following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value
of  each  class  of  financial  instruments:

     CASH AND CASH INVESTMENTS, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND ACCOUNTS PAYABLE:    The
carrying  amounts  approximate  fair  value  due  to the short maturity of these
instruments.
     INVESTMENT IN MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES:   The fair value  is  estimated
based  on  quoted  market  prices.
     CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS:   The fair value  is estimated based  on quoted
market prices.
     NOTES PAYABLE TO BANKS:   These  instruments  are  variable  interest  rate
bearing  notes  for  which  the  carrying  value  approximates  the  fair value.
     LONG-TERM DEBT:  The senior credit facility is subject to variable interest
rates  which  are frequently reset; accordingly, the carrying value of this debt
approximates  its  fair  value.  The fair value of the remaining long-term debt,
which  is  all fixed rate, is estimated by discounting cash flows using interest
rates  currently  available  for  debt  with  similar  terms  and  maturities.

     DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS -
     As  a  multinational  company,  the  Company is exposed to market risk from
changes  in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates that could affect
the  Company's  results  of operations and financial condition. Accordingly, the
Company's  results  of  operations  are  exposed  to  some  volatility, which is
minimized  or  eliminated  whenever  possible. The amount of volatility realized
will  vary  based  upon  the  effectiveness  and level of derivative instruments
outstanding  during  a  particular  period  of time, as well as the currency and
interest  rate  market  movements  during  that  same  period.

     The  Company  enters  into  derivative instruments, including interest rate
swaps,  foreign  currency forwards, and/or purchased foreign currency options to
manage interest rate and foreign currency risks. In accordance with Statement of
Financial  Standards  No.  133  ("SFAS  No.  133"),  "Accounting  for Derivative
Instruments  and  Hedging  Activities",  as  amended, the Company recognizes all
derivatives  as  either  assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measures
those  instruments  at  fair  value. The fair values of the Company's derivative
instruments change with fluctuations in interest rates and/or currency rates and
are  designed  so  that any changes in their values are offset by changes in the
values  of  the  underlying  exposures. The Company's derivative instruments are
held  solely to hedge economic exposures. The Company follows strict policies to
manage  interest  rate  and  foreign  currency  risks, including prohibitions on
derivative  market-making  or  other  speculative activities. As of February 29,
2004,  and  February  28,  2003, the Company did not have any interest rate swap
agreements  outstanding.  As  of  February  29, 2004, and February 28, 2003, the
Company  had  foreign  exchange  contracts  outstanding with a notional value of
$735.8  million  and  $11.6  million,  respectively.

     To  qualify  for  hedge  accounting  under SFAS No. 133, the details of the
hedging   relationship  must   be  formally   documented  at  inception  of  the
arrangement,  including  the risk management objective, hedging strategy, hedged
item,  specific  risk  that  is  being  hedged,  the  derivative instrument, how
effectiveness  is  being  assessed and how ineffectiveness will be measured. The
derivative  must  be  highly  effective in offsetting either changes in the fair
value  or cash flows, as appropriate, of the risk being hedged. Effectiveness is
evaluated  on  a  retrospective  and  prospective  basis  based  on quantitative
measures.

     Certain of the Company's derivative instruments do not qualify for SFAS No.
133  hedge  accounting  treatment; for others, the Company does not maintain the
required  documentation  to  apply  hedge accounting treatment. In both of these
instances,  the  mark  to  fair  value  is  reported currently through earnings.
Furthermore,  when  it  is determined that a derivative is not, or has ceased to
be,  highly  effective  as  a  hedge,  the Company discontinues hedge accounting
prospectively.  The Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when (1)
the  derivative  is no longer highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash
flows  of  a  hedged item; (2) the derivative expires or is sold, terminated, or
exercised;  (3)  it  is  no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will
occur; or (4) management determines that designating the derivative as a hedging
instrument  is  no  longer  appropriate.

     CASH FLOW HEDGES:
     The  Company  is  exposed  to  fluctuations  in foreign currency cash flows
related  primarily  to sales to third parties, intercompany sales, available for
sale  securities  and  intercompany  loans  and  interest payments.  Forward and
option  contracts  are  used  to  hedge  some  of these risks.  Effectiveness is
assessed based on changes in forward rates. Derivatives used to manage cash flow
exposures  generally mature within 24 months or less, with a maximum maturity of
five  years.

     The  Company  records  the  fair  value  of  its foreign exchange contracts
qualifying  for cash flow hedge accounting treatment in its consolidated balance
sheet with the related gain or loss on those contracts deferred in stockholders'
equity  (as a component of AOCI).  These deferred gains or losses are recognized
in  the  Company's  Consolidated Statement of Income in the same period in which
the  underlying  hedged  items  are recognized, and on the same line item as the
underlying  hedged items.  However, to the extent that any derivative instrument
is  not  considered  to  be  perfectly effective in offsetting the change in the
value  of the hedged item, the amount related to the ineffective portion of this
derivative  instrument  is  immediately recognized in the Company's Consolidated
Statement  of  Income.

     The Company expects $14.1 million of net gains to be reclassified from AOCI
to  earnings  within  the  next  12 months.  The amount of hedge ineffectiveness
associated  with the Company's designated cash flow hedge instruments recognized
in  the  Company's  Consolidated  Statements  of  Income  during the years ended
February  29,  2004,  February  28, 2003, and February 28, 2002, was immaterial.
All  components  of  the  Company's  derivative instruments' gains or losses are
included  in  the assessment of hedge effectiveness.  In addition, the amount of
net  gains  reclassified into earnings as a result of the discontinuance of cash
flow  hedge  accounting  due  to  the  probability  that the original forecasted
transaction  would  not occur by the end of the originally specified time period
was  immaterial  for  the  years ended February 29, 2004, February 28, 2003, and
February 28, 2002.

     FAIR VALUE HEDGES:
     Fair  value  hedges  are hedges that offset the risk of changes in the fair
values  of  recorded  assets  and liabilities, and firm commitments. The Company
records changes in fair value of derivative instruments which are designated and
deemed  effective  as fair value hedges, in earnings offset by the corresponding
changes  in  the  fair  value  of  the  hedged  items.

     The  Company  is  exposed  to fluctuations in the value of foreign currency
denominated  receivables  and  payables, foreign currency investments, primarily
consisting  of  loans  to  subsidiaries  and  cash  flows  related  primarily to
repatriation  of those loans/investments. Forward contracts, generally less than
12  months  in duration, are used to hedge some of these risks. Effectiveness is
assessed  based  on changes in forward rates. Gains and losses on the derivative
instruments  used  to  hedge  the  foreign  exchange  volatility associated with
foreign  currency dominated receivables and payables is recorded within selling,
general  and  administrative  expenses.

     The  amount  of   hedge  ineffectiveness  associated   with  the  Company's
designated fair value hedge instruments recognized in the Company's Consolidated
Statements  of  Income  during  the  years ended February 29, 2004, February 28,
2003,  and  February  28,  2002, was immaterial. All components of the Company's
derivative  instruments' gains or losses are included in the assessment of hedge
effectiveness.  There  were  no gains or losses recognized in earnings resulting
from  a  hedged  firm  commitment  no  longer  qualifying as a fair value hedge.

     NET INVESTMENT HEDGES:
     Net  investment  hedges  are  hedges  that  use  derivative  instruments or
non-derivative  instruments  to  hedge  the  foreign  currency exposure of a net
investment  in  a  foreign  operation.  The  Company  manages currency exposures
resulting from its net investments in foreign subsidiaries principally with debt
denominated  in  the  related  foreign  currency.  Gains  and  losses  on  these
instruments  are  recorded  as  foreign currency translation adjustment in AOCI.
Currently, the Company has designated the Sterling Senior Notes and the Sterling
Series  C  Senior  Notes  (as defined in Note 10) totaling (pound) 155.0 million
aggregate  principal  amount  as  a  hedge  against  the  net  investment in the
Company's  U.K.  subsidiary. For the years ended February 29, 2004, February 28,
2003,  and  February  28,  2002,  net (losses) gains of ($45.9) million, ($24.0)
million,  and  $4.4  million,  respectively,  are  included  in foreign currency
translation  adjustments  within  AOCI.

     COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK:
     Counterparty  risk  relates  to  losses  the   Company  could  incur  if  a
counterparty defaults on a derivative contract.  The Company manages exposure to
counterparty  credit  risk  by  requiring specified minimum credit standards and
diversification  of  counterparties.  The  Company enters into master agreements
with  our  counterparties  that  allow  netting of certain exposures in order to
manage  this  risk.   All  of  the  Company's  counterpart  exposures  are  with
counterparts  that have investment grade ratings.  The Company has procedures to
monitor  the  credit  exposure  for  both  mark  to  market and future potential
exposures.

     INVENTORIES -
     Inventories  are  stated  at the lower of cost (computed in accordance with
the  first-in, first-out method) or market.  Elements of cost include materials,
labor  and  overhead  and  are  classified  as  follows:



     A  substantial  portion  of  barreled  whiskey  and brandy will not be sold
within  one  year  because  of  the duration of the aging process.  All barreled
whiskey  and brandy are classified as in-process inventories and are included in
current assets, in accordance with industry practice.  Bulk wine inventories are
also  included  as  in-process  inventories within current assets, in accordance
with  the  general  practices  of  the wine industry, although a portion of such
inventories  may  be  aged  for  periods  greater  than  one year.  Warehousing,
insurance,  ad  valorem  taxes and other carrying charges applicable to barreled
whiskey  and  brandy  held  for  aging  are  included  in  inventory  costs.

     The  Company  assesses  the  valuation  of  its inventories and reduces the
carrying  value  of  those  inventories  that  are  obsolete or in excess of the
Company's forecasted usage to their estimated net realizable value.  The Company
estimates  the  net  realizable  value of such inventories based on analyses and
assumptions  including,  but not limited to, historical usage, future demand and
market  requirements.  Reductions  to  the  carrying  value  of  inventories are
recorded in cost of goods sold.  If the future demand for the Company's products
is  less  favorable  than  the  Company's  forecasts,  then  the  value  of  the
inventories  may  be  required  to  be reduced, which would result in additional
expense  to  the  Company  and  affect  its  results  of  operations.

     PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT -
     Property,  plant  and  equipment  is  stated  at cost.  Major additions and
betterments  are charged to property accounts, while maintenance and repairs are
charged  to  operations  as  incurred.  The cost of properties sold or otherwise
disposed  of  and  the  related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the
accounts  at the time of disposal and resulting gains and losses are included as
a  component  of  operating  income.

     DEPRECIATION -
     Depreciation  is computed primarily using the straight-line method over the
following  estimated  useful  lives:



     GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS -
     Effective  March  1,  2002,  the  Company  adopted  Statement  of Financial
Accounting  Standards  No.  142 ("SFAS No. 142"), "Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets."  SFAS No. 142 addresses financial accounting and reporting for acquired
goodwill  and other intangible assets and supersedes Accounting Principles Board
Opinion  No.  17,  "Intangible  Assets."   Under  SFAS  No.  142,  goodwill  and
indefinite  lived  intangible assets are no longer amortized but are reviewed at
least  annually  for  impairment.  Additionally,  in  the  year  of  adoption, a
transitional  impairment test is also required.  The Company uses December 31 as
its  annual  impairment  test  measurement date.  Intangible assets that are not
deemed  to  have  an  indefinite  life  will continue to be amortized over their
useful  lives  and  are also subject to review for impairment.  Upon adoption of
SFAS  No.  142, the Company determined that certain of its intangible assets met
the  criteria  to  be considered indefinite lived and, accordingly, ceased their
amortization  effective  March  1,  2002.   These  intangible  assets  consisted
principally  of trademarks.  The Company's trademarks relate to well established
brands  owned  by  the  Company  which  were previously amortized over 40 years.
Intangible  assets  determined  to  have  a  finite life, primarily distribution
agreements, continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives which did
not  require  modification as a result of adopting SFAS No. 142.  Nonamortizable
intangible assets are tested for impairment in accordance with the provisions of
SFAS  No.  142  and  amortizable  intangible assets are tested for impairment in
accordance  with  the  provisions  of  SFAS  No. 144 (as defined below).  Note 6
provides  a  summary  of  intangible  assets  segregated between amortizable and
nonamortizable  amounts.  No instances of impairment were noted on the Company's
goodwill  and  other  intangible  assets  for the years ended February 29, 2004,
February 28, 2003, and February 28, 2002.

     OTHER ASSETS -
     Other assets include the following:  (i) deferred financing costs which are
stated  at  cost,  net  of  accumulated  amortization,  and  are amortized on an
effective  interest  basis  over  the  term of the related debt; (ii) derivative
assets  which are stated at fair value (see discussion above); (iii) investments
in  marketable  securities which are stated at fair value (see Note 7); and (iv)
investments  in  joint  ventures  which  are  carried under the equity method of
accounting  (see Note 8).

     LONG-LIVED ASSETS IMPAIRMENT -
     Effective  March  1,  2002,  the  Company  adopted  Statement  of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 144 ("SFAS No. 144"), "Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal  of  Long-Lived  Assets,"  which  addresses  financial  accounting  and
reporting  for  the  impairment  or disposal of long-lived assets.  SFAS No. 144
supersedes  Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, "Accounting for
the  Impairment  of  Long-Lived  Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed
Of,"  and the accounting and reporting provisions of Accounting Principles Board
Opinion  No.  30,  "Reporting the Results of Operations-Reporting the Effects of
Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently
Occurring  Events and Transactions," for the disposal of a segment of a business
(as  previously  defined in that Opinion).  In accordance with SFAS No. 144, the
Company  reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes
in  circumstances  indicate  that  the  carrying  amount  of an asset may not be
recoverable.  Recoverability  of  assets  to  be  held and used is measured by a
comparison  of  the  carrying  amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted cash
flows expected to be generated by the asset.  If the carrying amount of an asset
exceeds  its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for
the  amount  by  which  the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value.
Assets  to  be  disposed  of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or
fair  value  less  costs  to  sell  and  are  no  longer  depreciated.

     Pursuant  to  this  policy and in connection with the restructuring plan of
the  Constellation  Wines  segment (see Note 20), the Company recorded losses of
$2.1 million on  the disposal of certain property, plant and equipment in Fiscal
2004.  These  losses  are  included  in restructuring and related charges on the
Company's  Consolidated  Statements   of  Income   as  they  are  part   of  the
restructuring  plan.

     In  Fiscal  2003,  the  Company recorded an asset impairment charge of $4.8
million  in  connection  with  two  of  the production facilities disposed of in
Fiscal  2004 under the Constellation Wines segment's restructuring plan.  One of
the  facilities, which was held and used prior to its sale in the fourth quarter
of  Fiscal  2004,  was written down to its appraised value and comprised most of
the  impairment  charge.  The  other facility, which was held for sale in Fiscal
2004,  was  written  down  to a value based on the Company's estimate of salvage
value.  These  assets  were  sold  in  the  second quarter of Fiscal 2004.  This
impairment  charge  is  included  in  restructuring  and  related charges on the
Company's  Consolidated Statements of Income since it is part of the realignment
of its business operations.  The impaired assets consist primarily of buildings,
machinery  and  equipment  located at the two production facilities.  The charge
resulted  from the determination that the assets' undiscounted future cash flows
were  less  than  their  carrying  values.

     The  Company  recorded an asset impairment charge of $1.4 million in Fiscal
2002  in  connection  with  the sale of the Stevens Point Brewery in March 2002.
This  charge  has been included in selling, general and administrative expenses.

     INCOME TAXES -
     The  Company  uses  the asset and liability method of accounting for income
taxes.  This  method  accounts  for  deferred income taxes by applying statutory
rates  in  effect  at  the  balance  sheet  date  to  the difference between the
financial  reporting  and  tax  bases  of  assets  and  liabilities.

     ENVIRONMENTAL -
     Environmental  expenditures  that  relate  to  current  operations or to an
existing  condition  caused  by  past operations, and which do not contribute to
current   or   future   revenue   generation,  are  expensed.   Liabilities  for
environmental  risks  or  components  thereof  are  recorded  when environmental
assessments and/or remedial efforts are probable, and the cost can be reasonably
estimated.  Generally,   the  timing  of   these  accruals  coincides  with  the
completion  of  a feasibility study or the Company's commitment to a formal plan
of  action.  Liabilities  for  environmental costs were not material at February
29,  2004,  and  February  28,  2003.

     EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE -
     Basic  earnings  per  common  share  excludes  the  effect  of common stock
equivalents  and is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders
by  the  weighted  average number of common shares outstanding during the period
for Class A Common Stock and Class B Convertible Common Stock.  Diluted earnings
per common share reflects the potential dilution that could result if securities
or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common
stock.  Diluted  earnings per common share assumes the exercise of stock options
using  the  treasury  stock method and assumes the conversion of Preferred Stock
(see  Note  16)  using  the  "if  converted"  method.

     STOCK-BASED EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION PLANS -
     As  of  February  29,  2004,  the  Company  has  four  stock-based employee
compensation  plans,  which  are  described  more fully in Note 16.  The Company
applies  the  intrinsic  value  method  described in Accounting Principles Board
Opinion  No.  25 ("APB No. 25"), "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and
related  interpretations  in accounting for these plans.  In accordance with APB
No. 25, the compensation cost for stock options is recognized in income based on
the excess, if any, of the quoted market price of the stock at the grant date of
the  award  or  other  measurement  date over the amount an employee must pay to
acquire  the  stock.  The  Company  utilizes  the  disclosure-only provisions of
Statement  of   Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.  123   ("SFAS  No.  123"),
"Accounting  for  Stock-Based  Compensation," as amended.  Options granted under
the  Company's  plans  have  an  exercise price equal to the market value of the
underlying  common  stock  on  the  date  of  grant;  therefore,  no incremental
compensation  expense has been recognized for grants made to employees under the
Company's stock option plans.  The following table illustrates the effect on net
income  and  earnings  per  share  if  the  Company  had  applied the fair value
recognition  provisions  of  SFAS  No. 123 to stock-based employee compensation.



     As  reported in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
February  28,  2003,  pro forma net income for the year ended February 28, 2002,
was  adjusted  from  the  amount  originally  reported  to  properly reflect the
increased  expense,  net  of  income tax benefits, primarily attributable to the
accelerated  vesting  of  certain  options  during Fiscal 2002.  The accelerated
vesting was attributable to the attainment of preexisting performance rights set
forth in the stock option grants.  The impact of the accelerated vesting was not
reflected  in  the  Fiscal  2002  amount originally reported.  The pro forma net
income  amount  reflected above for Fiscal 2002 was reduced by $12.9 million for
this  matter.  Basic  pro  forma earnings per common share and diluted pro forma
earnings  per  common  share  for  Fiscal  2002 were reduced by $0.15 and $0.16,
respectively.

2.   RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS:

     Effective  March  1,  2003,  the  Company  adopted  Statement  of Financial
Accounting  Standards No. 143 ("SFAS No. 143"), "Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations."  SFAS  No.  143  addresses  financial accounting and reporting for
obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the
associated  retirement  costs.  The  adoption  of  SFAS  No.  143 did not have a
material  impact  on  the  Company's  consolidated  financial  statements.

     Effective March 1, 2003, the Company completed its adoption of Statement of
Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.  145 ("SFAS No. 145"), "Rescission of FASB
Statements  No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical
Corrections."  SFAS No. 145 rescinds Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No.  4 ("SFAS No. 4"), "Reporting Gains and Losses from Extinguishment of Debt,"
Statement  of  Financial Accounting Standards No. 44, "Accounting for Intangible
Assets  of  Motor Carriers," and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
64,  "Extinguishments  of  Debt  Made to Satisfy Sinking-Fund Requirements."  In
addition,  SFAS  No.  145 amends Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
13,  "Accounting  for  Leases,"  to  eliminate an inconsistency between required
accounting  for  sale-leaseback  transactions  and  the  required accounting for
certain  lease  modifications  that  have  economic  effects that are similar to
sale-leaseback  transactions.  Lastly,  SFAS  No. 145 also amends other existing
authoritative  pronouncements  to  make  various  technical corrections, clarify
meanings,  or  describe  their  applicability  under  changed  conditions.   The
adoption  of the provisions rescinding SFAS No. 4 resulted in a reclassification
of  the extraordinary loss related to the extinguishment of debt recorded in the
fourth quarter of Fiscal 2002 ($1.6 million, net of income taxes), by increasing
selling,  general  and administrative expenses ($2.6 million) and decreasing the
provision  for  income  taxes  ($1.0  million).  The  adoption  of the remaining
provisions  of  SFAS  No.  145  did  not have a material impact on the Company's
consolidated  financial  statements.

     Effective March 1, 2003, the Company completed its adoption of Statement of
Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.  148  ("SFAS  No.  148"),  "Accounting for
Stock-Based  Compensation--Transition  and  Disclosure."  SFAS  No.  148  amends
Statement  of   Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.  123   ("SFAS  No.  123"),
"Accounting  for  Stock-Based  Compensation,"  to provide alternative methods of
transition for an entity that voluntarily changes to the fair value based method
of  accounting  for stock-based employee compensation.  SFAS No. 148 also amends
the  disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123 to require prominent disclosure about
the  effects  on  reported net income of an entity's accounting policy decisions
with  respect to stock-based employee compensation.  Lastly, SFAS No. 148 amends
Accounting  Principles  Board  Opinion  No.  28 ("APB Opinion No. 28"), "Interim
Financial  Reporting,"  to  require  disclosure  about  those effects in interim
financial  information.  The  Company has adopted the disclosure provisions only
of SFAS No. 148.  The adoption of SFAS No. 148 did not have a material impact on
the  Company's  consolidated  financial  statements.

     Effective  July  1,  2003,  the  Company  adopted  Statement  of  Financial
Accounting  Standards  No.  149 ("SFAS No. 149"), "Amendment of Statement 133 on
Derivative  Instruments  and Hedging Activities," in its entirety.  SFAS No. 149
amends  and  clarifies  financial  accounting   and   reporting  for  derivative
instruments,  including  certain   derivative  instruments   embedded  in  other
contracts  (collectively  referred to as derivatives) and for hedging activities
under SFAS No. 133.  The adoption of SFAS No. 149 did not have a material impact
on  the  Company's  consolidated  financial  statements.

     Effective  August  1, 2003, the Company adopted EITF Issue No. 00-21 ("EITF
No.  00-21"), "Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables."  EITF No. 00-21
addresses  certain  aspects of the accounting by a vendor for arrangements under
which  it  will  perform multiple revenue-generating activities.  EITF No. 00-21
also addresses how arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated to
the  separate  units of accounting in the arrangement.  The adoption of EITF No.
00-21  did  not  have  a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial
statements.

     Effective  September  1,  2003,  the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 150 ("SFAS No. 150"), "Accounting for Certain Financial
Instruments  with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity."  SFAS No. 150
establishes  standards  for  how  an  issuer  classifies  and  measures  certain
financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity.  SFAS
No.  150  requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within
the  scope of SFAS No. 150 as a liability.  The adoption of SFAS No. 150 did not
have  a  material  impact  on  the  Company's consolidated financial statements.

     Also,  as reported in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended February 28, 2003, effective March 1, 2002, the Company adopted EITF Issue
No. 01-9 ("EITF No. 01-9"), "Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a
Customer  (Including  a  Reseller  of  the  Vendor's  Products)," which codified
various  issues  related  to  certain  promotional payments under EITF Issue No.
00-14,  "Accounting  for  Certain  Sales  Incentives,"  EITF  Issue  No.  00-22,
"Accounting  for  'Points'  and  Certain  Other Time-Based or Volume-Based Sales
Incentive  Offers,  and  Offers for Free Products or Services to Be Delivered in
the Future," and EITF Issue No. 00-25, "Vendor Income Statement Characterization
of  Consideration  Paid  to a Reseller of the Vendor's Products."  EITF No. 01-9
addresses  the  recognition,  measurement and income statement classification of
consideration  given by a vendor to a customer (including both a reseller of the
vendor's  products  and  an  entity  that purchases the vendor's products from a
reseller).   EITF  No.  01-9,  among   other  things,  requires   that   certain
consideration given by a vendor to a customer be characterized as a reduction of
revenue when recognized in the vendor's income statement.  Prior to its adoption
of  EITF  No.  01-9  effective March 1, 2002, the Company reported such costs as
selling,  general and administrative expenses.  As a result of adopting EITF No.
01-9,  the  Company restated the amounts originally reported for net sales, cost
of  product  sold, and selling, general and administrative expenses for the year
ended  February  28,  2002.  Net  sales  were reduced by $213.8 million; cost of
product  sold  was  increased   by  $10.1  million;  and  selling,  general  and
administrative  expenses  were reduced by $223.9 million.  This reclassification
did  not  affect  operating  income  or  net  income.

3.   ACQUISITIONS:

     TURNER ROAD VINTNERS ASSETS ACQUISITION -
     On  March  5,  2001,  in an asset acquisition, the Company acquired several
well-known  premium  wine brands, including Vendange, Nathanson Creek, Heritage,
and  Talus, working capital (primarily inventories), two wineries in California,
and  other  related  assets  from  Sebastiani Vineyards, Inc. and Tuolomne River
Vintners  Group  (the "Turner Road Vintners Assets").  The purchase price of the
Turner  Road  Vintners  Assets,  including  direct acquisition costs, was $279.4
million.  In  addition,  the  Company assumed indebtedness of $9.4 million.  The
acquisition  was  financed  by  the  proceeds from the sale of the February 2001
Senior  Notes  (as  defined  in Note 10) and revolving loan borrowings under the
senior  credit  facility.  The  Turner  Road  Vintners  Assets  acquisition  was
accounted  for  using  the purchase method; accordingly, the acquired net assets
were  recorded  at  fair  value  at  the date of acquisition.  The excess of the
purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired (goodwill), $146.2
million,  is  no  longer  being amortized, but is tested for impairment at least
annually  in  accordance  with  the  provisions of SFAS No. 142.  The results of
operations  of the Turner Road Vintners Assets are reported in the Constellation
Wines  segment  and  have been included in the Consolidated Statements of Income
since  the  date  of  acquisition.

     CORUS ASSETS ACQUISITION -
     On  March  26,  2001, in an asset acquisition, the Company acquired certain
wine  brands,  wineries,  working  capital  (primarily  inventories),  and other
related   assets  from  Corus  Brands,  Inc.  (the  "Corus  Assets").   In  this
acquisition,  the  Company  acquired  several  well-known  premium  wine  brands
primarily sold in the northwestern United States, including Covey Run, Columbia,
Ste.  Chapelle  and  Alice  White.  The  purchase  price  of  the  Corus Assets,
including  direct acquisition costs, was $48.9 million plus an earn-out over six
years  based on the performance of the brands.  In addition, the Company assumed
indebtedness  of $3.0 million.  As of February 29, 2004, the Company has paid an
earn-out in the amount of $3.7 million.  In connection with the transaction, the
Company  also  entered into long-term grape supply agreements with affiliates of
Corus  Brands,  Inc.  covering  more  than  1,000  acres of Washington and Idaho
vineyards.  The  acquisition  was  financed with revolving loan borrowings under
the  senior  credit  facility.  The  Corus  Assets acquisition was accounted for
using the purchase method; accordingly, the acquired net assets were recorded at
fair  value  at  the date of acquisition.  The excess of the purchase price over
the  fair  value  of  the  net  assets acquired (goodwill), $48.5 million, is no
longer  being  amortized,  but  is  tested  for  impairment at least annually in
accordance  with  the  provisions of SFAS No. 142.  The results of operations of
the  Corus  Assets are reported in the Constellation Wines segment and have been
included in the Consolidated Statements of Income since the date of acquisition.

     RAVENSWOOD ACQUISITION -
     On  July 2, 2001, the Company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock
of  Ravenswood  Winery,  Inc.  (the  "Ravenswood  Acquisition").  The Ravenswood
business  produces, markets and sells super-premium and ultra-premium California
wine,  primarily  under  the  Ravenswood  brand name.  The purchase price of the
Ravenswood  Acquisition, including direct acquisition costs, was $149.7 million.
In  addition,  the  Company  assumed indebtedness of $2.8 million.  The purchase
price  was  financed  with  revolving  loan  borrowings  under the senior credit
facility.  The  Ravenswood  Acquisition  was  accounted  for  using the purchase
method;  accordingly, the acquired net assets were recorded at fair value at the
date  of  acquisition.  The  excess of the purchase price over the fair value of
the  net  assets  acquired  (goodwill), $99.8 million, is not amortizable and is
tested  for  impairment  at  least annually in accordance with the provisions of
SFAS  No.  142.  The  Ravenswood  Acquisition  was consistent with the Company's
strategy of further penetrating the higher gross profit margin super-premium and
ultra-premium  wine  categories.  The  results  of  operations of the Ravenswood
business  are reported in the Constellation Wines segment and have been included
in  the  Consolidated  Statements  of  Income  since  the  date  of acquisition.

     The  following  table summarizes the fair values of the assets acquired and
liabilities  assumed  in the Ravenswood Acquisition at July 2, 2001, as adjusted
for  the  final  appraisal:

                 (in thousands)
                 Current assets                    $    34,396

                                                   ===========

     The  trademarks  are  not subject to amortization.  None of the goodwill is
expected  to  be  deductible  for  tax  purposes.

     HARDY ACQUISITION -
     On  March  27, 2003, the Company acquired control of BRL Hardy Limited, now
known as Hardy Wine Company Limited ("Hardy"), and on April 9, 2003, the Company
completed  its  acquisition  of  all  of Hardy's outstanding capital stock. As a
result  of the acquisition of Hardy, the Company also acquired the remaining 50%
ownership  of  Pacific  Wine Partners LLC ("PWP"), the joint venture the Company
established  with  Hardy  in  July 2001. The acquisition of Hardy along with the
remaining  interest  in  PWP is referred to together as the "Hardy Acquisition."
Through this acquisition, the Company acquired Australia's largest wine producer
with  interests  in  wineries  and  vineyards  in most of Australia's major wine
regions  as  well  as  New Zealand and the United States. In addition, Hardy has
significant  marketing  and  sales  operations  in  the  United  Kingdom.

     Total  consideration  paid  in  cash  and Class A Common Stock to the Hardy
shareholders  was  $1,137.4  million.  Additionally, the Company recorded direct
acquisition  costs  of  $17.7  million.  The  acquisition  date  for  accounting
purposes  is  March 27, 2003.  The Company has recorded a $1.6 million reduction
in  the  purchase  price  to  reflect  imputed  interest  between the accounting
acquisition  date  and  the  final  payment  of  consideration.  This  charge is
included  as  interest  expense  in the Consolidated Statement of Income for the
year  ended  February  29, 2004.  The cash portion of the purchase price paid to
the  Hardy  shareholders  and optionholders ($1,060.2 million) was financed with
$660.2 million of borrowings under the Company's March 2003 Credit Agreement (as
defined  in Note 10) and $400.0 million of borrowings under the Company's Bridge
Agreement  (as  defined in Note 10).  Additionally, the Company issued 3,288,913
shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock, which were valued at $77.2 million
based on the simple average of the closing market price of the Company's Class A
Common  Stock beginning two days before and ending two days after April 4, 2003,
the  day the Hardy shareholders elected the form of consideration they wished to
receive.  The  purchase  price  was  based  primarily  on a discounted cash flow
analysis  that  contemplated,  among  other  things,  the  value  of  a  broader
geographic distribution in strategic international markets and a presence in the
important  Australian  winemaking  regions.   The   Company   and   Hardy   have
complementary  businesses  that  share a common growth orientation and operating
philosophy.  The Hardy Acquisition supports the Company's strategy of growth and
breadth  across  categories  and  geographies,  and  strengthens its competitive
position  in  its  core markets.  The purchase price and resulting goodwill were
primarily based on the growth opportunities of the brand portfolio of Hardy.  In
particular,  the  Company believes there are growth opportunities for Australian
wines  in  the  United  Kingdom,  United  States  and  other wine markets.  This
acquisition  supports  the  Company's  strategy  of driving long-term growth and
positions  the  Company to capitalize on the growth opportunities in "new world"
wine  markets.

     The  results  of  operations  of  Hardy  and  PWP   are  reported  in   the
Constellation  Wines  segment  and   have  been  included  in  the  Consolidated
Statements  of  Income  since  the  accounting  acquisition  date.

     The  following  table  summarizes  the  estimated  fair values of the Hardy
Acquisition  assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition.
The  purchase  price  allocation period ended on March 27, 2004, and the Company
will  record  final  adjustments to the valuation of certain assets in the first
quarter of fiscal 2005; however, these adjustments are not material. The Company
is in the process of finalizing the tax bases of assets acquired and liabilities
assumed.  Accordingly,  deferred  tax  assets   and  deferred   tax  liabilities
associated  with  temporary  differences  may be subject to further adjustments.
Estimated  fair  values  at  March  27,  2003,  are  as  follows:

                 (in thousands)
                 Current assets                    $   535,374

     The trademarks  are  not subject to amortization.   None of the goodwill is
expected  to  be  deductible  for  tax  purposes.

     The  following  table  sets  forth  the  unaudited  pro  forma  results  of
operations  of  the  Company for the years ended February 29, 2004, and February
28,  2003,  respectively.  The  unaudited  pro  forma results of operations give
effect  to  the  Hardy  Acquisition  as  if  it  occurred  on March 1, 2002. The
unaudited  pro  forma results of operations are presented after giving effect to
certain  adjustments for depreciation, amortization of deferred financing costs,
interest  expense  on  the acquisition financing and related income tax effects.
The unaudited pro forma results of operations are based upon currently available
information  and  certain  assumptions  that the Company believes are reasonable
under  the  circumstances. The unaudited pro forma results of operations for the
year  ended  February 28, 2003, do not reflect total pretax nonrecurring charges
of  $30.3  million  ($0.23  per share on a diluted basis) related to transaction
costs,  primarily for the payment of stock options, which were incurred by Hardy
prior  to  the  acquisition, partially offset by the one-time tax benefit from a
change  in Australian tax consolidation rules effective January 1, 2003, related
to acquisition basis adjustments to fair value of $10.6 million ($0.11 per share
on  a  diluted  basis).  The  unaudited  pro  forma results of operations do not
purport  to present what the Company's results of operations would actually have
been  if the aforementioned transactions had in fact occurred on such date or at
the  beginning  of  the  period  indicated,  nor  do  they project the Company's
financial position or results of operations at any future date or for any future
period.




4.   PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT:

     The major components of property, plant and equipment are as follows:



5.   GOODWILL:

     As  discussed  in Note 1, effective March 1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS
No.  142.   The  following  table  presents  earnings  and  earnings  per  share
information  for the comparative periods as if Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards  No.  141   ("SFAS  No.  141"),   "Business  Combinations,"   and  the
nonamortization  provisions  of SFAS No. 142 had been applied beginning March 1,
2001:



     The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the year ended  February
29, 2004, are as follows:



     The  Constellation  Wines   purchase  accounting  allocations  of  goodwill
totaling $650.1 million consist of $615.3 million of goodwill resulting from the
Hardy  Acquisition, $33.4 million of goodwill previously included as part of the
Company's  investment  in  PWP,  and  $1.4 million of goodwill resulting from an
immaterial  business  acquisition.

6.   INTANGIBLE ASSETS:

     The major components of intangible assets are:



     The  difference  between  the gross carrying amount and net carrying amount
for   each   item   presented  is  attributable  to   accumulated  amortization.
Amortization  expense  for  intangible assets was $2.6 million, $2.2 million and
$13.4 million  for  the  years  ended  February 29, 2004, February 28, 2003, and
February  28, 2002, respectively. Estimated amortization expense for each of the
five  succeeding  fiscal  years  is  as  follows:

                          (in thousands)
                          2005            $  2,823
                          2006            $  1,318
                          2007            $    341
                          2008            $     25
                          2009            $     12

7.   OTHER ASSETS:

     The major components of other assets are as follows:



     The  Company's  investment in marketable equity securities is classified as
an available-for-sale security. As such, gross unrealized losses of $0.6 million
are  included,  net  of  applicable income taxes, within AOCI as of February 29,
2004.  The  Company  uses  the average cost method as its basis on which cost is
determined  in  computing  realized  gains or losses. Realized gains on sales of
securities  during  the  year  ended  February  29,  2004,  are  immaterial.

     Amortization  expense for other assets was included in selling, general and
administrative expenses and was $19.3 million, $3.7 million and $4.0 million for
the  years  ended  February  29, 2004, February 28, 2003, and February 28, 2002,
respectively.  Amortization  expense  for  the  year  ended  February  29, 2004,
includes  $7.9  million  related to amortization of the deferred financing costs
associated  with  the  Bridge Loans (as defined in Note 10).  As of February 29,
2004,  the  deferred  financing costs associated with the Bridge Loans have been
fully  amortized.

8.   INVESTMENT IN JOINT VENTURE:

     On  March  27, 2003, as part of the Hardy Acquisition, the Company acquired
the  remaining  50% ownership of PWP, the joint venture formed on July 31, 2001,
which was previously owned equally by the Company and Hardy.  Prior to March 27,
2003, the Company's investment was accounted for under the equity method.  Since
the  Hardy  Acquisition, PWP has become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company
and  its results of operations have been included in the Consolidated Statements
of  Income  since  March  27,  2003.

     In addition, in connection with the Hardy Acquisition, the Company acquired
several  investments which are being accounted for under the equity method.  The
majority  of  these investments consist of 50% owned joint venture arrangements.
As  of  February  29,  2004,  the  Company's  investment balance in these equity
investments  was  $8.4  million.

9.   OTHER ACCRUED EXPENSES AND LIABILITIES:

     The  major  components  of  other  accrued  expenses and liabilities are as
follows:



10.  BORROWINGS:

     Borrowings consist of the following:



     SENIOR CREDIT FACILITY -
     In connection with the Hardy Acquisition, on January 16, 2003, the Company,
certain  subsidiaries  of  the  Company,  JPMorgan  Chase  Bank, as a lender and
administrative  agent  (the  "Administrative  Agent"), and certain other lenders
entered  into a new credit agreement (as subsequently amended and restated as of
March 19, 2003, the "March 2003 Credit Agreement"). In October 2003, the Company
entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the "October Credit
Agreement") that (i) refinanced the then outstanding principal balance under the
Tranche B Term Loan facility on essentially the same terms as the Tranche B Term
Loan  facility  under the March 2003 Credit Agreement, but at a lower Applicable
Rate  (as  such  term  is  defined  in  the  October  Credit Agreement) and (ii)
otherwise restated the terms of the March 2003 Credit Agreement, as amended. The
October  Credit  Agreement was further amended during February 2004 (the "Credit
Agreement").  The  March  2003  Credit  Agreement  provided for aggregate credit
facilities  of  $1.6  billion consisting of a $400.0 million Tranche A Term Loan
facility  due  in  February 2008, an $800.0 million Tranche B Term Loan facility
due  in  November 2008 and a $400.0 million Revolving Credit facility (including
an  Australian  Dollar  revolving  sub-facility  of  up  to A$10.0 million and a
sub-facility  for  letters  of  credit  of up to $40.0 million) which expires on
February  29, 2008. Proceeds of the March 2003 Credit Agreement were used to pay
off  the Company's obligations under its prior senior credit facility, to fund a
portion  of  the  cash  required to pay the former Hardy shareholders and to pay
indebtedness outstanding under certain of Hardy's credit facilities. The Company
uses  the  remaining availability under the Credit Agreement to fund its working
capital  needs  on  an  on-going  basis.

     The  Tranche A Term Loan facility and the Tranche B Term Loan facility were
fully  drawn  on  March  27, 2003. As of February 29, 2004, the Company has made
$40.0  million  of  scheduled  and  required payments on the Tranche A Term Loan
facility.  In August 2003, the Company paid $100.0 million of the Tranche B Term
Loan facility. In October 2003, the Company paid an additional $200.0 million of
the  Tranche  B Term Loan facility. As of February 29, 2004, the required annual
repayments  of  the  Tranche  A  Term  Loan  and  the Tranche B Term Loan are as
follows:



     The  rate  of  interest  payable, at the Company's option, is a function of
LIBOR  plus  a  margin,  the federal funds rate plus a margin, or the prime rate
plus a margin.  The margin is adjustable based upon the Company's Debt Ratio (as
defined  in  the Credit Agreement) and, with respect to LIBOR borrowings, ranges
between  1.50%  and  2.50%.  As  of  February 29, 2004, the LIBOR margin for the
Revolving  Credit  facility and the Tranche A Term Loan facility is 1.75%, while
the  LIBOR  margin  on  the  Tranche  B  Term  Loan  facility  is  2.00%.

     The  Company's  obligations  are  guaranteed by certain subsidiaries of the
Company  ("Guarantors") and the Company is obligated to pledge collateral of (i)
100% of the capital stock of all of the Company's U.S. subsidiaries and (ii) 65%
of  the  voting  capital  stock  of certain foreign subsidiaries of the Company.

     The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to customary lending covenants
including  those  restricting  additional  liens,  the  incurrence of additional
indebtedness  (including  guarantees  of  indebtedness), the sale of assets, the
payment  of  dividends,  transactions  with affiliates and the making of certain
investments, in each case subject to baskets, exceptions and/or thresholds. As a
result  of  the  prepayment  of  the  Bridge  Loans  (as defined below) with the
proceeds  from  the  2003  Equity Offerings (see Note 16), the requirement under
certain  circumstances  for  the  Company  and  the Guarantors to pledge certain
assets  consisting  of,  among  other things, inventory, accounts receivable and
trademarks  to  secure  the  obligations  under  the Credit Agreement, ceased to
apply.  The  primary  financial  covenants  require  the  maintenance  of a debt
coverage  ratio,  a  senior  debt  coverage  ratio,  a fixed charge ratio and an
interest  coverage ratio.  As of February 29, 2004, the Company is in compliance
with  all  of  its  covenants  under  its  Credit  Agreement.

     As  of  February  29,  2004,  under  the  Credit Agreement, the Company had
outstanding  Tranche  A  Term Loans of $360.0 million bearing a weighted average
interest rate of 2.9%, Tranche B Term Loans of $500.0 million bearing a weighted
average  interest  rate  of  3.2%,  undrawn revolving letters of credit of $18.6
million,  and  $381.4  million  in revolving loans available to be drawn.  There
were  no  outstanding  revolving loans under the Credit Agreement as of February
29,  2004.

     BRIDGE FACILITY -
     On  January  16,  2003,  the  Company, certain subsidiaries of the Company,
JPMorgan  Chase  Bank,  as  a lender and Administrative Agent, and certain other
lenders  (such  other  lenders,  together  with  the  Administrative  Agent, are
collectively  referred  to herein as the "Bridge Lenders") entered into a bridge
loan  agreement  which was amended and restated as of March 26, 2003, containing
commitments  of  the Bridge Lenders to make bridge loans (the "Bridge Loans") of
up  to,  in the aggregate, $450.0 million (the "Bridge Agreement").  On April 9,
2003,  the  Company used $400.0 million of the Bridge Loans to fund a portion of
the  cash  required to pay the former Hardy shareholders.  On July 30, 2003, the
Company  used  proceeds  from  the  2003  Equity  Offerings to prepay the $400.0
million  Bridge  Loans  in  their  entirety.

     SUBSIDIARY FACILITIES -
     The  Company  has additional line of credit arrangements available totaling
$91.5  million and $44.5 million as of February 29, 2004, and February 28, 2003,
respectively.  These  lines  support  the  borrowing  needs  of  certain  of the
Company's foreign subsidiary operations. Interest rates and other terms of these
borrowings  vary  from country to country, depending on local market conditions.
As  of  February  29, 2004, and February 28, 2003, amounts outstanding under the
subsidiary  revolving  credit  facilities  were  $1.8  million and $0.6 million,
respectively.

     SENIOR NOTES -
     On  August  4,  1999, the Company issued $200.0 million aggregate principal
amount  of 8 5/8% Senior Notes due August 2006 (the "August 1999 Senior Notes").
Interest  on  the August 1999 Senior Notes is payable semiannually on February 1
and  August  1.  As  of  February  29,  2004, the Company had outstanding $200.0
million  aggregate  principal  amount  of  August  1999  Senior  Notes.

     On  November  17,  1999,  the  Company  issued (pound) 75.0 million ($121.7
million  upon  issuance)  aggregate  principal amount of 8 1/2% Senior Notes due
November  2009  (the  "Sterling  Senior Notes"). Interest on the Sterling Senior
Notes  is  payable  semiannually  on  May 15 and November 15. In March 2000, the
Company  exchanged  (pound)  75.0  million  aggregate principal amount of 8 1/2%
Series  B  Senior  Notes  due  in  November  2009 (the "Sterling Series B Senior
Notes") for all of the Sterling Senior Notes. The terms of the Sterling Series B
Senior  Notes  are  identical  in  all  material respects to the Sterling Senior
Notes.  In  October  2000,  the Company exchanged (pound) 74.0 million aggregate
principal  amount  of  Sterling  Series  C  Senior  Notes (as defined below) for

50  basis  points.  The  senior  notes are unsecured senior obligations and rank
equally  in  right  of  payment  to  all  existing  and  future unsecured senior
indebtedness  of  the  Company.  Certain  of the Company's significant operating
subsidiaries  guarantee  the  senior  notes,  on  a  senior  basis.

     SENIOR SUBORDINATED NOTES -
     On  March  4,  1999,  the Company issued $200.0 million aggregate principal

aggregate  principal  amount of Senior Subordinated Notes. On February 10, 2004,
the Company issued a Notice of Redemption for its Senior Subordinated Notes. The

by  a  rolling  four  quarter  fixed charge ratio requiring a specified minimum.

     DEBT PAYMENTS -
     Principal  payments  required  under  long-term debt obligations (excluding
unamortized  discount  of  $0.5  million)  during the next five fiscal years and
thereafter  are  as  follows:

                                         ===========

     GUARANTEES -
     A  foreign subsidiary of the Company has guaranteed debt of a joint venture
in the maximum amount of $4.2 million as of February 29, 2004. The liability for
this guarantee is not material and the Company does not have any collateral from
this  entity.

11.  INCOME TAXES:

     Income before income taxes was generated as follows:



     The income tax provision consisted of the following:



     The foreign provision for income taxes is based on foreign pretax earnings.
Earnings  of  foreign  subsidiaries  would be subject to U.S. income taxation on
repatriation  to the U.S.  The Company's consolidated financial statements fully
provide  for  any  related  tax  liability  on  amounts that may be repatriated.

     Deferred  tax  assets and liabilities reflect the future income tax effects
of  temporary  differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying
amounts  of  existing  assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and
are  measured  using  enacted  tax  rates  that  apply  to  taxable  income.


     Significant  components of deferred tax assets (liabilities) consist of the
following:



     In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers
whether  it  is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets
will  not  be  realized.  Management  considers  the  reversal  of  deferred tax
liabilities  and  projected  future  taxable  income  in making this assessment.
Based  upon this assessment, management believes it is more likely than not that
the  Company  will  realize the benefits of these deductible differences, net of
any  valuation  allowances.

     Operating  loss  carryforwards totaling $47.7 million at February 29, 2004,
are  being  carried  forward in a number of U.S. and foreign jurisdictions where
the  Company  is  permitted  to  use  tax operating losses from prior periods to
reduce  future  taxable  income.  Of  these  operating  loss carryforwards, $6.6
million  will  expire  in  2019  and  $41.1  million   may  be  carried  forward
indefinitely.  In  addition,  certain  tax credits generated of $8.6 million are
available to future income taxes. These credits will expire, if not utilized, in
2007  through  2009.

     The  Company  is  subject  to  ongoing  tax examinations and assessments in
various  jurisdictions.  Accordingly,  the  Company  provides for additional tax
expense  based  on  probable  outcomes  of  such  matters.  The Internal Revenue
Service  is  currently  examining  tax  returns for the years ended February 29,
2000,  February 28, 2001, February 28, 2002, and February 28, 2003.  While it is
often  difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any
particular  tax  matter,  the Company believes the reserves reflect the probable
outcome  of  known  tax contingencies.  Unfavorable settlement of any particular
issue  would require use of cash.  Favorable resolution would be recognized as a
reduction  to  the  effective  tax  rate  in  the  year  of  resolution.

     A  reconciliation  of  the  total  tax  provision to the amount computed by
applying  the  statutory U.S. Federal income tax rate to income before provision
for  income  taxes  is  as  follows:



     The  effect  of  earnings  of  foreign subsidiaries includes the difference
between the U.S. statutory rate and local jurisdiction tax rates, as well as the
provision  for  incremental  U.S.  taxes   on  unremitted  earnings  of  foreign
subsidiaries  offset  by  foreign  tax  credits  and  other foreign adjustments.

12.  OTHER LIABILITIES:

     The major components of other liabilities are as follows:



13.  PROFIT SHARING AND RETIREMENT SAVINGS PLANS:

     The Company's retirement and profit sharing plan, the Constellation Brands,
Inc.  401(k) and Profit Sharing Plan (the "Plan"), covers substantially all U.S.
employees,  excluding   those  employees   covered  by   collective   bargaining
agreements. The 401(k) portion of the Plan permits eligible employees to defer a
portion  of  their  compensation  (as  defined  in  the Plan) on a pretax basis.
Participants  may defer up to 50% of their compensation for the year, subject to
limitations of the Plan. The Company makes a matching contribution of 50% of the
first  6%  of  compensation  a  participant  defers. The amount of the Company's
contribution  under  the  profit  sharing portion of the Plan is a discretionary
amount  as  determined  by the Board of Directors on an annual basis, subject to
limitations  of  the  Plan.  Company  contributions  under  the  Plan were $10.8
million, $10.9 million, and $10.5 million for the years ended February 29, 2004,
February  28,  2003,  and  February  28,  2002,  respectively.

     During  the  year  ended  February  29,  2004, in connection with the Hardy
Acquisition,  the  Company acquired the BRL Hardy Superannuation Fund (now known
as  the  Hardy Wine Company Superannuation Plan) (the "Hardy Plan") which covers
substantially  all  salaried  Australian employees. The Hardy Plan has a defined
benefit  component  and a defined contribution component. The Company also has a
statutory  obligation to provide a minimum defined contribution on behalf of any
Australian  employees  who  are  not  covered by the Hardy Plan. Additionally in
Fiscal  2004,  the  Company  instituted  a defined contribution plan that covers
substantially all of its U.K. employees. Company contributions under the defined
contribution  component  of the Hardy Plan, the Australian statutory obligation,
and  the  U.K.  defined  contribution  plan aggregated $6.5 million for the year
ended  February  29,  2004.

     The  Company  also  has defined benefit pension plans that cover certain of
its  non-U.S.  employees. These consist of a Canadian plan, an U.K. plan and the
defined  benefit component of the Hardy Plan. During the year ended February 29,
2004,  the  Company  ceased  future accruals for active employees under its U.K.
plan.  There  were  no curtailment charges arising from this event. Net periodic
benefit  cost  (income)  reported  in  the Consolidated Statements of Income for
these  plans  includes  the  following  components:



     The  following  table summarizes the funded status of the Company's defined
benefit  pension  plans  and  the  related  amounts included in the Consolidated
Balance Sheets:



     As  of  February  29,  2004, and February 28, 2003, the accumulated benefit
obligation  for  all defined benefit pension plans was $290.3 million and $212.2
million,  respectively.  The  following  table  summarizes the projected benefit
obligation,  accumulated  benefit  obligation  and fair value of plan assets for
those  pension  plans  with  an accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan
assets:



     The  increase  in  minimum pension liability included in AOCI for the years
ended  February  29,  2004,  and February 28, 2003, were $15.6 million and $42.5
million,  respectively.

     The  following  table  sets  forth the weighted average assumptions used in
developing  the  net  periodic  pension expense for the years ended February 29,
2004,  and  February  28,  2003:



     The  following  table  sets  forth the weighted average assumptions used in
developing  the  benefit  obligation  as  of February 29, 2004, and February 28,
2003:



14.  POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS:

     The  Company  currently  sponsors  multiple unfunded postretirement benefit
plans  for  certain  of  its  Constellation Beers and Spirits segment employees.
During  Fiscal  2004, an amendment to one of the unfunded postretirement benefit
plans modifying the eligibility requirements and retiree contributions decreased
the  postretirement  benefit  obligation  by  $0.6  million.

     The status of the plans is as follows:



     Net periodic benefit cost reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income
includes  the  following  components:



     The  following  table  sets  forth the weighted average assumptions used in
developing  the  benefit  obligation  as  of February 29, 2004, and February 28,
2003:



     The  following  table  sets  forth the weighted average assumptions used in
developing  the  net  periodic  non-pension postretirement expense for the years
ended  February  29,  2004,  and  February  28,  2003:



     The  following table sets forth the assumed health care cost trend rates as
of  February  29,  2004,  and  February  28,  2003:



     Assumed  health  care  trend  rates  could have a significant effect on the
amount  reported  for health care plans.  A one percent change in assumed health
care  cost  trend  rates  would  have  the  following  effects:



15.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES:

     OPERATING LEASES -
     Step  rent  provisions, escalation clauses, capital improvement funding and
other  lease  concessions,  when present in the Company's leases, are taken into
account in computing the minimum lease payments.  The minimum lease payments for
the  Company's operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the
minimum lease term.  Future payments under noncancelable operating leases having
initial  or  remaining  terms of one year or more are as follows during the next
five  fiscal  years  and  thereafter:

                           (in thousands)
                           2005            $  39,155

                                           =========

     Rental  expense  was  $38.7  million,  $25.3 million, and $24.0 million for
Fiscal 2004, Fiscal 2003, and Fiscal 2002, respectively.

     PURCHASE COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES -
     The  Company  has  agreements with suppliers to purchase various spirits of
which  certain agreements are denominated in British pound sterling and Canadian
dollars.  The  maximum  future  obligation  under  these  agreements, based upon
exchange  rates  at  February  29,  2004,  aggregate $20.3 million for contracts
expiring  through  December  2007.

     All  of the Company's imported beer products are marketed and sold pursuant
to  exclusive distribution agreements from the suppliers of these products.  The
Company's agreement to distribute Corona Extra and its other Mexican beer brands
exclusively  throughout  25  primarily  western  U.S. states expires in December
2006,  with  automatic five year renewals thereafter, subject to compliance with
certain performance criteria and other terms under the agreement.  The remaining
agreements  expire  through  December  2008.  Prior  to  their expiration, these
agreements  may  be  terminated if the Company fails to meet certain performance
criteria.  At  February  29, 2004, the Company believes it is in compliance with
all  of  its material distribution agreements and, given the Company's long-term
relationships  with  its  suppliers,  the  Company  does  not believe that these
agreements  will  be  terminated.

     In  connection  with  previous  acquisitions  as  well  as  with  the Hardy
Acquisition,  the  Company  has  assumed  grape  purchase contracts with certain
growers  and  suppliers.  In  addition, the Company has entered into other grape
purchase  contracts  with  various growers and suppliers in the normal course of
business.  Under  the  grape  purchase  contracts,  the  Company is committed to
purchase  all  grape  production  yielded from a specified number of acres for a
period  of  time  from  one  to  fifteen years.  The actual tonnage and price of
grapes  that  must  be purchased by the Company will vary each year depending on
certain  factors,  including weather, time of harvest, overall market conditions
and  the  agricultural practices and location of the growers and suppliers under
contract.  The  Company  purchased  $284.0  million and $166.6 million of grapes
under  contracts  during  Fiscal  2004  and Fiscal 2003, respectively.  Based on
current production yields and published grape prices, the Company estimates that
the  aggregate  purchases  under these contracts over the remaining terms of the
contracts  will  be  $2,131.3  million.

     In  connection  with the Turner Road Vintners Assets acquisition, the Corus
Assets  acquisition and the Hardy Acquisition, the Company established a reserve
for  the  estimated  loss  on  firm  purchase commitments assumed at the time of
acquisition.  As  of February 29, 2004, the remaining balance on this reserve is
$123.6  million.

     The Company's aggregate obligations under bulk wine purchase contracts will
be  $78.9 million over the remaining terms of the contracts which extend through
fiscal 2008.

     In  connection  with  the  Hardy  Acquisition,  the Company assumed certain
processing  contracts  which  commits the Company to utilize outside services to
process  and/or  package  a  minimum  volume quantity.  In addition, the Company
entered into a new processing contract in Fiscal 2004 utilizing outside services
to  process  a  minimum  volume  of  brandy at prices which are dependent on the
processing  ingredients  provided  by  the  Company.   The  Company's  aggregate
obligations  under  these  processing  contracts  will be $67.5 million over the
remaining  terms  of  the  contracts  which  extend  through  December  2014.

     EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS -
     The Company has employment contracts with certain of its executive officers
and  certain  other management personnel with automatic one year renewals unless
terminated  by  either party.  These agreements provide for minimum salaries, as
adjusted  for  annual  increases,  and  may include incentive bonuses based upon
attainment of specified management goals.  In addition, these agreements provide
for  severance payments in the event of specified termination of employment.  As
of  February  29,  2004,  the  aggregate  commitment for future compensation and
severance,  excluding  incentive  bonuses,  was  $8.0 million, none of which was
accruable  at  that  date.

     EMPLOYEES COVERED BY COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS -
     Approximately  31.2%  of  the  Company's full-time employees are covered by
collective  bargaining  agreements  at  February  29, 2004.  Agreements expiring
within  one year cover approximately 11.9% of the Company's full-time employees.

     LEGAL MATTERS -
     In  the  course  of its business, the Company is subject to litigation from
time  to  time.  Although  the  amount  of  any  liability  with respect to such
litigation  cannot  be  determined,  in the opinion of management such liability
will  not  have  a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition,
results  of  operations  or  cash  flows.

16.  STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY:

     COMMON STOCK -
     The Company has two classes of common stock: Class A Common Stock and Class
B  Convertible  Common  Stock.  Class  B  Convertible  Common  Stock  shares are
convertible  into  shares  of  Class A Common Stock on a one-to-one basis at any
time  at  the  option of the holder. Holders of Class B Convertible Common Stock
are  entitled  to  ten  votes  per  share.  Holders  of Class A Common Stock are
entitled  to one vote per share and a cash dividend premium. If the Company pays
a  cash  dividend  on  Class  B  Convertible Common Stock, each share of Class A
Common Stock will receive an amount at least ten percent greater than the amount
of  the  cash  dividend  per  share paid on Class B Convertible Common Stock. In
addition,  the  Board  of  Directors  may  declare and pay a dividend on Class A
Common  Stock  without  paying any dividend on Class B Convertible Common Stock.
However, under the terms of the Company's senior credit facility, the Company is
currently  constrained  from  paying  cash  dividends  on  its  common stock. In
addition,  the  indentures for the Company's outstanding senior notes and senior
subordinated  notes  may  restrict  the  payment of cash dividends on its common
stock  under  certain  circumstances.

     In  July  2002, the stockholders of the Company approved an increase in the
number  of  authorized shares of Class A Common Stock from 120,000,000 shares to
275,000,000  shares  and Class B Convertible Common Stock from 20,000,000 shares
to  30,000,000  shares,  thereby  increasing  the aggregate number of authorized
shares  of  the  Company  to  306,000,000  shares.

     At  February 29, 2004, there were 94,566,611 shares of Class A Common Stock
and  12,061,730  shares  of Class B Convertible Common Stock outstanding, net of
treasury  stock.

     STOCK REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION -
     In June 1998, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of
up  to $100.0 million of its Class A Common Stock and Class B Convertible Common
Stock.  The  Company  may  finance  such  purchases,  which will become treasury
shares,  through  cash  generated  from  operations or through the senior credit
facility.  No shares were repurchased during Fiscal 2004, Fiscal 2003 and Fiscal
2002.

     PREFERRED STOCK -
     In  Fiscal  2004,  the  Company issued 5.75% Series A Mandatory Convertible
Preferred  Stock  ("Preferred Stock") (see "Equity Offerings" discussion below).
Dividends  are cumulative and payable quarterly, if declared, in cash, shares of
the  Company's Class A Common Stock, or a combination thereof, at the discretion
of  the  Company.  Dividends are payable, if declared, on the first business day
of  March, June, September, and December of each year, commencing on December 1,
2003.  On  September  1,  2006,  the  automatic  conversion  date, each share of
Preferred   Stock   will   automatically  convert  into,   subject   to  certain
anti-dilution  adjustments,  between  29.276  and 35.716 shares of the Company's
Class  A  Common  Stock,  depending  on  the then applicable market price of the
Company's  Class  A  Common  Stock,  in  accordance  with  the  following table:

           Applicable market price               Conversion rate
           -----------------------               ---------------
           Less than or equal to $28.00          35.716 shares
           Between $28.00 and $34.16             35.716 to 29.276 shares
           Equal to or greater than $34.16       29.276 shares

The  applicable market price is the average of  the closing prices per share  of
the Company's  Class A Common Stock  on each of the 20  consecutive trading days
ending  on the third trading day immediately preceding the applicable conversion
date.  At any time prior to September 1, 2006, holders may elect to convert each
share  of  Preferred  Stock,  subject to certain anti-dilution adjustments, into
29.276 shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock. If the closing market price
of  the  Company's  Class  A Common Stock exceeds $51.24 for at least 20 trading
days  within  a  period  of  30 consecutive trading days, the Company may elect,
subject  to  certain  limitations  and  anti-dilution  adjustments, to cause the
conversion  of  all,  but  not  less than all, of the then outstanding shares of
Preferred  Stock  into  shares  of  the  Company's  Class  A  Common  Stock at a
conversion rate of 29.276 shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock. In order
for  the  Company  to  cause  the  early  conversion of the Preferred Stock, the
Company must pay all accrued and unpaid dividends on the Preferred Stock as well
as  the  present  value of all remaining dividend payments through and including
September  1, 2006. If the Company is involved in a merger in which at least 30%
of the consideration for all or any class of the Company's common stock consists
of  cash  or  cash  equivalents,  then on or after the date of such merger, each
holder  will  have  the  right to convert each share of Preferred Stock into the
number  of  shares  of  the  Company's  Class  A  Common Stock applicable on the
automatic  conversion date. The Preferred Stock ranks senior in right of payment
to  all of the Company's common stock and has a liquidation preference of $1,000
per  share,  plus  accrued  and  unpaid  dividends.

     As of February 29, 2004, 170,500 shares of Preferred Stock were outstanding
and  $2.5  million  of  dividends  were  accrued.

     EQUITY OFFERINGS -
     During  March  2001,  the  Company completed a public offering of 8,740,000
shares  of  its  Class  A  Common Stock, which was held as treasury stock.  This
resulted  in net proceeds to the Company, after deducting underwriting discounts
and  expenses, of $139.4 million.  The net proceeds were used to repay revolving
loan borrowings under the senior credit facility of which a portion was incurred
to  partially  finance  the  acquisition  of  the  Turner  Road Vintners Assets.

     During  October 2001, the Company sold 645,000 shares of its Class A Common
Stock, which was held as treasury stock, in connection with a public offering of
Class  A  Common  Stock by stockholders of the Company.  The net proceeds to the
Company,  after  deducting underwriting discounts, of $12.1 million were used to
repay  borrowings  under  the  senior  credit  facility.

     During  July  2003,  the  Company  completed a public offering of 9,800,000
shares  of  its  Class  A Common Stock resulting in net proceeds to the Company,
after  deducting  underwriting  discounts  and  expenses,  of $261.1 million. In
addition,  the Company also completed a public offering of 170,500 shares of its
5.75%  Series  A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock resulting in net proceeds
to  the  Company, after deducting underwriting discounts and expenses, of $164.9
million.  The Class A Common Stock offering and the Preferred Stock offering are
referred  to  together  as  the "2003 Equity Offerings." The majority of the net
proceeds from the 2003 Equity Offerings were used to repay the Bridge Loans that
were incurred to partially finance the Hardy Acquisition. The remaining proceeds
were  used  to repay term loan borrowings under the March 2003 Credit Agreement.

     LONG-TERM STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN -
     Under  the  Company's  Long-Term  Stock  Incentive Plan, nonqualified stock
options,  stock  appreciation  rights,  restricted  stock  and other stock-based
awards  may be granted to employees, officers and directors of the Company.  The
aggregate  number  of shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock available for
awards  under the Company's Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan is 28,000,000 shares.
The  exercise  price,  vesting  period  and  term  of nonqualified stock options
granted  are  established   by  the  committee  administering   the   plan  (the
"Committee").  Grants  of  stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and other
stock-based  awards  may  contain  such  vesting,  terms,  conditions  and other
requirements  as  the  Committee may establish.  During Fiscal 2004, Fiscal 2003
and Fiscal 2002, no stock appreciation rights were granted.  No restricted stock
was  granted during Fiscal 2004.  During Fiscal 2003, 7,080 shares of restricted
Class A Common Stock were granted at a weighted average grant date fair value of
$28.41  per  share.  No  restricted  stock  was  granted  during  Fiscal  2002.

     INCENTIVE STOCK OPTION PLAN -
     Under  the  Company's  Incentive Stock Option Plan, incentive stock options
may be granted to employees, including officers, of the Company.  Grants, in the
aggregate,  may  not  exceed  4,000,000  shares  of the Company's Class A Common
Stock.  The  exercise  price  of any incentive stock option may not be less than
the  fair  market  value  of  the  Company's Class A Common Stock on the date of
grant.  The  vesting  period  and  term  of  incentive stock options granted are
established  by  the  Committee.  The maximum term of incentive stock options is
ten  years.

     A  summary  of  stock  option  activity under the Company's Long-Term Stock
Incentive  Plan  and  the  Incentive  Stock  Option  Plan  is  as  follows:



     The  following table summarizes information about stock options outstanding
at  February  29,  2004:



     The  weighted  average  fair  value  of options granted during Fiscal 2004,
Fiscal 2003 and Fiscal 2002 was $9.74, $12.18 and $8.99, respectively.  The fair
value  of  options  is  estimated  on  the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions:  risk-free
interest  rate of 3.2% for Fiscal 2004, 5.0% for Fiscal 2003 and 4.7% for Fiscal
2002;  volatility  of 35.7% for Fiscal 2004, 36.7% for Fiscal 2003 and 41.0% for
Fiscal  2002;  and  expected option life of 6.2 years for Fiscal 2004, 6.0 years
for  Fiscal  2003  and 6.0 years for Fiscal 2002.  The dividend yield was 0% for
Fiscal  2004,  Fiscal  2003 and Fiscal 2002.  Forfeitures are recognized as they
occur.

     Employee stock purchase plans -
     The Company has a stock purchase plan under which 4,500,000 shares of Class
A  Common  Stock may be issued.  Under the terms of the plan, eligible employees
may  purchase  shares  of  the  Company's  Class  A Common Stock through payroll
deductions.  The  purchase price is the lower of 85% of the fair market value of
the  stock on the first or last day of the purchase period.  During Fiscal 2004,
Fiscal  2003 and Fiscal 2002, employees purchased 137,985 shares, 138,304 shares
and  120,674  shares,  respectively.

     The  weighted  average  fair value of purchase rights granted during Fiscal
2004, Fiscal 2003 and Fiscal 2002 was $6.60, $7.02 and $5.59, respectively.  The
fair  value  of  purchase  rights  is  estimated  on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes  option-pricing   model  with   the  following   weighted  average
assumptions:  risk-free  interest  rate of 1.0% for Fiscal 2004, 1.4% for Fiscal
2003  and  2.6%  for Fiscal 2002; volatility of 22.2% for Fiscal 2004, 40.3% for
Fiscal  2003  and 33.2% for Fiscal 2002; and expected purchase right life of 0.5
years  for  Fiscal 2004, Fiscal 2003 and Fiscal 2002.  The dividend yield was 0%
for  Fiscal  2004,  Fiscal  2003  and  Fiscal  2002.

     The  Company  has a stock purchase plan under which 2,000,000 shares of the
Company's Class A Common Stock may be issued to eligible employees and directors
of  the  Company's  United  Kingdom  subsidiaries.  Under the terms of the plan,
participants  may  purchase shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock through
payroll  deductions.  The  purchase price may be no less than 80% of the closing
price  of  the  stock  on  the  day the purchase price is fixed by the committee
administering the plan.  During Fiscal 2004 and Fiscal 2003, employees purchased
27,791  shares  and 758 shares, respectively.  During Fiscal 2002, there were no
shares  purchased  under  this  plan.

     The  weighted  average  fair value of purchase rights granted during Fiscal
2002  was  $6.26.  There  were no purchase rights granted during Fiscal 2004 and
Fiscal 2003. The fair value of purchase rights is estimated on the date of grant
using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average
assumptions  for  Fiscal  2002:  risk-free  interest rate of 4.9%; volatility of
36.2%;  and expected purchase right life of 3.8 years. The dividend yield was 0%
for  Fiscal  2002.

17.  EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE:

     Earnings per common share are as follows:



     Stock  options  to purchase 0.1 million, 1.1 million and 2.2 million shares
of  Class A Common Stock at a weighted average price per share of $31.09, $27.41
and  $20.70  were outstanding during the years ended February 29, 2004, February
28,  2003,  and  February  28,  2002, respectively, but were not included in the
computation  of the diluted earnings per common share because the stock options'
exercise  price  was greater than the average market price of the Class A Common
Stock  for  the  respective  periods.

18.  ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS):

     Accumulated  other  comprehensive  loss,  net  of tax effects, includes the
following  components:




19.  SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS AND CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK:

     Sales  to the five largest customers represented 20.6%, 21.2%, and 19.1% of
the  Company's  sales  for the years ended February 29, 2004, February 28, 2003,
and  February  28,  2002,  respectively.  No single customer was responsible for
greater  than  10%  of  sales  during these years.  Accounts receivable from the
Company's  largest customer, Southern Wine and Spirits, represented 8.3%, 11.4%,
and  10.0%  of  the Company's total accounts receivable as of February 29, 2004,
February  28, 2003, and February 28, 2002, respectively.  Sales to the Company's
five  largest  customers  are  expected  to  continue to represent a significant
portion  of  the Company's revenues.  The Company's arrangements with certain of
its  customers  may, generally, be terminated by either party with prior notice.
The  Company  performs  ongoing  credit  evaluations of its customers' financial
position,  and  management  of  the  Company  is of the opinion that any risk of
significant  loss  is  reduced  due to the diversity of customers and geographic
sales  area.

     The  Company purchases the majority of its glass inventories from a limited
number  of  suppliers.  Glass  bottle costs are one of the largest components of
the  Company's  cost  of  product  sold.  The  glass  bottle  industry is highly
concentrated with only a small number of producers.  The inability of any of the
Company's  glass  bottle  suppliers  to satisfy the Company's requirements could
adversely  affect  the  Company's  operations.

20.  RESTRUCTURING AND RELATED CHARGES:

     For the year ended February 29, 2004, the Company recorded $31.2 million of
restructuring  and related charges associated with the restructuring plan of the
Constellation Wines segment. Restructuring and related charges resulted from (i)
the  realignment  of  business  operations  and  (ii)  the  decision to exit the
commodity  concentrate  product  line in the U.S. and sell its winery located in
Escalon,  California.  In addition, in connection with the Company's decision to
exit  the commodity concentrate product line in the U.S., the Company recorded a
write-down of concentrate inventory of $16.8 million, which was recorded in cost
of  product  sold.  For  the  year ended February 28, 2003, the Company recorded
restructuring  and related charges associated with an asset impairment charge of
$4.8  million in connection with two of Constellation Wines segment's production
facilities  (see Note 1). No restructuring and related charges were recorded for
the  year  ended  February  28,  2002.

     The  retructuring  and  related charges of $31.2 million for the year ended
February  29, 2004, included $6.9 million of employee termination benefit costs,
$17.7  million  of  grape  contract  termination costs, $1.9 million of facility
consolidation  and  relocation costs, and $4.7 million of other related charges,
which  consisted  of a $2.1 million loss on the sale of the Escalon facility and
$2.6  million  of  other  costs  related  to  the  realignment  of  the business
operations  in  the  Constellation  Wines  segment.

     The Company estimates that the completion of the restructuring actions will
include  (i)  a  total  of  $9.9  million  of employee termination benefit costs
through  February  28,  2005,  of  which  $6.9 million has been incurred through
February  29,  2004, (ii) a total of $22.1 million of grape contract termination
costs  through  February  28,  2005,  of  which  $17.7 million has been incurred
through  February  29,  2004,  and  (iii)  a  total  of $4.8 million of facility
consolidation  and  relocation  costs  through  February 28, 2005, of which $1.9
million  has  been  incurred through February 29, 2004. The Company has incurred
other  costs  related to the restructuring plan for the disposal of fixed assets
and other costs of realigning the business operations of the Constellation Wines
segment  and  expects  to  incur  additional  costs  of  realigning the business
operations  of  $1.3  million  during  the  year  ending  February  28,  2005.

     The  following table illustrates the changes in the restructuring liability
balance  since  February  28,  2003:



21.  CONDENSED CONSOLIDATING FINANCIAL INFORMATION:

     The  following  information  sets forth the condensed consolidating balance
sheets  as  of  February  29,  2004,  and  February  28,  2003,   the  condensed
consolidating statements of income and cash flows for each of the three years in
the  period  ended  February  29, 2004, for the Company, the parent company, the
combined  subsidiaries of the Company which guarantee the Company's senior notes
and  senior  subordinated  notes  ("Subsidiary  Guarantors")  and  the  combined
subsidiaries  of  the  Company  which  are  not Subsidiary Guarantors, primarily
Matthew  Clark  and  Hardy  and  their  subsidiaries,  which are included in the
Constellation  Wines  segment   ("Subsidiary  Nonguarantors").   The  Subsidiary
Guarantors  are  wholly  owned and the guarantees are full, unconditional, joint
and several obligations of each of the Subsidiary Guarantors. Separate financial
statements  for  the  Subsidiary  Guarantors  of  the  Company are not presented
because  the  Company has determined that such financial statements would not be
material  to  investors.  The  accounting  policies  of  the parent company, the
Subsidiary  Guarantors  and  the  Subsidiary Nonguarantors are the same as those
described  for  the Company in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in
Note  1 and include recently adopted accounting pronouncements described in Note
2.  There  are  no  restrictions  on the ability of the Subsidiary Guarantors to
transfer  funds to the Company in the form of cash dividends, loans or advances.



22.  BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION:

     As a result of the Hardy Acquisition, the Company has changed the structure
of its internal organization to consist of two business divisions, Constellation
Wines  and  Constellation  Beers and Spirits. Separate division chief executives
report  directly  to  the  Company's  chief operating officer. Consequently, the
Company  reports  its  operating  results in three segments: Constellation Wines
(branded  wine,  and  U.K. wholesale and other), Constellation Beers and Spirits
(imported  beers  and  distilled  spirits)  and  Corporate  Operations and Other
(primarily corporate related items and other). Amounts included in the Corporate
Operations  and  Other  segment  consist of general corporate administration and
finance  expenses. These amounts include costs of executive management, investor
relations,  internal  audit,  treasury,  tax,   corporate   development,  legal,
financial  reporting, professional fees and public relations. Any costs incurred
at the corporate office that are applicable to the segments are allocated to the
appropriate  segment. The amounts included in the Corporate Operations and Other
segment  are general costs that are applicable to the consolidated group and are
therefore  not  allocated  to  the other reportable segments. All costs reported
within  the Corporate Operations and Other segment are not included in the chief
operating decision maker's evaluation of the operating income performance of the
other  operating  segments.  The new business segments reflect how the Company's
operations  are  being  managed, how operating performance within the Company is
being evaluated by senior management and the structure of its internal financial
reporting.  In  addition, the Company changed its definition of operating income
for  segment  purposes  to exclude restructuring and related charges and unusual
costs  that affect comparability. Accordingly, the financial information for the
years  ended  February  28,  2003,  and  February 28, 2002, has been restated to
conform  to  the new segment presentation. For the year ended February 29, 2004,
restructuring  and related charges and unusual costs consist of the flow through
of  inventory  step-up and financing costs associated with the Hardy Acquisition
of  $22.5 million and $11.6 million, respectively, and restructuring and related
charges  of  $48.0  million,  including  a  write-down  of commodity concentrate
inventory  of  $16.8 million, partially offset by the relief from certain excise
tax, duty and other costs incurred in prior years of $10.4 million. For the year
ended  February  28,  2003,  restructuring and related charges and unusual costs
consist  of  an  asset  impairment charge of $4.8 million recorded in connection
with  the  Company's  realignment  of  its   business  operations   within   the
Constellation Wines segment. For the year ended February 28, 2002, restructuring
and  related charges and unusual costs consist of the write-off of the remaining
deferred financing costs and unamortized discount associated with certain of the
Company's senior subordinated notes which were redeemed in February 2002 of $2.6
million.  The  Company  evaluates  performance  based on operating income of the
respective  business units. The accounting policies of the segments are the same
as  those  described  for  the  Company in the Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies  in  Note  1 and include the recently adopted accounting pronouncements
described  in  Note  2. Transactions between segments consist mainly of sales of
products  and  are  accounted  for  at  cost  plus  an  applicable  margin.

     Segment information is as follows:



     The  Company's  areas  of  operations are principally in the United States.
Operations  outside  the  United  States are primarily in the United Kingdom and
Australia  and  are  included  within the Constellation Wines segment.

     Geographic data is as follows:






23.  ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS NOT YET ADOPTED:

     In  December  2003,  the  Financial  Accounting Standards Board issued FASB
Interpretation  No. 46 (revised December 2003) ("FIN No. 46(R)"), "Consolidation
of Variable  Interest  Entities--an  interpretation  of ARB No. 51", which  will
replace  FASB  Interpretation  No. 46 ("FIN No. 46"), "Consolidation of Variable
Interest  Entities," upon its effective date.  FIN No. 46(R) retains many of the
basic concepts introduced in FIN No. 46; however, it also introduces a new scope
exception for certain types of entities that qualify as a business as defined in
FIN No. 46(R) and revises the method of calculating expected losses and residual
returns  for  determination of primary beneficiaries, including new guidance for
assessing variable interests.  The application of the transition requirements of
FIN  No.  46(R)  with  regard to special purpose entities and existing  variable
interest  entities did not result in any entities requiring consolidation or any
additional disclosures.  The Company is continuing to evaluate the impact of FIN
No.  46(R)  for its adoption as of May 31, 2004.  However, it is not expected to
have  a  material  impact  on  the  Company's consolidated financial statements.

     In December 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of  Financial  Accounting  Standards No. 132 (revised 2003) ("SFAS No. 132(R)"),
"Employers'  Disclosures  about  Pensions  and Other Postretirement Benefits--an
amendment  of  FASB  Statements No. 87, 88, and 106." SFAS No. 132(R) supersedes
Statement  of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.  132  ("SFAS  No. 132"), by
revising  employers'  disclosures  about  pension plans and other postretirement
benefit  plans. SFAS No. 132(R) requires additional disclosures to those in SFAS
No.  132 regarding the assets, obligations, cash flows, and net periodic benefit
cost  of  defined benefit pension plans and other defined benefit postretirement
plans.  SFAS  No.  132(R) also amends Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 28
("APB  Opinion  No.  28"),  "Interim Financial Reporting," to require additional
disclosures  for  interim periods. The Company has adopted certain of the annual
disclosure  provisions  of  SFAS No. 132(R), primarily those related to its U.S.
postretirement  plan,  for the fiscal year ending February 29, 2004. The Company
is required to adopt the remaining annual disclosure provisions, primarily those
related  to its foreign plans, for the fiscal year ending February 28, 2005. The
Company  is  required to adopt the amendment to APB Opinion No. 28 for financial
reports  containing condensed financial statements for interim periods beginning
March  1,  2004.

     In  March  2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a proposed
statement,  "Share-Based  Payment,  an  amendment of FASB Statements No. 123 and
95."  The  objective  of  the proposed statement is to require recognition in an
entity's  financial  statements  of  the  cost  of employee services received in
exchange  for  equity instruments issued, and liabilities incurred, to employees
in share-based payment (or compensation) transactions based on the fair value of
the  instruments  at  the grant date. The proposed statement would eliminate the
alternative  of  continuing to account for share-based payment arrangements with
employees under APB No. 25 and require that the compensation cost resulting from
all  share-based  payment  transactions  be  recognized in an entity's financial
statements.  If  adopted  in  its  current form, the proposed statement would be
effective  for  awards  that  are  granted, modified, or settled in fiscal years
beginning  after  December  15,  2004. Also, if adopted in its current form, the
proposed  statement  could  result  in  a  significant  charge  to the Company's
Consolidated  Statement  of  Income for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2006.

affected,  or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal
control  over  financial  reporting.

SECURITIES AUTHORIZED FOR ISSUANCE UNDER EQUITY COMPENSATION PLANS

     The  following  table  sets forth information with respect to the Company's
compensation  plans  under  which  its  equity  securities  may be issued, as of
February  29,  2004.  The equity compensation plans approved by security holders
include  the  Company's  Long-Term  Stock Incentive Plan, Incentive Stock Option
Plan  and  1989 Employee Stock Purchase Plan.  The equity compensation plans not
approved  by security holders include the Company's UK Sharesave Scheme (the "UK
Plan").  Under  the  UK Plan, 2,000,000 shares of Class A Stock may be issued to
eligible United Kingdom employees and directors of the Company in offerings that
typically  extend  from  three  to  five years.  Under the terms of the UK Plan,
participants  may  purchase  shares  of Class A Stock at the end of the offering
period  through payroll deductions made during the offering period.  The payroll
deductions  are  kept  in interest bearing accounts until the participant either
exercises  the option at the end of the offering or withdraws from the offering.
The  exercise  price for each offering is fixed at the beginning of the offering
by  the  committee  administering  the  plan  and may be no less than 80% of the
closing  price  of  the  stock  on  the  day  the exercise price is fixed.  If a
participant  ceases to be employed by the Company, that participant may exercise
the option during a period of time specified in the UK Plan or may withdraw from
the  offering.  During  the year ended February 29, 2004, an aggregate of 27,791
shares  were  issued  pursuant  to  the  UK  Plan.
