     Market share and industry data disclosed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K
have  been obtained from the following industry and government publications: The
Gomberg-Fredrikson  Report;  Adams  Liquor  Handbook; Adams Wine Handbook; Adams
Beer  Handbook;  Adams  Media  Handbook  Advance;  The  U.S. Wine Market: Impact
Databank  Review  and Forecast; The U.S. Beer Market: Impact Databank Review and
Forecast; The U.S. Spirits Market: Impact Databank Review and Forecast; NACM; AC
Nielsen;  The  Zenith  Guide; Beer Marketer's Insights; and The Drink Pocketbook
2003.  The  Company has not independently verified this data.   Unless otherwise
noted,  all  references to market share data are based on unit volume and unless
otherwise  noted,  the  most  recent  complete  industry  data available are for
calendar 2002.

     The  Company  is  a leading international producer and marketer of beverage
alcohol in North America, Europe and Australia with a broad portfolio of  brands
across  the  wine,  imported beer and distilled spirits categories.  The Company
has  the  largest  wine  business in the world and is the largest multi-category
supplier  of  beverage  alcohol  brands  in  the  United  States.  In the United
Kingdom,  the  Company  is  the  largest  marketer  of  wine, the second largest
producer and marketer of cider and a leading independent drinks wholesaler.  The
Company  is  the  leading  producer  of wine in Australia and the second largest
producer of wine in New Zealand.  The Company's strong market positions increase
its purchasing power and make the Company a supplier of choice to its customers.

     With  its  broad  product  portfolio, the Company believes it is distinctly
positioned  to  satisfy  an  array  of  consumer preferences across all beverage
alcohol  categories  and  price  points.  Many  of  the  Company's  products are
recognized  leaders  in  their  respective  categories.  Leading  brands  in the
Company's  portfolio  include Corona Extra, Modelo Especial, Pacifico, St. Pauli
Girl,  Franciscan  Oakville  Estate,  Simi,  Estancia,  Ravenswood,  Blackstone,
Banrock Station, Hardys, Nobilo, Houghton, Leasingham, Almaden, Inglenook, Arbor
Mist,  Vendange,  Alice White, Stowells of Chelsea, Black Velvet, Fleischmann's,
Schenley, Ten High and Blackthorn.

     The  Company is a Delaware corporation incorporated on December 4, 1972, as
the  successor  to  a  business founded in 1945. Since the Company's founding in
1945  as a producer and marketer of wine products, the Company has grown through
a  combination  of  internal  growth  and  acquisitions.  The



Company's  internal  growth has been driven by leveraging the Company's existing
portfolio  of  leading  brands,  developing new products, new packaging and line
extensions,  and  focusing on the faster growing sectors of the beverage alcohol
industry.

     Since  1991,  the  Company  has  successfully  integrated a number of major
acquisitions  that  have broadened its portfolio and increased its market share,
net  sales,  operating  income  and  cash flow.  Through these acquisitions, the
Company  has  become more competitive by: diversifying its portfolio; developing
strong  market  positions  in the growing beverage alcohol product categories of
varietal  table  wine  and  imported  beer; strengthening its relationships with
wholesalers;  expanding   its   distribution  and   enhancing   its   production
capabilities;  and  acquiring additional management, operational, marketing, and
research  and  development  expertise.

     In  April 2003, the Company completed the acquisition of BRL Hardy Limited,
now  known  as  Hardy  Wine Company Limited ("Hardy") (the "Hardy Acquisition"),
Australia's  largest  producer  of  wine,  which  enhanced the Company's overall
growth  prospects  and  gave the Company an immediate presence in the Australian
domestic  and  export  markets.  Well  known brands in Hardy's portfolio include
Banrock  Station,  Hardys  Nottage  Hill, Hardys Stamp and VR, Eileen Hardy, Sir
James,  Omni,  Leasingham  and  Houghton. Other recent acquisitions include: the
acquisition  in  July  2001 of the Ravenswood brand, a leading premium wine from
Sonoma,  California;  the  acquisition in March 2001 of the Covey Run, Columbia,
Ste.  Chapelle,  Alice  White  and other premium wine brands; the acquisition in
March  2001  of the Vendange, Nathanson Creek, Heritage, Talus and other premium
wine  brands;  and  the  formation  in  July  2001  of Pacific Wine Partners LLC
("PWP"),  a  joint venture owned equally by the Company and Hardy that produces,
markets  and  sells  a  global  portfolio  of premium wine in the United States,
including  a  range of Australian imports. As a result of the Hardy Acquisition,
the  Company  acquired  the remaining 50% ownership of PWP. For more information
about these acquisitions, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition  and  Results  of  Operations" in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form
10-K.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS

     As a result of the Hardy Acquisition, the Company has changed the structure
of its internal organization to consist of two business divisions, Constellation
Wines  and  Constellation  Beers and Spirits. Separate division chief executives
report  directly  to  the Company's chief operating officer. As a result of such
changes,  beginning  with  the  first  quarter  of Fiscal 2004, the Company will
report  its  operating  results  in three segments: Constellation Wines (branded
wine,  and  U.K. wholesale and other), Constellation Beers and Spirits (imported
beer and distilled spirits) and Corporate Operations and Other. The new business
segments,  described more fully  below, reflect how the Company's operations are
now  being  managed,  how  operating performance within the Company is now being
evaluated  by  senior  management and the availability and structure of internal
financial  reporting.

     PREVIOUS BUSINESS SEGMENTS

     For  Fiscal 2003, Fiscal 2002 and Fiscal 2001, the Company has reported its
operating  results  in  the  five  segments  described  below:

     The Popular and Premium Wine segment produces, bottles, imports and markets
wine  and  brandy  in the United States and exports its wine to other major wine
consuming  markets.  Most of its wine is marketed in the under $10.00 per 750 ml
bottle price range.  This segment also produces and sells bulk wine, grape juice
concentrate  and  other  related  products  and  services.



     The  Imported  Beer  and  Spirits segment imports and markets a diversified
line of imported beer, produces, bottles, imports and markets a diversified line
of distilled spirits and sells bulk distilled spirits and other related products
and services.

     The U.K. Brands and Wholesale segment is a leading producer and marketer of
wine,  cider  and bottled water and is the leading independent on-premise drinks
wholesaler in the United Kingdom. This segment also exports its branded products
from the United Kingdom.

     The  Fine  Wine segment participates in the super-premium and ultra-premium
wine  market  in  the United States and exports its products to other major wine
consuming markets.

     The Corporate  Operations and Other segment includes traditional corporate-
related items.

     Results  of  operations  of the Company's previous business segments is set
forth  in  "Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial Condition and
Results of Operation" in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Information
regarding  net sales, operating income and total assets of each of the Company's
previous  business  segments  and  information regarding geographic areas is set
forth  in  Note 21 to the Company's consolidated financial statements located in
Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

     POST-FISCAL 2003 BUSINESS SEGMENTS

     CONSTELLATION WINES

     Constellation  Wines  is  the  leading producer and marketer of wine in the
world.  It  sells  a  large  number of wine brands across all categories - table
wine,  dessert  wine and sparkling wine - and across all price points - popular,
premium,  super-premium  and  ultra-premium.  The portfolio of super-premium and
ultra-premium  wines is supported by vineyard holdings in California, Australia,
New  Zealand  and  Chile.  As  the  largest producer and marketer of wine in the
world, Constellation Wines has leading market positions in several countries. It
is  the second largest supplier of wine in the United States and New Zealand and
the  largest  supplier of wine in Australia and the United Kingdom. In addition,
Constellation  Wines  exports  its  wine  products  to  the major wine consuming
markets  of  the  world.

     In  the  United  States,  Constellation  Wines sells 20 of the top 100 wine
brands  and  has  one  of  the  largest  super-premium  and  ultra-premium  wine
portfolios.  In  the  United  Kingdom,  it has eight of the top 20 selling table
wine  brands  to  the  off-premise  market,  four  of  the  top 10 brands in the
on-premise  market  and  the  best  selling brand of fortified British wine.  In
Australia,  it  has wine brands across all price points and varieties, including
the most comprehensive range of premium wine brands, and is the largest producer
of cask wines.

Estate, Simi, Estancia, Ravenswood, Blackstone, Banrock Station, Hardys, Nobilo,
Houghton,  Leasingham, Almaden, Inglenook, Arbor Mist, Vendange, Alice White and
Stowells  of  Chelsea.

     Constellation  Wines is also the leading independent beverage wholesaler to
the  on-premise  trade in the United Kingdom and has more than 16,000 on-premise
accounts.   The  wholesaling  business  is  wine  led,  but  also  involves  the
distribution  of  branded  distilled spirits, cider, beer, RTDs and soft drinks.
While  these  products  are  primarily produced by other major drinks companies,
they  also  include Constellation Wines' branded wine, cider and water products.



     Constellation  Wines  is  also  the second largest producer and marketer of
cider  in  the United Kingdom, with leading cider brands Blackthorn and Gaymer's
Olde  English,  and  produces  and markets Strathmore, the leading bottled water
brand  in  the  United  Kingdom  on-premise  market.

     In  conjunction  with its wine production, Constellation Wines produces and
sells  bulk  wine,  grape  juice  concentrate  and  other  related  products and
services.

     CONSTELLATION BEERS AND SPIRITS

     Constellation  Beers  and Spirits imports and markets a diversified line of
beer  and produces, bottles, imports and markets a diversified line of distilled
spirits.  It  is  the  largest marketer of imported beer in 25 primarily western
U.S.  states,  where it has exclusive rights to distribute the Mexican brands in
its  portfolio.  Constellation  Beers  and  Spirits  has exclusive rights to the
entire  United  States for its non-Mexican brands. It distributes six of the top
25  imported  beer  brands  in the United States: Corona Extra, Modelo Especial,
Corona  Light,  Pacifico,  St. Pauli Girl, and Negra Modelo. Corona Extra is the
best  selling  imported  beer  in the United States and the seventh best selling
beer  overall  in  the  United  States.  Its  other imported beer brands include
Tsingtao  from  China, Peroni from Italy and Double Diamond and Tetley's English
Ale from the United Kingdom.

Beers  and  Spirits also sells bulk distilled spirits and other related products
and services.

     CORPORATE OPERATIONS AND OTHER

     The Corporate Operations and Other segment includes traditional  corporate-
related items.

MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION

     The  Company  employs  full-time,  in-house  marketing,  sales and customer
service  organizations within its segments to maintain a high degree of focus on
each  of  its  product  categories.  The  organizations use a range of marketing
strategies  and  tactics  to  build  brand  equity and increase sales, including
market research, consumer and trade advertising, price promotions, point-of-sale
materials,  event  sponsorship and public relations.  Where opportunities exist,
particularly  with  national  accounts,  the  Company  leverages  its  sales and
marketing  skills  across  the  organization.

     In  North America, the Company's products are primarily distributed by more
than  1,000  wholesale  distributors  as  well as state and provincial alcoholic
beverage  control  agencies.  In  the  Company's  other  markets,  products  are
primarily  distributed  either  directly to retailers or through wholesalers and
importers.  In  Australia,  distribution  is  dominated  by  a  small  number of
industry  leaders.  Its  U.K.  wholesaling  business  sells  and distributes the
Company's  branded  products and those of other major drinks companies through a
network  of  depots  located  throughout  the  United  Kingdom.



TRADEMARKS AND DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENTS

     Trademarks  are  an important aspect of the Company's business. The Company
sells  its products under a number of trademarks, most of which the Company owns
or  has  the right to use. Throughout its segments, the Company also has various
licenses and distribution agreements, for  the sale  and the production and sale
of  its  products,  as  well as for the sale of products of third parties. These
licenses  and  distribution  agreements   have  varying  terms  and   durations.
Agreements  include,  among  others,  a  long-term  license agreement with Hiram
Walker & Sons, Inc., which  expires in  2116, for the  Ten High, Crystal Palace,
Northern Light, Lauder's and Imperial Spirits brands.

     All  of the Company's imported beer products are marketed and sold pursuant
to exclusive distribution agreements with the suppliers of these products. These
agreements  have  terms  that vary and prohibit the Company from importing other
beer  from  other  producers  from  the same country. The Company's agreement to
distribute  Corona Extra and other Mexican beer brands exclusively throughout 25
primarily  western  U.S.  states  expires  in  December  2006  and,  subject  to
compliance  with  certain  performance  criteria, continued retention of certain
Company  personnel  and  other  terms under the agreement, will be automatically
renewed for additional terms of five years. Changes in control of the Company or
of  its  subsidiaries  involved in importing the Mexican beer brands, changes in
the  position of the Chief Executive Officer of Barton Beers, Ltd., including by
death or disability, or the termination of the President of Barton Incorporated,
may  be  a  basis  for  the  supplier,  unless  it  consents to such changes, to
terminate  the  agreement.  The  supplier's  consent  to such changes may not be
unreasonably  withheld. Prior to their expiration, all of the Company's imported
beer  distribution  agreements  may  be  terminated if the Company fails to meet
certain performance criteria. The Company believes it is currently in compliance
with  its material imported beer distribution agreements. From time to time, the
Company  has  failed, and may in the future fail, to satisfy certain performance
criteria  in  its  distribution  agreements.  Although  there can be no absolute
assurance that the Company's beer distribution agreements will be renewed, given
the  Company's  long-term  relationships with its suppliers, the Company expects
that  such  agreements  will  be  renewed prior to their expiration and does not
believe  that  these  agreements  will  be  terminated.

COMPETITION

     The  beverage alcohol industry is highly competitive.  The Company competes
on  the  basis  of  quality, price, brand recognition and distribution strength.
The  Company's  beverage  alcohol  products  compete  with  other  alcoholic and
nonalcoholic  beverages for consumer purchases, as well as shelf space in retail
stores, restaurant presence and wholesaler attention.  The Company competes with
numerous  multinational producers and distributors of beverage alcohol products,
some  of  which  may  have  greater  resources  than  the  Company.

     Constellation  Wines'  principal  wine  competitors  include:  E  & J Gallo
Winery,  The  Wine  Group,  Beringer  Blass,  The Robert Mondavi Corporation and
Kendall-Jackson  in  the  United  States;  Southcorp  Wines, Orlando Wyndham and
Beringer  Blass  in  Australia; and E & J Gallo Winery, Southcorp Wines, Western
Wines, Halewood Vintners and Pernod-Ricard in the United Kingdom.  Its wholesale
business  competes  with  major  brewers  who also have wholesale operations, in
particular,  Scottish  Courage, Coors, Interbrew and Carlsberg Tetley, and other
independent  national  and regional wholesalers.  Constellation Wines' principal
cider competitor is H.P. Bulmer.

     Constellation   Beers   and   Spirits'   principal   competitors   include:
Heineken  USA,  Molson,  Labatt  USA  and   Guinness  Import  Company   in   the
imported  beer  category  as  well  as  domestic  producers  such  as



Anheuser  Busch,  Coors  and SAB-Miller; and Diageo, Brown-Forman Beverages, Jim
Beam  Brands  and  Heaven  Hill  Distilleries in the distilled spirits category.

PRODUCTION

     In  the  United  States,  the  Company  operates 20 wineries  where wine is
produced  from  many  varieties of grapes grown principally in the Napa, Sonoma,
Monterey  and  San  Joaquin  regions  of  California.  In Australia, the Company
operates  10 wineries where wine is produced from many varieties of grapes grown
in  most  of the major viticultural regions of Australia.  Grapes are crushed at
the  Company's  wineries  and  stored  as wine until packaged for sale under the
Company's  brand  names  or sold in bulk.  Most of the Company's wine is bottled
and  sold  within  18  months  after the grape crush.  In the United States, the
Company's  inventories  of  wine are usually at their highest levels in November
and  December  immediately after the crush of each year's grape harvest, and are
substantially  reduced  prior  to  the  subsequent  year's crush.  Similarly, in
Australia, the Company's inventories of wine are usually at their highest levels
in  April  and May immediately after the crush of each year's grape harvest, and
are  substantially  reduced  prior  to the subsequent year's crush.  The Company
also  operates  one  winery  in  Chile  and  two  wineries  in  New  Zealand.

     The bourbon whiskeys, domestic blended whiskeys and light whiskeys marketed
by  the Company are primarily produced and aged by the Company at its distillery
in  Bardstown,  Kentucky.  The  Company's  primary  distilled  spirits  bottling
facility  in  the  United States is in Owensboro, Kentucky.  The majority of the
Company's  Canadian  whisky  requirements  are produced and aged at its Canadian
distilleries  in  Lethbridge,  Alberta,  and Valleyfield, Quebec.  The Company's
requirements  of Scotch whisky, tequila, mezcal and the neutral grain spirits it
uses  in  the production of gin, vodka and other spirits products, are primarily
purchased  from  various  suppliers.

     The  Company  operates three facilities in the United Kingdom that produce,
bottle  and  package cider, wine and water. To produce Stowells of Chelsea, wine
is  imported  in  bulk  from  various  countries  and  packaged at the Company's
facility  at Bristol.  The Bristol facility also produces fortified British wine
and  wine  style  drinks.  All  cider  production  takes  place at the Company's
facility  at  Shepton  Mallet.  The Strathmore brand of bottled water is sourced
and bottled in Forfar, Scotland.

SOURCES AND AVAILABILITY OF PRODUCTION MATERIALS

     The  principal  components  in  the  production  of  the  Company's branded
beverage  alcohol  products are agricultural products, such as grapes and grain,
and  packaging  materials  (primarily  glass).

     Most  of the Company's annual grape requirements are satisfied by purchases
from  each  year's  harvest  which  normally  begins  in August and runs through
October  in  the  United  States  and begins in February and runs through May in
Australia.  The  Company believes that it has adequate sources of grape supplies
to  meet  its sales expectations.  However, in the event demand for certain wine
products  exceeds  expectations,  the  Company  could  experience  shortages.

     The  Company purchases grapes from approximately 800 independent growers in
the  United  States  and  1,450  growers  in Australia.  The Company enters into
written  purchase  agreements  with  a  majority  of  these  growers and pricing
generally  varies  year-to-year  based  on current market prices.  In Australia,
approximately  800  of  the 1,450 growers belong to a grape growers cooperative.
The  Company  purchases  the  majority of its Australian grape requirements from
this  cooperative  under  a  long-term  arrangement.  In the United Kingdom, the
Company  produces wine from materials purchased either on a contract basis or on
the open market.



     The Company currently owns or leases approximately 16,080 acres of land and
vineyards,  either fully bearing or under development, in California (U.S.), New
York  (U.S.),  Australia,  Chile  and New Zealand.  This acreage supplies only a
small  percentage  of  the Company's overall total wine needs.  However, most of
this  acreage  is  used  to  supply  a  large portion of the grapes used for the
production  of the Company's super-premium and ultra-premium wines.  The Company
continues  to  consider  the  purchase  or  lease  of  additional vineyards, and
additional  land  for  vineyard  plantings,  to  supplement  its  grape  supply.

     The  distilled  spirits  manufactured   by  the  Company  require   various
agricultural  products,  neutral  grain  spirits  and bulk spirits.  The Company
fulfills  its requirements through purchases from various sources by contractual
arrangement and through purchases on the open market.  The Company believes that
adequate  supplies  of  the aforementioned products are available at the present
time.

     In  the  United  Kingdom,  the  Company sources apples for cider production
primarily  through  long-term supply arrangements with owners of apple orchards.
There  are  adequate  supplies  of  apples  at  this  particular  time.

     The  Company  utilizes glass and polyethylene terephthalate ("PET") bottles
and  other materials such as caps, corks, capsules, labels and cardboard cartons
in the bottling and packaging of its products. Glass bottle costs are one of the
largest  components  of the Company's cost of product sold. In the United States
and  Australia,  the  glass  bottle  industry is highly concentrated with only a
small number of producers. The Company has traditionally obtained, and continues
to obtain, its glass requirements from a limited number of producers. Currently,
substantially  all  of the Company's glass container requirements for its United
States  operations  are  supplied  by  one producer and substantially all of the
Company's glass container requirements for its Australia operations are supplied
by  another  producer.  The Company has not experienced difficulty in satisfying
its  requirements with respect to any of the foregoing and considers its sources
of  supply  to be adequate. However, the inability of any of the Company's glass
bottle  suppliers  to  satisfy the Company's requirements could adversely affect
the  Company's  operations.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION

     The  Company is subject to a range of regulations in the countries in which
it operates. Where it produces products, the Company is subject to environmental
laws  and  regulations  and  may  be  required to obtain permits and licenses to
operate  its  facilities. Where it markets and sells products, it may be subject
to  laws  and  regulations  on  trademark  and brand registration, packaging and
labeling,  distribution  methods  and  relationships, pricing and price changes,
sales  promotions, advertising and public relations. The Company is also subject
to rules and regulations relating to changes in officers or directors, ownership
or  control.

     The  Company believes it is in compliance in all material respects with all
applicable  governmental  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries in which it
operates.  The  Company  also  believes  that  the  cost  of  administration and
compliance  with,  and liability under, such laws and regulations does not have,
and  is  not  expected  to  have,  a  material  adverse  impact on its financial
condition,  results  of  operations  or  cash  flows.



SEASONALITY

     The  beverage  alcohol  industry  is  subject  to seasonality in each major
category.  As  a  result,  in  response  to wholesaler and retailer demand which
precedes  consumer purchases, the Company's wine and spirits sales are typically
highest  during  the third quarter of its fiscal year, primarily due to seasonal
holiday  buying,  and  its  imported beer sales are typically highest during the
first  and second quarters of the Company's fiscal year, which correspond to the
Spring  and  Summer  periods in the United States.

EMPLOYEES

     As of the end of March 2003, including the impact of the Hardy Acquisition,
the  Company  had  approximately 7,680 full-time employees throughout the world.
Approximately  3,030  full-time  employees  were  in  the   United  States   and
approximately  4,650  full-time  employees were outside of the United States, in
countries  including  Australia,  the  United  Kingdom,  Canada, New Zealand and
France.  Additional  workers  may be employed by the Company during the peak and
grape  crushing seasons.  The Company considers its employee relations generally
to be good.

ITEM 2.   PROPERTIES
- -------   ----------

     During  Fiscal  2003,  the  Company  consisted  of  five business segments.
Through its business segments, the Company operated wineries, distilling plants,
bottling  plants,  and  cider  and  water  producing  facilities,  most of which
included  warehousing  and distribution facilities on the premises.  The Company
also  operated separate distribution centers under the U.K. Brands and Wholesale
segment's  wholesaling  business.

     As  a result of the Hardy Acquisition, the  Company  modified its  business
segmentation  and   will  report   its  operating  results  in  three  segments:
Constellation  Wines,  Constellation  Beers and Spirits and Corporate Operations
and  Other.  Set  forth  below  under the title "Hardy Acquisition" is a general
description  of  the  production  properties  acquired  by  virtue  of the Hardy
Acquisition.

     The  Company  believes  that  its facilities, taken as a whole, are in good
condition and working order and have adequate capacity to meet its needs for the
foreseeable future.

     The  following  discussion  details the properties associated with the five
business  segments  as  reported  in  Fiscal  2003.



     POPULAR AND PREMIUM WINE

     The  Popular  and Premium Wine segment maintained its headquarters in owned
and  leased  offices in Canandaigua, New York. It operated three wineries in New
York,  located in Canandaigua, Naples and Batavia; seven wineries in California,
located  in  Escalon, Fresno, Ukiah, two in Lodi and two in Madera; two wineries
in Washington, located in Woodinville and Sunnyside; and one winery in Caldwell,
Idaho.  All of these wineries are owned, except for the wineries in Batavia (New
York),  Caldwell  (Idaho)  and  Woodinville (Washington), which are leased. This
segment  considered  its  principal  wineries  to  be the Mission Bell winery in
Madera  (California)  and  the Canandaigua winery in Canandaigua (New York). The
Mission  Bell  winery crushes grapes, produces, bottles and distributes wine and
produces  grape  juice  concentrate.  The  Canandaigua winery crushes grapes and
produces,  bottles  and distributes wine. This segment plans to close two of its
wineries  located  in Batavia (New York) and Fresno (California) in Fiscal 2004.

     This segment owned or leased approximately 2,800 acres of vineyards, either
fully  bearing  or  under  development,  in  California  and  New  York.

     IMPORTED BEER AND SPIRITS

     The Imported Beer and Spirits segment maintained its headquarters in leased
offices in Chicago, Illinois.  It owned and operated four distilling plants, two
in the United States and two in Canada.  The two distilling plants in the United
States  are  located  in  Bardstown,  Kentucky  and  Albany,  Georgia.  The  two
distilling  plants  in Canada are located in Valleyfield, Quebec and Lethbridge,
Alberta.  This  segment  considered  its  principal  distilling plants to be the
facilities  located in Bardstown (Kentucky), Valleyfield (Quebec) and Lethbridge
(Alberta).  The  Bardstown  facility  distills, bottles and warehouses distilled
spirits products for the Company and, on a contractual basis, for other industry
members.  The  two Canadian facilities distill, bottle and store Canadian whisky
for  the  segment,  and  distill and/or bottle and store Canadian whisky, vodka,
rum,  gin  and  liqueurs  for  third  parties.

     In  the  United States, the Imported Beer and Spirits segment also operated
three  bottling  plants,  located  in  Georgia,  Kentucky  and  California.  The
facilities  located in Atlanta, Georgia and Owensboro, Kentucky are owned, while
the facility in Carson, California is operated and leased through an arrangement
involving  an ongoing management contract.  This segment considered the bottling
plant  located  in  Owensboro  (Kentucky) to be one of its principal facilities.
The Owensboro facility bottles and warehouses distilled spirits products for the
segment  and  is  also  utilized  for  contract  bottling.

     U.K. BRANDS AND WHOLESALE

     The  U.K. Brands and Wholesale segment maintained its headquarters in owned
offices  in  Bristol, England.  It owned and operated two facilities in England,
located  in  Bristol and Shepton Mallet and one facility in Scotland, located in
Forfar.  This  segment  considered  all  three  facilities  to  be its principal
facilities.  The  Bristol  facility  produces,  bottles  and  packages wine; the
Shepton  Mallet  facility  produces,  bottles and packages cider; and the Forfar
facility  produces,  bottles  and  packages water products.  The U.K. Brands and
Wholesale segment also owns another facility in Taunton, England, which it plans
to  sell  since  the  operations  have been consolidated into the Shepton Mallet
facility.

     The U.K. Brands and  Wholesale  segment operated  a  National  Distribution
Centre, located  at  a  leased  facility  in  Severnside, England  to distribute
its   products  that  are  produced   at  the   Bristol   and   Shepton   Mallet
facilities  as  well   as  products  imported  from  other  wine suppliers.   To
support  its  wholesaling  business,  this  segment  operated   11  distribution
centers  located  throughout  the  United



Kingdom,  10  of  which  are  leased.  These 11 distribution centers are used to
distribute  products  produced by third parties, as well as by the Company. This
segment  has  been  and  will  continue  consolidating  the  operations  of  its
wholesaling  distribution  centers.

     FINE WINE

     The  Fine  Wine  segment  maintained  its  headquarters in offices owned in
Rutherford,  California.  Through  this  segment, the Company owned and operated
five wineries in the United States, one of which is on land that is leased, and,
through  a  majority  owned  subsidiary,  operated one winery in Chile. All five
wineries  in  the  United  States  are  located  in  the state of California, in
Rutherford,  Healdsburg, Monterey County and two in Sonoma County. The winery in
Chile is located in the Casablanca Valley. This segment considered its principal
wineries  to  be  one  of  its  wineries  in  Sonoma County (California) and its
wineries  located  in Rutherford (California), Healdsburg (California), Monterey
County  (California),  and the Casablanca Valley (Chile). The winery in Monterey
County  crushes,  vinifies  and cellars wine. The other principal wineries crush
grapes,  vinify,  cellar  and  bottle  wine.

     This  segment  also owned and leased approximately 2,700 plantable acres of
vineyards  in California and approximately 1,000 plantable acres of vineyards in
Chile.

     CORPORATE OPERATIONS AND OTHER

     The  Company's  corporate  headquarters  are  located  in offices leased in
Fairport, New York.

     HARDY ACQUISITION

     During  the  first  quarter  of Fiscal 2004, the Company acquired Hardy, an
Australian  company   based  in  Reynella,  South  Australia.  Hardy  owns   ten
Australian  wineries,  five  of  which  are  in  South Australia, two in Western
Australia  and  the other three in New South Wales, Australian Capital Territory
and  Tasmania.  Hardy  also  owns  two wineries in New Zealand and one winery in
France.  All of these wineries crush, vinify and cellar wine.  In addition, four
of these wineries include bottling and/or packaging operations.  Hardy also owns
a  bottling  facility  in  Reynella, South Australia which bottles a significant
portion  of the wine produced by Hardy.  The Company considers Hardy's principal
facilities  to  be  the  Berri Estates and the Renmano wineries located in South
Australia,  the  Stanley  winery located in New South Wales, the Houghton winery
located  in Western Australia, the Nobilo winery located in New Zealand, and the
bottling  facility  located  in  Reynella.

     Hardy  owns  or  has  interests  in  approximately 6,200 plantable acres of
vineyards  in  South  Australia,  the  Australian  Capital  Territory,   Western
Australia,  Victoria,  and  Tasmania,  approximately  1,900  plantable  acres of
vineyards  in  New  Zealand and approximately 80 plantable acres of vineyards in
France.

     As  a  result  of the Hardy Acquisition, the Company acquired the remaining
50%  ownership  of  PWP.  PWP  owns and operates two wineries in California, one
located in Monterey County and the other in Sonoma County. These wineries crush,
vinify  and  cellar  wine.  In  addition, the winery in Monterey County includes
bottling  operations and distribution facilities. PWP also owns or has interests
in  approximately  1,400  plantable  acres  of  vineyards  in  California.



ITEM 3.   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     The  Company  and  its  subsidiaries are subject to litigation from time to
time  in  the ordinary course of business.  Although the amount of any liability
with  respect  to  such  litigation  cannot  be  determined,  in  the opinion of
management  such  liability  will  not  have  a  material  adverse effect on the
Company's  financial  condition,  results  of  operations  or  cash  flows.

ITEM 6.   SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA
- -------   -----------------------


     For  the  years  ended  February  28,  2003,  and  February  28,  2002, see
Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial  Condition and Results of
Operations  under Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the Consolidated
Financial  Statements and  notes thereto  under Item 8 of this Annual Report  on
Form 10-K.

     Effective  March  1,  2002,  the  Company  adopted  Statement  of Financial
Accounting  Standards  No.  142 ("SFAS No. 142"), "Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets."  SFAS No. 142 addresses financial accounting and reporting for acquired
goodwill  and other intangible assets and supersedes Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No. 17, "Intangible Assets." Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill and indefinite
lived  intangible  assets  are  no  longer  amortized  but are reviewed at least
annually  for  impairment.  Intangible  assets  that  are  not deemed to have an
indefinite  life  will  continue to be amortized over their useful lives and are
subject  to  review  for  impairment. Upon adoption of SFAS No. 142, the Company
determined  that  certain  of  its  intangible  assets  met  the  criteria to be
considered  indefinite  lived   and,  accordingly,  ceased  their   amortization
effective  March  1,  2002.  These  intangible  assets  consisted principally of
trademarks.  The Company's trademarks relate to well established brands owned by
the  Company  which  were  previously amortized over 40 years. Intangible assets
determined to have a finite life, primarily distribution agreements, continue to
be  amortized  over  their  estimated  useful lives which were not modified as a
result  of  adopting  SFAS No. 142. The supplemental data section above presents
operating  income, income before extraordinary item, net income and earnings per
share  information  for  the  comparative  periods  as  if  the  nonamortization
provisions of SFAS No. 142 had been applied as of March 1, 1998.

     Effective  March  1,  2002, the Company adopted EITF Issue No. 01-09 ("EITF
No.  01-09"),  "Accounting  for  Consideration  Given  by a Vendor to a Customer
(Including  a Reseller of the Vendor's Products)."  EITF No. 01-09 addresses the
recognition,  measurement  and  income statement classification of consideration
given  by  a  vendor  to  a  customer (including both a reseller of the vendor's
products  and  an  entity that purchases the vendor's products from a reseller).
EITF No. 01-09, among other things, requires that certain consideration given by
a  vendor  to  a  customer  be  characterized  as  a  reduction  of



revenue when recognized in the vendor's income statement. The Company previously
reported such costs as selling, general and administrative expenses. As a result
of adopting EITF No. 01-09 on March 1, 2002, the Company has restated net sales,
cost  of  product sold, and selling, general and administrative expenses for the
years  ended  February  28,  2002,  February  28,  2001,  February 29, 2000, and
February  28,  1999.  Net  sales were reduced by $213.8 million, $170.7 million,
$178.7  million  and  $112.8  million,  respectively;  cost  of product sold was
increased  by  $10.1  million,  $7.8  million,  $8.8  million  and $2.0 million,
respectively;  and  selling, general and administrative expenses were reduced by
$223.9 million, $178.5 million, $187.5 million and $114.8 million, respectively.
This  reclassification  did  not  affect  operating  income  or  net  income.

     The consolidated financial statements for the year ended February 28, 2003,
were  audited  by  KPMG LLP. The consolidated financial statements for the years
ended  February 28, 2002, February 28, 2001, February 29, 2000, and February 28,
1999,  were  audited by Arthur Andersen LLP and the reports for those years have
not  been  reissued  by  Arthur  Andersen  LLP.

ITEM 7.   MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION  AND  ANALYSIS  OF  FINANCIAL  CONDITION  AND
- -------   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
          RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
          ---------------------

INTRODUCTION
- ------------

     The  Company  is  a leading international producer and marketer of beverage
alcohol in North America, Europe and Australia with a broad portfolio of  brands
across  the wine, imported beer and distilled spirits categories. The Company is
the largest wine company in the world and the largest multi-category supplier of
beverage alcohol brands in the United States. In the United Kingdom, the Company
is  the  largest  marketer  of wine, the second largest producer and marketer of
cider and  a leading independent drinks wholesaler.   The Company is the leading
producer  of  wine  in  Australia and the second largest producer of wine in New
Zealand.

     Through  February  28,  2003, the Company reported its operating results in
five  segments:  Popular  and Premium Wine (branded popular and premium wine and
brandy,  and  other,  primarily grape juice concentrate and bulk wine); Imported
Beer  and  Spirits  (primarily imported beer and distilled spirits); U.K. Brands
and  Wholesale  (branded  wine,  cider,  and  bottled water, and wholesale wine,
distilled  spirits,  cider,  beer,  RTDs  and soft drinks); Fine Wine (primarily
branded  super-premium  and  ultra-premium  wine);  and Corporate Operations and
Other  (primarily corporate related items). As a result of the Hardy Acquisition
(as  defined  below),  the  Company  has  changed  the structure of its internal
organization  to  consist  of  two  business  divisions, Constellation Wines and
Constellation  Beers  and  Spirits.  Separate  division  chief executives report
directly  to the Company's chief operating officer. As a result of such changes,
beginning  with  the  first  quarter of Fiscal 2004, the Company will report its
operating results in three segments: Constellation Wines (branded wine, and U.K.
wholesale  and  other),  Constellation  Beers  and  Spirits  (imported  beer and
distilled spirits) and Corporate Operations and Other. The new business segments
reflect  how  the  Company's  operations  are  now  being managed, how operating
performance  within  the Company is now being evaluated by senior management and
the  availability  and  structure  of  internal  financial  reporting.

     The  following  discussion  and analysis summarizes the significant factors
affecting  (i)  consolidated  results  of operations of the Company for the year
ended February 28, 2003 ("Fiscal 2003"), compared to the year ended February 28,
2002  ("Fiscal  2002"),  and Fiscal 2002 compared to the year ended February 28,
2001  ("Fiscal  2001"),  and  (ii) financial liquidity and capital resources for
Fiscal  2003.  This  discussion  and analysis should be read in conjunction with
the  Company's  consolidated  financial  statements  and  notes thereto included
herein.



     As  discussed  in  Note  1 to the financial statements, the Company adopted
SFAS  No.  142 on March 1, 2002.  Upon the adoption of SFAS No. 142, the Company
ceased   amortization  of  goodwill  and  indefinite  lived  intangible  assets.
Retroactive  application of SFAS No. 142 is not permitted.  As discussed in Note
2  to  the  financial statements, the Company adopted EITF No. 01-09 on March 1,
2002.  EITF No. 01-09 requires that certain consideration given by a vendor to a
customer  be  characterized  as  a reduction of revenue.  The Company previously
reported  such  costs  as  selling,  general  and administrative expenses.  As a
result  of  adopting EITF No. 01-09, the Company has restated net sales, cost of
product  sold,  and  selling,  general and administrative expenses for the years
ended  February  28, 2002, and February 28, 2001.  This reclassification did not
affect  operating  income  or  net  income.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

     ACQUISITION OF HARDY

     On  March  27, 2003, the Company acquired control of BRL Hardy Limited, now
known as Hardy Wine Company Limited ("Hardy"), and on April 9, 2003, the Company
completed  its  acquisition  of  all  of  Hardy's outstanding capital stock (the
"Hardy  Acquisition"). Hardy is Australia's largest wine producer with interests
in  wineries  and vineyards in most of Australia's major wine regions as well as
New  Zealand,  France  and the United States. In addition, Hardy has significant
marketing  and sales operations in the United Kingdom. This acquisition supports
the  Company's strategy of driving long-term growth and positions the Company to
capitalize  on the growth opportunities in "new world" wine markets. Hardy has a
comprehensive  portfolio  of wine products across all price points with a strong
focus  on  premium  wine  production.  Hardy's  wines  are distributed worldwide
through  a network of marketing and sales operations, with the majority of sales
generated  in  Australia,  the  United  Kingdom  and  the  United  States.

     Total  consideration  paid  in  cash  and Class A Common Stock to the Hardy
shareholders  was  $1,137.4  million. Additionally, the Company expects to incur
direct  acquisition  costs of $20.0 million. The acquisition date for accounting
purposes  is  March  27, 2003.   The Company expects to record an approximate $2
million  reduction in the purchase price to reflect imputed interest between the
accounting  acquisition  date  and  the final payment of consideration. The cash
portion  of  the  purchase  price  ($1,060.2  million)  was financed with $660.2
million  of  borrowings  under  the  Company's 2003 Credit Agreement (as defined
below) and $400.0 million of borrowings under the Company's Bridge Agreement (as
defined  below).  Additionally,  the  Company  issued  3,288,913  shares  of the
Company's  Class A Common Stock, which were valued at $77.2 million based on the
simple average of the closing market price of the Company's Class A Common Stock
beginning  two  days before and ending two days after April 4, 2003, the day the
Hardy  shareholders elected the form of consideration they wished to receive. As
a  result  of the Hardy Acquisition, the Company also acquired the remaining 50%
ownership  of  PWP (as defined below), the joint venture the Company established
with Hardy in July 2001.

     The  results  of  operations  of the Hardy business will be reported in the
Company's  new  Constellation  Wines  segment  as  of  March 27, 2003. The Hardy
Acquisition  is significant and the Company expects it to have a material impact
on  the  Company's  future  results  of  operations, financial position and cash
flows.

results  of  operations of the Company since the date of acquisition.  Beginning
in Fiscal 2004, the results of operations of Forth Wines will be reported in the
Company's  new  Constellation  Wines  segment.



     PACIFIC WINE PARTNERS

     Pacific  Wine  Partners  LLC  ("PWP")  produces, markets and sells a global
portfolio  of premium wine in the United States, including a range of Australian
imports.  As  a  result  of  the  Hardy  Acquisition,  PWP became a wholly-owned
subsidiary  of  the  Company.  Accordingly,  its  results  of operations will be
consolidated  and  reported  in  the  Company's new Constellation Wines segment.

     On  July  31, 2001, the Company and Hardy completed the formation of PWP, a
joint  venture  owned  equally  by the Company and Hardy. In connection with the
initial formation of the joint venture, PWP was given the exclusive distribution
rights in the United States and the Caribbean to seven brands - Banrock Station,
Hardys,  Leasingham,  Barossa Valley Estate and Chateau Reynella from Australia;
Nobilo  from  New Zealand; and La Baume from France. The joint venture also owns
Farallon,  a premium California coastal wine. In addition, PWP owns a winery and
controls  1,400  acres of vineyards, all located in Monterey County, California.

     On  October 16, 2001, the Company announced that PWP completed the purchase
of  certain  assets of Blackstone Winery, including the Blackstone brand and the
Codera  wine  business  in  Sonoma  County.

     The  investment  in   PWP  is  accounted  for  using  the  equity   method;
accordingly,  the  results  of  operations of PWP since July 31, 2001, have been
included  in  the  equity  in earnings of joint venture line in the Consolidated
Statements  of  Income  of  the  Company.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
- ---------------------

FISCAL 2003 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2002

     NET SALES

     The  following  table sets forth the net sales (in thousands of dollars) by
operating segment of the Company for Fiscal 2003 and Fiscal 2002.



     Net  sales  for  Fiscal  2003  increased  to $2,731.6 million from $2,606.8
million  for  Fiscal 2002, an increase of $124.9 million, or 4.8%. This increase
resulted  primarily  from increased sales of imported beer and impact of foreign
currency changes of $50.7 million in the U.K. Brands and Wholesale segment. Also
contributing  to  the  sales growth were increased sales in U.K. wholesale (on a
local  currency  basis), fine wine and spirits, offset by lower bulk wine, grape
juice concentrate, Popular and Premium branded wine and U.K. branded sales (on a
local  currency  basis).

     POPULAR AND PREMIUM WINE

     Net  sales  for  the  Popular  and  Premium  Wine  segment  for Fiscal 2003
decreased  to  $749.4 million from $778.0 million for Fiscal 2002, a decrease of
$28.6  million,  or  (3.7)%.  Other sales declined $14.7 million, or (20.6)%, on
lower  bulk wine and grape juice concentrate sales. Branded sales declined $13.9
million,  or  (2.0)%,  on lower volume offset slightly by higher average selling
prices.  Volumes  were negatively impacted as a result of increased  promotional
spending  in  the industry, which the Company did not participate in heavily. In
this  competitive  pricing environment, the Company continues to be selective in
its  promotional  activities,  focusing instead on growth areas, long-term brand
building  initiatives  and  increased  profitability.

     IMPORTED BEER AND SPIRITS

     Net  sales  for  the  Imported  Beer  and  Spirits  segment for Fiscal 2003
increased to $1,058.3 million from $1,001.7 million for Fiscal 2002, an increase
of  $56.7  million,  or  5.7%.  This  increase  resulted  primarily from a $49.1
million  increase in imported beer sales.  The growth in imported beer sales was
due  to  a  price  increase  on the Company's Mexican beer portfolio, which took
effect  in  the  first  quarter  of  Fiscal  2003.  Spirits sales increased $7.6
million  due  primarily  to  increased  bulk  whiskey sales, along with a slight
increase  in  branded  sales.

     U.K. BRANDS AND WHOLESALE

     Net  sales  for  the  U.K.  Brands  and  Wholesale  segment for Fiscal 2003
increased  to $789.8 million from $719.9 million for Fiscal 2002, an increase of
$69.9  million,  or 9.7%.  This  increase resulted  from  the  impact of foreign
currency  changes  of  $50.7  million  and  a  $28.6  million   local   currency
increase  in



wholesale sales  due  to  the  addition  of  new accounts and increased  average
delivery  sizes,  partially  offset  by a $9.4 million local currency decline in
branded  sales as a decrease in cider sales was partially offset by increases in
wine  sales.

     FINE WINE

     Net  sales  for  the  Fine Wine segment for Fiscal 2003 increased to $155.8
million  from  $131.9  million for Fiscal 2002, an increase of $23.8 million, or
18.1%.  This  increase  resulted  from an additional four months of sales of the
brands  acquired in the Ravenswood Acquisition, completed in July 2001, of $14.1
million,  as  well  as  growth  in the Ravenswood, Simi, Estancia and Franciscan
brands.  The  growth was due to higher sales volumes led by Ravenswood and Simi,
partially  offset  by  higher promotional costs and a shift towards lower priced
brands.

     GROSS PROFIT

     The Company's gross profit increased to $760.7 million for Fiscal 2003 from
$695.2  million  for  Fiscal  2002,  an increase of $65.6 million, or 9.4%.  The
dollar  increase  in  gross profit resulted from higher imported beer sales, the
additional  four  months  of  sales  of  the  brands  acquired in the Ravenswood
Acquisition  (completed  in  July 2001), a favorable mix of sales towards higher
margin  products,  particularly  popular  and  premium  wine  and tequila, lower
average  wine and spirits costs, and a favorable foreign currency impact.  These
increases  were partially offset by higher average imported beer costs and lower
concentrate  and bulk wine sales.  As a result of the foregoing, gross profit as
a  percent of net sales increased to 27.8% for Fiscal 2003 from 26.7% for Fiscal
2002.

     SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

     Selling,  general  and  administrative expenses decreased to $351.0 million
for Fiscal 2003 from $352.7 million for Fiscal 2002, a decrease of $1.7 million,
or  (0.5)%. The Company adopted SFAS No. 142 on March 1, 2002, and, accordingly,
stopped  amortizing  goodwill  and  other  indefinite  lived  intangible assets.
Therefore,  the decrease of $1.7 million consists of a decrease of $27.3 million
of amortization expense from Fiscal 2002 offset by an increase of $25.6 million.
The  increase  resulted  primarily from increased personnel costs to support the
Company's  growth,  higher  selling  costs  to  support  the  growth in the U.K.
wholesale  business,  and  increased  advertising  costs  on certain popular and
premium   wine  brands  and  imported   beer  brands.   Selling,   general   and
administrative  expenses as a percent of net sales decreased to 12.8% for Fiscal
2003  as compared to 13.5% for Fiscal 2002. This decrease was due to the reduced
amortization expense noted above partially offset by (i) the percent increase in
general  and  administrative  expenses growing at a faster rate than the percent
change  in the Corporate Operations and Other, Popular and Premium Wine and U.K.
Brands  and  Wholesale segments' net sales, and (ii) the percent increase in the
U.K. Brands and Wholesale segment's selling costs being greater than the percent
increase  in  U.K.  Brands  and  Wholesale  segment's  net  sales.

     RESTRUCTURING CHARGES

     The  Company's  Popular and Premium Wine segment recorded a property, plant
and  equipment  impairment of $4.8 million in Fiscal 2003 in connection with the
planned  closure of two of its production facilities in Fiscal 2004. The Company
has  begun  the  realignment  of  its business operations within the Popular and
Premium  Wine  segment  to further improve productivity. This realignment is not
expected  to  have  an  impact  on brand sales. As part of this realignment, the
Company expects  to incur an additional  $6.7  million in charges, primarily  in
cash, during  Fiscal 2004 within the Constellation Wine segment. No such charges
were incurred in Fiscal 2002.



     In  connection  with the Hardy Acquisition, the Company expects to record a
restructuring  charge  related to the integration of Hardy in the amount of $3.2
million  in  Fiscal 2004.  In addition, the Company expects to record a one-time
charge  in  the  amount of $8.2 million in Fiscal 2004 for the write-off of bank
fees related to the repayment of the Company's senior credit facility.

     OPERATING INCOME

     The following table sets forth the operating income (loss) (in thousands of
dollars)  by  operating  segment of the Company for Fiscal 2003 and Fiscal 2002.



     As  a  result  of  the  above factors, operating income increased to $405.0
million  for  Fiscal  2003  from  $342.5 million for Fiscal 2002, an increase of
$62.5  million,  or  18.2%. Fiscal 2002 operating income for Popular and Premium
Wine,  Imported  Beer  and  Spirits,  U.K.  Brands  and Wholesale and  Fine Wine
included  amortization  expense of $8.9 million, $8.2 million, $5.9 million, and
$4.3  million,  respectively.

     GAIN ON CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

     In  February  2003,  the  Company  entered  into  a foreign currency collar
contract  in  connection  with  the Hardy Acquisition to lock in a range for the
cost  of  the  acquisition  in  U.S.  dollars.  As  of  February  28, 2003, this
derivative  instrument  had a fair value of $23.1 million. Under SFAS No. 133, a
transaction  that  involves  a  business  combination  is not eligible for hedge
accounting  treatment. As such, the derivative was recorded on the balance sheet
at its fair value with the change in the fair value recognized separately on the
Company's  Consolidated  Statement  of  Income.

     In the first quarter of Fiscal 2004, the Company will record an  additional
gain  of  $4.1  million  related  to  the  settlement  of  the  foreign currency
derivative  instruments  entered into in conjunction with the Hardy Acquisition.

     INTEREST EXPENSE, NET

     Net  interest  expense  decreased  to  $105.4  million for Fiscal 2003 from
$114.2  million  for  Fiscal  2002,  a decrease of $8.8 million, or (7.7)%.  The
decrease  resulted  from both a decrease in the average borrowings for the  year
and  a  decrease  in  the  average  interest  rate.

     PROVISIONS FOR INCOME TAXES

     The  Company's  effective tax rate for Fiscal 2003 was 39.3% as compared to
40.0%  for  Fiscal  2002 as a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 142 on March 1,
2002.



     NET INCOME

     As  a  result  of the above factors, net income increased to $203.3 million
for  Fiscal  2003  from  $136.4  million  for  Fiscal 2002, an increase of $66.9
million,  or 49.0%.

FISCAL 2002 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2001

     NET SALES

     The  following  table sets forth the net sales (in thousands of dollars) by
operating segment of the Company for Fiscal 2002 and Fiscal 2001.



     Net  sales  for  Fiscal  2002  increased  to $2,606.8 million from $2,226.0
million for Fiscal 2001, an increase of $380.7 million, or 17.1%.

     POPULAR AND PREMIUM WINE

     Net  sales  for  the  Popular  and  Premium  Wine  segment  for Fiscal 2002
increased  to $778.0 million from $634.0 million for Fiscal 2001, an increase of
$144.0  million, or 22.7%.  This increase resulted primarily from $158.5 million
of  sales  of  the  newly  acquired  brands  from  the  Turner  Road  Vintners



Assets and Corus Assets acquisitions (the "March Acquisitions"), both  completed
in March 2001. This increase was partially offset by declines in the Popular and
Premium  Wine  segment's grape juice concentrate business and certain other wine
brands.

     IMPORTED BEER AND SPIRITS

     Net  sales  for  the  Imported  Beer  and  Spirits  segment for Fiscal 2002
increased  to  $1,001.7 million from $896.8 million for Fiscal 2001, an increase
of  $104.9  million,  or  11.7%.  This  increase resulted primarily from a 14.7%
increase  in  imported  beer  sales,  led  by  volume growth in the Mexican beer
portfolio.  Spirits  sales increased slightly primarily from an increase in bulk
whiskey  sales,  partially  offset  by slightly lower branded spirits sales as a
result  of  lower  net  selling  prices from the implementation of a net pricing
strategy  in  the  third  quarter  of  Fiscal 2001, which also resulted in lower
promotion costs.

     U.K. BRANDS AND WHOLESALE

     Net  sales  for  the  U.K.  Brands  and  Wholesale  segment for Fiscal 2002
increased  to $719.9 million from $631.0 million for Fiscal 2001, an increase of
$88.9  million,  or  14.1%.  This  increase resulted from a 27.1% local currency
basis  increase in wholesale sales, with the majority of this growth coming from
organic sales, and a 7.4% local currency basis increase in  branded  sales, with
an increase in wine sales  being  partially offset by a decrease in cider sales,
partially offset by a 22.9% adverse foreign currency impact.

     FINE WINE

     Net  sales  for  the  Fine Wine segment for Fiscal 2002 increased to $131.9
million  from  $88.7  million  for Fiscal 2001, an increase of $43.2 million, or
48.7%.  This  increase resulted primarily from $30.4 million of net sales of the
newly  acquired  brands from the Ravenswood Acquisition and organic sales growth
primarily  due  to  volume  increases in the Estancia, Veramonte, and Franciscan
brands.

     GROSS PROFIT

     The Company's gross profit increased to $695.2 million for Fiscal 2002 from
$578.9  million  for  Fiscal 2001, an increase of $116.2 million, or 20.1%.  The
dollar  increase  in  gross  profit  resulted  primarily from sales of the newly
acquired  brands  from  the  March  Acquisitions and the Ravenswood Acquisition,
volume growth in the Imported Beer and Spirits segment's Mexican beer portfolio,
volume  growth  in  the  Fine Wine segment's portfolio, and volume growth in the
U.K.  Brands  and  Wholesale  segment's wholesale business and branded business.
These  increases  were  partially  offset by a decrease in the Imported Beer and
Spirits  segment's  spirits  sales and an adverse foreign currency impact.  As a
percent of net sales, gross profit increased to 26.7% for Fiscal 2002 from 26.0%
for  Fiscal  2001,  resulting  primarily from sales of higher-margin wine brands
acquired  in  the  March  Acquisitions  and  the  Ravenswood  Acquisition.

     SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

     Selling,  general  and  administrative expenses increased to $352.7 million
for  Fiscal  2002  from  $308.1  million  for  Fiscal 2001, an increase of $44.6
million,  or  14.5%.  The dollar increase in selling, general and administrative
expenses  resulted  primarily  from an increase in advertising, selling, general
and  administrative  expenses  associated  with the brands acquired in the March
Acquisitions  and the Ravenswood Acquisition.  In addition, there were increases
in  selling,  general  and  administrative expenses associated with the Imported
Beer  and  Spirits  segment's  Mexican  beer  portfolio  volume  growth,



and  the  U.K.  Brands  and  Wholesale  segment's  wholesale  volume growth, and
increased  personnel  costs to support the Company's growth within the Corporate
Operations  and Other segment. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a
percent  of net sales decreased slightly to 13.5% for Fiscal 2002 as compared to
13.8% for Fiscal 2001 due to higher sales growth from the March Acquisitions and
the  Ravenswood Acquisition than the related selling, general and administrative
expense  growth.

     OPERATING INCOME

     The following table sets forth the operating income (loss) (in thousands of
dollars)  by  operating  segment of the Company for Fiscal 2002 and Fiscal 2001.



     As  a  result  of  the  above factors, operating income increased to $342.5
million  for  Fiscal  2002  from  $270.9 million for Fiscal 2001, an increase of
$71.6 million, or 26.4%.

     INTEREST EXPENSE, NET

     Net  interest  expense  increased  to  $114.2  million for Fiscal 2002 from
$108.6  million  for  Fiscal  2001,  an  increase of $5.6 million, or 5.1%.  The
increase resulted primarily from an increase in the average borrowings primarily
due  to  the financing of the March Acquisitions and the Ravenswood Acquisition,
partially  offset  by  a  decrease  in  the  average  interest  rate.

     NET INCOME

     As  a  result  of the above factors, net income increased to $136.4 million
for  Fiscal  2002  from  $97.3  million  for  Fiscal  2001, an increase of $39.1
million, or 40.1%.

FINANCIAL LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
- -----------------------------------------

GENERAL

     The  Company's  principal  use  of  cash in its operating activities is for
purchasing  and  carrying inventories. The Company's primary source of liquidity
has  historically  been cash flow from operations, except during the annual fall
grape  harvests  when  the  Company  has relied on short-term borrowings. In the
United States, the annual grape crush normally begins in August and runs through
October.  In Australia, the annual grape crush normally begins in March and runs
through  May. The Company generally begins purchasing grapes at the beginning of
the  crush  season with payments for such grapes beginning to come due one month
later.  The  Company's short-term borrowings to support such purchases generally
reach  their  highest levels one to two months after the crush season has ended.
Historically,  the  Company  has  used  cash  flow  from   operating  activities
to  repay  its  short-term



borrowings.  The  Company  will  continue  to  use  its short-term borrowings to
support  its  working  capital  requirements.  The  Company  believes  that cash
provided  by  operating  activities  and  its  financing  activities,  primarily
short-term  borrowings,  will  provide adequate resources to satisfy its working
capital, liquidity and anticipated capital expenditure requirements for both its
short-term  and  long-term  capital  needs.

FISCAL 2003 CASH FLOWS

     OPERATING ACTIVITIES

     Net  cash  provided  by  operating  activities  for  Fiscal 2003 was $236.1
million,  which  resulted from $256.5 million in net income adjusted for noncash
items, less $20.4 million representing the net change in the Company's operating
assets  and  liabilities.  The  net  change  in operating assets and liabilities
resulted  primarily  from  an increase in inventories and a reduction in accrued
excise  taxes  and  adverse  grape  contracts  partially  offset by increases in
accrued  income  taxes  payable  and accrued advertising and promotion expenses.

     INVESTING ACTIVITIES

     Net  cash  used  in investing activities for Fiscal 2003 was $72.0 million,
which  resulted  primarily from $71.6 million of capital expenditures (including
$7.0 million for vineyards).

     FINANCING ACTIVITIES

     Net  cash  used  in financing activities for Fiscal 2003 was $161.5 million
resulting  primarily from $151.1 million of principal payments of long-term debt
and  $51.9  million of net repayments of notes payable. These debt payments were
partially  funded  by  $28.7  million  of  proceeds  from  employee stock option
exercises  and  $10.0 million of proceeds from long-term debt which was used for
the  repayment  of  debt  at  one  of  the  Company's  Chilean  subsidiaries.

FISCAL 2002 CASH FLOWS

     OPERATING ACTIVITIES

     Net  cash  provided  by  operating  activities  for  Fiscal 2002 was $213.3
million,  which  resulted from $226.3 million in net income adjusted for noncash
items, less $13.0 million representing the net change in the Company's operating
assets  and  liabilities.  The  net  change  in operating assets and liabilities
resulted  primarily  from  increases  in  accounts  receivable  and  inventories
partially  offset  by  increases  in accounts payable, deferred revenue, accrued
salaries  and  commissions,  and  accrued  advertising  and  promotions.

     INVESTING ACTIVITIES

     Net  cash  used in investing activities for Fiscal 2002 was $585.4 million,
which  resulted  from net cash paid of $472.8 million for the March Acquisitions
and the Ravenswood Acquisition, $77.3 million of equity contributions to PWP and
$71.1  million  of capital expenditures (including $10.1 million for vineyards),
partially  offset  by  $35.8  million  of  proceeds  from  the  sale  of assets.



     FINANCING ACTIVITIES

     Net  cash  provided  by  financing  activities  for  Fiscal 2002 was $236.9
million,  which  resulted  primarily  from  proceeds  of $252.5 million from the
issuance of long-term debt, including $250 million of 8 1/8% Senior Subordinated
Notes used to repay $130.0 million of 8 3/4% Senior Subordinated Notes and $65.0
million  of  8  3/4%  Series  C  Senior  Subordinated Notes and a portion of the
Company's  borrowings  under  its senior credit facility, net proceeds of $151.5
million from equity offerings, proceeds of $51.4 million from net revolving loan
borrowings  under the senior credit facility, and proceeds of $45.0 million from
exercise  of  employee  stock  options.  These  amounts were partially offset by
principal  payments  of  long-term  debt  of  $261.0 million, which included the
repayments  as  discussed  above  and  $54.7  million  of  scheduled or required
principal  payments  under  the  Company's  senior  credit  facility.

     During  June  1998,   the  Company's  Board  of  Directors  authorized  the
repurchase  of  up  to  $100.0  million  of its Class A Common Stock and Class B
Common  Stock.  The  repurchase  of shares of common stock will be accomplished,
from  time  to  time,  in  management's  discretion  and  depending  upon market
conditions,  through  open  market  or  privately  negotiated transactions.  The
Company  may  finance such repurchases through cash generated from operations or
through the senior credit facility.  The repurchased shares will become treasury
shares.  As of May 12, 2003, the Company had purchased 4,075,344 shares of Class
A Common Stock at an  aggregate cost of  $44.9 million, or at an average cost of
$11.01  per  share.  No  shares were repurchased during Fiscal 2003, Fiscal 2002
or Fiscal 2001.

DEBT

     Total  debt  outstanding  as  of  February  28,  2003, amounted to $1,265.5
million,  a  decrease  of  $164.0  million from February 28, 2002.  The ratio of
total  debt  to total capitalization decreased to 51.9% as of February 28, 2003,
from  59.9%  as  of  February  28,  2002.

     SENIOR CREDIT FACILITIES

     2000 Credit Agreement
     ---------------------

     As  of  February  28,  2003,  under the  2000 Credit Agreement  (as defined
below),  the  Company  had  outstanding  term  loans of $145.4 million bearing a
weighted  average  interest  rate of 3.1%, $2.0 million of outstanding revolving
loans  bearing  a  weighted  average  interest  rate of 3.1%, undrawn letters of
credit  of  $15.1  million,  and  $282.9 million available to be drawn under the
Revolving  Credit  facility.  The  2000  Credit  Agreement  was  a senior credit
facility  originally  entered into between the Company, certain of its principal
operating  subsidiaries  and a syndicate of banks, for which The Chase Manhattan
Bank  acted  as  administrative  agent,  on  October  6,  1999, and subsequently
amended (the "2000 Credit Agreement").

     2003 Credit Agreement
     ---------------------

     In connection with the Hardy Acquisition, on January 16, 2003, the Company,
the  U.S.  subsidiaries of the Company (excluding certain inactive subsidiaries)
and  Canandaigua  Limited  ("Guarantors"),  JPMorgan Chase Bank, as a lender and
administrative  agent  (the  "Administrative  Agent"), and certain other lenders
(such  other  lenders,  together with the Administrative Agent, are collectively
referred  to herein as the "Lenders") entered into a new credit agreement, which
was  subsequently  amended  and  restated  on  March 19, 2003  (the "2003 Credit
Agreement").  The 2003 Credit Agreement provides for aggregate credit facilities
of  $1.6 billion consisting of a $400.0 million Tranche A Term Loan facility due
in  February 2008,  an  $800.0 million  Tranche B  Term  Loan  facility  due  in
November  2008  and  a  $400.0  million  Revolving Credit facility (including an
Australian  Dollar  revolving



sub-facility of up to A$10.0 million and a sub-facility for letters of credit of
up to $40.0 million) which expires on the fifth anniversary of the first date on
which  the  Lenders'  obligation  to  make loans under the 2003 Credit Agreement
commences.

     The required annual repayments of the Tranche A Term Loan facility is $40.0
million  in  Fiscal 2004 and increases by $20.0 million each year through fiscal
2008.  The  required  annual  repayments  of  the  Tranche B Term Loan, which is
backend  loaded, is $10.0 million in Fiscal 2004 and increases to $400.0 million
in fiscal 2009.

     The  rate  of  interest  payable, at the Company's option, is a function of
LIBOR  plus  a  margin,  the federal funds rate plus a margin, or the prime rate
plus a margin.  The margin is adjustable based upon the Company's Debt Ratio (as
defined  in  the  2003  Credit Agreement) and, with respect to LIBOR borrowings,
ranges  between  1.75%  and  2.75%.  The  initial LIBOR margin for the Revolving
Credit facility and the Tranche A Term Loan facility is 2.25%, while the initial
LIBOR margin on the Tranche B Term Loan facility is 2.75%.

     The  Company's obligations are guaranteed by the Guarantors and the Company
has pledged collateral of (i)  100% of the capital stock of all of the Company's
U.S.  subsidiaries  and  (ii)  65%  of  the  voting capital stock of Canandaigua
Limited,  Matthew  Clark  plc,  Hardy,  Constellation  Australia Pty Limited and
certain  other  foreign subsidiaries of the Company.  In addition, under certain
circumstances,  the Company and the Guarantors are required to pledge certain of
their  assets  consisting of, among other things, inventory, accounts receivable
and  trademarks  to  secure  the  obligations  under  the 2003 Credit Agreement.

     The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to customary lending covenants
including  those  restricting  additional  liens,  the  incurrence of additional
indebtedness,  the  sale  of assets, the payment of dividends, transactions with
affiliates  and  the  making  of  certain  investments,  in each case subject to
baskets, exceptions and thresholds.  The primary financial covenants require the
maintenance  of  a  debt  coverage  ratio, a senior debt coverage ratio, a fixed
charges  ratio  and  an  interest  coverage  ratio.

     The  Company  used  the  proceeds  of the Tranche A Term Loan facility, the
Tranche  B  Term  Loan  facility  and a portion of the Revolving Credit facility
under  the 2003 Credit Agreement to payoff its obligations under the 2000 Credit
Agreement,  to fund a portion of the cash required to pay the Hardy shareholders
and  to pay indebtedness outstanding under certain of Hardy's credit facilities.
The  Company  intends  to  use  the remaining availability under the 2003 Credit
Agreement  to  fund  its  working  capital  needs  on  an  ongoing  basis.

     Bridge Agreement
     ----------------

     On January 16, 2003, the Company, the Guarantors, JPMorgan Chase Bank, as a
lender  and Administrative Agent, and certain other lenders (such other lenders,
together  with  the Administrative Agent, are collectively referred to herein as
the "Bridge Lenders") entered into a bridge loan agreement which was amended and
restated  as  of March 26, 2003, containing commitments of the Bridge Lenders to
make  bridge  loans  (the  "Bridge  Loans")  of  up to, in the aggregate, $450.0
million  (the  "Bridge  Agreement").  On  April 9, 2003, the Company used $400.0
million  of  the  Bridge Loans to fund a portion of the cash required to pay the
former Hardy shareholders.  The Bridge Loans are due on the first anniversary of
the  date of the funding of the Bridge Loans ("Bridge Loan Maturity Date").  The
rate  of  interest  payable on the Bridge Loans is equal to LIBOR plus a margin.
The initial margin on the Bridge Loans is 3.75%.



     If  the  Bridge  Loans are not repaid on the Bridge Loan Maturity Date, the
Bridge  Lenders  have  committed  to  make  certain  term  loans  in  an  amount
corresponding to the then-outstanding amount of the Bridge Loans ("Term Loans").
The  Term  Loans  are  due  on  the seventh anniversary of the date on which the
Bridge  Loans  are  funded  ("Term  Loan  Maturity Date").  The rate of interest
payable  on  the  Term Loans is equal to LIBOR plus a margin.  If the Term Loans
are  not  repaid on the date that is three months after the Bridge Loan Maturity
Date,  then  the  margin will increase on a quarterly basis thereafter until the
Term  Loans  are refinanced, exchanged or otherwise repaid in full.  The rate of
interest  payable  on  any  of  the  Bridge Loans or the Term Loans is capped at
11.50% ("Rate Cap").

     The Lenders have the right to exchange on or after the Bridge Loan Maturity
Date  all  or a portion of their respective Bridge Loans or Term Loans for notes
("Exchange  Notes")  that  will be issued pursuant to an indenture to be entered
into  among  the  Company,  as  issuer,  certain subsidiaries of the Company, as
guarantors,  and  an  indenture trustee on behalf of the holders of the Exchange
Notes.  The  Exchange Notes indenture will be in a form to be agreed between the
Company and the Administrative Agent and will contain terms and a final maturity
date  that  are substantially consistent with the terms and the maturity date of
the  Term  Loans.  The  Exchange  Notes  will  bear  interest at a fixed rate as
determined  by  the  exchanging  holder  that  will  not  exceed  the  Rate Cap.

     The  Guarantors  have guaranteed the Company's obligations under the Bridge
Agreement.

     The  Company  and  the  Guarantors  have  made  certain representations and
warranties  in  the  Bridge  Agreement  which  are substantially the same as the
representations  and  warranties  in  the  2003  Credit  Agreement.  The  Bridge
Agreement  also contains covenants and events of default that are similar to the
covenants  and events of default in the indentures pursuant to which the Company
issued  its  senior  notes  and  senior  subordinated  notes.

     SENIOR NOTES

     On  August  4,  1999, the Company issued $200.0 million aggregate principal
amount  of 8 5/8% Senior Notes due August 2006 (the "August 1999 Senior Notes").
Interest  on  the August 1999 Senior Notes is payable semiannually on February 1

million aggregate principal amount of Sterling Series C Senior Notes (as defined
below) for (pound) 74.0 million of the Sterling Series B Notes. The terms of the
Sterling  Series  C  Senior  Notes  are  identical  in   all  material  respects

As  of  February 28, 2003, the Company had outstanding (pound) 1.0 million ($1.6
million) aggregate principal amount of Sterling Series B Senior Notes.

     On  May  15,  2000, the Company issued (pound) 80.0 million ($120.0 million

issuance,  net  of $0.6 million unamortized discount, with an effective interest
rate  of  8.6%)  (the "Sterling Series C Senior Notes"). The net proceeds of the
offering  ((pound) 78.8 million, or $118.2 million) were used to repay a portion
of  the  Company's  British  pound  sterling  borrowings under its then existing
senior  credit  facility.  Interest  on  the  Sterling  Series C Senior Notes is
payable  semiannually  on  May  15 and November 15. The Sterling Series C Senior
Notes  are  redeemable at the option of the Company, in whole or in part, at any
time.  The  Sterling  Series C Senior Notes are unsecured senior obligations and
rank  equally  in  right  of payment to all existing and future unsecured senior
indebtedness  of the Company. The Sterling Series C Senior Notes are guaranteed,
on  a  senior  basis,   by  certain  of  the  Company's  significant   operating
subsidiaries. As of February 28, 2003, the Company had outstanding (pound) 154.0
million  ($241.7  million,  net  of $0.5 million unamortized discount) aggregate
principal  amount  of  Sterling  Series  C  Senior  Notes.

     On February 21, 2001, the Company issued $200.0 million aggregate principal
amount  of 8% Senior Notes due February 2008 (the "February 2001 Senior Notes").
The  net  proceeds  of the offering ($197.0 million) were used to partially fund
the  acquisition  of  the  Turner Road Vintners Assets. Interest on the February
2001  Senior  Notes  is  payable  semiannually on February 15 and August 15. The
February 2001 Senior Notes are redeemable at the option of the Company, in whole
or  in  part,  at  any time. The February 2001 Senior Notes are unsecured senior

terms  of  the February 2001 Series B Senior Notes are identical in all material
respects  to  the  February  2001  Senior  Notes.

     SENIOR SUBORDINATED NOTES

     On  March  4,  1999,  the Company issued $200.0 million aggregate principal
amount  of 8 1/2% Senior Subordinated Notes due March 2009 ("Senior Subordinated
Notes").  Interest  on  the Senior Subordinated Notes is payable semiannually on

were  used  primarily  to repay the Company's $195.0 million aggregate principal
amount  of  8 3/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due in December 2003. In connection
with  this repayment, the Company incurred an extraordinary loss of $2.6 million
($1.6  million, net of income taxes of $1.0 million) related to the write-off of
the  remaining  deferred financing costs and unamortized discount. The remaining

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS

     The  following  table  sets forth information about the Company's long-term
contractual  obligations  outstanding  at  February 28, 2003. It brings together
data  for easy reference from the consolidated balance sheet and from individual
notes to the Company's consolidated financial statements. See Note 9 and Note 14
to  the  Company's  consolidated  financial statements located in Item 8 of this
Annual  Report  on Form 10-K for detailed discussion of items noted in the table
below.



     The  above  table  includes  the  payments due by period as of February 28,
2003,  and  includes  the  required payments under the then existing 2000 Credit
Agreement.  Subsequent  to February 28, 2003, the Company drew down $8.0 million
in  revolving  debt and $1,200.0 million in term loan debt under the 2003 Credit
Agreement  and $400.0 million under the Bridge Agreement. The Company used these
proceeds to payoff the Company's obligations under the 2000 Credit Agreement, to
fund  the  cash  required  to pay the Hardy shareholders and to pay indebtedness
outstanding  under  certain  of  Hardy's  credit  facilities.  Consequently, the
following  table  gives  the  payments  due  by period taking into account these
changes:





     In  addition,  in  connection  with  the  formation  of the Company's joint
venture,  PWP,  in  July  2001,  the Company transferred certain of its vineyard
lease and vineyard management agreements to PWP.  The agreements have terms that
expire  between  2012  and  2026.  The  Company  guaranteed  PWP's  payment  and
performance  under  these  agreements.  The  estimated  maximum  amount  of  the
Company's  exposure  is  $42.6  million  in  undiscounted  future payments.  The
Company  has not recorded a liability for these guarantees and does not have any
collateral  from  PWP.

EQUITY OFFERINGS

     During  March  2001,  the  Company completed a public offering of 8,740,000
shares  of  its  Class  A  Common Stock, which was held as treasury stock.  This
resulted  in net proceeds to the Company, after deducting underwriting discounts
and  expenses, of $139.4 million.  The net proceeds were used to repay revolving
loan borrowings under the senior credit facility of which a portion was incurred
to  partially  finance  the  acquisition  of  the  Turner  Road Vintners Assets.

     During  October 2001, the Company sold 645,000 shares of its Class A Common
Stock, which was held as treasury stock, in connection with a public offering of
Class  A  Common  Stock by stockholders of the Company.  The net proceeds to the
Company,  after  deducting underwriting discounts, of $12.1 million were used to
repay  borrowings  under  the  senior  credit  facility.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES

     During  Fiscal  2003,  the  Company  incurred  $71.6  million  for  capital
expenditures,  including $7.0 million related to vineyards. The Company plans to
spend  approximately  $120  million  for  capital   expenditures,  exclusive  of
vineyards,  in  Fiscal  2004. In addition, the Company continues to consider the
purchase,  lease  and  development  of   vineyards  and  may   incur  additional
expenditures  for  vineyards  if opportunities become available. See "Business -
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials" under Item 1 of this Annual Report on
Form  10-K.  Management reviews the capital expenditure program periodically and
modifies  it  as  required  to  meet  current  business  needs.

RELATED PARTIES

     Agustin  Francisco Huneeus, the executive in charge of the Fiscal 2003 Fine
Wine  segment, along with other members of his immediate family, through various
family  owned entities (the "Huneeus Interests") engaged in certain transactions
with  the  Fine  Wine segment during each of the three years in the period ended
February  28,  2003.  The  Huneeus Interests engage the Fine Wine segment as the
exclusive  distributor  of  its Quintessa wines under a long-term contract; sell
grapes  to the Fine Wine segment pursuant to existing long-term contracts; lease
a  vineyard consisting of 67 acres to the Fine Wine segment pursuant to a 5-year
lease  contract;  participate  as  partners  with  the  Fine Wine segment in the
ownership  and  operation  of  a winery and vineyards in Chile; and render brand
management  and  other consulting and advisory services in the United States and
internationally  to the Fine Wine segment and the Company.  Total amounts to the
Huneeus  Interests  pursuant to these transactions and arrangements totaled $6.5
million,  $4.8  million, and $5.0 million for the years ended February 28, 2003,
February  28,  2002, and February 28, 2001, respectively.  In addition, the Fine
Wine  segment  performs  certain  wine  processing  services  for  the   Huneeus
Interests.  Total  fees  earned  from  the  Huneeus  Interests  to the Fine Wine
segment  for these services totaled $0.2 million, $0.4 million, and $0.6 million
for the years ended February 28, 2003, February 28, 2002, and February 28, 2001,
respectively.  As  of  February 28, 2003, and February 28, 2002, the net amounts
due  to/from  the  Huneeus  Interests  under these agreements are insignificant.



EFFECTS OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES

     The  Company's  results of operations and financial condition have not been
significantly  affected  by  inflation and changing prices. The Company has been
able,  subject  to  normal  competitive  conditions,  to pass along rising costs
through  increased selling prices. There can be no assurances, however, that the
Company  will  continue  to be able to pass along rising costs through increased
selling prices.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     The  Company's  significant accounting policies are more fully described in
Note  1  to the Company's consolidated financial statements located in Item 8 of
this  Annual  Report  on Form 10-K. However, certain of the Company's accounting
policies  are particularly important to the portrayal of the Company's financial
position  and  results  of operations and require the application of significant
judgment  by  the  Company's  management;  as  a  result  they are subject to an
inherent  degree  of  uncertainty.  In  applying  those  policies, the Company's
management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used
in  the  determination  of  certain  estimates. Those estimates are based on the
Company's  historical  experience,  the  Company's  observance  of trends in the
industry,  information  provided  by  the  Company's  customers  and information
available  from  other outside sources, as appropriate. On an ongoing basis, the
Company  reviews its estimates to ensure that they appropriately reflect changes
in the Company's business.  The Company's critical accounting  policies include:

     -  Accounting  for  promotional  activities. Gross sales reflect reductions
        attributable  to  consideration  given  to customers in various customer
        incentive  programs, including pricing discounts on single transactions,
        volume  discounts,  promotional and advertising allowances, coupons, and
        rebates.  Certain  customer  incentive  programs  require  management to
        estimate  the  cost  of  those programs. The accrued liability for these
        programs  is determined through analysis of programs offered, historical
        trends,  expectations  regarding  customer  and  consumer participation,
        sales  and   payment  trends,  and  experience  with  payment   patterns
        associated  with  similar  programs that had been previously offered. If
        assumptions included in the Company's estimates were to change or market
        conditions  were  to  change,  then  material  incremental reductions to
        revenue could be required, which would have a material adverse impact on
        the  Company's  financial  statements.  Promotional  costs  were  $231.6
        million,  $223.9 million and $178.5 million for Fiscal 2003, Fiscal 2002
        and  Fiscal  2001,  respectively.

     -  Inventory  valuation.  Inventories  are  stated  at the lower of cost or
        market,  cost  being  determined  on the first-in, first-out method. The
        Company  assesses  the  valuation  of  its  inventories  and reduces the
        carrying  value  of  those inventories that are obsolete or in excess of
        the  Company's forecasted usage to their estimated net realizable value.
        The Company estimates the net realizable value of such inventories based
        on  analyses  and  assumptions including, but not limited to, historical
        usage, future demand and market requirements. Reductions to the carrying
        value  of  inventories are recorded in cost of goods sold. If the future
        demand  for  the Company's products is less favorable than the Company's
        forecasts,  then  the  value  of  the  inventories may be required to be
        reduced,  which  could  result  in  material  additional  expense to the
        Company  and  have  a material adverse impact on the Company's financial
        statements.

     -  Accounting for business combinations.   The acquisition of businesses is
        an  important  element of  the Company's  strategy.   Under the purchase
        method,  the  Company  is  required  to  record



        the  net  assets  acquired  at  the  estimated fair value at the date of
        acquisition.  The determination of the fair value of the assets acquired
        and  liabilities  assumed  requires  the  Company  to make estimates and
        assumptions that affect the Company's financial statements. For example,
        the  Company's  acquisitions  typically  result  in  goodwill  and other
        intangible  assets;  the  value  and  estimated life of those assets may
        affect  the  amount of future period amortization expense for intangible
        assets with finite lives as well as possible impairment charges that may
        be  incurred.

     -  Impairment  of  goodwill  and  intangible  assets with indefinite lives.
        Intangible  assets with indefinite lives consist primarily of trademarks
        as well as distributor and agency relationships. The Company is required
        to  analyze  its  goodwill  and  other intangible assets with indefinite
        lives  for  impairment  on  an  annual  basis as well as when events and
        circumstances  indicate  that  an  impairment may have occurred. Certain
        factors  that  may occur and indicate that an impairment exists include,
        but  are  not limited to, operating results that are lower than expected
        and  adverse  industry or market economic trends. The impairment testing
        requires  management  to  estimate  the  fair  value  of  the  assets or
        reporting  unit  and  record  an  impairment  loss for the excess of the
        carrying  value  over  the fair value. The estimate of fair value of the
        assets  is  generally  determined on the basis of discounted future cash
        flows.  The  estimate  of  fair value of the reporting unit is generally
        determined  on the basis of discounted future cash flows supplemented by
        the  market approach. In estimating the fair value, management must make
        assumptions  and  projections regarding such items as future cash flows,
        future revenues, future earnings and other factors. The assumptions used
        in  the  estimate  of  fair value are generally consistent with the past
        performance  of  each reporting unit and other intangible assets and are
        also  consistent  with  the projections and assumptions that are used in
        current  operating  plans.  Such  assumptions are subject to change as a
        result  of  changing  economic  and  competitive  conditions.  If  these
        estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, the Company
        may  be  required  to  record  an  impairment loss for these assets. The
        recording of any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse
        impact  on  the  Company's  financial  statements.

ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS NOT YET ADOPTED

     In  August  2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.  143 ("SFAS No. 143"), "Accounting for
Asset  Retirement  Obligations." SFAS No. 143 addresses financial accounting and
reporting  for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived
assets  and  the  associated  retirement costs. As required, the Company adopted
SFAS  No.  143  on  March  1,  2003. The adoption of SFAS No. 143 did not have a
material  impact  on  the  Company's  financial  statements.

     In April 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.  145 ("SFAS No. 145"), "Rescission of FASB
Statements  No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical
Corrections."  SFAS No. 145 rescinds Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No.  4 ("SFAS No. 4"), "Reporting Gains and Losses from Extinguishment of Debt,"
Statement  of  Financial Accounting Standards No. 44, "Accounting for Intangible
Assets  of  Motor Carriers," and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
64,  "Extinguishments  of  Debt  Made  to Satisfy Sinking-Fund Requirements." In
addition,  SFAS  No.  145 amends Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
13,  "Accounting  for  Leases,"  to  eliminate an inconsistency between required
accounting  for  sale-leaseback  transactions  and  the  required accounting for
certain  lease  modifications  that  have  economic  effects that are similar to
sale-leaseback  transactions.  Lastly,  SFAS  No. 145 also amends other existing
authoritative  pronouncements  to  make  various  technical



corrections,  clarify  meanings,  or  describe their applicability under changed
conditions.  The  Company  is  required  to  adopt the provisions related to the
rescission  of  SFAS  No.  4 for fiscal years beginning March 1, 2003. All other
provisions  of  SFAS  No. 145 were effective for fiscal years beginning March 1,
2002.  The  adoption of the applicable provisions of SFAS No. 145 did not have a
material  impact  on  the  Company's  financial  statements. The adoption of the
provisions  rescinding  SFAS  No.  4  will  result  in a reclassification of the
extraordinary  loss related to the extinguishment of debt recorded in the fourth
quarter  of  Fiscal  2002  ($1.6  million,  net  of income taxes), by increasing
selling,  general  and administrative expenses ($2.6 million) and decreasing the
provision  for  income  taxes  ($1.0  million).

     In  November  2002,  the  Emerging  Issues  Task  Force  ("EITF") reached a
consensus on EITF Issue No. 00-21 ("EITF No. 00-21"), "Revenue Arrangements with
Multiple  Deliverables."  EITF  No.  00-21  addresses  certain  aspects  of  the
accounting  by  a  vendor  for arrangements under which it will perform multiple
revenue-generating  activities.  EITF  No.  00-21 also addresses how arrangement
consideration  should  be  measured  and  allocated  to  the  separate  units of
accounting  in the arrangement.  The Company is required to adopt EITF No. 00-21
for all revenue arrangements entered into beginning August 1, 2003.  The Company
is  currently  assessing the financial impact of EITF No. 00-21 on its financial
statements.

     In  December  2002,  the  FASB  issued  Statement  of  Financial Accounting
Standards No. 148 ("SFAS No. 148"), "Accounting  for Stock-Based  Compensation -
Transition  and  Disclosure."   SFAS  No.  148  amends   Statement of  Financial
Accounting  Standards  No. 123  ("SFAS No. 123"),  "Accounting  for  Stock-Based
Compensation,"  to provide alternative  methods of transition for an entity that
voluntarily  changes  to  the  fair  value   based  method  of  accounting   for
stock-based  employee  compensation.  SFAS  No.  148  also amends the disclosure
provisions  of SFAS No. 123 to require prominent disclosure about the effects on
reported  net  income of an entity's accounting policy decisions with respect to
stock-based  employee  compensation.  Lastly,  SFAS  No.  148  amends Accounting
Principles  Board  Opinion  No.  28  ("APB  Opinion No. 28"), "Interim Financial
Reporting,"  to  require  disclosure  about  those  effects in interim financial
information.  The  Company has adopted the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 148
for  the  fiscal year ended February 28, 2003.  The Company is required to adopt
the  amendment  to APB Opinion No. 28 for financial reports containing condensed
financial statements for interim periods beginning March 1, 2003.

     In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46 ("FIN No. 46"),
"Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities - an interpretation of ARB No. 51."
FIN  No.  46  requires  all variable interest entities to be consolidated by the
primary  beneficiary.  The  primary  beneficiary  is  the  entity that holds the
majority  of  the  beneficial  interests  in  the  variable  interest entity. In
addition,  the  interpretation expands disclosure requirements for both variable
interest  entities  that  are consolidated as well as variable interest entities
from  which  the  entity is the holder of a significant amount of the beneficial
interests,  but  not  the  majority.  Since the Company has no transactions with
variable  interest entities, the Company does not expect the adoption of FIN No.
46  in  its  entirety  to  have  a significant impact on the Company's financial
statements.

     In  April 2003, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No.  149 ("SFAS No. 149"), "Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments
and  Hedging Activities." SFAS No. 149 amends and clarifies financial accounting
and  reporting  for   derivative  instruments,   including  certain   derivative
instruments  embedded   in  other  contracts   (collectively   referred  to   as
derivatives)  and  for  hedging  activities  under  SFAS No. 133.  SFAS No.  149
is  effective  for  contracts  entered  into  or  modified  after June 30, 2003,
and  hedging  relationships  designated   after   June  30,  2003,   except  for
those  provisions  of  SFAS  No. 149 which relate to SFAS No. 133 Implementation
Issues that have  been  effective  for  fiscal  quarters  that  began  prior  to
June 15, 2003.   For  these  issues,  the  provisions  that  are  currently   in
effect  should  continue  to  be  applied  in  accordance with  their respective
effective  dates.  In  addition, certain



provisions  of  SFAS  No.  149,  which  relate  to forward purchases or sales of
when-issued  securities  or  other  securities  that do not yet exist, should be
applied to both existing contracts and new contracts entered into after June 30,
2003. The Company is currently assessing the financial impact of SFAS No. 149 on
its  financial  statements.

           CAUTIONARY INFORMATION REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

     This  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K  contains "forward-looking statements"
within  the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E
of  the  Securities  Exchange  Act of 1934. These forward-looking statements are
subject  to  a  number  of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the
Company's  control,  that  could  cause actual results to differ materially from
those  set  forth  in,  or  implied  by,  such  forward-looking  statements. All
statements  other  than  statements  of historical facts included in this Annual
Report on Form 10-K, including the statements under Item 1 "Business" and Item 7
"Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial Condition and Results of
Operations"   regarding  the  Company's  business  strategy,  future   financial
position,  prospects, plans and objectives of management, as well as information
concerning  expected  actions  of  third parties are forward-looking statements.
When  used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the words "anticipate," "intend,"
"expect,"  and  similar  expressions  are  intended  to identify forward-looking
statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain such identifying
words.  All  forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Annual
Report  on  Form  10-K. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise
any  forward-looking  statements, whether as a result of new information, future
events  or  otherwise.  Although  the  Company  believes  that  the expectations
reflected  in  the  forward-looking  statements  are  reasonable, it can give no
assurance  that  such  expectations will prove to be correct. In addition to the
risks  and uncertainties of ordinary business operations, important factors that
could  cause  actual  results  to  differ materially from those set forth in, or
implied,  by  the  Company's forward-looking statements contained in this Annual
Report on Form 10-K are as follows:

THE COMPANY'S INDEBTEDNESS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS FINANCIAL
HEALTH.

     The  Company   has  incurred  substantial   indebtedness  to  finance   its
acquisitions  and may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future to
finance  further  acquisitions  or for other purposes.  The Company's ability to
satisfy  its  financial obligations under the Company's indebtedness outstanding
from  time  to time will depend upon the Company's future operating performance,
which is subject to prevailing economic conditions, levels of interest rates and
financial,  business  and  other factors, many of which are beyond the Company's
control.  Therefore, there can be no assurance that the Company's cash flow from
operations  will  be sufficient to meet all of its debt service requirements and
to  fund  its  capital  expenditure  requirements.

     The  Company's  current  and  future debt service obligations and covenants
could  have  important consequences.  Such consequences include, or may include,
the  following:

     -    the  Company's ability  to obtain financing for future working capital
          needs  or  acquisitions  or  other  purposes  may  be  limited;

     -    a  significant  portion of  the Company's  cash flow  from  operations
          will  be  dedicated  to  the  payment of principal and interest on its
          indebtedness,  thereby   reducing  funds  available  for   operations,
          expansion  or  distributions;

     -    the  Company is subject to restrictive covenants that could limit  its
          ability  to  conduct  its  business; and



     -    the Company  may  be  more vulnerable to adverse  economic  conditions
          than  less  leveraged  competitors  and,  thus,  may be limited in its
          ability  to  withstand  competitive  pressures.

     The restrictive covenants included in the Company's senior credit facility,
its bridge loan agreement and its indentures include, among others, restrictions
in  relation  to  additional borrowings, the sale of assets, changes of control,
the   payment  of  dividends,  transactions  with  affiliates,  the  making   of
investments  and  certain other fundamental changes.  The senior credit facility
and  the  bridge  loan  agreement  also contain restrictions on acquisitions and
certain  financial  ratio  tests  including a debt coverage ratio, a senior debt
coverage  ratio,  a  fixed  charges ratio and an interest coverage ratio.  These
restrictions  could  limit the Company's ability to conduct business.  A failure
to  comply  with  the  obligations  contained in the senior credit facility, the
bridge loan agreement, its indentures or in follow-on financings could result in
an  event  of  default under such agreements, which could require the Company to
immediately repay the related debt and also debt under other agreements that may
contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions.

THE COMPANY'S ACQUISITION OR JOINT VENTURE STRATEGIES MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL.

     The  Company  has  made a number of mergers and acquisitions, including the
recent  acquisitions  of Hardy, Ravenswood, the Turner Road Vintners Assets, and
the  Corus  Assets,  and  anticipates  that  it  may, from time to time, acquire
additional  businesses,  assets  or  securities  of  companies  that the Company
believes  would  provide  a  strategic fit with its business.   In addition, the
Company has entered joint ventures and may enter into additional joint ventures.
Acquired  businesses  will  need  to  be  integrated with the Company's existing
operations.  There  can  be  no  assurance  that  the  Company  will effectively
assimilate  the  business  or  product  offerings of acquired companies into its
business  or  product  offerings.  Acquisitions are accompanied by risks such as
potential exposure to unknown liabilities of acquired companies and the possible
loss  of key employees and customers of the acquired business.  Acquisitions are
subject  to  risks associated with the difficulty and expense of integrating the
operations  and personnel of the acquired companies, the potential disruption to
the  Company's business and the diversion of management time and attention.  The
Company  shares control of its existing joint ventures and may not have majority
interest  or control of future joint ventures, and, therefore, there is the risk
that  the  Company's  joint  venture  partners  may  at  any time have economic,
business  or  legal  interests  or goals that are inconsistent with those of the
joint  venture  or  the  Company.  There  is  also risk that the Company's joint
venture  partners  may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations and
that  the  Company  may  be  required  to  fulfill those obligations alone.  The
Company's  failure  or the failure of an entity in which the Company has a joint
venture interest to adequately manage the risks associated with any acquisitions
or  joint  ventures  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on the Company's
financial  condition  or  results  of  operations.

COMPETITION COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS.

     The  Company  is in a highly competitive industry and the dollar amount and
unit  volume  of  its  sales  could  be  negatively affected by its inability to
maintain  or  increase  prices,  changes in geographic or product mix, a general
decline  in  beverage  alcohol  consumption  or  the  decision  of the Company's
wholesale  customers,  retailers  or  consumers to purchase competitive products
instead of the Company's products.  Wholesaler, retailer and consumer purchasing
decisions  are  influenced  by,  among  other  things, the perceived absolute or
relative  overall  value  of  the Company's products, including their quality or
pricing,  compared  to competitive products.  Unit volume and dollar sales could
also  be  affected  by  pricing, purchasing, financing, operational, advertising
or  promotional  decisions  made  by   wholesalers  and  retailers  which  could
affect  their  supply  of,  or  consumer  demand  for, the  Company's  products.
The  Company  could  also  experience  higher  than  expected  selling,  general
and  administrative  expenses  if  the



Company  finds  it  necessary  to  increase  the  number  of  its  personnel  or
advertising  or promotional expenditures to maintain its competitive position or
for  other  reasons.

INCREASE IN  EXCISE TAXES  AND GOVERNMENT  REGULATIONS  COULD  HAVE  A  MATERIAL
ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS.

     In  the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and other countries in
which the Company operates, the Company is subject to imposition of excise taxes
and  other taxes on beverage alcohol products in varying amounts which have been
subject  to  change.  In  addition,  the  beverage  alcohol products industry is
subject  to   extensive  regulation  by  federal,  state,  local   and   foreign
governmental  agencies.  For  example,  in  the  United  States, the Alcohol and
Tobacco  Tax  and  Trade  Bureau  of the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the
various  state  liquor authorities regulate such matters as licensing, trade and
pricing  practices,  permitted  and required labeling, advertising and relations
with  wholesalers  and  retailers.  Certain  federal  and state regulations also
require  warning  labels  and  signage.

     Increases  in  excise  taxes  on  beverage  alcohol  products in the United
States,  the  United  Kingdom or  Australia,  if enacted, could  materially  and
adversely  affect  the  Company's  financial condition or results of operations.
New  or  revised  regulations or increased licensing fees, requirements or taxes
could  also  have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition
or  results  of  operations.

THE COMPANY RELIES ON THE PERFORMANCE OF WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTORS, MAJOR RETAILERS
AND CHAINS FOR THE SUCCESS OF ITS BUSINESS.

     In  the  United  States,  the  Company  sells  its  products principally to
wholesalers  for  resale  to  retail  outlets  including grocery stores, package
liquor  stores, club and discount stores and restaurants.  In the United Kingdom
and  Australia,  the  Company  sells its products principally to wholesalers and
directly  to major retailers and chains.  The replacement or poor performance of
the  Company's  major  wholesalers,  retailers  and  chains,  or  the  Company's
inability  to  collect accounts receivable from the Company's major wholesalers,
retailers and chains could materially and adversely affect the Company's results
of  operations  and  financial  condition.  Distribution  channels  for beverage
alcohol  products  have  been  consolidating  in  recent  years.   In  addition,
wholesalers and retailers of the Company's products offer products which compete
directly  with  the  Company's  products  for  retail  shelf  space and consumer
purchases.  Accordingly,  there is a risk that wholesalers or retailers may give
higher  priority  to  products of the Company's competitors.  In the future, the
Company's  wholesalers  and retailers may not continue to purchase the Company's
products  or  provide the Company's products with adequate levels of promotional
support.

THE  COMPANY'S  BUSINESS   COULD  BE  ADVERSELY  AFFECTED  BY  DECLINES  IN  THE
CONSUMPTION  OF  PRODUCTS  THE  COMPANY  SELLS.

     Although  since  1995  there  have  been modest increases in consumption of
beverage  alcohol  in  most of the Company's product categories, there have been
periods  in the past few decades in which there were substantial declines in the
overall per capita consumption of beverage alcohol products in the United States
and  other  markets  in  which  the  Company participates.  A limited or general
decline  in consumption in one or more of the Company's product categories could
occur  in  the  future  due  to  a  variety  of  factors,  including:

     -    a general decline or lack of improvement in economic conditions;

     -    increased   concern   about  the  health  consequences   of  consuming
          beverage alcohol products and about drinking and driving;



     -    a  trend  toward  a  healthier  diet including  lighter, lower calorie
          beverages such as diet soft drinks, juices and water products;

     -    increased activity of anti-alcohol consumer groups; and

     -    increased federal, state or foreign excise taxes.

THE COMPANY GENERALLY PURCHASES RAW MATERIALS UNDER SHORT-TERM SUPPLY  CONTRACTS
AND THE COMPANY IS  SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL  PRICE FLUCTUATIONS  FOR  GRAPES  AND
GRAPE-RELATED  MATERIALS;  THE COMPANY HAS A LIMITED GROUP OF SUPPLIERS OF GLASS
BOTTLES.

     The  Company's  business  is  heavily dependent upon raw materials, such as
grapes,  grape  juice  concentrate, grains, alcohol and packaging materials from
third-party  suppliers.  The  Company  could  experience  raw  material  supply,
production  or  shipment  difficulties that could adversely affect the Company's
ability  to supply goods to its customers. The Company is also directly affected
by  increases  in  the costs of such raw materials. In the past, the Company has
experienced  dramatic  increases  in  the  cost  of grapes. Although the Company
believes  it  has  adequate  sources  of grape supplies, in the event demand for
certain  wine  products  exceeds  expectations,  the  Company  could  experience
shortages. In addition, one of the Company's largest components of cost of goods
sold  is  that of glass bottles, which, in the United States and Australia, have
only  a small number of producers. Currently, substantially all of the Company's
glass  container  requirements  for its United States operations are supplied by
one producer and substantially all of the Company's glass container requirements
for its Australian operations are supplied by another producer. The inability of
any  of  the  Company's glass bottle suppliers to satisfy its requirements could
adversely  affect  the  Company's  business.

THE COMPANY'S GLOBAL  OPERATIONS SUBJECT  IT TO RISKS  RELATED TO CURRENCY  RATE
FLUCTUATIONS AND GEOPOLITICAL UNCERTAINTY.

     The  Company  has  operations  in  different  countries  and, therefore, is
subject  to  the risks associated with currency fluctuations.  Subsequent to the
Hardy Acquisition, the Company's exposure to foreign currency risk has increased
significantly  as  a  result  of having additional international subsidiaries in
Australia,  New Zealand and France.  The Company could experience changes in its
ability  to obtain or hedge against fluctuations in exchange rates.  The Company
could  also  be  affected  by  nationalizations or unstable governments or legal
systems  or  intergovernmental disputes.  These currency, economic and political
uncertainties  may  affect the Company's results, especially to the extent these
matters,  or  the  decisions,  policies  or  economic  strength of the Company's
suppliers,  affect  the  Company's  global operations or imported beer products.

THE COMPANY HAS A MATERIAL AMOUNT OF GOODWILL, AND IF THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO
WRITE DOWN GOODWILL DUE TO IMPAIRMENT, IT WOULD REDUCE THE COMPANY'S NET INCOME,
WHICH  IN  TURN  COULD  MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS.

     As of February 28, 2003, goodwill represented approximately $722.2 million,
or  22.6%  of the Company's total assets.  It is expected that this balance will
increase  once the allocation of the purchase price for the Hardy Acquisition is
completed.  Goodwill  is  the  amount  by  which  the  costs  of  an acquisition
accounted for using the purchase method exceeds the fair value of the net assets
acquired.  The  Company  adopted  Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No.
142  ("SFAS  No. 142"), "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," in its entirety,
on  March  1,  2002.  Under  SFAS  No. 142, goodwill is no longer amortized, but
instead  is  subject to a periodic impairment evaluation based on the fair value
of  the  reporting  unit.  Reductions  in  the  Company's net income caused by a
write-down  of  goodwill  could  materially  and  adversely affect the Company's
results  of  operations.



THE TERMINATION  OR NON-RENEWAL OF IMPORTED BEER  DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENTS  COULD
HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS.

     All  of the Company's imported beer products are marketed and sold pursuant
to  exclusive  distribution  agreements with the suppliers of these products and
are subject to renewal from time to time. The Company's agreements to distribute
Corona  Extra  and  its  other  Mexican beer brands in 25 primarily western U.S.
states  expires  in  December  2006  and,  subject  to  compliance  with certain
performance  criteria,  continued retention of certain personnel and other terms
of  the  agreement,  will  be automatically renewed for additional terms of five
years.  Changes  in  control  of  the  Company  or  its subsidiaries involved in
importing  the Mexican beer brands, or changes in the chief executive officer of
such  subsidiaries,  may be a basis for the supplier, unless it consents to such
changes,  to terminate the agreement. The supplier's consent to such changes may
not  be  unreasonably  withheld. Prior to their expiration, all of the Company's
imported  beer distribution agreements may be terminated if the Company fails to
meet  certain performance criteria. The Company believes that it is currently in
compliance  with all of its material imported beer distribution agreements. From
time  to  time  the  Company  has failed, and may in the future fail, to satisfy
certain  performance  criteria  in  the Company's distribution agreements. It is
possible  that  the Company's beer distribution agreements may not be renewed or
may  be  terminated  prior  to  expiration.

THE COMPANY'S PRIOR YEARS' FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WERE AUDITED BY  ARTHUR ANDERSEN
LLP.

     The  Company's  consolidated  financial  statements  for  the  years  ended
February  28,  2002, and February 28, 2001, were audited by Arthur Andersen LLP,
independent  public accountants.  On August 31, 2002, Arthur Andersen LLP ceased
to  practice  before the SEC.  Therefore, Arthur Andersen did not participate in
the preparation of this Form 10-K, did not reissue its audit report with respect
to  the  financial statements included in this Form 10-K, and did not consent to
the inclusion of a copy of its previously issued audit report in this Form 10-K.
As  a  result,  holders of the Company's securities may have no effective remedy
against  Arthur  Andersen  LLP  in  connection  with  a material misstatement or
omission  in  the  financial  statements  to which its audit report relates.  In
addition,  even if such holders were able to assert such a claim, because it has

report  of  Arthur  Andersen  LLP.

ITEM 7A.   QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
- --------   ----------------------------------------------------------

     The  Company  is exposed to market risk associated with changes in interest
rates and foreign currency exchange rates.  To manage the volatility relating to
these  risks,  the  Company  periodically  enters  into  derivative transactions
including foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate swap agreements.
The  Company  has  limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and
does not use them for trading purposes.  The Company uses derivative instruments
solely  to  reduce  the  financial  impact  of  these  risks.

     The  fair  value  of  long-term  debt  is  subject  to  interest rate risk.
Generally, the fair value of long-term debt will increase as interest rates fall
and  decrease as interest rates rise.  The estimated fair value of the Company's
total  long-term  debt,  including  current maturities, was $1,400.8 million and
$1,407.4  million  at  February 28, 2003, and  February 28, 2002,  respectively.
A  hypothetical  1%  increase  from



prevailing  interest  rates  at  February 28, 2003, and February 28, 2002, would
have  resulted in a decrease in fair value of fixed interest rate long-term debt
by $151.3 million and $57.6 million, respectively.

     Also, a hypothetical 1% increase from prevailing interest rates at February
28, 2003, and February 28, 2002, would result in an approximate increase in cash
required for interest on variable interest rate debt during the next five fiscal
years as follows:

                          February 28,    February 28,
                              2003            2002
                          ------------    ------------
         2003             N/A             $2.5 million
         2004             $1.1 million    $1.7 million
         2005             $0.3 million    $0.7 million
         2006             $ -             $ -
         2007             $ -             $ -
         2008             $ -             N/A

     The  Company  has on occasion entered into interest rate swap agreements to
reduce its exposure to interest rate changes relative to its long-term debt.  At
February  28, 2003, and February 28, 2002, the Company had no interest rate swap
agreements  outstanding.

     At  February 28, 2003, the Company has exposure to foreign currency risk as
a  result of having international subsidiaries in the United Kingdom and Canada.
For  the  Company's  operations  in  the  United Kingdom, the Company uses local
currency  borrowings  to  hedge  its  earnings and cash flow exposure to adverse
changes  in  foreign  currency exchange rates.  At February 28, 2003, management
believes  that  a  hypothetical  10% adverse change in foreign currency exchange
rates  would  not result in a material adverse impact on either earnings or cash
flow.  The  Company  also  has  exposure to foreign currency risk as a result of
contracts  to  purchase  inventory items that are denominated in various foreign
currencies.  In  order  to  reduce  the  risk  of foreign currency exchange rate
fluctuations  resulting  from  these  contracts, the Company periodically enters
into  foreign  exchange  hedging agreements.  At February 28, 2003, and February
28,  2002, the potential loss on outstanding foreign exchange hedging agreements
from  a hypothetical 10% adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates would
not  be  material.

     Subsequent  to  the  Hardy  Acquisition, the Company's exposure to  foreign
currency  risk  has  increased  significantly  as  a result of having additional
international  subsidiaries  in  Australia, New Zealand and France.  The Company
also  has  exposure  to foreign currency risk as a result of Hardy's significant
international  sales  that  are  denominated  in various foreign currencies.  In
order  to  reduce  the  risk  of  foreign  currency  exchange  rate fluctuations
resulting  from these sales, the Company's involvement with derivative financial
instruments  will  increase  proportionately.

                          INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Constellation Brands, Inc.:

We  have  audited  the  February  28,  2003 consolidated financial statements of
Constellation Brands, Inc. and subsidiaries as listed in the accompanying index.
These  consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management.  Our  responsibility  is to express an opinion on these consolidated
financial  statements  based  on  our  audit.  The  February  28,  2002 and 2001
consolidated financial statements of Constellation Brands, Inc. and subsidiaries
were  audited  by  other  auditors  who  have  ceased operations. Those auditors
expressed  an  unqualified  opinion  on those consolidated financial statements,
before  the  revisions  described in Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial
statements, in their report dated April 9, 2002.

We  conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in  the  United  States  of  America.  Those  standards require that we plan and
perform  the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated
financial  statements  are  free  of  material  misstatement.  An audit includes
examining,  on  a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the  consolidated  financial  statements.  An  audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well
as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our
audit  provides  a  reasonable  basis  for  our  opinion.

In  our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly,  in  all  material  respects,  the  financial  position of Constellation
Brands,  Inc. and subsidiaries as of February 28, 2003, and the results of their
operations  and  their  cash  flows  for the year then ended, in conformity with
accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in  the  United  States of America.

As discussed above, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Constellation
Brands,  Inc.  and  subsidiaries  as  of  February  28,  2002,  and  the related
consolidated  statements  of income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for the
years  ended  February 28, 2002 and 2001 were audited by other auditors who have
ceased  operations.  As  described  in  Note  2,  these  consolidated  financial
statements have been revised to include the transitional disclosures required by
Statement  of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.  142,  Goodwill  and  Other
Intangible Assets, which was adopted by the Company as of March 1, 2002.  In our
opinion  these  disclosures  for  2002  and  2001  in  Note  2  are appropriate.
Additionally,  as described in Note 2, the consolidated statements of income for
the  years  ended  February  28,  2002  and  2001  have  been revised to reflect
reclassifications of certain consumer and trade promotional expenses as required
by Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 01-9, Accounting for Consideration Given
by  a Vendor to a Customer (EITF 01-9), which was also adopted by the Company as
of  March  1, 2002 and,  as described in Note 1, the proforma disclosures of net
income and earnings per common share related to stock-based compensation for the
years  ended  February  28,  2002  and  2001 have been adjusted from the amounts
originally reported. We audited the adjustments that were applied to restate the
2002  and  2001  consolidated financial statements for the adoption of EITF 01-9
and  to  restate  the disclosure of amounts of pro forma net income and earnings
per  share  related to stock-based compensation for the years ended February 28,
2002  and  2001.  In our opinion, such adjustments are appropriate and have been
properly  applied.  However,  we were not engaged to audit, review, or apply any
procedures  to  the February 28, 2002 and 2001 consolidated financial statements
of  Constellation Brands, Inc. and subsidiaries, other than with respect to such
disclosures  and  adjustments;  accordingly, we do not express an opinion or any
other form of assurance on the February 28, 2002 and 2001 consolidated financial
statements taken as a whole.

                   CONSTELLATION BRANDS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                                FEBRUARY 28, 2003

1.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

     DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS -
     Constellation  Brands,  Inc.  and  its subsidiaries (the "Company") operate
primarily  in  the  beverage alcohol industry. The Company is a leading producer
and marketer of beverage alcohol brands, with a broad portfolio of wine, spirits
and  imported  beer.  The Company is the largest single-source supplier of these
products  in  the  United  States  ("U.S."),  and  both  a  major  producer  and
independent  drinks wholesaler in the United Kingdom ("U.K."). In North America,
the  Company  distributes  its  products  through wholesale distributors. In the
U.K.,  the  Company  distributes  its products directly to off-premise accounts,
such  as  major  retail  chains, and to other wholesalers. Through the Company's
U.K.  wholesale business, the Company distributes its branded products and those
of  other major drinks companies to on-premise accounts: pubs, clubs, hotels and
restaurants.

     PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION -
     The  consolidated  financial statements of the Company include the accounts
of  Constellation  Brands,  Inc.  and all of its subsidiaries.  All intercompany
accounts  and  transactions  have  been  eliminated.

     MANAGEMENT'S USE OF ESTIMATES -
     The  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  conformity  with generally
accepted  accounting  principles  requires  management  to  make  estimates  and
assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of assets and liabilities and
disclosure  of  contingent  assets  and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements  and  the  reported  amounts  of  revenues  and  expenses  during the
reporting  period.  Actual  results  could  differ  from  those  estimates.

     REVENUE RECOGNITION -
     Sales  are recognized when title passes to the customer, which is generally
when  the  product  is  shipped.  Amounts  billed  to customers for shipping and
handling  are  classified  as  gross  sales.   Gross  sales  reflect  reductions
attributable  to  consideration given to customers in various customer incentive
programs,  including pricing discounts on single transactions, volume discounts,
promotional  and  advertising  allowances,  coupons,  and  rebates.

     FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION -
     The  "functional  currency"  for  translating the accounts of the Company's
operations  outside  the  U.S.  is  the local currency. The translation from the
applicable  foreign  currencies  to  U.S. dollars is performed for balance sheet
accounts  using  exchange  rates  in  effect  at  the balance sheet date and for
revenue  and  expense accounts using a weighted average exchange rate during the
period.  The  resulting  translation  adjustments are recorded as a component of
accumulated  other comprehensive income/loss ("AOCI"). Gains or losses resulting
from  foreign  currency  transactions  are  included  in  selling,  general  and
administrative  expenses.

     CASH INVESTMENTS -
     Cash  investments  consist  of  highly  liquid investments with an original
maturity  when  purchased  of three months or less and are stated at cost, which
approximates  market  value.  The amounts at February 28, 2003, and February 28,
2002, are not significant.

     ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS -
     The Company records an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses
resulting  from  the  inability  of its customers to make required payments. The
majority  of  the  accounts  receivable  balance  is



generated  from  sales  to  independent distributors with whom the Company has a
predetermined  collection  date  arranged through electronic funds transfer. The
allowance  for  doubtful  accounts  was  $13.8  million  and $10.4 million as of
February  28,  2003,  and  February  28, 2002, respectively. In Fiscal 2003, the
allowance for doubtful accounts was increased by $6.1 million for provisions and
decreased  by  $2.7  million primarily for write-offs of uncollectible accounts.

     FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS -
     To  meet  the  reporting  requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards  No. 107, "Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments," the
Company  calculates  the fair value of financial instruments using quoted market
prices  whenever  available.  When  quoted  market prices are not available, the
Company  uses standard pricing models for various types of financial instruments
(such  as  forwards,  options,  swaps, etc.) which take into account the present
value  of  estimated  future  cash  flows.

     The  carrying  amount  and  estimated fair value of the Company's financial
instruments  are  summarized  as  follows:



     The  following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value
of  each  class  of  financial  instruments:

     CASH  AND  CASH  INVESTMENTS, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND ACCOUNTS PAYABLE: The
carrying  amounts  approximate  fair  value  due  to the short maturity of these
instruments.
     NOTES PAYABLE TO BANKS:   These  instruments  are  variable  interest  rate
bearing notes for which the carrying value approximates the fair value.
     LONG-TERM  DEBT: The senior credit facility is subject to variable interest
rates  which  are frequently reset; accordingly, the carrying value of this debt
approximates  its  fair  value.  The fair value of the remaining long-term debt,
which  is  all fixed rate, is estimated by discounting cash flows using interest
rates currently available for debt with similar terms and maturities.
     CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS: The fair value of currency forward contracts is
estimated based on quoted market prices.

     DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS -
     From  time  to  time,  the  Company enters into interest rate futures and a
variety  of  currency  forward contracts in the management of interest rate risk
and  foreign  currency transaction exposure. The Company has limited involvement
with  derivative  instruments  and  does  not use them for trading purposes. The
Company  uses  derivatives  solely to reduce the financial impact of the related
risks.  Effective  March  1,  2001,  the  Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting  Standards  No.  133  ("SFAS  No.  133"),  "Accounting for Derivative
Instruments  and  Hedging  Activities", as amended, which establishes accounting
and  reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities. SFAS
No.  133 requires that the Company recognize all derivatives as either assets or
liabilities  on  the  balance  sheet  and



measure  those  instruments  at  fair  value.  The  cash  flows  from derivative
instruments  accounted  for as hedges are classified in the same category as the
items  being hedged. The adoption of SFAS No. 133 did not have a material impact
on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash
flows.

     The  use  of  derivative  instruments  exposes  the Company to credit risk.
However,  the  Company   mitigates   the   credit  risk  associated   with   the
non-performance  of  counterparties  by  using major financial institutions with
high  credit  ratings.

     The Company uses foreign currency exchange agreements to reduce the risk of
foreign  currency  exchange rate fluctuations resulting primarily from contracts
to  purchase inventory items that are denominated in various foreign currencies.
In the past, certain of these derivative contracts have been designated to hedge
the  exposure  to  variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction and have been
classified as cash flow hedges.  As such, the effective portion of the change in
the  fair  value of the derivatives has been recorded each period in the balance
sheet in AOCI, and has been reclassified into the statement of income, primarily
as  a  component  of  cost  of product sold, in the same period during which the
hedged  transaction  affects  earnings.  The currency forward exchange contracts
used  generally  have  maturity  terms of twelve months or less.  If the Company
determines  that  the  hedging  relationship no longer qualifies as an effective
cash  flow hedge, then the derivative will continue to be carried on the balance
sheet  at  its  fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in earnings.  If
hedge  accounting  is  discontinued  because  it  is  probable that a forecasted
transaction  will not occur, then the derivative will continue to be recorded on
the  balance sheet at its fair value, changes in the fair value will be recorded
in  earnings,  and  any  amounts previously recorded in AOCI will immediately be
recorded  in  earnings.  As  of  February  28,  2003, the entire balance in AOCI
related  to  cash  flow hedges has been reclassified to the statement of income.

     The  Company  also  uses foreign currency exchange agreements to reduce the
risk  of  foreign  currency  exchange rate fluctuations resulting primarily from
recorded  accounts  payable  denominated in various foreign currencies. As these
derivative  contracts  have  not  been  designated  as  hedging instruments, the
resulting  gains  or  losses  from changes in the fair value of these agreements
which  are  not  significant,  are  recognized  in  earnings.

     In  connection  with  the  Hardy  Acquisition  (as defined in Note 23), the
Company entered into a foreign currency collar contract in February 2003 to lock
in  a  range for the cost of the acquisition in U.S. dollars. As of February 28,
2003,  this  derivative instrument had a fair value of $23.1 million. Under SFAS
No.  133, a transaction that involves a business combination is not eligible for
hedge accounting treatment. As such, this derivative was recorded on the balance
sheet  at its fair value with the change in the fair value recognized separately
on  the  Company's  Consolidated  Statements  of  Income.

     The  Company  has  exposure  to foreign currency risk as a result of having
international subsidiaries, primarily in the U.K. The Company uses British pound
sterling  borrowings  to  hedge  a portion of its exposure to adverse changes in
foreign  currency  exchange  rates  related  to  its  investments  in these U.K.
subsidiaries.  Such borrowings are designated as a hedge of the foreign currency
exposure of the net investment in these foreign operations. Accordingly, foreign
currency  gain  or  loss  on  this instrument is reported in AOCI as part of the
foreign  currency  translation  adjustments.  For years ended February 28, 2003,
February 28, 2002, and February 28, 2001, net (losses) gains of ($29.5) million,
$5.4  million  and $20.0 million, respectively, are included in foreign currency
translation  adjustments  within  AOCI.



     INVENTORIES -
     Inventories  are  stated  at the lower of cost (computed in accordance with
the  first-in, first-out method) or market.  Elements of cost include materials,
labor and overhead and are classified as follows:



     A  substantial  portion  of  barreled  whiskey  and brandy will not be sold
within  one  year  because  of  the duration of the aging process.  All barreled
whiskey  and brandy are classified as in-process inventories and are included in
current assets, in accordance with industry practice.  Bulk wine inventories are
also  included  as  in-process  inventories within current assets, in accordance
with  the  general  practices  of  the wine industry, although a portion of such
inventories  may  be  aged  for  periods  greater  than  one year.  Warehousing,
insurance,  ad  valorem  taxes and other carrying charges applicable to barreled
whiskey  and  brandy  held  for  aging  are  included  in  inventory  costs.

     The  Company  assesses  the  valuation  of  its inventories and reduces the
carrying  value  of  those  inventories  that  are  obsolete or in excess of the
Company's forecasted usage to their estimated net realizable value.  The Company
estimates  the  net  realizable  value of such inventories based on analyses and
assumptions  including,  but not limited to, historical usage, future demand and
market  requirements.  Reductions  to  the  carrying  value  of  inventories are
recorded in cost of goods sold.  If the future demand for the Company's products
is  less  favorable  than  the  Company's  forecasts,  then  the  value  of  the
inventories  may  be  required  to  be reduced, which would result in additional
expense  to  the  Company  and  affect  its  results  of  operations.

     PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT -
     Property,  plant  and  equipment  is  stated  at cost.  Major additions and
betterments  are charged to property accounts, while maintenance and repairs are
charged  to  operations  as  incurred.  The cost of properties sold or otherwise
disposed  of  and  the  related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the
accounts  at the time of disposal and resulting gains and losses are included as
a  component  of  operating  income.

     DEPRECIATION -
     Depreciation  is computed primarily using the straight-line method over the
following estimated useful lives:



     GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS  -
     Effective  March  1,  2002,  the  Company  adopted  Statement  of Financial
Accounting  Standards  No.  142 ("SFAS No. 142"), "Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets."  SFAS No. 142 addresses financial accounting and reporting for acquired
goodwill  and other intangible assets and supersedes Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No. 17, "Intangible Assets." Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill and indefinite
lived  intangible  assets  are  no  longer  amortized  but are reviewed at least
annually  for  impairment. Additionally, in the year of adoption, a transitional
impairment  test  is  also  required.  The  Company  uses



December  31  as  its annual impairment test measurement date. Intangible assets
that  are  not  deemed  to have an indefinite life will continue to be amortized
over  their  useful  lives  and  are also subject to review for impairment. Upon
adoption  of SFAS No. 142, the Company determined that certain of its intangible
assets  met  the  criteria  to  be considered indefinite lived and, accordingly,
ceased  their  amortization  effective  March  1,  2002. These intangible assets
consisted  principally  of  trademarks.  The Company's trademarks relate to well
established  brands owned by the Company which were previously amortized over 40
years.   Intangible  assets  determined   to  have  a  finite  life,   primarily
distribution  agreements,  continue  to be amortized over their estimated useful
lives  which  did not require modification as a result of adopting SFAS No. 142.
Nonamortizable  intangible  assets  are tested for impairment in accordance with
the  provisions of SFAS No. 142 and amortizable intangible assets are tested for
impairment in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 144 (as defined below).
Note  5  provides  a summary of intangible assets segregated between amortizable
and  nonamortizable  amounts.

     The  Company  has  completed  its  impairment  testing  for  goodwill   and
nonamortizable  intangible  assets pursuant to the requirements of SFAS No. 142.
No instances of impairment were noted as a result of these processes.

     OTHER ASSETS -
     Other assets, include an investment in joint venture which is carried under
the  equity method of accounting (see Note 7) and deferred financing costs which
are  stated  at  cost, net of accumulative amortization, and are amortized on an
effective  interest  basis  over  the  term  of  the  related  debt.

     LONG-LIVED ASSETS IMPAIRMENT -
     Effective  March  1,  2002,  the  Company  adopted  Statement  of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 144 ("SFAS No. 144"), "Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal  of  Long-Lived  Assets,"  which  addresses  financial  accounting  and
reporting  for  the  impairment  or  disposal of long-lived assets. SFAS No. 144
supersedes  Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, "Accounting for
the  Impairment  of  Long-Lived  Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed
Of,"  and the accounting and reporting provisions of Accounting Principles Board
Opinion  No.  30,  "Reporting the Results of Operations-Reporting the Effects of
Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently
Occurring  Events and Transactions," for the disposal of a segment of a business
(as  previously  defined  in that Opinion). In accordance with SFAS No. 144, the
Company  reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes
in  circumstances  indicate  that  the  carrying  amount  of an asset may not be
recoverable.  Recoverability of  assets  to  be  held  and used is measured by a
comparison  of  the  carrying  amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted cash
flows  expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset
exceeds  its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for
the  amount  by  which  the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value.
Assets  to  be disposed of would be reported at the lower of the carrying amount
or fair value less costs to sell and are no longer depreciated.

     Pursuant  to  this  policy,  during  the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2003, the
Company's  Popular  and Premium Wine segment recorded an asset impairment charge
of  $4.8 million in connection with two of its production facilities. One of the
facilities, which is to be held and used for a short period prior to its planned
closing  in  fiscal  2004,  has  been  written  down  to its appraised value and
comprised  most  of the impairment charge. The other facility, which is held for
sale in fiscal 2004, was written down to a value based on the Company's estimate
of salvage value. This impairment charge is included in restructuring charges on
the  Company's  Consolidated  Statements  of  Income  since  it  is  part  of  a
realignment  of  its  business  operations  that  is expected to be completed in
fiscal  2004.  The impaired assets consist primarily of buildings, machinery and
equipment located at the two production facilities. The charge resulted from the
determination  that  the  assets'  undiscounted future cash flows were less than
their  carrying  values. The Company recorded an asset impairment charge of $1.4
million  in  Fiscal  2002  in  connection  with  the



sale  of  the Stevens Point Brewery in March 2002. This charge has been included
in  selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company did not record any
asset  impairment  charge  in  Fiscal  2001.

     ADVERTISING COSTS -
     The  Company  expenses advertising costs as incurred, shown or distributed.
Prepaid  advertising costs at February 28, 2003, and February 28, 2002, were not
material.  Advertising  expense  for the years ended February 28, 2003, February
28,  2002,  and  February  28,  2001, was $89.6 million, $87.0 million and $85.9
million, respectively.

     INCOME TAXES -
     The  Company  uses  the asset and liability method of accounting for income
taxes.  This  method  accounts  for  deferred income taxes by applying statutory
rates  in  effect  at  the  balance  sheet  date  to  the difference between the
financial  reporting  and  tax  bases  of  assets  and  liabilities.

     ENVIRONMENTAL -
     Environmental  expenditures  that  relate  to  current  operations or to an
existing  condition  caused  by  past operations, and which do not contribute to
current  or future revenue generation, are expensed. Liabilities for environment
risks  or  components thereof are recorded when environmental assessments and/or
remedial  efforts  are  probable,  and  the  cost  can  be reasonably estimated.
Generally,  the  timing  of  these  accruals  coincides with the completion of a
feasibility  study  or  the  Company's  commitment  to  a formal plan of action.
Liabilities  for environmental costs were not material at February 28, 2003, and
February  28,  2002.

     EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE -
     Basic  earnings  per  common  share  excludes  the  effect  of common stock
equivalents  and is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders
by  the  weighted  average number of common shares outstanding during the period
for Class A Common Stock and Class B Convertible Common Stock.  Diluted earnings
per common share reflects the potential dilution that could result if securities
or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common
stock.  Diluted  earnings per common share assumes the exercise of stock options
using  the  treasury  stock  method  and  assumes  the conversion of convertible
securities,  if  any,  using  the  "if  converted"  method.

     STOCK-BASED EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION PLANS -
     As  of  February  28,  2003,  the  Company  has  four  stock-based employee
compensation  plans,  which  are  described  more  fully in Note 15. The Company
applies  the  intrinsic  value  method  described in Accounting Principles Board
Opinion  No.  25 ("APB No. 25"), "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and
related  interpretations  in  accounting for these plans. In accordance with APB
No. 25, the compensation cost for stock options is recognized in income based on
the excess, if any, of the quoted market price of the stock at the grant date of
the  award  or  other  measurement  date over the amount an employee must pay to
acquire  the  stock.  The  Company  utilizes  the  disclosure-only provisions of
Statement  of  Financial  Accounting  Standards   No.  123   ("SFAS  No.  123"),
"Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," as amended. Options granted under the
Company's  plans  have  an  exercise  price  equal  to  the  market value of the
underlying  common  stock  on  the  date  of  grant;  therefore,  no incremental
compensation  expense has been recognized for grants made to employees under the
Company's  stock option plans. The following table illustrates the effect on net
income  and  earnings  per  share  if  the  Company  had  applied the fair value
recognition  provisions  of  SFAS  No. 123 to stock-based employee compensation.





     Pro  forma  net  income for the years ended February 28, 2002, and February
28,  2001,  has  been  adjusted from the amounts previously reported to properly
reflect  the  increased   expense,  net  of  income  tax   benefits,   primarily
attributable  to  the accelerated vesting of certain options during those years.
The  accelerated  vesting  was  attributable  to  the  attainment of preexisting
performance  rights  set  forth  in  the  stock option grants. The impact of the
accelerated vesting was not reflected in the Fiscal 2002 and Fiscal 2001 amounts
originally reported. The pro forma net income amounts reflected above for Fiscal
2002  and  Fiscal  2001  have  been  reduced  by $12.9 million and $2.4 million,
respectively,  for  this  matter. Basic pro forma earnings per common share have
been  reduced  by  $0.15 and $0.03 in Fiscal 2002 and Fiscal 2001, respectively.
Diluted pro forma earnings per common share have been reduced by $0.16 and $0.03
for  these  periods.

     OTHER -
     Certain  February  28,  2002, balances have been reclassified to conform to
current  year  presentation.

2.   ACCOUNTING CHANGES:

     Effective March 1, 2002, the Company completed its adoption of Statement of
Financial  Accounting   Standards   No.  141   ("SFAS   No.   141"),   "Business
Combinations,"  resulting  in  a reclassification of $46.8 million of previously
identified  separable  intangible assets to goodwill and an elimination of $16.6
million  of deferred tax liabilities previously associated with those intangible
assets  with  a  corresponding deduction from goodwill. The reclassified assets,
from a 1993 acquisition, relate to non-specific customer relationships that were
neither contractual nor separable. The adoption of SFAS No. 141 did not have any
other  material  impact  on  the  Company's  financial  statements.

     As  discussed  in Note 1, effective March 1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS
No.  142.   The  following  table  presents  earnings  and  earnings  per  share
information  for  the   comparative  periods  as  if  SFAS  No.  141   and   the
nonamortization  provisions  of SFAS No. 142 had been applied beginning March 1,
2000:





     The  changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the year ended February
28, 2003, are as follows:



     Also,  effective  March  1,  2002, the Company adopted EITF Issue No. 01-09
("EITF  No.  01-09"),  "Accounting  for  Consideration  Given  by  a Vendor to a
Customer  (Including  a  Reseller  of  the  Vendor's  Products)," which codified
various  issues  related  to  certain  promotional payments under EITF Issue No.
00-14,  "Accounting  for  Certain  Sales  Incentives,"  EITF  Issue  No.  00-22,
"Accounting  for  'Points'  and



Certain Other Time-Based  or Volume-Based Sales Incentive Offers, and Offers for
Free  Products  or  Services  to Be Delivered in the Future," and EITF Issue No.
00-25,  "Vendor  Income  Statement  Characterization  of Consideration Paid to a
Reseller  of  the  Vendor's Products." EITF No. 01-09 addresses the recognition,
measurement  and  income  statement  classification  of consideration given by a
vendor  to a customer (including both a reseller of the vendor's products and an
entity  that  purchases  the vendor's products from a reseller). EITF No. 01-09,
among  other  things, requires that certain consideration given by a vendor to a
customer  be  characterized  as  a  reduction  of revenue when recognized in the
vendor's  income  statement.  The  Company  previously  reported  such  costs as
selling,  general  and administrative expenses. As a result of adopting EITF No.
01-09,  the  Company  has restated net sales, cost of product sold, and selling,
general  and  administrative expenses for the years ended February 28, 2002, and
February  28, 2001. Net sales were reduced by $213.8 million and $170.7 million,
respectively;  cost  of  product  sold  was  increased by $10.1 million and $7.8
million,  respectively;  and  selling,  general   and  administrative   expenses
were  reduced   by  $223.9  million  and  $178.5  million,  respectively.   This
reclassification  did  not  affect  operating  income  or  net  income.

     The Company adopted EITF Issue No. 02-16 ("EITF No. 02-16"), "Accounting by
a  Customer  (Including  a  Reseller)  for Certain Consideration Received from a
Vendor"  for new arrangements, including modifications of existing arrangements,
entered into after November 21, 2002, or December 31, 2002, as appropriate. EITF
No.  02-16  addresses  how a vendor should characterize consideration given to a
customer, including a reseller, and, to a limited extent, when to recognize that
consideration  in  the  income statement. The adoption of EITF No. 02-16 did not
have  a  material  impact  on  the  Company's  financial  statements.

     Effective  January  1,  2003,  the  Company  adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting  Standards No. 146 ("SFAS No. 146"), "Accounting for Costs Associated
with  Exit or Disposal Activities."  SFAS No. 146 addresses financial accounting
and  reporting  for  costs  associated  with  exit  or  disposal  activities and
nullifies  EITF  Issue  No.  94-3,  "Liability  Recognition for Certain Employee
Termination  Benefits  and  Other  Costs  to Exit an Activity (including Certain
Costs  Incurred in a Restructuring)."  The adoption of SFAS No. 146 did not have
a  material  impact  on  the  Company's  financial  statements.

     Effective  January  1,  2003,  the  Company  adopted  Financial  Accounting
Standards  Board  ("FASB")  Interpretation  No.  45 ("FIN No. 45"), "Guarantor's
Accounting  and  Disclosure  Requirements  for  Guarantees,  Including  Indirect
Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others -- an Interpretation of FASB Statements No.
5,  57,  and  107  and  Rescission  of  FASB  Interpretation No. 34." FIN No. 45
addresses  the  disclosures  to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual
financial  statements  about  its  obligations under guarantees. FIN No. 45 also
clarifies  the  requirements  related  to  the  recognition  of a liability by a
guarantor  at the inception of a guarantee for the obligations the guarantor has
undertaken  in  issuing  that  guarantee.  Lastly,  FIN  No.  45 supersedes FASB
Interpretation  No.  34,  "Disclosure  of Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of
Others (An Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 5)." The initial recognition and
initial  measurement provisions of FIN No. 45 have been applied on a prospective
basis  to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002 and have not had
a  material  impact  on  the  Company's  financial statements. Additionally, the
Company  has  adopted  the  disclosure requirements of FIN No. 45 for the fiscal
year  ended  February  28,  2003  (see  Note  14).

3.   ACQUISITIONS:

     FORTH WINES ACQUISITION -
     On  October  27,  2000,  the  Company  purchased all of the issued Ordinary
Shares  and  Preference  Shares  of  Forth  Wines  Limited  ("Forth Wines"). The
purchase price was $4.5 million and was accounted for using the purchase method;
accordingly,  the acquired net assets were recorded at fair value at the date of
acquisition.  The excess of the purchase price over the fair market value of the
net  assets acquired (goodwill), $2.2 million, is no longer being amortized, but
is  tested  for  impairment  at  least  annually  in  accordance



with  the  provisions  of SFAS No. 142. The results of operations of Forth Wines
are  reported in the U.K. Brands and Wholesale segment and have been included in
the  Consolidated  Statements  of  Income  since  the  date  of  acquisition.

     TURNER ROAD VINTNERS ASSETS ACQUISITION -
     On  March  5,  2001,  in an asset acquisition, the Company acquired several
well-known  premium  wine brands, including Vendange, Nathanson Creek, Heritage,
and  Talus, working capital (primarily inventories), two wineries in California,
and  other  related  assets  from  Sebastiani Vineyards, Inc. and Tuolomne River
Vintners  Group  (the  "Turner Road Vintners Assets"). The purchase price of the
Turner  Road  Vintners  Assets,  including  direct acquisition costs, was $279.4
million.  In  addition,  the  Company  assumed indebtedness of $9.4 million. The
acquisition  was  financed  by  the  proceeds from the sale of the February 2001
Senior  Notes  (as  defined  in  Note 9) and revolving loan borrowings under the
senior  credit  facility.  The  Turner  Road  Vintners  Assets  acquisition  was
accounted  for  using  the purchase method; accordingly, the acquired net assets
were  recorded  at  fair  value  at  the  date of acquisition. The excess of the
purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired (goodwill), $146.2
million,  is  no  longer  being amortized, but is tested for impairment at least
annually  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of SFAS No. 142. The results of
operations  of  the  Turner Road Vintners Assets are reported in the Popular and
Premium  Wine  segment  and have been included in the Consolidated Statements of
Income  since  the  date  of  acquisition.

     CORUS ASSETS ACQUISITION -
     On  March  26,  2001, in an asset acquisition, the Company acquired certain
wine  brands,  wineries,  working  capital  (primarily  inventories),  and other
related  assets  from  Corus  Brands,  Inc.   (the  "Corus  Assets").   In  this
acquisition,  the  Company  acquired  several  well-known  premium  wine  brands
primarily sold in the northwestern United States, including Covey Run, Columbia,
Ste. Chapelle and Alice White. The purchase price of the Corus Assets, including
direct  acquisition  costs,  was  $48.9  million plus an earn-out over six years
based  on  the  performance  of  the  brands.  In  addition, the Company assumed
indebtedness  of  $3.0 million. As of February 28, 2003, the Company has paid an
earn-out  in the amount of $1.7 million. In connection with the transaction, the
Company  also  entered into long-term grape supply agreements with affiliates of
Corus  Brands,  Inc.  covering  more  than  1,000  acres of Washington and Idaho
vineyards. The acquisition was financed with revolving loan borrowings under the
senior credit facility. The Corus Assets acquisition was accounted for using the
purchase  method;  accordingly,  the  acquired  net assets were recorded at fair
value at the date of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the fair
value  of  the net assets acquired (goodwill), $48.5 million, is no longer being
amortized, but is tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the
provisions  of  SFAS  No. 142. The results of operations of the Corus Assets are
reported  in  the Popular and Premium Wine segment and have been included in the
Consolidated  Statements  of  Income  since  the  date  of  acquisition.

     RAVENSWOOD ACQUISITION -
     On  July 2, 2001, the Company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock
of  Ravenswood  Winery,  Inc.  (the  "Ravenswood  Acquisition").  The Ravenswood
business  produces, markets and sells super-premium and ultra-premium California
wine,  primarily  under  the  Ravenswood  brand  name. The purchase price of the
Ravenswood  Acquisition, including direct acquisition costs, was $149.7 million.
In  addition,  the  Company  assumed  indebtedness of $2.8 million. The purchase
price  was  financed  with  revolving  loan  borrowings  under the senior credit
facility.  The  Ravenswood  Acquisition  was  accounted  for  using the purchase
method;  accordingly, the acquired net assets were recorded at fair value at the
date of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the
net  assets acquired (goodwill), $99.8 million, is not amortizable and is tested
for  impairment  at least annually in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No.
142.  The  Ravenswood  Acquisition was consistent with the Company's strategy of
further   penetrating  the   higher  gross  profit   margin  super-premium   and
ultra-premium  wine  categories.  The  results  of  operations of the Ravenswood
business  are  reported  in  the Fine Wine segment and have been included in the
Consolidated  Statements  of  Income  since  the  date  of  acquisition.



     The  following  table summarizes the fair values of the assets acquired and
liabilities  assumed  in the Ravenswood Acquisition at July 2, 2001, as adjusted
for the final appraisal:

                     Current assets                 $  34,396
                     Property, plant and equipment     14,994

                     Long-term liabilities             32,593
                                                    ---------
                       Total liabilities assumed       45,116
                                                    ---------

                     Net assets acquired            $ 149,656
                                                    =========

     The  trademarks  are  not subject to amortization.  None of the goodwill is
expected  to  be  deductible  for  tax  purposes.

     The  following  table  sets  forth  the  unaudited  pro  forma  results  of
operations  of  the  Company for the years ended February 28, 2002, and February
28,  2001,  respectively.  The  unaudited  pro  forma results of operations give
effect  to the acquisitions of the Turner Road Vintners Assets, the Corus Assets
and  the  Ravenswood  Acquisition  as  if  they  occurred  on March 1, 2000. The
unaudited  pro  forma results of operations are presented after giving effect to
certain adjustments for depreciation, amortization of goodwill, interest expense
on  the  acquisition financing and related income tax effects. The unaudited pro
forma  results of operations are based upon certain assumptions that the Company
believes are reasonable under the circumstances. The unaudited pro forma results
of  operations  for  the  year  ended  February  28,  2002, do not reflect total
nonrecurring  charges  of  $12.6  million  ($0.10  per share on a diluted basis)
related to transaction costs, primarily for the acceleration of vesting of stock
options,  which   were  incurred  by   Ravenswood  Winery,  Inc.  prior  to  the
acquisition.  The  unaudited  pro  forma results of operations do not purport to
present what the Company's results of operations would actually have been if the
aforementioned  transactions  had in fact occurred on March 1, 2000, nor do they
project  the Company's financial position or results of operations at any future
date  or  for  any  future  period.





     On  March  27, 2003, the Company acquired control of BRL Hardy Limited, now
known  as  Hardy  Wine  Company  Limited  ("Hardy"),  and  on April 9, 2003, had
acquired all of Hardy's outstanding capital stock (the "Hardy Acquisition"). See
Note  23  for  discussion.

4.   PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT:

     The major components of property, plant and equipment are as follows:





5.   INTANGIBLE ASSETS:

     The major components of intangible assets are:



     The  difference  between  the gross carrying amount and net carrying amount
for  each  item   presented   is  attributable  to   accumulated   amortization.
Amortization  expense  for intangible assets was $2.2 million, $13.4 million and
$10.4  million  for  the  years  ended  February 28, 2003, February 28, 2002 and
February 28, 2001, respectively.  Estimated amortization expense for each of the
five  succeeding  fiscal  years  is  as  follows:

               (in thousands)
               2004            $ 1,625
               2005            $ 1,427
               2006            $ 1,362
               2007            $   365
               2008            $  -

6.   OTHER ASSETS:

     The major components of other assets are as follows:



     Amortization  expense for other assets was included in selling, general and
administrative  expenses and was $3.7 million, $4.0 million and $4.1 million for
the  years  ended  February  28, 2003, February 28, 2002, and February 28, 2001,
respectively.



7.   INVESTMENT IN JOINT VENTURE:

     On  July  31, 2001, the Company and Hardy (as defined in Note 23) completed
the  formation  of  Pacific  Wine  Partners  LLC  ("PWP"), a joint venture owned
equally  by  the Company and Hardy. The Company contributed to PWP assets with a
carrying  amount  of  $30.0  million plus $5.5 million of cash. The Company sold
assets  with  a  carrying  amount  of  $31.2 million to Hardy and received $34.9
million  in  cash.  Hardy  contributed these assets plus $5.5 million of cash to
PWP. The Company and PWP are parties to the following agreements: crushing, wine
production,  bottling, storage, and related services agreement; inventory supply
agreement;  sublease  and assumption agreements pertaining to certain vineyards,
which agreements include a market value adjustment provision; and a market value
adjustment  agreement  relating  to  a certain vineyard lease held by PWP. As of
February 28, 2003, amounts related to the above agreements were not material.

     On  October  16,  2001,  PWP  completed  the  purchase of certain assets of
Blackstone  Winery,  including the Blackstone brand and the Codera wine business
in Sonoma County (the "Blackstone Assets"). The purchase price of the Blackstone
Assets was $138.0 million and was financed equally by the Company and Hardy. The
Company  used revolving loan borrowings under its senior credit facility to fund
the  Company's  portion  of  the  transaction.

     As  of  February  28,  2003,  the  Company's  investment  balance, which is
accounted  for  under the equity method, was $123.1 million. The carrying amount
of the investment is less than the Company's equity in the underlying net assets
of  PWP  by  $3.9 million. This amount is included in earnings as the assets are
used  by  PWP.  Subsequent to February 28, 2003, the Company acquired Hardy (see
Note 23). Consequently, PWP will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company
and its results of operations will be included in the Consolidated Statements of
Income beginning March 26, 2003.

8.   OTHER ACCRUED EXPENSES AND LIABILITIES:

     The  major  components  of  other  accrued  expenses and liabilities are as
follows:





9.   BORROWINGS:

     Borrowings consist of the following:



     SENIOR CREDIT FACILITY -
     On  October  6,  1999,  the  Company,  certain  of  its principal operating
subsidiaries  and  a  syndicate  of banks (the "Syndicate Banks"), for which The
Chase  Manhattan Bank acts as administrative agent, entered into a senior credit
facility  (as  subsequently  amended,  the  "2000  Credit Agreement").  The 2000
Credit  Agreement  includes  both  U.S.  dollar   and  British  pound   sterling
commitments of the Syndicate Banks of up to, in the aggregate, the equivalent of
$1.0  billion  (subject  to  increase  as  therein  provided  to  $1.2 billion).
Proceeds  of  the  2000  Credit  Agreement  were  used  to repay all outstanding
principal  and  accrued  interest  on all loans under the Company's prior senior
credit  facility,  and  are available to fund permitted acquisitions and ongoing
working  capital  needs  of  the  Company  and  its subsidiaries.  Subsequent to
February  28,  2003, the Company entered into a new senior credit facility  (see
Note 23).

     The 2000 Credit Agreement provides for a $380.0 million Tranche I Term Loan
facility, a $320.0 million Tranche II Term Loan facility available for borrowing
in  British  pound  sterling,  and  a  $300.0  million Revolving Credit facility
(including  letters  of  credit up to a maximum of $20.0 million). The Tranche I
Term  Loan  facility  ($380.0  million)  and  the  Tranche II Term Loan facility
((pound)  193.4  million, or $320.0 million) were fully drawn at closing. During
Fiscal 2001, the Company used proceeds from operating activities to prepay $75.0
million  of the $380.0 million Tranche I Term Loan facility. During Fiscal 2002,
the Company used proceeds from the sale of 645,000 shares of the Company's Class
A  Common  Stock  (see  Note  15)  to  prepay $6.0 million of the $380.0 million
Tranche I Term Loan facility. During Fiscal 2003, the Company used proceeds from
operating  activities  to prepay $24.0 of the $380.0 million Tranche I Term Loan
facility.  On  November  17,  1999,  proceeds from the Sterling Senior Notes (as
defined  below)  were  used to prepay a portion of the $320.0 million Tranche II
Term  Loan  facility ((pound) 73.0 million, or $118.3 million). On May 15, 2000,
proceeds from the Sterling Series C Senior Notes (as defined below) were used to
prepay an additional portion of the $320.0 million Tranche II Term Loan facility
((pound)  78.8 million, or $118.2 million). During Fiscal 2003, the Company used
proceeds from operating activities to prepay an additional portion of the $320.0
million  Tranche II Term Loan facility ((pound) 29.0 million, or $45.6 million).

     The rate of interest payable, at the Company's option, is a function of the
London  interbank offering rate ("LIBOR") plus a margin, federal funds rate plus
a  margin, or the prime rate plus a margin.  The margin is adjustable based upon
the  Company's  Debt  Ratio  (as defined in the 2000 Credit Agreement) and, with
respect  to  LIBOR  borrowings, ranges  between  0.75% and 1.25%  for  Revolving



Credit  loans  and  1.00% and 1.75% for Term Loans. As of February 28, 2003, the
margin  was  1.00%  for  Revolving  Credit  loans  and  1.50% for Term Loans. In
addition  to  interest,  the Company pays a facility fee on the Revolving Credit
commitments  at  0.50% per annum as of February 28, 2003. This fee is based upon
the  Company's  quarterly  Debt  Ratio  and  can  range  from  0.25%  to  0.50%.

     Certain  of  the Company's principal operating subsidiaries have guaranteed
the  Company's  obligations  under  the  2000  Credit Agreement. The 2000 Credit
Agreement  has  as  collateral (i) first priority pledges of 100% of the capital
stock  of  Canandaigua  Limited  and  all  of  the  Company's domestic operating
subsidiaries  and  (ii)  first  priority  pledges of 65% of the capital stock of
Matthew  Clark  and  certain  other  foreign  subsidiaries.

     The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to customary lending covenants
including those restricting additional liens, incurring additional indebtedness,
the  sale  of assets, the payment of dividends, transactions with affiliates and
the  making  of  certain investments, in each case subject to customary baskets,
exceptions  and  thresholds.   The  primary  financial  covenants  require   the
maintenance  of  a  debt  coverage  ratio, a senior debt coverage ratio, a fixed
charges  ratio  and  an  interest  coverage  ratio.  Among  the most restrictive
covenants  contained  in  the  2000 Credit Agreement is the debt coverage ratio.

     As  of  February 28, 2003, under the 2000 Credit Agreement, the Company had
outstanding  term  loans  of  $145.4 million bearing a weighted average interest
rate  of  3.1%  and  $2.0  million of revolving loans bearing a weighted average
interest  rate  of 3.1%.  Amounts available to be drawn down under the Revolving
Credit  Loans,  after  deducting  undrawn letters of credit of $15.1 million and
$13.2  million, were $282.9 million and $236.8 million at February 28, 2003, and
February  28, 2002, respectively.  The Company had average outstanding Revolving
Credit  Loans  of  $11.3 million, $84.4 million, and $47.6 million for the years
ended February 28, 2003, February 28, 2002, and February 28, 2001, respectively.
The average interest rate on the Revolving Credit Loans was 3.2%, 4.8%, and 7.8%
for Fiscal 2003, Fiscal 2002, and Fiscal 2001, respectively.

10.  INCOME TAXES:

     Income before income taxes was generated as follows:

                                 For the Years Ended February 28,
                               ----------------------------------

              Domestic         $  294,557  $  202,190  $  127,608
              Foreign              40,379      27,769      34,629

                               $  334,936  $  229,959  $  162,237
                               ==========  ==========  ==========



     The income tax provision consisted of the following:



     The foreign provision for income taxes is based on foreign pretax earnings.
Earnings  of  foreign  subsidiaries  would be subject to U.S. income taxation on
repatriation  to the U.S.  The Company's consolidated financial statements fully
provide  for  any  related  tax  liability  on  amounts that may be repatriated.

     Significant  components of deferred tax (liabilities) assets consist of the
following:



     In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers
whether  it  is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets
will  not  be  realized.  Management  considers  the  reversal  of  deferred tax
liabilities and projected future taxable income in making this assessment. Based
upon  this  assessment,  management believes it is more likely than not that the
Company  will  realize  the  benefits  of  these  deductible  differences.



     A  reconciliation  of  the  total  tax  provision to the amount computed by
applying  the  statutory U.S. Federal income tax rate to income before provision
for  income  taxes  is  as  follows:



11.  OTHER LIABILITIES:

     The major components of other liabilities are as follows:



12.  PROFIT SHARING AND RETIREMENT SAVINGS PLANS:

     The Company's retirement and profit sharing plan, the Constellation Brands,
Inc.  401(k)  and  Profit  Sharing  Plan  (the "Plan"), covers substantially all
employees, excluding those employees covered by collective bargaining agreements
and  U.K.  employees.  The 401(k) portion of the Plan permits eligible employees
to  defer  a  portion of their compensation (as defined in the Plan) on a pretax
basis.  Participants  may  defer  up  to 12% of their compensation for the year,
subject  to  limitations of the Plan.  The Company makes a matching contribution
of  50% of the first 6% of compensation a participant defers.  The amount of the
Company's  contribution  under the profit sharing portion of the Plan is in such
discretionary  amount  as the Board of Directors may annually determine, subject
to  limitations  of  the  Plan.  Company contributions were $10.9 million, $10.5
million,  and  $8.2  million for the years ended February 28, 2003, February 28,
2002,  and  February  28,  2001,  respectively.

     The Company has defined benefit pension plans which cover substantially all
of  its U.K. and Canadian employees. Net periodic benefit (income) cost reported
in  the Consolidated Statements of Income for these plans includes the following
components:





     The  following  table summarizes the funded status of the Company's defined
benefit  pension  plans  and  the  related  amounts included in the Consolidated
Balance Sheets:





     As  of  February 28, 2003, the aggregate accumulated benefit obligation was
$212.2 million. The following table sets forth the principal assumptions used in
developing  the  benefit  obligation  and  the  net  periodic  pension  expense:



13.  POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS:

     The  Company  currently  sponsors  multiple unfunded postretirement benefit
plans for certain of its Imported Beer and Spirits segment employees.

     The status of the plans is as follows:



     Net periodic benefit cost reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income
includes  the  following  components:




     The following table sets forth the principal assumptions used in developing
the  benefit  obligation  and  the  net  periodic non-pension postretirement and
postemployment expense:



     At  February  28,  2003,  a 10.3% annual rate of increase and a 6.2% annual
rate  of increase in the per capita cost of covered health benefits were assumed
for  the  first  year  for  the  Non-U.S. and  U.S. plans,



respectively.  These rates were assumed to decrease gradually to 4.7% over seven
years and 4.0% over two years for the Non-U.S. and U.S. plans, respectively, and
to  remain at this level thereafter. Assumed healthcare trend rates could have a
significant  effect on the amount reported for health care plans. A 1% change in
assumed  health  care  cost  trend  rates  would  have  the  following  effects:



14.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES:

     OPERATING LEASES -
     Future  payments  under  noncancelable  operating  leases having initial or
remaining  terms  of one year or more are as follows during the next five fiscal
years and thereafter:

                                          =========

     Rental  expense  was  $25.3  million,  $24.0 million, and $19.6 million for
Fiscal 2003, Fiscal 2002, and Fiscal 2001, respectively.

     In connection with the formation of PWP, the Company transferred certain of
its  vineyard  lease  and  vineyard management agreements to PWP. The agreements
have  terms  that  expire  between  2012  and 2026. The Company guaranteed PWP's
payment  and performance under these agreements. The estimated maximum amount of
the  Company's  exposure  is  $42.6 million in undiscounted future payments. The
Company  has not recorded a liability for these guarantees and does not have any
collateral  from  PWP.

     PURCHASE COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES -
     The  Company  has  agreements with suppliers to purchase various spirits of
which  certain agreements are denominated in British pound sterling and Canadian
dollars.  The  maximum  future  obligation  under  these  agreements, based upon
exchange  rates  at  February  28,  2003,  aggregate $24.4 million for contracts
expiring through December 2007.

     All  of the Company's imported beer products are marketed and sold pursuant
to  exclusive distribution agreements from the suppliers of these products.  The
Company's agreement to distribute Corona Extra and its other Mexican beer brands
exclusively  throughout  25  primarily  western  U.S. states expires in December
2006,  with  automatic five year renewals thereafter, subject to compliance with
certain performance criteria and other terms under the agreement.  The remaining
agreements  expire  through December 2007.   Prior to  their  expiration,  these
agreements  may  be  terminated if the Company fails to meet certain performance
criteria.  At  February  28, 2003, the Company believes it is in compliance with
all  of  its material distribution agreements and, given the Company's long-term
relationships  with  its  suppliers,  the  Company  does  not believe that these
agreements  will  be  terminated.

     In  connection  with  previous acquisitions as well as with the Turner Road
Vintners  Assets  acquisition  and  the  Corus Assets  acquisition, the  Company
has  assumed  grape  purchase  contracts with



certain  growers  and  suppliers.  In  addition,  the Company  has entered  into
other  grape purchase contracts with various growers and suppliers in the normal
course of business. Under the grape purchase contracts, the Company is committed
to  purchase all grape production yielded from a specified number of acres for a
period of time from one to fifteen years. The actual tonnage and price of grapes
that  must  be purchased by the Company will vary each year depending on certain
factors,  including  weather, time of harvest, overall market conditions and the
agricultural practices and location of the growers and suppliers under contract.
The  Company  purchased  $166.6  million  and  $177.0  million  of  grapes under
contracts  during  Fiscal  2003  and Fiscal 2002, respectively. Based on current
production  yields  and  published  grape prices, the Company estimates that the
aggregate  purchases  under  these  contracts  over  the  remaining terms of the
contracts  will  be  $564.0  million.

     In  connection  with  the  Turner  Road Vintners Assets acquisition and the
Corus  Assets  acquisition,  the Company established a reserve for the estimated
loss  on  firm  purchase  commitments assumed at the time of acquisition.  As of
February 28, 2003, the remaining balance on this reserve is $32.8 million.

     The Company's aggregate obligations under bulk wine purchase contracts will
be  $17.3 million over the remaining terms of the contracts which expire through
fiscal 2007.

     EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS -
     The Company has employment contracts with certain of its executive officers
and  certain  other management personnel with automatic one year renewals unless
terminated  by  either  party. These agreements provide for minimum salaries, as
adjusted  for  annual  increases,  and  may include incentive bonuses based upon
attainment  of specified management goals. In addition, these agreements provide
for  severance  payments in the event of specified termination of employment. As
of  February  28,  2003,  the  aggregate  commitment for future compensation and
severance,  excluding  incentive  bonuses,  was  $5.1 million, none of which was
accruable  at  that  date.

     EMPLOYEES COVERED BY COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS -
     Approximately  28%  of  the  Company's  full-time  employees are covered by
collective  bargaining  agreements  at  February  28, 2003.  Agreements expiring
within  one  year  cover approximately 19% of the Company's full-time employees.

     LEGAL MATTERS -
     The  Company  is  subject  to  litigation from time to time in the ordinary
course  of  business.  Although the amount of any liability with respect to such
litigation  cannot  be  determined,  in the opinion of management such liability
will  not  have  a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition,
results  of  operations  or  cash  flows.

15.  STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY:

     COMMON STOCK -
     The Company has two classes of common stock: Class A Common Stock and Class
B  Convertible  Common  Stock.  Class  B  Convertible  Common  Stock  shares are
convertible  into  shares  of  Class A Common Stock on a one-to-one basis at any
time  at  the  option of the holder. Holders of Class B Convertible Common Stock
are  entitled  to  ten  votes  per  share.  Holders  of Class A Common Stock are
entitled  to one vote per share and a cash dividend premium. If the Company pays
a  cash  dividend  on  Class  B  Convertible Common Stock, each share of Class A
Common Stock will receive an amount at least ten percent greater than the amount
of  the  cash  dividend  per  share paid on Class B Convertible Common Stock. In
addition,  the  Board  of  Directors  may  declare and pay a dividend on Class A
Common  Stock  without  paying any dividend on Class B Convertible Common Stock.
However,  the  Company's  2000  Credit Agreement restricts the payment of a cash
dividend.



     In  July  2002, the stockholders of the Company approved an increase in the
number  of  authorized shares of Class A Common Stock from 120,000,000 shares to
275,000,000  shares  and Class B Convertible Common Stock from 20,000,000 shares
to  30,000,000  shares,  thereby  increasing  the aggregate number of authorized
shares of the Company to 306,000,000 shares.

     At  February 28, 2003, there were 78,685,751 shares of Class A Common Stock
and  12,075,590  shares  of Class B Convertible Common Stock outstanding, net of
treasury stock.

     COMMON STOCK SPLIT -
     During May 2002, a two-for-one stock split was distributed in the form of a
stock  dividend  to stockholders of record on April 30, 2002.  All share and per
share  amounts  have  been  retroactively  restated to give effect to the common
stock split.

     STOCK REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION -
     In June 1998, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of
up  to $100.0 million of its Class A Common Stock and Class B Convertible Common
Stock.  The  Company  may  finance  such  purchases,  which will become treasury
shares,  through  cash  generated  from  operations or through the senior credit
facility.  No shares were repurchased during Fiscal 2003, Fiscal 2002 and Fiscal
2001.

     EQUITY OFFERINGS -
     During  March  2001,  the  Company completed a public offering of 8,740,000
shares  of  its  Class  A  Common Stock, which was held as treasury stock.  This
resulted  in net proceeds to the Company, after deducting underwriting discounts
and  expenses, of $139.4 million.  The net proceeds were used to repay revolving
loan borrowings under the senior credit facility of which a portion was incurred
to  partially  finance  the  acquisition  of  the  Turner  Road Vintners Assets.

     During  October 2001, the Company sold 645,000 shares of its Class A Common
Stock, which was held as treasury stock, in connection with a public offering of
Class  A  Common  Stock by stockholders of the Company.  The net proceeds to the
Company,  after  deducting underwriting discounts, of $12.1 million were used to
repay  borrowings  under  the  senior  credit  facility.

     LONG-TERM STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN -
     Under  the  Company's  Long-Term  Stock  Incentive Plan, nonqualified stock
options,  stock  appreciation  rights,  restricted  stock  and other stock-based
awards  may  be granted to employees, officers and directors of the Company.  At
the Company's Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on July 20, 1999, stockholders
approved  the  amendment  to  the  Company's  Long-Term  Stock Incentive Plan to
increase  the  aggregate  number of shares of the Class A Common Stock available
for  awards  under  the  plan  from 16,000,000 shares to 28,000,000 shares.  The
exercise  price,  vesting  period and term of nonqualified stock options granted
are  established  by  the  committee  administering  the plan (the "Committee").
Grants  of  stock  appreciation  rights,  restricted stock and other stock-based
awards may contain such vesting, terms, conditions and other requirements as the
Committee  may  establish.  During  Fiscal 2003, Fiscal 2002 and Fiscal 2001, no
stock  appreciation  rights  were  granted.  During Fiscal 2003, 7,080 shares of
restricted  Class  A  Common Stock were granted at a weighted average grant date
fair  value  of $28.41 per share.  No restricted stock was granted during Fiscal
2002.  During Fiscal 2001, 15,100 shares of restricted Class A Common Stock were
granted  at  a  weighted  average  grant  date  fair  value of $13.31 per share.

     INCENTIVE STOCK OPTION PLAN -
     Under  the  Company's  Incentive Stock Option Plan, incentive stock options
may be granted to employees, including officers, of the Company.  Grants, in the
aggregate,  may  not  exceed  4,000,000  shares  of the Company's Class A Common
Stock.  The  exercise  price  of  any  incentive  stock  option  may



not  be less than the fair market value of the Company's Class A Common Stock on
the  date  of  grant.  The  vesting  period  and term of incentive stock options
granted  are  established  by the Committee. The maximum term of incentive stock
options  is  ten  years.

     A  summary  of  stock  option  activity under the Company's Long-Term Stock
Incentive  Plan  and  the  Incentive  Stock  Option  Plan  is  as  follows:



     The  following table summarizes information about stock options outstanding
at February 28, 2003:



     The  weighted  average  fair  value  of options granted during Fiscal 2003,
Fiscal  2002 and Fiscal 2001 was $12.18, $8.99 and $5.45, respectively. The fair
value  of  options  is  estimated  on  the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing  model with the following weighted average assumptions: risk-free
interest  rate of 5.0% for Fiscal 2003, 4.7% for Fiscal 2002 and 6.2% for Fiscal
2001;  volatility  of 36.7% for Fiscal 2003, 41.0% for Fiscal 2002 and 38.8% for
Fiscal  2001;  and  expected option life of 6.0 years for Fiscal 2003, 6.0 years
for  Fiscal  2002  and  4.7 years for Fiscal 2001. The dividend yield was 0% for
Fiscal  2003,  Fiscal  2002  and Fiscal 2001. Forfeitures are recognized as they
occur.

     EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLANS -
     The Company has a stock purchase plan under which 4,500,000 shares of Class
A  Common  Stock  may be issued. Under the terms of the plan, eligible employees
may  purchase  shares  of  the  Company's  Class  A Common Stock through payroll
deductions.  The  purchase price is the lower of 85% of the fair market value of
the  stock  on the first or last day of the purchase period. During Fiscal 2003,
Fiscal  2002 and Fiscal 2001, employees purchased 138,304 shares, 120,674 shares
and 147,776 shares, respectively.



     The  weighted  average  fair value of purchase rights granted during Fiscal
2003,  Fiscal 2002 and Fiscal 2001 was $7.02, $5.59 and $3.78, respectively. The
fair  value  of  purchase  rights  is  estimated  on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes  option-pricing   model   with  the   following  weighted  average
assumptions:  risk-free  interest  rate of 1.4% for Fiscal 2003, 2.6% for Fiscal
2002  and  5.7%  for Fiscal 2001; volatility of 40.3% for Fiscal 2003, 33.2% for
Fiscal  2002  and 36.8% for Fiscal 2001; and expected purchase right life of 0.5
years  for  Fiscal  2003, Fiscal 2002 and Fiscal 2001. The dividend yield was 0%
for Fiscal 2003, Fiscal 2002 and Fiscal 2001.

     The  Company  has a stock purchase plan under which 2,000,000 shares of the
Company's Class A Common Stock may be issued to eligible employees and directors
of  the  Company's  United  Kingdom  subsidiaries.  Under the terms of the plan,
participants  may  purchase shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock through
payroll  deductions.  The  purchase price may be no less than 80% of the closing
price  of  the  stock  on  the  day the purchase price is fixed by the committee
administering  the  plan.  During  Fiscal  2003, employees purchased 758 shares.
During  Fiscal  2002  and Fiscal 2001, there were no shares purchased under this
plan.

     The  weighted  average  fair value of purchase rights granted during Fiscal
2002 and  Fiscal  2001 was $6.26 and $5.18, respectively. There were no purchase
rights  granted  during  Fiscal  2003.  The  fair  value  of  purchase rights is
estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with
the following weighted average assumptions:  risk-free interest rate of 4.9% for
Fiscal  2002  and  6.7% for Fiscal 2001; volatility of 36.2% for Fiscal 2002 and
39.2%  for Fiscal 2001; and expected purchase right life of 3.8 years for Fiscal
2002  and  4.3  years for Fiscal 2001. The dividend yield was 0% for Fiscal 2002
and Fiscal 2001.

16.  EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE:

     Earnings per common share are as follows:



     Stock  options  to purchase 1.1 million, 2.2 million and 1.1 million shares
of  Class A Common Stock at a weighted average price per share of $27.41, $20.70
and  $13.93  were outstanding during the years ended February 28, 2003, February
28, 2002, and  February 28, 2001,  respectively,  but  were  not



included in the computation of the diluted earnings per common share because the
stock  options'  exercise price was greater than the average market price of the
Class  A  Common  Stock  for  the  respective  periods.

17.  ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS:

     Accumulated  other  comprehensive  loss,  net  of tax effects, includes the
following components:



18.  RELATED PARTIES:

     Agustin  Francisco  Huneeus,  the  executive  in  charge  of  the Fine Wine
segment,  along  with  other  members  of  his immediate family, through various
family  owned entities (the "Huneeus Interests") engaged in certain transactions
with  the  Fine  Wine segment during each of the three years in the period ended
February  28,  2003.  The  Huneeus Interests engage the Fine Wine segment as the
exclusive  distributor  of  its Quintessa wines under a long-term contract; sell
grapes  to the Fine Wine segment pursuant to existing long-term contracts; lease
a  vineyard consisting of 67 acres to the Fine Wine segment pursuant to a 5-year
lease  contract;  participate  as joint owners with the Fine Wine segment in the
ownership  and  operation  of  a winery and vineyards in Chile; and render brand
management  and  other consulting and advisory services in the United States and
internationally  to the Fine Wine segment and the Company. Total amounts paid or
payable to the Huneeus Interests pursuant to these transactions and arrangements
totaled $6.5 million, $4.8 million and $5.0 million for the years ended February
28,  2003,  February 28, 2002, and February 28, 2001, respectively. In addition,
the  Fine Wine segment performs certain wine processing services for the Huneeus
Interests. Total fees earned from the Huneeus Interests to the Fine Wine segment
for  these  services totaled $0.2 million, $0.4 million and $0.6 million for the
years  ended  February  28,  2003,  February  28,  2002,  and February 28, 2001,
respectively.  As  of  February 28, 2003, and February 28, 2002, the net amounts
due  to/from  the  Huneeus  Interests  under these agreements are insignificant.

19.  SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS AND CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK:

     Gross  sales  to  the  five largest  customers represented 21.2%, 19.1% and
17.6%  of  the  Company's  gross  sales  for  the years ended February 28, 2003,
February  28,  2002, and February 28, 2001, respectively. No single customer was
responsible  for  greater  than  10% of gross sales during these years. Accounts
receivable  from  the  Company's  largest  customer,  Southern Wine and Spirits,
represented 11.4%, 10.0% and 9.8% of the Company's total accounts receivable  as
of  February  28,  2003, February 28, 2002, and February 28, 2001, respectively.
Gross  sales to the Company's five largest customers are expected to continue to
represent  a  significant  portion  of  the  Company's  revenues.  The Company's
arrangements  with  certain  of  its  customers may, generally, be terminated by
either  party with prior notice. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations
of  its  customers'  financial position, and management of the Company is of the
opinion  that  any  risk  of significant loss is reduced due to the diversity of
customers  and  geographic  sales  area.

     The  Company purchases the majority of its glass inventories from a limited
number of suppliers. Glass bottle costs are one of the largest components of the
Company's cost of product sold. The glass bottle industry is highly concentrated
with  only  a  small  number of producers.  The  inability  of  any  of  the



Company's  glass  bottle  suppliers  to satisfy the Company's requirements could
adversely  affect  the  Company's  operations.

20.  CONDENSED CONSOLIDATING FINANCIAL INFORMATION:

     The  following  information  sets forth the condensed consolidating balance
sheets  as  of  February  28,  2003,  and  February  28,  2002,  the   condensed
consolidating statements of income and cash flows for each of the three years in
the  period  ended  February  28, 2003, for the Company, the parent company, the
combined  subsidiaries of the Company which guarantee the Company's senior notes
and  senior  subordinated  notes  ("Subsidiary  Guarantors")  and  the  combined
subsidiaries  of  the  Company  which  are  not Subsidiary Guarantors, primarily
Matthew  Clark,  which  is  included  in  the  U.K. Brands and Wholesale segment
("Subsidiary  Nonguarantors").  The  Subsidiary  Guarantors are wholly owned and
the guarantees are full, unconditional, joint and several obligations of each of
the  Subsidiary  Guarantors.  Separate  financial  statements for the Subsidiary
Guarantors  of  the Company are not presented because the Company has determined
that  such  financial  statements  would  not  be  material  to  investors.  The
Subsidiary  Guarantors  comprise  all of the direct and indirect subsidiaries of
the  Company,  other  than  Matthew Clark, the Company's Canadian subsidiary and
certain  other  subsidiaries  which  individually,  and  in  the  aggregate, are
inconsequential.  The  accounting policies of the parent company, the Subsidiary
Guarantors  and the Subsidiary Nonguarantors are the same as those described for
the  Company  in  the  Summary  of Significant Accounting Policies in Note 1 and
include  the  accounting changes described in Note 2.  There are no restrictions
on  the ability of the Subsidiary Guarantors to transfer funds to the Company in
the form of cash dividends, loans or advances.



21.  BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION:

     The  Company  reports  its  operating results in five segments: Popular and
Premium  Wine (branded popular and premium wine and brandy, and other, primarily
grape  juice  concentrate  and  bulk wine); Imported Beer and Spirits (primarily
imported  beer  and distilled spirits); U.K. Brands and Wholesale (branded wine,
cider  and bottled water, and wholesale wine, distilled spirits, cider, beer and
RTDs  soft drinks); Fine Wine (primarily branded super-premium and ultra-premium
wine)  and  Corporate  Operations and Other (primarily corporate related items).
Segment  selection  was based upon internal organizational structure, the way in
which  these  operations  are   managed  and  their  performance  evaluated   by
management,  and  the availability of separate financial results. The accounting
policies  of the segments are the same as those described for the Company in the
Summary  of Significant Accounting Policies in Note 1 and include the accounting
changes  described  in  Note  2. Transactions between segments consist mainly of
sales  of  products and are accounted for at cost plus an applicable margin. The
Company  evaluates  performance  based  on  operating  income  of the respective
business  units.

     Segment information is as follows:



     The  Company's  areas  of  operations are principally in the United States.
Operations  outside  the  United States consist of the U.K. Brands and Wholesale
segment's operations, which are primarily in the United Kingdom. No other single
foreign  country  or  geographic  area   is  significant  to  the   consolidated
operations.

22.  ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS NOT YET ADOPTED:

     In  August  2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.  143 ("SFAS No. 143"), "Accounting for
Asset  Retirement  Obligations." SFAS No. 143 addresses financial accounting and
reporting  for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived
assets  and  the  associated  retirement costs. As required, the Company adopted
SFAS  No.  143  on  March  1,  2003. The adoption of SFAS No. 143 did not have a
material  impact  on  the  Company's  financial  statements.

     In April 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.  145 ("SFAS No. 145"), "Rescission of FASB
Statements  No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical
Corrections."  SFAS No. 145 rescinds Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No.  4 ("SFAS No. 4"), "Reporting Gains and Losses from Extinguishment of Debt,"
Statement  of  Financial Accounting Standards No. 44, "Accounting for Intangible
Assets  of  Motor Carriers," and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
64,  "Extinguishments  of  Debt  Made  to Satisfy Sinking-Fund Requirements." In
addition,  SFAS  No.  145 amends Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
13,  "Accounting  for  Leases,"  to  eliminate an inconsistency between required
accounting  for  sale-leaseback  transactions  and  the  required accounting for
certain  lease  modifications  that  have  economic  effects that are similar to
sale-leaseback  transactions.  Lastly,  SFAS  No. 145 also amends other existing
authoritative  pronouncements  to  make  various  technical corrections, clarify
meanings,  or describe their applicability under changed conditions. The Company
is  required to adopt the provisions related to the rescission of SFAS No. 4 for
fiscal  years  beginning March 1, 2003. All other provisions of SFAS No. 145 are
effective  for  fiscal  years  beginning  March  1,  2002.  The  adoption of the
applicable  provisions  of  SFAS  No.  145 did not have a material impact on the
Company's  financial  statements. The adoption of the provisions rescinding SFAS
No.  4  provisions  will  result in a reclassification of the extraordinary loss
related  to  the extinguishment of debt recorded in the fourth quarter of Fiscal
2002  ($1.6  million,  net  of income taxes), by increasing selling, general and
administrative  expenses  ($2.6 million) and decreasing the provision for income
taxes ($1.0 million).

     In  November  2002,  the  Emerging  Issues  Task  Force  ("EITF") reached a
consensus on EITF Issue No. 00-21 ("EITF No. 00-21"), "Revenue Arrangements with
Multiple  Deliverables."  EITF  No.  00-21  addresses  certain  aspects  of  the
accounting  by  a  vendor  for arrangements under which it will perform multiple
revenue-generating  activities.  EITF  No.  00-21 also addresses how arrangement
consideration  should  be  measured  and  allocated  to  the  separate  units of
accounting  in the arrangement.  The  Company  is



required  to  adopt  EITF  No.  00-21  for all revenue arrangements entered into
beginning  August  1,  2003.  The  Company  is currently assessing the financial
impact  of  EITF  No.  00-21  on  its  financial  statements.

     In  December  2002,  the  FASB  issued  Statement  of  Financial Accounting
Standards    No.   148   ("SFAS  No.  148"),    "Accounting   for    Stock-Based
Compensation-Transition  and  Disclosure."  SFAS  No.  148  amends  Statement of
Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.  123  ("SFAS  No.  123"),  "Accounting for
Stock-Based  Compensation,"  to provide alternative methods of transition for an
entity that voluntarily changes to the fair value based method of accounting for
stock-based  employee  compensation.  SFAS  No.  148  also amends the disclosure
provisions  of SFAS No. 123 to require prominent disclosure about the effects on
reported  net  income of an entity's accounting policy decisions with respect to
stock-based  employee  compensation.  Lastly,  SFAS  No.  148  amends Accounting
Principles  Board  Opinion  No.  28  ("APB  Opinion No. 28"), "Interim Financial
Reporting,"  to  require  disclosure  about  those  effects in interim financial
information.  The  Company has adopted the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 148
for  the  fiscal year ended February 28, 2003.  The Company is required to adopt
the  amendment  to APB Opinion No. 28 for financial reports containing condensed
financial  statements  for  interim  periods  beginning  March 1, 2003.

     In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46 ("FIN No. 46"),
"Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities - an interpretation of ARB No. 51."
FIN  No.  46  requires  all variable interest entities to be consolidated by the
primary  beneficiary.  The  primary  beneficiary  is  the  entity that holds the
majority  of  the  beneficial  interests  in  the  variable  interest entity. In
addition,  the  interpretation expands disclosure requirements for both variable
interest  entities  that  are consolidated as well as variable interest entities
from  which  the  entity is the holder of a significant amount of the beneficial
interests,  but  not  the  majority.  Since the Company has no transactions with
variable  interest entities, the Company does not expect the adoption of FIN No.
46  in  its  entirety  to  have  a significant impact on the Company's financial
statements.

     In  April 2003, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No.  149 ("SFAS No. 149"), "Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities."  SFAS No. 149 amends and clarifies financial accounting
and  reporting  for  derivative  instruments,   including   certain   derivative
instruments   embedded   in  other  contracts   (collectively  referred  to   as
derivatives)  and  for  hedging  activities under SFAS No. 133.  SFAS No. 149 is
effective  for  contracts  entered  into  or  modified  after June 30, 2003, and
hedging  relationships  designated  after  June  30,  2003,   except  for  those
provisions  of  SFAS  No. 149 which relate to SFAS No. 133 Implementation Issues
that  have been effective for fiscal quarters that began prior to June 15, 2003.
For these issues, the provisions that are currently in effect should continue to
be  applied  in  accordance with their respective effective dates.  In addition,
certain  provisions  of SFAS No. 149, which relate to forward purchases or sales
of  when-issued  securities or other securities that do not yet exist, should be
applied to both existing contracts and new contracts entered into after June 30,
2003.  The  Company  is currently assessing the financial impact of SFAS No. 149
on  its  financial  statements.

23.  SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

     On  March  27, 2003, the Company acquired control of BRL Hardy Limited, now
known as Hardy Wine Company Limited ("Hardy"), and on April 9, 2003, the Company
completed  its  acquisition  of  all  of  Hardy's outstanding capital stock (the
"Hardy Acquisition").  Hardy is Australia's largest wine producer with interests
in  wineries  and vineyards in most of Australia's major wine regions as well as
New  Zealand,  France and the United States.  In addition, Hardy has significant
marketing and sales operations in the United Kingdom.  This acquisition supports
the  Company's strategy of driving long-term growth and positions the Company to
capitalize on the growth opportunities in "new world" wine markets.  As a result
of  the Hardy Acquisition, the Company also acquired the remaining 50% ownership
of  PWP,  the  joint  venture  the  Company established with Hardy in July 2001.
Total  consideration  paid  in  cash  and



Class  A  Common  Stock  to  the  Hardy   shareholders  was   $1,137.4  million.
Additionally,  the  Company  expects  to incur direct acquisition costs of $20.0
million.  The  acquisition  date  for accounting purposes is March 27, 2003. The
Company  expects to record an approximate $2 million  reduction in the  purchase
price  to  reflect  imputed interest between the accounting acquisition date and
the  final  payment  of  consideration.  The  cash portion of the purchase price
($1,060.2  million)  was  financed  with  $660.2 million of borrowings under the
Company's  2003  Credit  Agreement  (as  defined  below)  and  $400.0 million of
borrowings   under   the   Company's   Bridge  Agreement   (as  defined  below).
Additionally,  the  Company  issued  3,288,913  shares  of the Company's Class A
Common  Stock, which were valued at $77.2 million based on the simple average of
the  closing  market  price  of the Company's Class A Common Stock beginning two
days  before  and  ending  two  days  after  April  4,  2003,  the day the Hardy
shareholders  elected  the  form  of  consideration  they  wished to receive. In
accordance  with  the purchase method of accounting, the acquired net assets are
recorded  at fair value at the date of acquisition. The results of operations of
the  Hardy  business  will  be included in the Consolidated Statements of Income
beginning  on  the date of acquisition. The purchase price allocation, including
the  third-party  appraisal,  is  in  progress.

     In connection with the Hardy Acquisition, on January 16, 2003, the Company,
the  U.S.  subsidiaries of the Company (excluding certain inactive subsidiaries)
and  Canandaigua  Limited  ("Guarantors"),  JPMorgan Chase Bank, as a lender and
administrative  agent  (the  "Administrative  Agent"), and certain other lenders
(such  other  lenders,  together with the Administrative Agent, are collectively
referred  to herein as the "Lenders") entered into a new credit agreement, which
was  subsequently  amended  and  restated  on  March 19, 2003  (the "2003 Credit
Agreement").  The 2003 Credit Agreement provides for aggregate credit facilities
of  $1.6 billion consisting of a $400.0 million Tranche A Term Loan facility due
in February 2008, an $800.0 million Tranche B Term Loan facility due in November
2008  and  a  $400.0  million Revolving Credit facility (including an Australian
Dollar  revolving  sub-facility  of  up to A$10.0 million and a sub-facility for
letters of credit of up to $40.0 million) which expires on the fifth anniversary
of  the first date on which the Lenders' obligation to make loans under the 2003
Credit Agreement commences.

     The required annual repayments of the Tranche A Term Loan facility is $40.0
million  in  Fiscal 2004 and increases by $20.0 million each year through Fiscal
2008.  The  required  annual  repayments  of  the  Tranche B Term Loan, which is
backend  loaded, is $10.0 million in Fiscal 2004 and increases to $400.0 million
in Fiscal 2009.

     The  rate  of  interest  payable, at the Company's option, is a function of
LIBOR  plus  a  margin,  the federal funds rate plus a margin, or the prime rate
plus a margin.  The margin is adjustable based upon the Company's Debt Ratio (as
defined  in  the  2003  Credit Agreement) and, with respect to LIBOR borrowings,
ranges  between  1.75%  and  2.75%.  The  initial LIBOR margin for the Revolving
Credit facility and the Tranche A Term Loan facility is 2.25%, while the initial
LIBOR margin on the Tranche B Term Loan facility is 2.75%.

     The  Company's obligations are guaranteed by the Guarantors and the Company
has pledged collateral of (i)  100% of the capital stock of all of the Company's
U.S.  subsidiaries  and  (ii)  65%  of  the  voting capital stock of Canandaigua
Limited,  Matthew  Clark  plc,  Hardy,  Constellation  Australia Pty Limited and
certain  other  foreign subsidiaries of the Company.  In addition, under certain
circumstances,  the Company and the Guarantors are required to pledge certain of
their  assets  consisting of, among other things, inventory, accounts receivable
and  trademarks  to  secure  the  obligations  under  the 2003 Credit Agreement.

     The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to customary lending covenants
including  those  restricting  additional  liens,  the  incurrence of additional
indebtedness,  the  sale  of assets, the payment of dividends, transactions with
affiliates  and  the  making  of  certain  investments,  in each case subject to



baskets, exceptions and thresholds.  The primary financial covenants require the
maintenance  of  a  debt  coverage  ratio, a senior debt coverage ratio, a fixed
charges  ratio  and  an  interest  coverage  ratio.

     On January 16, 2003, the Company, the Guarantors, JPMorgan Chase Bank, as a
lender  and Administrative Agent, and certain other lenders (such other lenders,
together  with  the Administrative Agent, are collectively referred to herein as
the "Bridge Lenders") entered into a bridge loan agreement which was amended and
restated  as  of March 26, 2003, containing commitments of the Bridge Lenders to
make  bridge  loans  (the  "Bridge  Loans")  of  up to, in the aggregate, $450.0
million  (the  "Bridge  Agreement").  The  Bridge  Loans  are  due  on the first
anniversary  of  the  date  of  the  funding  of  the Bridge Loans ("Bridge Loan
Maturity  Date").  The  rate of interest payable on the Bridge Loans is equal to
LIBOR plus a margin.  The initial margin on the Bridge Loans is 3.75%.

     If  the  Bridge  Loans are not repaid on the Bridge Loan Maturity Date, the
Bridge  Lenders  have  committed  to  make  certain  term  loans  in  an  amount
corresponding to the then-outstanding amount of the Bridge Loans ("Term Loans").
The  Term  Loans  are  due  on  the seventh anniversary of the date on which the
Bridge  Loans  are  funded  ("Term  Loan  Maturity Date").  The rate of interest
payable  on  the  Term Loans is equal to LIBOR plus a margin.  If the Term Loans
are  not  repaid on the date that is three months after the Bridge Loan Maturity
Date,  then  the  margin will increase on a quarterly basis thereafter until the
Term  Loans  are refinanced, exchanged or otherwise repaid in full.  The rate of
interest  payable  on  any  of  the  Bridge Loans or the Term Loans is capped at
11.50%  ("Rate  Cap").

     The Lenders have the right to exchange on or after the Bridge Loan Maturity
Date  all  or a portion of their respective Bridge Loans or Term Loans for notes
("Exchange  Notes")  that  will be issued pursuant to an indenture to be entered
into  among  the  Company,  as  issuer,  certain subsidiaries of the Company, as
guarantors,  and  an  indenture trustee on behalf of the holders of the Exchange
Notes.  The  Exchange Notes indenture will be in a form to be agreed between the
Company and the Administrative Agent and will contain terms and a final maturity
date  that  are substantially consistent with the terms and the maturity date of
the  Term  Loans.  The  Exchange  Notes  will  bear  interest at a fixed rate as
determined  by  the  exchanging  holder  that  will  not  exceed  the  Rate Cap.

     The  Guarantors  have guaranteed the Company's obligations under the Bridge
Agreement.

     The  Company  and  the  Guarantors  have  made  certain representations and
warranties  in  the  Bridge  Agreement  which  are substantially the same as the
representations  and  warranties  in  the  2003  Credit  Agreement.  The  Bridge
Agreement  also contains covenants and events of default that are similar to the
covenants  and events of default in the indentures pursuant to which the Company
issued  its  senior  notes  and  senior  subordinated  notes.

     The  Company  used  the  proceeds  of the Tranche A Term Loan facility, the
Tranche  B  Term  Loan  facility  and a portion of the Revolving Credit facility
under  the 2003 Credit Agreement to payoff its obligations under the 2000 Credit
Agreement,  to fund a portion of the cash required to pay the Hardy shareholders
and  to pay indebtedness outstanding under certain of Hardy's credit facilities.
The  Company  also used $400.0 million of the Bridge Loans to fund the remaining
portion  of  the  cash  required  to  pay  the  former  Hardy  shareholders.
