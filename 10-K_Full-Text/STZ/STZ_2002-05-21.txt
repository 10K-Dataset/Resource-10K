ITEM 1.   BUSINESS
- -------   --------

INTRODUCTION

     Unless  the  context  otherwise  requires,  the  term  "Company"  refers to
Constellation  Brands,  Inc.  and  its  subsidiaries, and all references to "net
sales"  refer  to  gross revenue less excise taxes and returns and allowances to
conform  with the Company's method of classification.  All references to "Fiscal
2002",  "Fiscal 2001" and "Fiscal 2000" shall refer to the Company's fiscal year
ended the last day of February of the indicated year.

     During  Fiscal  2001, the Company changed its name from Canandaigua Brands,
Inc.  to  Constellation Brands, Inc.  The new name better reflects the Company's
dynamic  growth,  promising  potential  and  diversified  portfolio  as  well as
provides  a  clear  distinction  between  the corporate parent and its operating
divisions.

     Market share and industry data disclosed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K
have  been obtained from the following industry and government publications: The
Gomberg-Fredrikson  Report;  Adams  Liquor  Handbook; Adams Wine Handbook; Adams
Beer  Handbook;  Adams  Media  Handbook  Advance;  The  U.S. Wine Market: Impact
Databank  Review  and Forecast; The U.S. Beer Market: Impact Databank Review and
Forecast; The U.S. Spirits Market: Impact Databank Review and Forecast; NACM; AC
Nielsen;  The  Zenith  Guide; Beer Marketer's Insights; and The Drink Pocketbook
2001.  The  Company has not independently verified these data.  Unless otherwise
noted,  all  references to market share data are based on unit volume and unless
otherwise  noted, the most recent complete industry data available are for 2000.

     The Company is a leader in the production and marketing of beverage alcohol
brands  in  North America and the United Kingdom. As the second largest supplier
of  wine,  the  second  largest marketer of  imported beer and the third largest
supplier of distilled spirits, the Company is the largest single-source supplier
of these products in the United States.  In the United Kingdom, the Company is a
leading  marketer of wine, the second largest producer and marketer of cider and
a  leading  independent drinks wholesaler. With its broad product portfolio, the
Company  believes  it  is  distinctly positioned to satisfy an array of consumer
preferences  across  all  beverage  alcohol  categories.  Leading  brands in the
Company's  portfolio  include:   Franciscan  Oakville  Estate,  Simi,  Estancia,
Ravenswood,  Corona Extra, Modelo Especial, St. Pauli Girl, Almaden, Arbor Mist,
Talus,  Vendange,  Alice White, Black Velvet, Fleischmann's, Schenley, Ten High,
Stowells of Chelsea, Blackthorn and K.

     The  Company's  products  are  distributed  by  more  than  1,000 wholesale
distributors  in  North  America. In the United Kingdom, the Company distributes
its branded products and those of other companies to more than 16,500 customers.
The Company operates 29 production facilities throughout the world.  In addition
to  producing  and marketing its own brands, the Company also purchases products
for resale from other producers.

     The  Company is a Delaware corporation incorporated on December 4, 1972, as
the  successor  to  a  business founded in 1945. Since the Company's founding in
1945  as a producer and marketer of wine products, the Company has grown through
a combination of internal growth and acquisitions. The Company's internal growth
has  been  driven  by  leveraging  the  Company's  existing portfolio of leading
brands, developing new products, new packaging and line extensions, and focusing
on the faster growing sectors of the beverage alcohol industry. The acquisitions
of  Ravenswood Winery, Inc. ("Ravenswood"), the Corus Assets (as defined below),
the  Turner Road Vintners Assets (as defined below), Forth Wines Limited ("Forth
Wines"),  Franciscan  Vineyards,  Inc. ("Franciscan Estates"), Simi Winery, Inc.
("Simi"),



the  Black  Velvet  Assets  (as  defined  below) and Matthew Clark plc ("Matthew
Clark")  continued  a  series of strategic acquisitions made since 1991 by which
the  Company  has  broadened  its  portfolio and increased its market share, net
sales and cash flow.

COMMON STOCK SPLIT

     During April 2002, the  Board  of   Directors  of  the Company  approved  a
two-for-one  stock  split of both the Company's Class A Common Stock and Class B
Common  Stock,  which was distributed in the form of a stock dividend on May 13,
2002, to stockholders of record on April 30, 2002.  Pursuant to the terms of the
stock  dividend,  each  holder  of  Class A Common Stock received one additional
share  of Class A stock for each share of Class A stock held, and each holder of
Class  B  Common  Stock  received one additional share of Class B stock for each
share  of  Class  B  stock  held.  All  share  and  per  share amounts have been
retroactively restated to give effect to the common stock split.

ACQUISITIONS IN FISCAL 2002, FISCAL 2001 AND FISCAL 2000 AND JOINT VENTURE

     Through  the  acquisitions  described  below  and  prior  acquisitions, the
Company  has  become more competitive by: diversifying its portfolio; developing
strong  market  positions  in the growing beverage alcohol product categories of
varietal  table  wine  and  imported  beer; strengthening its relationships with
wholesalers;  expanding   its   distribution   and   enhancing   its  production
capabilities;  and  acquiring additional management, operational, marketing, and
research and development expertise.

     ACQUISITION OF RAVENSWOOD WINERY

     On  July 2, 2001, the Company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock
of Ravenswood Winery, Inc. ("Ravenswood"), a leading premium wine producer based
in  Sonoma, California. Ravenswood produces, markets and sells super-premium and
ultra-premium  California  wine  primarily  under the Ravenswood brand name. The
preliminary  purchase price of Ravenswood, including assumption of indebtedness,
was $151.8 million. The Ravenswood acquisition was consistent with the Company's
strategy of further penetrating the higher gross profit margin super-premium and
ultra-premium wine categories. The acquired operations have been integrated into
the Fine Wine segment (as defined below).

     ACQUISITION OF THE CORUS ASSETS

     On  March  26,  2001, in an asset acquisition, the Company acquired certain
wine  brands,  wineries,  working  capital  (primarily  inventories),  and other
related  assets  from  Corus  Brands,  Inc.  (the  "Corus  Assets").   In   this
acquisition,  the  Company  acquired  several  well-known  premium  wine  brands
primarily sold in the northwestern United States, including Covey Run, Columbia,
Ste.  Chapelle  and  Alice  White.  The  preliminary purchase price of the Corus
Assets, including assumption of indebtedness, was $52.3 million plus an earn-out
over  six  years  based on the performance of the brands. In connection with the
transaction,  the  Company  also  entered into long-term grape supply agreements
with  affiliates  of  Corus  Brands,  Inc.  covering  more  than  1,000 acres of
Washington and Idaho vineyards.

     ACQUISITION OF THE TURNER ROAD VINTNERS ASSETS

     On  March  5,  2001,  in an asset acquisition, the Company acquired several
well-known  premium  wine brands, including Vendange, Nathanson Creek, Heritage,
and  Talus, working capital (primarily inventories), two wineries in California,
and  other  related  assets  from  Sebastiani Vineyards, Inc. and Tuolomne River
Vintners  Group  (the  "Turner  Road Vintners Assets"). The preliminary purchase
price  of the Turner Road Vintners Assets, including assumption of indebtedness,
was $289.8 million.



     The  acquisition  of  the  Corus  Assets, along with the acquisition of the
Turner  Road  Vintners  Assets,  has strengthened the Company's portfolio in the
higher  margin  and growing premium table wine category. The acquired operations
have  been  integrated  into  the  Popular  and Premium Wine segment (as defined
below).

     ACQUISITION OF FORTH WINES

     On October 27, 2000, the Company acquired all of the issued Ordinary Shares
and  Preference  Shares  of  Forth  Wines Limited ("Forth Wines").  The purchase
price  of  the  shares  was  $4.5  million.  The addition of Forth Wines further
strengthened  Matthew  Clark's  position  as one of the United Kingdom's leading
drinks  wholesalers,  and made Matthew Clark the leading provider of wine to the
on-premise  market  in  Scotland.  The  acquired operations have been integrated
into the U.K. Brands and Wholesale segment (as defined below).

     ACQUISITIONS OF FRANCISCAN ESTATES AND SIMI

     On June 4, 1999, the Company purchased all of the outstanding capital stock
of  Franciscan  Estates  and,  in  related  transactions,  purchased  vineyards,
equipment  and  other  vineyard  related  assets  located in Northern California
(collectively  the  "Franciscan Acquisition"). The purchase price of the shares,
including  the  assumption  of  indebtedness,  net  of cash acquired, was $243.2
million.   Franciscan   Estates  is  one  of  the  foremost  super-premium   and
ultra-premium wine companies in California.

     Also on  June 4, 1999, the Company purchased all of the outstanding capital
stock  of  Simi.  (The  acquisition  of  the  capital stock of Simi is hereafter
referred  to  as  the  "Simi Acquisition".) The purchase price of the shares was
$57.5  million.  The  Simi  Acquisition  included  the  Simi  winery (located in
Healdsburg, California), equipment, vineyards, inventory and worldwide ownership
of  the  Simi  brand  name.  Founded in 1876, Simi is one of the oldest and best
known wineries in California, combining a strong super-premium and ultra-premium
brand  with  a flexible and well-equipped facility and high quality vineyards in
the  key  Sonoma  appellation.  On  February  29,  2000,  Simi  was  merged into
Franciscan Estates.

     The  Franciscan  and Simi Acquisitions established the Company as a leading
producer  and  marketer  of  super-premium  and  ultra-premium  wine.  Together,
Franciscan  Estates,  Simi   and   Ravenswood  represent   one  of  the  largest
super-premium and ultra-premium wine companies in the United States. The Company
operates Franciscan Estates, Simi and Ravenswood, and their properties, together
as a separate business segment (collectively, "Fine Wine").

     ACQUISITION OF THE BLACK VELVET ASSETS

     On  April  9,  1999,  in an asset acquisition, the Company acquired several
well-known  Canadian  whisky  brands,  including  Black  Velvet,  the third best
selling Canadian whisky and the 16th best selling distilled spirits brand in the
United States, production facilities located in Alberta and Quebec, Canada, case
goods  and  bulk  whisky inventories and other related assets from affiliates of
Diageo  plc  (collectively,  the  "Black Velvet Assets"). Other principal brands
acquired  in  the  transaction were Golden Wedding, OFC, MacNaughton, McMaster's
and  Triple  Crown. In connection with the transaction, the Company also entered
into  multi-year  agreements  with affiliates of Diageo plc to provide packaging
and  distilling  services  for  various   brands  retained  by  the  Diageo  plc
affiliates.  The purchase price of the Black Velvet Assets was $183.6 million.

     The  addition  of  the  Canadian  whisky   brands  from   this  transaction
strengthened  the  Company's  position  in  the North American distilled spirits
category,   and   enhanced  the  Company's  portfolio  of  brands



and  category  participation.  The acquired operations have been integrated into
the Imported Beer and Spirits segment (as defined below).

     PACIFIC WINE PARTNERS

     On July 31, 2001, the Company and BRL Hardy Limited completed the formation
of  Pacific  Wine  Partners  LLC  ("PWP"),  a joint venture owned equally by the
Company and BRL Hardy Limited, the second largest wine company in Australia. PWP
produces,  markets  and  sells  a global portfolio of premium wine in the United
States,  including a range of Australian imports. PWP has exclusive distribution
rights in the United States and the Caribbean to seven brands - Banrock Station,
Hardys,  Leasingham,  Barossa Valley Estate and Chateau Reynella from Australia;
Nobilo  from  New Zealand; and La Baume from France. The joint venture also owns
Farallon, a premium California coastal wine.  In addition, PWP owns a winery and
controls 1,400 acres of vineyards, all located in Monterey County, California.

     The  Company  contributed  to  PWP  assets  with a carrying amount of $30.0
million  plus  $5.5  million  of  cash.  The Company sold assets with a carrying
amount  of  $31.2  million  to BRL Hardy (USA) Inc. ("Hardy") and received $34.9
million  in  cash.  Hardy  contributed these assets plus $5.5 million of cash to
PWP.  The  Company  and  PWP  are parties to the following agreements: crushing,
wine  production,  bottling,  storage, and related services agreement; inventory
supply  agreement;  sublease  and  assumption  agreements  pertaining to certain
vineyards,  which  agreements include a market value adjustment provision; and a
market  value  adjustment agreement relating to a certain vineyard lease held by
PWP.

     On  October 16, 2001, the Company announced that PWP completed the purchase
of  certain  assets of Blackstone Winery, including the Blackstone brand and the
Codera   wine  business  in  Sonoma  County   (the  "Blackstone  Assets").   The
preliminary  purchase  price of the Blackstone Assets was $138.1 million and was
financed equally by the Company and Hardy.

     The  investment  in  PWP  is  accounted   for  using  the   equity  method;
accordingly,  the  results  of  operations of PWP since July 31, 2001, have been
included  in  the  equity  in earnings of joint venture line in the Consolidated
Statements of Income of the Company.

through  over  1,000  wholesalers,  as  well  as  through  state  and provincial
alcoholic beverage control agencies. The Popular and Premium Wine, Imported Beer
and  Spirits  and Fine Wine segments employ full-time, in-house marketing, sales
and  customer  service  organizations  to  develop  and  service  their sales to
wholesalers and state agencies.

     The Company believes that the organization of its sales force into separate
segments  positions  it  to  maintain  a  high  degree  of  focus on each of its
principal  product categories. However, where appropriate, the Company leverages
its sales and marketing skills across the organization, particularly in national
accounts.

     The  Company's  marketing strategy places primary emphasis upon promotional
programs  directed  at  its  broad  national  distribution  network,  and at the
retailers  served  by that network. The Company has extensive marketing programs
for  its  brands  including  promotional  programs  on both a national basis and
regional  basis  in  accordance  with  the strength of the brands, point-of-sale
materials, consumer media advertising, event sponsorship, market research, trade
advertising and public relations.

     UNITED KINGDOM

     The Company's U.K.-produced branded products are distributed throughout the
United  Kingdom  by  the  U.K.  Brands  and  Wholesale segment. The products are
packaged  at one of three production facilities. Shipments of cider and wine are
then  made  to  the  U.K.  Brands  and Wholesale segment's national distribution
center for branded products. All branded products are then distributed to either
the  on-premise  or  off-premise  markets  with  some of the sales to on-premise
customers  made  through  the  U.K.  Brands  and  Wholesale  segment's wholesale
business.  This  segment's  wholesale products are distributed through 11 depots
located  throughout the United Kingdom. On-premise distribution channels include
hotels,  restaurants,  pubs,  wine  bars and clubs. The off-premise distribution
channels include grocers, convenience retail and cash-and-carry outlets.



     The U.K. Brands and Wholesale segment employs full-time, in-house marketing
and  sales  organizations  that  separately  target  or  service the off-premise
customers  and  the  on-premise market in the United Kingdom for the U.K. Brands
and  Wholesale  segment's  branded  products  and the customers of its wholesale
business.

TRADEMARKS AND DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENTS

     Trademarks  are  an important aspect of the Company's business. The Company
sells its products under a number of trademarks, most of which the Company owns.
Throughout  its segments, the Company also has various licenses and distribution
agreements,  for  the production and/or sale of its products, as well as for the
sale  of  products  of third parties. These licenses and distribution agreements
have  varying terms and durations. Agreements include, among others, a long-term

Ten  High,  Crystal  Palace,  Northern  Light and Imperial Spirits brands; and a
long-term  license  agreement with the B. Manischewitz Company, which expires in
2042,  for  the  Manischewitz brand of kosher wine. On September 30, 1998, under
the  provisions  of  an  existing  long-term  license  agreement, Nabisco Brands
Company agreed to transfer to Barton all of its right, title and interest to the
corporate  name  "Fleischmann Distilling Company" and worldwide trademark rights
to the "Fleischmann" mark for alcoholic beverages. Pending the completion of the
assignment of such interests, the license will remain in effect.

     All  of the Company's imported beer products are marketed and sold pursuant
to exclusive distribution agreements with the suppliers of these products. These
agreements  have  terms that vary and prohibit us from importing other beer from
other  producers  from  the  same country. The Company's agreement to distribute
Corona  Extra  and other Mexican beer brands exclusively throughout 25 primarily
western  U.S.  states  expires  in December 2006 and, subject to compliance with
certain  performance  criteria, continued retention of certain Company personnel
and  other  terms  under  the  agreement,  will  be  automatically  renewed  for
additional  terms  of  five  years.  Changes in control of the Company or of its
subsidiaries  involved  in  importing  the  Mexican  beer brands, changes in the
position  of  the  Chief  Executive  Officer of Barton Beers, Ltd., including by
death or disability, or the termination of the President of Barton Incorporated,
may  be  a  basis  for  the  supplier,  unless  it  consents to such changes, to
terminate  the  agreement.  The  supplier's  consent  to such changes may not be
unreasonably  withheld. The Company's agreement for the importation of St. Pauli
Girl  expires  in December 2007. Prior to their expiration, these agreements may
be  terminated  if  the  Company fails to meet certain performance criteria. The
Company  believes  it is currently in compliance with its material imported beer
distribution  agreements.  From time to time, the Company has failed, and may in
the  future  fail,  to  satisfy certain performance criteria in its distribution
agreements.  Although  there  can  be  no  assurance  that  the  Company's  beer
distribution  agreements  will   be  renewed,  given  the  Company's   long-term
relationships  with its suppliers, the Company expects that such agreements will
be  renewed prior to their expiration and does not believe that these agreements
will be terminated.

COMPETITION

      The  beverage alcohol industry is highly competitive. The Company competes
on  the  basis  of  quality,  price,  brand  recognition  and  distribution. The
Company's  beverage  alcohol   products   compete   with  other   alcoholic  and
nonalcoholic  beverages for consumer purchases, as well as shelf space in retail
stores,  a  presence  in  restaurants  and  marketing  focus  by  the  Company's
wholesalers.  The  Company  competes  with  numerous multinational producers and
distributors  of  beverage  alcohol  products,  some  of  which may have greater
resources  than  the Company. In the United States, the Popular and Premium Wine
segment's  principal  competitors include E & J Gallo Winery and The Wine Group.
The  Imported  Beer and Spirits segment's principal competitors include Heineken
USA,   Molson  Breweries  USA,  Labatt's  USA,  Guinness  Bass  Import  Company,
Brown-Forman  Beverages,  Jim Beam Brands and Heaven Hill Distilleries, Inc. The
Fine Wine segment's principal competitors include Beringer Blass,



Robert  Mondavi  Corp.,  and  Kendall-Jackson.  In  the United Kingdom, the U.K.
Brands  and  Wholesale  segment's  principal  competitors  include  H.P. Bulmer,
Halewood  Vintners,  Waverley  Vintners  and  Volvic.  In  connection  with  its
wholesale  business,  the  U.K.  Brands  and  Wholesale  segment distributes the
branded wine of third parties that compete directly against its own wine brands.

PRODUCTION

     In the United States, the Company's wine is produced from several varieties
of  wine  grapes  grown principally in California. The grapes are crushed at the
Company's  wineries  and  stored as wine, grape juice or concentrate. Such grape
products may be made into wine for sale under the Company's brand names, sold to
other  companies  for  resale under their own labels, or shipped to customers in
the  form of juice, juice concentrate, unfinished wine, high-proof grape spirits
or brandy. Most of the Company's wine is bottled and sold within 18 months after
the  grape crush. The Company's inventories of wine, grape juice and concentrate
are  usually  at their highest levels in November and December immediately after
the  crush  of each year's grape harvest, and are substantially reduced prior to
the subsequent year's crush.

     The bourbon whiskeys, domestic blended whiskeys and light whiskeys marketed
by  the Company are primarily produced and aged by the Company at its distillery
in  Bardstown,  Kentucky.  Following  the  Black  Velvet Assets acquisition, the
majority  of the Company's Canadian whisky requirements are produced and aged at
its  Canadian  distilleries in Lethbridge, Alberta, and Valleyfield, Quebec.  At
its  Albany,  Georgia,  facility,  the Company produces all of the neutral grain
spirits and whiskeys it uses in the production of vodka, gin and blended whiskey
it  sells  to  customers in the state of Georgia.  The Company's requirements of
Scotch  whisky,  tequila,  mezcal  and  the neutral grain spirits it uses in the
production  of  gin  and  vodka  for  sale outside of Georgia, and other spirits
products, are purchased from various suppliers.

     The  Company  operates three facilities in the United Kingdom that produce,
bottle  and  package cider, wine and water. To produce Stowells of Chelsea, wine
is  imported  in  bulk from various countries such as Australia, Chile, Germany,
France, Spain, South Africa and the United States, which is then packaged at the
Company's  facility  at  Bristol  and  distributed under the Stowells of Chelsea
brand  name.  The Bristol facility also produces fortified British wine and wine
style  drinks.  All cider  production  takes place at  the Company's facility at
Shepton Mallet, where apples of many different varieties are purchased from U.K.
growers  and  crushed.  This  juice, along with European-sourced concentrate, is
then  fermented  into cider, blended and then packaged.  The Strathmore brand of
bottled  water  (which is available in still, sparkling, and flavored varieties)
is sourced and bottled in Forfar, Scotland.

     The  Company  operates  one winery in Chile that crushes, vinifies, cellars
and bottles wine.

SOURCES AND AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS

     The  principal  components  in  the  production  of  the  Company's branded
beverage  alcohol  products  are  packaging   materials  (primarily  glass)  and
agricultural products, such as grapes and grain.  The Company utilizes glass and
polyethylene  terephthalate  ("PET")  bottles  and other materials such as caps,
corks,  capsules,  labels and cardboard cartons in the bottling and packaging of
its  products.  Glass  bottle  costs  are  one  of the largest components of the
Company's  cost   of   product  sold.   The  glass  bottle  industry  is  highly
concentrated  with   only  a  small  number  of   producers.   The  Company  has
traditionally  obtained,  and continues to obtain, its glass requirements from a
limited  number  of  producers.  The  Company  has not experienced difficulty in
satisfying  its  requirements with respect to any of the foregoing and considers
its  sources  of  supply  to  be adequate.  However, the inability of any of the
Company's  glass  bottle  suppliers  to satisfy the Company's requirements could
adversely affect the Company's operations.



     Most  of the Company's annual grape requirements are satisfied by purchases
from  each  year's  harvest  which  normally  begins  in August and runs through
October.  The Company believes that it has adequate sources of grape supplies to
meet  its  sales  expectations.  However,  in  the event demand for certain wine
products exceeds expectations, the Company could experience shortages.

     The  Company  purchases  grapes from approximately 800 independent growers,
principally  in  the  San  Joaquin Valley and Central and North Coast regions of
California.  The Company enters into written purchase agreements with a majority
of  these  growers on a year-to-year basis. The Company currently owns or leases
approximately  6,500  acres of land and vineyards, either fully bearing or under
development,  in  California,  New  York and Chile. This acreage supplies only a
small percentage of the Company's total needs. The Company continues to consider
the  purchase or lease of additional vineyards, and additional land for vineyard
plantings, to supplement its grape supply.

     The  distilled  spirits  manufactured   by  the  Company   require  various
agricultural  products,  neutral  grain  spirits  and  bulk spirits. The Company
fulfills  its  requirements  through  purchases  from  various  sources  through
contractual  arrangements  and through purchases on the open market. The Company
believes  that adequate supplies of the aforementioned products are available at
the present time.

     In  the  United  Kingdom,  the  Company  manufactures  wine  and cider from
materials that are purchased either on a contracted basis or on the open market.
In  particular,  supplies  of  cider apples are sourced through long-term supply
arrangements  with  owners of apple orchards. There are adequate supplies of the
various raw materials at this particular time.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION

     The  Company's  operations  in  the  United States are subject to extensive
federal  and  state  regulation.  These  regulations cover, among other matters,
sales  promotion,  advertising  and  public  relations,  labeling and packaging,
changes in officers or directors, ownership or control, distribution methods and
relationships,  and requirements regarding brand registration and the posting of
prices  and  price  changes.  All of the Company's operations and facilities are
also  subject  to  federal,  state,  foreign  and  local  environmental laws and
regulations  and  the  Company  is  required  to  obtain permits and licenses to
operate its facilities.

     In the United Kingdom, the Company has secured a Customs and Excise License
to carry on its excise trade.  Licenses are required for all premises where wine
is  produced.  The  Company  holds  a  license  to  act  as  an excise warehouse
operator.  Registrations  have  been  secured  for  the  production of cider and
bottled water.  Formal approval of product labeling is not required.

     In  Canada,  the Company's operations are also subject to extensive federal
and  provincial  regulation.  These  regulations  cover,  among  other  matters,
advertising  and public relations, labeling and packaging, environmental matters
and  customs  and  duty  requirements.  The  Company  is also required to obtain
licenses and permits to operate its facilities.

     The Company believes that it is in compliance in all material respects with
all  applicable  governmental  laws  and   regulations  and  that  the  cost  of
administration  and  compliance  with,  and  liability   under,  such  laws  and
regulations  does  not  have,  and  is  not expected to have, a material adverse
impact  on  the  Company's  financial  condition,  results of operations or cash
flows.



EMPLOYEES

     The  Company  had  approximately  2,960  full-time  employees in the United
States  at  the  end  of  April 2002, of which approximately 840 were covered by
collective  bargaining  agreements.  Additional  workers  may be employed by the
Company during the grape crushing season.

     The  Company  had  approximately 1,900  full-time  employees  in the United
Kingdom  at  the  end of  April 2002, of which approximately 420 were covered by
collective bargaining agreements.  Additional workers may be employed during the
peak season.

     The Company  had approximately 220 full-time employees in Canada at the end
of April 2002, of which approximately 170 were covered by collective  bargaining
agreements.

     The Company considers its employee relations generally to be good.

                INFORMATION REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

     This  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K  contains "forward-looking statements"
within  the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E
of  the  Securities  Exchange  Act of 1934. These forward-looking statements are
subject  to  a  number  of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the
Company's  control,  that  could  cause actual results to differ materially from
those  set  forth  in,  or  implied  by,  such  forward-looking  statements. All
statements  other  than  statements  of historical facts included in this Annual
Report  on  Form 10-K, including the statements under this Item 1 "Business" and
Item  7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of  Operations"  regarding  our  business  strategy,  future financial position,
prospects, plans and objectives of management, as well as information concerning
expected   actions  of   third  parties  are  forward-looking  statements.   All
forward-looking  statements  speak  only as of the date of this Annual Report on
Form  10-K.  The  Company  undertakes  no  obligation  to  update  or revise any
forward-looking  statements,  whether  as  a  result  of new information, future
events  or  otherwise.  Although  the  Company  believes  that  the expectations
reflected  in  the  forward-looking  statements  are  reasonable, it can give no
assurance  that  such  expectations will prove to be correct. In addition to the
risks  and uncertainties of ordinary business operations, important factors that
could  cause  actual  results  to  differ materially from those set forth in, or
implied  by  the  Company's  forward-looking statements contained in this Annual
Report on Form 10-K are as follows:

COMPETITION COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS.

     The  Company is in a highly competitive industry and the dollar amount, and
unit  volume,  of  its  sales  could  be negatively affected by its inability to
maintain  or  increase  prices,  changes in geographic or product mix, a general
decline  in  beverage  alcohol  consumption  or  the  decision  of our wholesale
customers,  retailers  or  consumers to purchase competitive products instead of
the  Company's  products. Wholesaler, retailer and consumer purchasing decisions
are  influenced  by,  among  other  things,  the  perceived absolute or relative
overall  value  of  the  Company's products, including their quality or pricing,
compared  to  competitive  products.  Unit volume and dollar sales could also be
affected  by   pricing,  purchasing,  financing,  operational,  advertising   or
promotional decisions made by wholesalers and retailers which could affect their
supply  of,  or  consumer  demand for, the Company's products. The Company could
also  experience  higher  than  expected  selling,  general  and  administrative
expenses  if  the  Company  finds  it  necessary  to  increase the number of its
personnel or advertising or promotional expenditures to maintain its competitive
position or for other reasons.



INCREASE  IN  EXCISE  TAXES  AND  GOVERNMENT  RESTRICTIONS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL
ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS.

In the United States, the federal government and individual states impose excise
taxes on beverage alcohol products in varying amounts which have been subject to
change.  In  addition,  the  beverage  alcohol  products  industry is subject to
extensive  regulation  by state and federal agencies. The federal U.S. Bureau of
Alcohol,  Tobacco and Firearms and the various state liquor authorities regulate
such  matters  as licensing requirements, trade and pricing practices, permitted
and required labeling, advertising and relations with wholesalers and retailers.
Certain  federal  and state regulations also require warning labels and signage.
In  the  United Kingdom, Matthew Clark carries on its operations under a Customs
and  Excise  License.  Licenses  are  required  for  all  premises where wine is
produced.  Matthew  Clark holds a license to act as an excise warehouse operator
and  registrations  have  been  secured  for the production of cider and bottled
water.  Increases  in  excise  taxes  on beverage alcohol products in the United
States  or the United Kingdom, if enacted, could materially and adversely affect
the  Company's  financial  condition  or  results  of operations. New or revised
regulations  or  increased  licensing  fees  and  requirements could also have a
material  adverse  effect  on  the  Company's  financial condition or results of
operations.

THE COMPANY RELIES ON  THE PERFORMANCE OF WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTORS FOR THE SUCCESS
OF ITS BUSINESS.

     In  the  United  States,  the  Company  sells  its  products principally to
wholesalers  for  resale  to  retail  outlets  including grocery stores, package
liquor stores, club and discount stores and restaurants. The replacement or poor
performance  of  the  Company's  major wholesalers or the Company's inability to
collect  accounts  receivable   from  the  Company's   major  wholesalers  could
materially  and  adversely  affect  the  Company's  results  of  operations  and
financial  condition.  Distribution  channels for beverage alcohol products have
been  characterized in recent years by rapid change, including consolidations of
certain  wholesalers.  In  addition,  wholesalers and retailers of the Company's
products  offer  products which compete directly with the Company's products for
retail  shelf  space  and  consumer purchases. Accordingly, there is a risk that
these  wholesalers  or  retailers  may  give  higher priority to products of the
Company's  competitors.  In  the future, the Company's wholesalers and retailers
may  not  continue  to  purchase the Company's products or provide the Company's
products with adequate levels of promotional support.

THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS COULD  BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY A GENERAL  DECLINE IN THE
CONSUMPTION OF PRODUCTS THE COMPANY SELLS.

     In  the United States, notwithstanding the fact that there have been modest
increases  in  consumption of beverage alcohol in the most recent few years, the
overall  per  capita consumption of beverage alcohol products by adults (ages 21
and  over)  has declined substantially over the past 20 years. A general decline
in consumption could be caused by a variety of factors, including:

     -  a  general  decline  in  economic  conditions;

     -  increased  concern  about  the health consequences of consuming beverage
        alcohol products and about drinking and driving;

     -  a  trend  toward  a  healthier  diet  including  lighter,  lower calorie
        beverages such as diet soft drinks, juices and water products;

     -  the  increased  activity  of anti-alcohol consumer groups; and

     -  increased federal and state excise taxes.



THE COMPANY GENERALLY DOES NOT  HAVE LONG-TERM SUPPLY CONTRACTS AND  THE COMPANY
IS SUBJECT TO  SUBSTANTIAL  PRICE  FLUCTUATIONS  FOR  GRAPES  AND  GRAPE-RELATED
MATERIALS; THE COMPANY HAS A LIMITED GROUP OF SUPPLIERS OF GLASS BOTTLES.

     The  Company's  business  is  heavily dependent upon raw materials, such as
grapes,  grape  juice  concentrate, grains, alcohol and packaging materials from
third-party  suppliers.  The  Company  could  experience  raw  material  supply,
production  or  shipment difficulties which could adversely affect the Company's
ability  to supply goods to its customers. The Company is also directly affected
by  increases  in  the costs of such raw materials. In the past, the Company has
experienced  dramatic  increases  in  the  cost  of grapes. Although the Company
believes  it  has  adequate  sources  of grape supplies, in the event demand for
certain  wine  products  exceeds  expectations,  the  Company  could  experience
shortages. In addition, one of the Company's largest components of cost of goods
sold  is that of glass bottles, which have only a small number of producers. The
inability  of  any  of  the  Company's  glass  bottle  suppliers  to satisfy its
requirements could adversely affect the Company's business.

CURRENCY RATE FLUCTUATIONS/FOREIGN OPERATIONS.

     The  Company  has  operations  in  different  countries  and, therefore, is
subject  to the risks associated with currency fluctuations.   The Company could
experience  changes  in its ability to obtain or hedge against foreign currency,
foreign  exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates.  The Company could also
be  affected  by  nationalizations  or  unstable governments or legal systems or
intergovernmental   disputes.    These   currency,   economic   and    political
uncertainties  may  affect the Company's results, especially to the extent these
matters,  or  the  decisions,  policies  or  economic  strength of the Company's
suppliers, affect the Company's foreign operations or imported beer products.

THE COMPANY'S ACQUISITION OR JOINT VENTURE STRATEGIES MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL.

     The  Company  has  made  a  number  of  acquisitions,  including the recent
acquisitions  of  Ravenswood,  the  Turner  Road  Vintners  Assets and the Corus
Assets,  and  anticipates  that  it  may,  from time to time, acquire additional
businesses,  assets  or  securities of companies that the Company believes would
provide  a  strategic  fit  with its business. In addition, the Company recently
entered  into  a  joint  venture,  PWP,  with BRL Hardy. Also, PWP completed its
acquisition  of  the  Blackstone  Assets  and  may acquire other businesses. The
Company may enter into additional joint ventures. Acquired business will need to
be  integrated with the Company's existing operations. There can be no assurance
that  the  Company will effectively assimilate the business or product offerings
of  acquired  companies into its business or product offerings. Any acquisitions
will  also  be  accompanied  by  risks  such  as  potential  exposure to unknown
liabilities  of  acquired  companies  and the possible loss of key employees and
customers of the acquired business. Acquisitions are subject to risks associated
with  the  difficulty and expense of integrating the operations and personnel of
the  acquired  companies, the potential disruption to the Company's business and
the  diversion  of  management time and attention. The Company shares control of
PWP equally with BRL Hardy, and may not have majority interest or control of any
future  joint  venture. There is the risk that our joint venture partners may at
any  time  have  economic,  business  or  legal  interests  or  goals  that  are
inconsistent  with those of the joint venture or the Company. There is also risk
that  the  Company's joint venture partners may be unable to meet their economic
or  other  obligations  and  that  the  Company may be required to fulfill those
obligations  alone.  The  Company's failure or the failure of an entity in which
the  Company  has  a  joint  venture  interest  to  adequately  manage the risks
associated with any acquisitions or joint ventures could have a material adverse
effect on the Company's financial condition or results of operations.



THE COMPANY HAS A MATERIAL AMOUNT OF GOODWILL, AND IF THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO
WRITE DOWN GOODWILL DUE TO IMPAIRMENT, IT WOULD REDUCE THE COMPANY'S NET INCOME,
WHICH  IN  TURN  COULD  MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS.

     Approximately  $675.2  million (net of accumulated amortization), or 22.0%,
of  our  total assets as of February 28, 2002, represented unamortized goodwill.
Goodwill  is the amount by which the costs of an acquisition accounted for using
the  purchase  method  exceeds the fair market value of the net assets acquired.
The  Company  was  required  to  record  goodwill  as an intangible asset on the
balance  sheet  and  to  amortize  it  over  a  period of years. The Company has
historically  amortized  goodwill  on  a straight-line basis over a period of 40
years.  Even though it reduced the Company's net income for accounting purposes,
a  portion of the amortization of goodwill is deductible for tax purposes. Prior
to  March 1, 2002, the Company was required to evaluate periodically whether the
Company  could  recover its remaining goodwill from the undiscounted future cash
flows  that  the  Company  expected to  receive  from the operations of acquired
businesses.  If  these undiscounted cash flows were less than the carrying value
of  the  associated  goodwill,  the  goodwill  was deemed to be impaired and the
Company  would  have  reduced  the  carrying  value of the goodwill to equal the
discounted  future  cash  flows  and  recorded  the amount of the reduction as a
charge against net income.

     On July 20, 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standard No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets"
("SFAS  No.  142").  SFAS  No.  142  became  effective  on  July  1,  2001,  for
acquisitions occurring on or after that date and has been adopted by the Company
on March 1, 2002, for acquisitions that occurred prior to July 1, 2001. SFAS No.
142  results in goodwill no longer being amortized. Instead, goodwill is subject
to  a  periodic  impairment  evaluation based on the fair value of the reporting
unit.  Reductions in the Company's net income caused by a write-down of goodwill
could materially and adversely affect the Company's results of operations.

THE  TERMINATION  OR  NON-RENEWAL OF IMPORTED BEER DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENTS COULD
HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS.

     All  of the Company's imported beer products are marketed and sold pursuant
to  exclusive distribution agreements with the suppliers of these products which
are  subject to renewal from time to time. Our exclusive agreement to distribute
Corona  Extra  and  our  other  Mexican beer brands in 25 primarily western U.S.
states  expires  in  December  2006  and,  subject  to  compliance  with certain
performance  criteria,  continued retention of certain personnel and other terms
of  the  agreement,  will  be automatically renewed for additional terms of five
years.  Changes  in  control  of  the  Company  or  its subsidiaries involved in
importing  the Mexican beer brands, or changes in the chief executive officer of
such  subsidiaries,  may be a basis for the supplier, unless it consents to such
changes,  to terminate the agreement. The supplier's consent to such changes may
not be unreasonably withheld. Prior to their expiration, these agreements may be
terminated  if  the  Company  fails  to  meet  certain performance criteria. The
Company  believes  that  it  is currently in compliance with all of its material
imported beer distribution agreements. From time to time the Company has failed,
and  may  in  the  future  fail,  to satisfy certain performance criteria in the
Company's  distribution  agreements.  It  is  possible  that  the Company's beer
distribution  agreements  may  not  be  renewed  or  may  be terminated prior to
expiration.

THE COMPANY'S INDEBTEDNESS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS FINANCIAL
HEALTH.

     The  Company  has   incurred  substantial   indebtedness  to   finance  its
acquisitions  and may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future to
finance  further  acquisitions.  The  Company's ability to satisfy its financial
obligations  under the Company's indebtedness outstanding from time to time will
depend  upon  the  Company's  future  operating performance, which is subject to
prevailing economic conditions, levels of interest rates and financial, business
and  other  factors,  many of which are beyond the



Company's  control. Therefore, there can be no assurance that the Company's cash
flow  from  operations  will  be  sufficient  to  meet  all  of its debt service
requirements and to fund its capital expenditure requirements.

     The  Company's  current  and  future debt service obligations and covenants
could  have  important consequences. Such obligations and covenants, include and
may include the following:

     -  the  Company's  ability  to  obtain financing for future working capital
        needs or acquisitions or other purposes may be limited;

     -  a significant portion of the Company's cash flow from operations will be
        dedicated  to the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness,
      thereby reducing funds available for operations;

     -  the  Company  is  subject  to restrictive covenants that could limit its
        ability to conduct its business; and

     -  the  Company  may be more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions than
        less leveraged  competitors  and, thus, may be limited in its ability to
        withstand competitive pressures.

     The  restrictive covenants included in the Company's senior credit facility
and  its  indentures  include, among others, those restricting additional liens,
additional  borrowing,  the  sale  of assets, changes of control, the payment of
dividends,  transactions  with affiliates, the making of investments and certain
other fundamental changes. The senior credit facility also contains restrictions
on  acquisitions  and  certain  financial  ratio tests including a debt coverage
ratio,  a  senior  debt  coverage  ratio,  a fixed charges ratio and an interest
coverage  ratio. These restrictions could limit the Company's ability to conduct
business.  A  failure  to  comply  with  the obligations contained in the senior
credit facility or its indentures could result in an event of default under such
agreements,  which  could  require  the Company to immediately repay the related
debt and also debt under other agreements that may contain cross-acceleration or
cross-default provisions.

                         -----------------------------

ITEM 2.   PROPERTIES
- -------   ----------

     The  Company  consists  of four business operating segments.  Through these
business  segments,  the Company currently operates wineries, distilling plants,
bottling plants, and cider and water producing facilities, most of which include
warehousing  and  distribution  facilities  on  the  premises.  The Company also
operates  separate  distribution  centers  under  the  U.K. Brands and Wholesale
segment's wholesaling business.  The Company believes that all of its facilities
are  in  good condition and working order and have adequate capacity to meet its
needs  for  the  foreseeable  future.  The  Company's corporate headquarters are
located in offices leased in Fairport, New York.

     POPULAR AND PREMIUM WINE

     The  Popular  and  Premium Wine segment maintains its headquarters in owned
and  leased  offices in Canandaigua, New York. It operates three wineries in New
York,  located  in  Canandaigua, Naples and Batavia, six wineries in California,
located  in Madera, Lodi, Escalon, Fresno and Ukiah, two wineries in Washington,
located  in Woodinville and Sunnyside, and one winery in Caldwell, Idaho. All of
the  facilities  in  which  these  wineries  operate  are  owned, except for the
wineries  in  Batavia (New York), Caldwell (Idaho) and Woodinville (Washington),
which  are  leased.  This  segment  considers  its  principal wineries to be the
Mission  Bell  winery  in  Madera  (California)  and  the  Canandaigua winery in
Canandaigua  (New  York).  The  Mission  Bell  winery  crushes grapes, produces,
bottles  and  distributes

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
- ---------------------

FISCAL 2002 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2001

     NET SALES

     The  following  table sets forth the net sales (in thousands of dollars) by
operating segment of the Company for Fiscal 2002 and Fiscal 2001.



     Net  sales  for  Fiscal  2002  increased  to $2,820.5 million from $2,396.7
million for Fiscal 2001, an increase of $423.8 million, or 17.7%.

     POPULAR AND PREMIUM WINE

     Net  sales  for  the  Popular  and  Premium  Wine  segment  for Fiscal 2002
increased  to $862.8 million from $691.8 million for Fiscal 2001, an increase of
$171.0  million,  or 24.7%. This increase resulted primarily from $188.1 million
of  sales  of the newly acquired brands from the Turner Road Vintners Assets and
Corus  Assets  acquisitions  (the "March Acquisitions"), both completed in March
2001.  This increase was partially offset by declines in the Popular and Premium
Wine segment's grape juice concentrate business and certain other wine brands.

     IMPORTED BEER AND SPIRITS

     Net  sales  for  the  Imported  Beer  and  Spirits  segment for Fiscal 2002
increased  to  $1,047.4 million from $945.1 million for Fiscal 2001, an increase
of  $102.3  million,  or  10.8%.  This  increase resulted primarily from a 15.1%
increase  in  imported  beer  sales,  led  by  volume growth in the Mexican beer
portfolio.  Spirits  sales increased slightly primarily from an increase in bulk
whiskey  sales,  partially  offset  by slightly lower branded spirits sales as a
result  of  lower  net  selling  prices from the implementation of a net pricing
strategy  in  the  third  quarter  of  Fiscal 2001, which also resulted in lower
promotion costs.

     U.K. BRANDS AND WHOLESALE

     Net  sales  for  the  U.K.  Brands  and  Wholesale  segment for Fiscal 2002
increased  to $792.9 million from $691.1 million for Fiscal 2001, an increase of
$101.8  million, or 14.7%. Excluding an adverse foreign currency impact of $28.9
million, net sales increased $130.7 million, or 18.9%. This local currency basis
increase  resulted  primarily from a 27.1% increase in wholesale sales, with the
majority  of  this growth coming from organic sales. Additionally, branded sales
increased  7.4%  with  an  increase  in  wine  sales being partially offset by a
decrease in cider sales.

     FINE WINE

     Net  sales  for  the  Fine Wine segment for Fiscal 2002 increased to $142.2
million  from  $93.1  million  for Fiscal 2001, an increase of $49.1 million, or
52.7%. This increase resulted primarily from $32.9 million of sales of the newly
acquired  brands  from  the  Ravenswood  acquisition  and  organic  sales growth
primarily  due  to  volume  increases in the Estancia, Veramonte, and Franciscan
brands.



     GROSS PROFIT

     The Company's gross profit increased to $919.0 million for Fiscal 2002 from
$757.5  million  for  Fiscal  2001, an increase of $161.6 million, or 21.3%. The
dollar  increase  in  gross  profit  resulted  primarily from sales of the newly
acquired  brands  from  the  March  Acquisitions and the Ravenswood acquisition,
volume growth in the Imported Beer and Spirits segment's Mexican beer portfolio,
volume  growth  in  the  Fine Wine segment's portfolio, and volume growth in the
U.K.  Brands  and  Wholesale  segment's wholesale business and branded business.
These  increases  were  partially  offset by a decrease in the Imported Beer and
Spirits  segment's  spirits  sales  and an adverse foreign currency impact. As a
percent of net sales, gross profit increased to 32.6% for Fiscal 2002 from 31.6%
for  Fiscal  2001,  resulting  primarily from sales of higher-margin wine brands
acquired in the March Acquisitions and the Ravenswood acquisition.

     SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

     Selling,  general  and  administrative expenses increased to $576.6 million
for  Fiscal  2002  from  $486.6  million  for  Fiscal 2001, an increase of $90.0
million,  or  18.5%.  The dollar increase in selling, general and administrative
expenses resulted primarily from an increase in advertising, promotion, selling,
and  general  and administrative expenses associated with the brands acquired in
the  March  Acquisitions and the Ravenswood acquisition. In addition, there were
increases  in  promotion  and  advertising expenses associated with the Imported
Beer and Spirits segment's Mexican beer portfolio volume growth, the U.K. Brands
and  Wholesale  segment's  branded  business  volume  growth,  and the Fine Wine
segment's  portfolio volume growth. Selling, general and administrative expenses
as  a percent of net sales remained virtually unchanged at 20.4% for Fiscal 2002
as compared to 20.3% for Fiscal 2001.

     OPERATING INCOME

     The  following  table sets forth the operating income (loss) (in thousands
of dollars) by operating segment of the Company for Fiscal 2002 and Fiscal 2001.



     As  a  result  of  the  above factors, operating income increased to $342.5
million  for  Fiscal  2002  from  $270.9 million for Fiscal 2001, an increase of
$71.6 million, or 26.4%.

     INTEREST EXPENSE, NET

     Net  interest  expense  increased  to  $114.2  million for Fiscal 2002 from
$108.6  million  for  Fiscal  2001,  an  increase of $5.6 million, or 5.1%.  The
increase resulted primarily from an increase in the average borrowings primarily
due  to  the financing of the March Acquisitions and the Ravenswood acquisition,
partially offset by a decrease in the average interest rate.



     NET INCOME

     As  a  result  of the above factors, net income increased to $136.4 million
for  Fiscal  2002  from  $97.3  million  for  Fiscal  2001, an increase of $39.1
million, or 40.1%.

     For  financial  analysis  purposes  only,  the  Company's  earnings  before
interest,  taxes,  depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") for Fiscal 2002 were
$429.6  million,  an increase of $88.3 million over EBITDA of $341.3 million for
Fiscal  2001.  EBITDA  should  not  be  construed as an alternative to operating
income or net cash flow from operating activities and should not be construed as
an indication of operating performance or as a measure of liquidity.

FISCAL 2001 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2000

     NET SALES

     The  following  table sets forth the net sales (in thousands of dollars) by
operating segment of the Company for Fiscal 2001 and Fiscal 2000.



     Net  sales  for  Fiscal  2001  increased  to $2,396.7 million from $2,340.5
million for Fiscal 2000, an increase of $56.2 million, or 2.4%.



     POPULAR AND PREMIUM WINE

     Net  sales  for  the  Popular  and  Premium  Wine  segment  for Fiscal 2001
decreased  to  $691.8 million from $717.3 million for Fiscal 2000, a decrease of
$25.5  million,  or  (3.6)%.  The  decline resulted primarily from a decrease in
table  wine  sales,  a  decrease  in  sparkling wine sales as third quarter 2000
included  the  impact  of  sales  associated  with  Millennium activities, and a
decrease in grape juice concentrate sales. These decreases were partially offset
by increases in sales of Paul Masson Grande Amber and Arbor Mist.

     IMPORTED BEER AND SPIRITS

     Net  sales  for  the  Imported  Beer  and  Spirits  segment for Fiscal 2001
increased  to $945.1 million from $838.1 million for Fiscal 2000, an increase of
$107.0  million,  or  12.8%. This increase resulted primarily from volume growth
and  selling  price  increases  in  the  Mexican  beer  portfolio, selling price
increases  on tequila products and the inclusion of $11.3 million of incremental
net  sales  during  the  first  quarter  of Fiscal 2001 from the Canadian whisky
brands  acquired  as  part  of  the  Black  Velvet Assets acquisition, which was
completed in April 1999.

     U.K. BRANDS AND WHOLESALE

     Net  sales  for  the  U.K.  Brands  and  Wholesale  segment for Fiscal 2001
decreased  to  $691.1 million from $729.7 million for Fiscal 2000, a decrease of
$38.6  million,  or  (5.3)%.  This  decrease  resulted primarily from an adverse
foreign  currency  impact of $58.8 million. On a local currency basis, net sales
increased  2.8% primarily due to an increase in wholesale sales, including sales
from  the  recent  Forth  Wines  acquisition,  an increase in branded table wine
sales,  and  an increase in packaged cider sales. These increases were partially
offset by decreases in private label cider and draft cider sales.

     FINE WINE

     Net  sales  for  the  Fine  Wine segment for Fiscal 2001 increased to $93.1
million  from  $62.1  million  for Fiscal 2000, an increase of $31.0 million, or
49.9%.  As  the  acquisition  of  Franciscan  was  completed  in June 1999, this
increase  resulted  primarily  from  the inclusion of $21.9 million of net sales
from  the  first  quarter  of  Fiscal  2001  and  from  selling  price increases
instituted during the second quarter of Fiscal 2001.

     GROSS PROFIT

     The Company's gross profit increased to $757.5 million for Fiscal 2001 from
$722.5  million  for  Fiscal  2000,  an  increase of $35.0 million, or 4.8%. The
dollar  increase  in  gross  profit  was  primarily related to volume growth and
selling   price  increases  in  the  Company's  Mexican  beer  portfolio,  sales
attributable  to the acquisitions of Franciscan (completed in June 1999) and the
Black  Velvet  Assets  (completed in April 1999), and increases in the Fine Wine
segment's  selling  prices.  These increases were partially offset by an adverse
foreign  currency  impact.  As a percent of net sales, gross profit increased to
31.6% for Fiscal 2001 from 30.9% for Fiscal 2000, resulting primarily from sales
of  higher-margin  distilled  spirits  and  super-premium and ultra-premium wine
acquired  in  the  acquisitions  of  the  Black  Velvet  Assets  and Franciscan,
respectively,  and  from improved margins resulting from selling price increases
in  the Company's imported beer business and the Fine Wine segment portfolio, as
well  as  cost improvements in the U.K. Brands and Wholesale segment's cider and
wholesale businesses.



     SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

     Selling,  general  and  administrative expenses increased to $486.6 million
for  Fiscal  2001  from  $481.9  million  for  Fiscal  2000, an increase of $4.7
million,  or  1.0%.  The  dollar increase in selling, general and administrative
expenses  resulted  primarily  from  an  increase  in  selling  expenses  in all
operating  segments,  the  inclusion  of  the  Franciscan  business and expenses
related to the brands acquired in the Black Velvet Assets acquisition for a full
year  in Fiscal 2001, and an increase in expenses in Corporate Operations. These
increases  were  partially  offset  by  a  decrease in advertising and promotion
expenses,  primarily  in  the  Popular and Premium Wine segment, and a favorable
foreign  currency  impact.  Selling,  general  and  administrative expenses as a
percent of net sales decreased to 20.3% for Fiscal 2001 as compared to 20.6% for
Fiscal  2000  as  the  percent increase in net sales for Fiscal 2001 was greater
than  the  percent  increase in selling, general and administrative expenses for
Fiscal 2001.

     NONRECURRING CHARGES

     The  Company  incurred  nonrecurring charges of $5.5 million in Fiscal 2000
related to the closure of a cider production facility within the U.K. Brands and
Wholesale  operating  segment  in  the  United  Kingdom  ($2.9 million) and to a
management  reorganization within the Popular and Premium Wine operating segment
($2.6 million).  No such charges were incurred in Fiscal 2001.

     OPERATING INCOME

     The following table sets forth the operating income (loss) (in thousands of
dollars) by operating segment of the Company for Fiscal 2001 and Fiscal 2000.



     As  a  result  of  the  above factors, operating income increased to $270.9
million  for  Fiscal  2001  from  $235.0 million for Fiscal 2000, an increase of
$35.8  million,  or  15.2%.  Exclusive  of  the  aforementioned  $2.6 million in
nonrecurring  charges,  operating  income  for  the  Popular  and  Premium  Wine
operating  segment  increased  1.0%  in Fiscal 2001 from $49.9 million in Fiscal
2000.  Operating  income  for  the  U.K. Brands and Wholesale operating segment,
excluding  the  aforementioned  nonrecurring  charges of $2.9 million, decreased
4.8% in Fiscal 2001 from $51.4 million in Fiscal 2000.

     INTEREST EXPENSE, NET

     Net  interest  expense  increased  to  $108.6  million for Fiscal 2001 from
$106.1  million  for  Fiscal  2000,  an  increase of $2.5 million, or 2.4%.  The
increase  resulted primarily from an increase in the average interest rate which
was partially offset by a decrease in average borrowings.

     NET INCOME

     As a result of the above factors, net income increased to $97.3 million for
Fiscal 2001 from $77.4 million for Fiscal 2000, an increase of $20.0 million, or
25.8%.



     For  financial  analysis  purposes  only,  the  Company's  earnings  before
interest,  taxes,  depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") for Fiscal 2001 were
$341.3  million,  an increase of $41.5 million over EBITDA of $299.8 million for
Fiscal  2000.  EBITDA  should  not  be  construed as an alternative to operating
income or net cash flow from operating activities and should not be construed as
an indication of operating performance or as a measure of liquidity.


FINANCIAL LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
- -----------------------------------------

GENERAL

     The  Company's  principal  use  of  cash in its operating activities is for
purchasing  and carrying inventories.  The Company's primary source of liquidity
has  historically  been cash flow from operations, except during the annual fall
grape harvests when the Company has relied on short-term borrowings.  The annual
grape  crush  normally  begins  in August and runs through October.  The Company
generally  begins  purchasing  grapes  in  August  with payments for such grapes
beginning  to  come  due  in  September.  The Company's short-term borrowings to
support  such  purchases  generally  reach  their  highest levels in November or
December.   Historically,  the  Company  has  used   cash  flow  from  operating
activities to repay its short-term borrowings.  The Company will continue to use
its  short-term  borrowings  to  support  its working capital requirements.  The
Company  believes  that  cash provided by operating activities and its financing
activities,  primarily short-term borrowings, will provide adequate resources to
satisfy  its  working  capital,  liquidity  and  anticipated capital expenditure
requirements for both its short-term and long-term capital needs.

FISCAL 2002 CASH FLOWS

     OPERATING ACTIVITIES

     Net  cash  provided  by  operating  activities  for  Fiscal 2002 was $213.3
million,  which  resulted from $226.3 million in net income adjusted for noncash
items, less $13.0 million representing the net change in the Company's operating
assets  and  liabilities.  The  net  change  in operating assets and liabilities
resulted  primarily  from  increases  in  accounts  receivable  and  inventories
partially  offset  by  increases  in accounts payable, deferred revenue, accrued
salaries and commissions, and accrued advertising and promotions.

     INVESTING ACTIVITIES AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES

     Net  cash  used in investing activities for Fiscal 2002 was $585.4 million,
which  resulted  from net cash paid of $472.8 million for the March Acquisitions
and the Ravenswood acquisition, $77.3 million of equity contributions to PWP and
$71.1  million  of capital expenditures (including $10.1 million for vineyards),
partially  offset  by  $35.8  million  of  proceeds  from  the  sale  of assets.

     Net  cash  provided  by  financing  activities  for  Fiscal 2002 was $236.9
million,  which  resulted  primarily  from  proceeds  of $252.5 million from the
issuance  of  long-term  debt,  including  $250.0  million  of  8  1/8%   Senior
Subordinated  Notes  used  to repay $130.0 million of 8 3/4% Senior Subordinated
Notes  and  $65.0  million  of  8  3/4% Series C Senior Subordinated Notes and a
portion  of  the  Company's  borrowings  under  its  senior credit facility, net
proceeds of $151.5 million from equity offerings, proceeds of $51.4 million from
net  revolving loan borrowings under the senior credit facility, and proceeds of
$45.0  million  from  exercise  of  employee  stock options.  These amounts were
partially  offset  by  principal  payments  of long-term debt of $261.0 million,
which  included the repayments as discussed above and $54.7 million of scheduled
or required principal payments under the Company's senior credit facility.



     During  June  1998,  the  Company's  Board  of  Directors  authorized   the
repurchase  of  up  to  $100.0  million  of its Class A Common Stock and Class B
Common  Stock.  The  repurchase  of shares of common stock will be accomplished,
from  time  to  time,  in  management's  discretion  and  depending  upon market
conditions,  through  open  market  or  privately  negotiated  transactions. The
Company  may  finance such repurchases through cash generated from operations or
through  the senior credit facility. The repurchased shares will become treasury
shares.  As of May 15, 2002, the Company had purchased 4,075,344 shares of Class
A  Common  Stock at an aggregate cost of $44.9 million, or at an average cost of
$11.01 per share. No shares were repurchased during Fiscal 2002, Fiscal 2001 and
Fiscal 2000.

DEBT

     Total  debt  outstanding  as  of  February  28,  2002, amounted to $1,429.6
million,  an  increase  of  $63.8  million from February 28, 2001.  The ratio of
total  debt  to total capitalization decreased to 59.9% as of February 28, 2002,
from 68.9% as of February 28, 2001.

     SENIOR CREDIT FACILITY

     As  of  February  28,  2002,  under  the  2000 Credit Agreement (as defined
below),  the  Company  had  outstanding  term  loans of $281.3 million bearing a
weighted  average  interest rate of 3.9%, $50.0 million of outstanding revolving
loans  bearing  a  weighted  average  interest  rate of 3.1%, undrawn letters of
credit  of  $13.2 million, and $236.8 million in revolving loans available to be
drawn.

     During  June  1999,  the  Company  financed  the  purchase  price  for  the
Franciscan  Acquisition  primarily through additional term loan borrowings under
its  previous  senior  credit facility.  The Company financed the purchase price
for  the  Simi  Acquisition with revolving loan borrowings under the same senior
credit  facility.  During  August  1999,  as  discussed  below, a portion of the
Company's  borrowings under that senior credit facility were repaid with the net
proceeds of its Senior Notes (as defined below) offering.

     On  October  6,  1999,  the  Company,  certain  of  its principal operating
subsidiaries,  and  a  syndicate of banks (the "Syndicate Banks"), for which The
Chase  Manhattan Bank acts as administrative agent, entered into a senior credit
facility  (as  subsequently  amended,  the  "2000  Credit Agreement").  The 2000
Credit  Agreement  includes  both   U.S.  dollar  and   British  pound  sterling
commitments of the Syndicate Banks of up to, in the aggregate, the equivalent of
$1.0  billion  (subject  to  increase  as  therein  provided  to  $1.2 billion).
Proceeds  of  the  2000  Credit  Agreement  were  used  to repay all outstanding
principal  and  accrued  interest  on all loans under the Company's prior senior
credit  facility,  and  are available to fund permitted acquisitions and ongoing
working capital needs of the Company and its subsidiaries.

     The 2000 Credit Agreement provides for a $380.0 million Tranche I Term Loan
facility  due  in  December 2004, a $320.0 million Tranche II Term Loan facility
available  for  borrowing  in British pound sterling due in December 2004, and a
$300.0  million  Revolving  Credit facility (including letters of credit up to a
maximum  of  $20.0  million)  which expires in December 2004. The Tranche I Term
Loan  facility  ($380.0  million) and the Tranche II Term Loan facility ((pound)
193.4  million,  or  $320.0  million) were fully drawn at closing. During Fiscal
2001, the Company used proceeds from operating activities to prepay a portion of
the $380.0 million Tranche I Term Loan facility. During Fiscal 2002, the Company
used  proceeds  from  the sale of 645,000 shares of the Company's Class A Common
Stock (see Note 11) to pay an additional portion of the $380.0 million Tranche I
Term Loan facility. After these repayments, the required quarterly repayments of
the  Tranche I Term Loan facility were revised to $17.4 million for each quarter
in  2002,  $19.6  million  for  each quarter in 2003, and $20.0 million for each
quarter  in  2004. On November 17, 1999, proceeds from the Sterling Senior Notes
(as defined below) were used to repay a portion of the $320.0 million Tranche II
Term  Loan  facility ((pound) 73.0 million, or $118.3 million). On May 15, 2000,
proceeds from the Sterling Series C Senior Notes (as defined below) were used to
repay an



additional  portion of the $320.0 million Tranche II Term Loan facility ((pound)
78.8 million, or $118.2 million). After these repayments, the required quarterly
repayments  of  the  Tranche  II  Term Loan facility were revised to (pound) 0.4
million  ($0.6  million)  for each quarter in 2001 and 2002, (pound) 0.5 million
($0.7 million) for each quarter in 2003, and (pound) 8.5 million ($12.0 million)
for  each  quarter  in  2004  (the  foregoing  U.S. dollar equivalents are as of
February 28, 2002). There are certain mandatory term loan prepayments, including
those  based  on  sale  of  assets and issuance of debt and equity, in each case
subject to customary baskets, exceptions and thresholds.

     The rate of interest payable, at the Company's option, is a function of the
London  interbank offering rate ("LIBOR") plus a margin, federal funds rate plus
a  margin, or the prime rate plus a margin.  The margin is adjustable based upon
the  Company's  Debt  Ratio  (as defined in the 2000 Credit Agreement) and, with
respect to LIBOR borrowings, ranges between 0.75% and 1.25% for Revolving Credit
loans  and  1.00% and 1.75% for Term Loans.  As of February 28, 2002, the margin
was 1.125% for Revolving Credit loans and 1.625% for Term Loans.  In addition to
interest, the Company pays a facility fee on the Revolving Credit commitments at
0.50%  per  annum as of February 28, 2002.  This fee is based upon the Company's
quarterly Debt Ratio and can range from 0.25% to 0.50%.

     Certain  of  the Company's principal operating subsidiaries have guaranteed
the  Company's  obligations  under  the  2000 Credit Agreement.  The 2000 Credit
Agreement  is secured by (i) first priority pledges of 100% of the capital stock
of  Canandaigua Limited and all of the Company's domestic operating subsidiaries
and (ii) first priority pledges of 65% of the capital stock of Matthew Clark and
certain other foreign subsidiaries.

     The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to customary lending covenants
including those restricting additional liens, incurring additional indebtedness,
the  sale  of assets, the payment of dividends, transactions with affiliates and
the  making  of  certain investments, in each case subject to customary baskets,
exceptions  and  thresholds.   The  primary  financial  covenants   require  the
maintenance  of  a  debt  coverage  ratio, a senior debt coverage ratio, a fixed
charges  ratio  and  an  interest  coverage  ratio.  Among  the most restrictive
covenants contained in the 2000 Credit Agreement is the debt coverage ratio.

     On February 13, 2001, the 2000 Credit Agreement was amended to, among other
things,  permit  the  Company  to  finance  the  acquisition  of the Turner Road
Vintners  Assets  with  revolving loan borrowings, permit the refinancing of the
Original  Notes  (as  defined  below) and Series C Notes (as defined below) with
senior notes, and adjust the senior debt coverage ratio covenant.

     SENIOR NOTES

     SENIOR SUBORDINATED NOTES

     On December 27, 1993, the Company issued $130.0 million aggregate principal
amount  of  8 3/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due in December 2003 (the "Original
Notes").  On  October  29,  1996,  the  Company  issued  $65.0 million aggregate
principal  amount  of  8 3/4% Series B Senior Subordinated Notes due in December
2003,  which  in  February  1997  were  exchanged  for  $65.0  million aggregate
principal  amount  of  8 3/4% Series C Senior Subordinated Notes due in December
2003  (the  "Series  C  Notes").  In  February  2002,  the  Company redeemed the
Original  Notes  and  the Series C Notes with the proceeds from the January 2002
Senior  Subordinated  Notes   (as  defined  below).   In  connection  with  this
redemption,  the  Company  incurred  an extraordinary loss of $2.6 million ($1.6
million, net of income taxes) related to the write-off of the remaining deferred
financing costs and unamortized discount.



     On  March  4,  1999,  the Company issued $200.0 million aggregate principal
amount  of 8 1/2% Senior Subordinated Notes due March 2009 ("Senior Subordinated
Notes"). The net proceeds of the offering ($195.0 million) were used to fund the
acquisition  of the Black Velvet Assets and to pay the fees and expenses related
thereto  with  the  remainder  of  the  net  proceeds used for general corporate
purposes.  Interest  on the Senior Subordinated Notes is payable semiannually on
March  1  and  September 1 of each year, beginning September 1, 1999. The Senior
Subordinated  Notes  are redeemable at the option of the Company, in whole or in
part,  at  any time on or after March 1, 2004. The Senior Subordinated Notes are
unsecured  and  subordinated  to  the  prior  payment  in  full  of  all  senior
indebtedness  of  the  Company,  which  includes the senior credit facility. The
Senior  Subordinated  Notes  are  guaranteed, on a senior subordinated basis, by
certain of the Company's significant operating subsidiaries.

     On  January 23, 2002, the Company issued $250.0 million aggregate principal
amount  of  8  1/8%  Senior  Subordinated  Notes due January 2012 ("January 2002
Senior  Subordinated Notes").  The net proceeds of the offering ($247.2 million)
were  used  to  repay  the  Original Notes and the Series C Notes and to repay a
portion  of  the  outstanding  indebtedness  under  the  Company's senior credit
facility.  Interest  on  the  January  2002 Senior Subordinated Notes is payable
semiannually  on  January  15 and July 15 of each year, beginning July 15, 2002.
The  January  2002 Senior Subordinated Notes are redeemable at the option of the
Company,  in  whole  or  in part, at any time on or after January 15, 2007.  The
Company  may also redeem up to 35% of the January 2002 Senior Subordinated Notes
using  the  proceeds  of  certain  equity offerings completed before January 15,
2005.  The January 2002 Senior Subordinated Notes are unsecured and subordinated
to  the  prior  payment in full of all senior indebtedness of the Company, which
includes the senior credit facility.  The January 2002 Senior Subordinated Notes
are  guaranteed,  on  a  senior  subordinated basis, by certain of the Company's
significant operating subsidiaries.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS

     The  table  below  sets  forth  information  about  the Company's long-term
contractual obligations and other commercial commitments outstanding at February
28,  2002.  It  brings  together  data  for easy reference from the consolidated
balance  sheet and from individual notes to the Company's consolidated financial
statements.



EQUITY OFFERINGS

     During  March  2001,  the  Company completed a public offering of 8,740,000
shares  of  its  Class  A  Common  Stock, which was held as treasury stock. This
resulted  in net proceeds to the Company, after deducting underwriting discounts
and  expenses,  of $139.4 million. The net proceeds were used to repay revolving
loan borrowings under the senior credit facility of which a portion was incurred
to partially finance the acquisition of the Turner Road Vintners Assets.

     During  October 2001, the Company sold 645,000 shares of its Class A Common
Stock, which was held as treasury stock, in connection with a public offering of
Class  A  Common  Stock  by stockholders of the Company. The net proceeds to the
Company,  after  deducting underwriting discounts, of $12.1 million were used to
repay borrowings under the senior credit facility.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES

     During  Fiscal  2002,  the  Company  incurred  $71.1  million  for  capital
expenditures, including $10.1 million related to vineyards. The Company plans to
spend  $69.0 million for capital expenditures, exclusive of vineyards, in fiscal
2003.  In  addition,  the  Company continues to consider the purchase, lease and
development  of vineyards and may incur additional expenditures for vineyards if
opportunities  become available. See "Business - Sources and Availability of Raw
Materials"  under  Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management reviews
the capital expenditure program periodically and modifies it as required to meet
current business needs.

RELATED PARTIES

     Agustin  Francisco  Huneeus,  the  executive  in  charge  of  the Fine Wine
segment,  along  with  other  members  of  his immediate family, through various
family  owned entities (the "Huneeus Interests") engaged in certain transactions
with  the  Fine  Wine segment during each of the three years in the period ended
February  28,  2002.  The  Huneeus Interests engage the Fine Wine segment as the
exclusive  distributor  of  its Quintessa wines under a long-term contract; sell
grapes  to  the  Fine  Wine  segment  pursuant  to existing long-term contracts;
participate  as  partners  with  the  Fine  Wine  segment  in  the ownership and
operation  of  a  winery and vineyards in Chile; and render brand management and
other  consulting and advisory services in the United States and internationally
to  the  Fine  Wine  segment  and  the  Company.  Total  payments to the Huneeus
Interests  pursuant to these transactions and arrangements totaled $4.8 million,
$5.0  million,  and $3.2 million for the years ended February 28, 2002, February
28,  2001,  and  February  29,  2000,  respectively.  In addition, the Fine Wine
segment  performs  certain  wine  processing services for the Huneeus Interests.
Total  fees  received  from  the  Huneeus Interests to the Fine Wine segment for
these  services  totaled  $0.4  million,  $0.6 million, and $0.6 million for the
years  ended  February  28,  2002,  February  28,  2001,  and February 29, 2000,
respectively.  As of February 28, 2002 and 2001, the net amounts due to/from the
Huneeus Interests under these agreements are insignificant.



EFFECTS OF INFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES

     The  Company's  results of operations and financial condition have not been
significantly affected by inflation and changing prices, including rising energy
and  tequila  costs.  The  Company  has been able, subject to normal competitive
conditions,  to pass along rising costs through increased selling prices.  There
can be no assurances, however, that the Company will continue to be able to pass
along rising costs through increased selling prices.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     The  Company's  significant accounting policies are more fully described in
Note  1  to the Company's consolidated financial statements located in Item 8 of
this  Annual  Report  on Form 10-K. However, certain of the Company's accounting
policies  are particularly important to the portrayal of the Company's financial
position  and  results  of operations and require the application of significant
judgment  by  the  Company's  management;  as  a  result  they are subject to an
inherent  degree  of  uncertainty.  In  applying  those  policies, the Company's
management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used
in  the  determination  of  certain  estimates. Those estimates are based on the
Company's  historical  experience,  terms  of  existing contracts, the Company's
observance  of  trends  in  the  industry, information provided by the Company's
customers  and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate.
The  Company's  critical  accounting  policies  include:

     -  Inventory  valuation.  Inventories  are  stated  at the lower of cost or
        market,  cost  being  determined  on  the  first-in,  first-out  method.
        Reserves  for slow moving and obsolete inventories are provided based on
        historical  experience and current product demand. The Company evaluates
        the adequacy of these reserves quarterly.

     -  Accounting  for  acquisitions.  Acquisition  activities are an important
        element  of  the Company's business strategy. The Company's acquisitions
        typically  result  in goodwill and other intangible assets, which affect
        the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment
        charges that  may  be  incurred.  The determination of the fair value of
        such intangible assets and other assets acquired and liabilities assumed
        requires the Company's management to make estimates and assumptions that
        affect the Company's consolidated financial statements.

     -  Impairment of long-lived assets. The Company's long-lived assets include
        goodwill,  trademarks  and  other  intangible  assets.  In assessing the
        recoverability  of  the  Company's  goodwill  and other intangibles, the
        Company  must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and
        other  factors  to determine the fair value of the respective assets. If
        these  estimates  or their related assumptions change in the future, the
        Company may  be  required to record impairment charges for these assets.
        On March 1, 2002, the Company adopted  SFAS No. 142 (as  defined  below)
        and  will  be  required  to  analyze  its goodwill and other  intangible
        assets with indefinite lives for impairment issues during the first  six
        months of  fiscal 2003  and  then on  a  periodic basis thereafter.  The
        Company  currently  expects  to  complete  the initial impairment review
        during the first quarter of fiscal 2003.  The Company does not expect to
        record  an  impairment charge upon  completion  of  the  initial review.
        However,  there can  be  no assurance that  at the  time  the  review is
        completed  a  material  impairment  charge  will  not  be recorded.  Any
        resulting impairment charge could  have a material adverse impact on the
        Company's financial condition and results of operations.



ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

     During  2000  and  2001,  the Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") addressed
various  issues  related  to  the  income  statement  classification  of certain
promotional  payments,  including  EITF  Issue  No.  00-14  ("EITF  No. 00-14"),
"Accounting  for  Certain  Sales  Incentives,"  EITF  Issue No. 00-22 ("EITF No.
00-22"),  "Accounting  for 'Points' and Certain Other Time-Based or Volume-Based
Sales Incentive Offers, and Offers for Free Products or Services to Be Delivered
in  the  Future,"  and  EITF  Issue No. 00-25 ("EITF No. 00-25"), "Vendor Income
Statement  Characterization  of Consideration Paid to a Reseller of the Vendor's
Products."  In  November 2001, the EITF codified EITF No. 00-14, EITF No. 00-22,
and  EITF  No.  00-25  as  part  of  EITF  Issue  No.  01-09 ("EITF No. 01-09"),
"Accounting  for  Consideration  Given  by  a  Vendor to a Customer (Including a
Reseller  of the Vendor's Products)."  EITF No. 01-09 addresses the recognition,
measurement  and  income  statement  classification  of consideration given by a
vendor  to a customer (including both a reseller of the vendor's products and an
entity  that  purchases the vendor's products from a reseller).  EITF No. 01-09,
among  other  things, requires that certain consideration given by a vendor to a
customer  be  characterized  as  a  reduction  of revenue when recognized in the
vendor's income statement.  The Company currently reports such costs referred to
in  EITF  No.  00-14  and  EITF No. 00-25 as selling, general and administrative
expenses.  The  Company  is  required  to  adopt EITF No. 01-09 in its financial
statements  beginning March 1, 2002.  Upon adoption of EITF No. 01-09, financial
statements  for  prior  periods  presented  for  comparative  purposes  will  be
reclassified  to comply with the requirements of EITF No. 01-09.  For the fiscal
years  ended  February  28,  2002, February 28, 2001, and February 29, 2000, net
sales  will  be  reduced  by $222.4 million, $176.2 million, and $182.5 million,
respectively, cost of product sold will increase by $10.1 million, $7.8 million,
and $8.8 million, respectively, and selling, general and administrative expenses
will  decrease  by  $232.5   million,  $184.0   million,  and  $191.3   million,
respectively.  This  reclassification  will  not  effect operating income or net
income.

     In  July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial   Accounting   Standards   No.  141   ("SFAS   No.  141"),   "Business
Combinations."  SFAS  No.  141  addresses financial accounting and reporting for
business  combinations  requiring  all business combinations to be accounted for
using  one  method,  the  purchase  method. In addition, SFAS No. 141 supersedes
Accounting  Principles  Board  Opinion No. 16, "Business Combinations." SFAS No.
141  is effective immediately for all business combinations initiated after June
30, 2001, as well as for all business combinations accounted for by the purchase
method  for which the date of acquisition is July 1, 2001, or later. The Company
is  required  to  adopt SFAS No. 141 for all business combinations for which the
acquisition  date  was  before July 1, 2001, for fiscal years beginning March 1,
2002.  The  adoption  of the applicable provisions of SFAS No. 141 has not had a
material impact on the Company's financial statements. The Company believes that
the  adoption  of  the  remaining  provisions  of  SFAS  No. 141 will not have a
material  impact  on  its  financial  statements.  On March 1, 2002, the Company
reclassified  $59.9 million of previously identified separable intangible assets
into  goodwill  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  SFAS  No.  141.

     In  July  2001,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  also  issued
Statement  of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 ("SFAS No. 142"), "Goodwill
and  Other  Intangible  Assets." SFAS No. 142 addresses financial accounting and
reporting  for  acquired  goodwill  and  other  intangible assets and supersedes
Accounting  Principles Board Opinion No. 17, "Intangible Assets." Under SFAS No.
142, goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized but
are  reviewed at least annually for impairment. Separable intangible assets that
are  not  deemed  to  have an indefinite life will continue to be amortized over
their  useful lives. The Company is required to apply the provisions of SFAS No.
142  for  all goodwill and intangible assets acquired prior to July 1, 2001, for
fiscal  years  beginning  March  1,  2002.  For  goodwill  and intangible assets
acquired  after  June  30,  2001,  these  assets  are subject immediately to the
nonamortization  and  amortization  provisions  of  SFAS  No. 142. The Company's



assessment  of  the financial impact of SFAS No. 142 on its financial statements
is  that  $27.3  million  of amortization expense of existing goodwill and other
intangible  assets  for  the  fiscal  year ending February 28, 2002, will not be
incurred  in  subsequent  fiscal  years.   The  required  transition  impairment
evaluations are not expected to result in impairment charges.

     In  August  2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.  143 ("SFAS No. 143"), "Accounting for
Asset  Retirement Obligations."  SFAS No. 143 addresses financial accounting and
reporting  for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived
assets  and  the  associated  retirement costs. The Company is required to adopt
SFAS No. 143 for fiscal years beginning March 1, 2003.  The Company is currently
assessing the financial impact of SFAS No. 143 on its financial statements.

     In  October 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of  Financial Accounting Standards No. 144 ("SFAS No. 144"), "Accounting for the
Impairment  or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets."  SFAS No. 144 addresses financial
accounting  and  reporting  for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets.
SFAS  No.  144  supersedes  Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121,
"Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to
Be  Disposed  Of,"  and  the  accounting  and reporting provisions of Accounting
Principles  Board Opinion No. 30, "Reporting the Results of Operations-Reporting
the  Effects  of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual
and  Infrequently  Occurring  Events  and  Transactions,"  for the disposal of a
segment  of  a business (as previously defined in that Opinion).  The Company is
required  to  adopt  SFAS No. 144 for fiscal years beginning March 1, 2002.  The
Company  believes  the financial impact of  SFAS No. 144 will not be material on
its financial statements.

     In April 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.  145 ("SFAS No. 145"), "Rescission of FASB
Statements  No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical
Corrections."  SFAS No. 145 rescinds Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No.  4 ("SFAS No. 4"), "Reporting Gains and Losses from Extinguishment of Debt,"
Statement  of  Financial Accounting Standards No. 44, "Accounting for Intangible
Assets  of  Motor Carriers," and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
64,  "Extinguishments  of  Debt  Made  to Satisfy Sinking-Fund Requirements." In
addition,  SFAS  No.  145 amends Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
13,  "Accounting  for  Leases,"  to  eliminate an inconsistency between required
accounting  for  sale-leaseback  transactions  and  the  required accounting for
certain  lease  modifications  that  have  economic  effects that are similar to
sale-leaseback  transactions.  Lastly,  SFAS  No. 145 also amends other existing
authoritative  pronouncements  to  make  various  technical corrections, clarify
meanings,  or describe their applicability under changed conditions. The Company
is  required to adopt the provisions related to the rescission of SFAS No. 4 for
fiscal  years  beginning March 1, 2003. All other provisions of SFAS No. 145 are
effective  for fiscal years beginning March 1, 2002. The Company does not expect
the  adoption  of  SFAS  No.  145  to  have  a  material impact on its financial
statements.  However,  it  will  result  in a reclassification of the previously
reported  extraordinary  item,  net  of  income  taxes, to increase nonoperating
expense  ($2.6  million)  and  to  decrease the provision for income taxes ($1.0
million).

EURO CONVERSION ISSUES

     Effective  January  1,  1999, eleven of the fifteen member countries of the
European  Union  (the  "Participating  Countries")  established fixed conversion
rates  between  their  existing  sovereign  currencies  and the euro.  Effective
January  1,  2002,  the  euro  became  the  sole  currency  of the Participating
Countries.  The Company does not believe that the effects of the conversion will
have a material adverse effect on the Company's business and operations.



ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
- --------  ----------------------------------------------------------

     The  Company  is exposed to market risk associated with changes in interest
rates and foreign currency exchange rates.  To manage the volatility relating to
these  risks,  the  Company  periodically  enters  into  derivative transactions
including foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate swap agreements.
The  Company  has  limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and
does not use them for trading purposes.  The Company uses derivative instruments
solely to reduce the financial impact of these risks.

     The  fair  value  of  long-term  debt  is  subject  to  interest rate risk.
Generally, the fair value of long-term debt will increase as interest rates fall
and  decrease as interest rates rise.  The estimated fair value of the Company's
total  long-term  debt,  including  current  maturities, was $1,407.4 million at
February 28, 2002.  A hypothetical 1% increase from prevailing interest rates at
February  28,  2002,  would result in a decrease in fair value of fixed interest
rate  long-term  debt  by  $57.6 million.  Also, a hypothetical 1% increase from
prevailing  interest  rates at February 28, 2002, would result in an approximate
increase in cash required for interest on variable interest rate debt during the
next five fiscal years as follows:

                           2003     $2.5  million
                           2004     $1.7  million
                           2005     $0.7  million
                           2006     $ -
                           2007     $ -

     The  Company  has on occasion entered into interest rate swap agreements to
reduce  its exposure to interest rate changes relative to its long-term debt. At
February 28, 2002, the Company had no interest rate swap agreements outstanding.

     The  Company  has  exposure  to foreign currency risk as a result of having
international  subsidiaries in the United Kingdom and Canada.  For the Company's
operations  in the United Kingdom, the Company uses local currency borrowings to
hedge its earnings and cash flow exposure to adverse changes in foreign currency
exchange  rates.  At  February 28, 2002, management believes that a hypothetical
10%  adverse  change  in  foreign  currency exchange rates would not result in a
material  adverse  impact on either earnings or cash flow.  The Company also has
exposure to foreign currency risk as a result of contracts to purchase inventory
items  that  are  denominated in various foreign currencies.  In order to reduce
the  risk  of  foreign  currency exchange rate fluctuations resulting from these
contracts,  the  Company  periodically  enters  into  foreign  exchange  hedging
agreements.  At  February  28,  2002,  the potential loss on outstanding foreign
exchange  hedging  agreements  from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in foreign
currency exchange rates would not be material.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To Constellation Brands, Inc.:

We  have  audited  the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Constellation
Brands,  Inc.  (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries as of February 28, 2002
and  February  28,  2001,  and  the  related  consolidated statements of income,
changes  in  stockholders'  equity and cash flows for each of the three years in
the  period  ended  February  28,  2002.  These  financial  statements  are  the
responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in  the  United  States.  Those  standards  require that we plan and perform the
audit  to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free  of  material  misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An
audit  also  includes  assessing  the accounting principles used and significant
estimates  made  by  management,  as  well  as  evaluating the overall financial
statement  presentation.  We  believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis

                   CONSTELLATION BRANDS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                                FEBRUARY 28, 2002

1.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

     DESCRIPTION  OF  BUSINESS -
     Constellation  Brands,  Inc.  and  its subsidiaries (the "Company") operate
primarily  in  the  beverage  alcohol  industry.  The Company is a leader in the
production  and  marketing  of  beverage alcohol brands in North America and the
United  Kingdom.  The  Company  is  the  largest single-source supplier of wine,
imported beer and distilled spirits in the United States. In the United Kingdom,
the  Company is a leading producer and marketer of wine and cider, and a leading
independent  drinks  wholesaler.  The Company's products are distributed by more
than  1,000  wholesale distributors in North America. In the United Kingdom, the
Company  distributes  its  branded products and those of other companies to more
than 16,500 customers.

     PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION -
     The  consolidated  financial statements of the Company include the accounts
of  Constellation  Brands,  Inc.  and  all of its subsidiaries. All intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated.


     MANAGEMENT'S USE OF ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENT -
     The  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  conformity  with generally
accepted  accounting  principles  requires  management  to  make  estimates  and
assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of assets and liabilities and
disclosure  of  contingent  assets  and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements  and  the  reported  amounts  of  revenues  and  expenses  during the
reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.

     FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION -
     The  "functional  currency"  for  translating the accounts of the Company's
operations  outside  the  U.S.  is  the local currency. The translation from the
applicable  foreign  currencies  to  U.S. dollars is performed for balance sheet
accounts  using  current  exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and
for  revenue  and expense accounts using a weighted average exchange rate during
the period. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of
accumulated  other  comprehensive loss.  Gains or losses resulting  from foreign
currency  transactions  are  included  in  selling,  general  and administrative
expenses.

     CASH INVESTMENTS -
     Cash  investments  consist  of  highly  liquid investments with an original
maturity  when  purchased  of three months or less and are stated at cost, which
approximates  market  value.   The  amounts  at  February  28,  2002,  were  not
significant.  At  February  28, 2001, cash investments consist of investments in
commercial paper of $141.0 million, which were classified as held-to-maturity.


     FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS -
     To  meet  the  reporting  requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards  No. 107, "Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments," the
Company  calculates  the fair value of financial instruments using quoted market
prices  whenever  available.  When  quoted  market prices are not available, the
Company  uses standard pricing models for various types of financial instruments
(such  as  forwards,  options,  swaps, etc.) which take into account the present
value  of  estimated  future  cash  flows.  The  methods and assumptions used to
estimate the fair value of financial instruments are summarized as follows:



     ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE:  The  carrying  amount  approximates fair value due to
the  short  maturity of these instruments, the creditworthiness of the customers
and the large number of customers constituting the accounts receivable balance.
     NOTES PAYABLE:   These instruments are variable interest rate bearing notes
for which the carrying value approximates the fair value.
     LONG-TERM DEBT:   The carrying value of the debt facilities with short-term
variable  interest  rates  approximates  the  fair value.  The fair value of the
fixed  rate  debt  was  estimated by discounting cash flows using interest rates
currently available for debt with similar terms and maturities.
     FOREIGN EXCHANGE HEDGING AGREEMENTS:   The  fair  value of currency forward
contracts is estimated based on quoted market prices.
     LETTERS OF CREDIT: At February 28, 2002, and February 28, 2001, the Company
had  letters  of  credit  outstanding  totaling $13.2 million and $12.3 million,
respectively,  which  guarantee  payment  for  certain  obligations. The Company
recognizes  expense  on these obligations as incurred and no material losses are
anticipated.

     The  carrying  amount  and  estimated fair value of the Company's financial
instruments are summarized as follows:



     INTEREST RATE FUTURES AND CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS -
     From  time  to  time,  the  Company enters into interest rate futures and a
variety  of  currency  forward contracts in the management of interest rate risk
and  foreign  currency transaction exposure. The Company has limited involvement
with  derivative  instruments  and  does  not use them for trading purposes. The
Company  uses  derivatives  solely to reduce the financial impact of the related
risks.  Effective  March  1,  2001,  the  Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting  Standards  No.  133  ("SFAS  No.  133"),  "Accounting for Derivative
Instruments  and  Hedging  Activities", as amended, which establishes accounting
and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities.  SFAS
No.  133 requires that the Company recognize all derivatives as either assets or
liabilities  on  the  balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value.
The  adoption  of  SFAS  No. 133 did not have a material impact on the Company's
consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

     The Company uses foreign currency exchange agreements to reduce the risk of
foreign  currency  exchange rate fluctuations resulting primarily from contracts
to  purchase inventory items that are denominated in various foreign currencies.
Certain  of  these  derivative contracts are designated to hedge the exposure to
variable  cash flows of a forecasted transaction and are classified as cash flow
hedges.  As  such,  the effective portion of the change in the fair value of the
derivatives  is  recorded  each period in the balance sheet in accumulated other
comprehensive  income/loss  ("AOCI"),  and is reclassified into the statement of
income, primarily as  a  component  of  cost of product sold, in the same period
during  which  the  hedged  transaction  affects earnings.  The currency forward
exchange  contracts used generally have maturity terms of twelve months or less.
The Company expects the entire balance in AOCI related to cash flow hedges to be
reclassified  to  the  statement  of  income within the next twelve months.  The
Company  formally  documents  all  relationships between hedging instruments and
hedged items in accordance with SFAS No. 133 requirements.



     The  Company  uses  the  remaining  foreign currency exchange agreements to
reduce  the  risk  of  foreign  currency  exchange  rate  fluctuations resulting
primarily  from  recorded  accounts  payable   denominated  in  various  foreign
currencies.  As  these  derivative contracts have not been designated as hedging
instruments,  all  resulting  gains  or losses are recognized in earnings in the
period of change.

     The  Company has exposure to foreign currency risk, primarily in the United
Kingdom,  as  a  result  of  having international subsidiaries. The Company uses
local  currency  borrowings  to  hedge  its  earnings  and cash flow exposure to
adverse  changes  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates.  Such  borrowings  are
designated  as a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of the net investment in
the  foreign  operation.  Accordingly,  the  effective  portion  of  the foreign
currency gain or loss on the hedging debt instrument is reported in AOCI as part
of the foreign currency translation adjustments. For fiscal years ended February
28,  2002,  and  February 28, 2001, net gains of $5.4 million and $20.0 million,
respectively,  are  included  in foreign currency translation adjustments within
AOCI.

     INVENTORIES -
     Inventories  are  stated  at the lower of cost (computed in accordance with
the  first-in,  first-out method) or market. Elements of cost include materials,
labor and overhead and consist of the following:



     A  substantial  portion  of  barreled  whiskey  and brandy will not be sold
within  one  year  because  of  the duration of the aging process.  All barreled
whiskey  and brandy are classified as in-process inventories and are included in
current assets, in accordance with industry practice.  Bulk wine inventories are
also  included  as  in-process  inventories within current assets, in accordance
with  the  general  practices  of  the wine industry, although a portion of such
inventories  may  be  aged  for  periods  greater  than  one year.  Warehousing,
insurance,  ad  valorem  taxes and other carrying charges applicable to barreled
whiskey and brandy held for aging are included in inventory costs.

     PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT -
     Property,  plant  and  equipment  is  stated  at  cost. Major additions and
betterments  are charged to property accounts, while maintenance and repairs are
charged  to  operations  as  incurred.  The cost of properties sold or otherwise
disposed  of  and  the  related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the
accounts  at the time of disposal and resulting gains and losses are included as
a component of operating income.

     DEPRECIATION -
     Depreciation  is computed primarily using the straight-line method over the
following estimated useful lives:

                                           Depreciable Life in Years
                                           -------------------------
     Buildings and improvements                  10 to 33 1/3
     Machinery and equipment                      3 to 15
     Motor vehicles                               3 to 7

     Amortization  of  assets  capitalized under capital leases is included with
depreciation  expense. Amortization is calculated using the straight-line method
over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term.



     OTHER  ASSETS  -
     Other  assets,  which consist of goodwill, distribution rights, trademarks,
agency  license  agreements,  deferred financing costs, prepaid pension benefits
and  other  amounts,  are  stated  at  cost,  net  of  accumulated amortization.
Amortization  is  calculated on a straight-line or effective interest basis over
the following estimated useful lives:

                                         Useful Life in Years
                                         --------------------
     Goodwill                                     40
     Distribution rights                          40
     Trademarks                                   40
     Agency license agreements                 16 to 40
     Deferred financing costs                   5 to 10

     LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND INTANGIBLES -
     In  accordance  with  Statement  of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121,
"Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to
be  Disposed  of,"  the  Company  reviews  its  long-lived  assets  and  certain
identifiable   intangibles   for   impairment  whenever  events  or  changes  in
circumstances  indicate  that  the  carrying  amount  of  an  asset  may  not be
recoverable  on  an  undiscounted  cash  flow basis. The statement also requires
that,  when  an   impairment   has   occurred,  long-lived  assets  and  certain
identifiable  intangibles to be disposed of be reported at the lower of carrying
amount or fair value less cost to sell. The Company recorded an asset impairment
of  $1.4 million in Fiscal 2002 in connection with the sale of the Stevens Point
Brewery in March 2002.

     ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION COSTS -
     The Company generally expenses advertising and promotion costs as incurred,
shown  or  distributed.  Prepaid  advertising  costs  at  February 28, 2002, and
February  28, 2001, were not material. Advertising and promotion expense for the
years  ended  February  28, 2002, February 28, 2001, and February 29, 2000, were
$310.9 million, $264.4 million, and $279.6 million, respectively.

     INCOME TAXES -
     The  Company  uses the liability method of accounting for income taxes. The
liability  method accounts for deferred income taxes by applying statutory rates
in  effect  at  the  balance  sheet date to the difference between the financial
reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities.

     ENVIRONMENTAL -
     Environmental  expenditures  that relate to current operations are expensed
as appropriate. Expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past
operations, and which do not contribute to current or future revenue generation,
are  expensed.  Liabilities  are  recorded when environmental assessments and/or
remedial  efforts  are  probable,  and  the  cost  can  be reasonably estimated.
Generally,  the  timing  of  these  accruals  coincides with the completion of a
feasibility  study  or  the  Company's  commitment  to  a formal plan of action.
Liabilities for  environmental costs were not material at February 28, 2002, and
February 28, 2001.

     COMPREHENSIVE INCOME -
     Comprehensive  income  consists of net income, foreign currency translation
adjustments  and net unrealized gains on derivative instruments and is presented
in  the  Consolidated Statements of Changes in Stockholders' Equity. See Note 15
for changes in the components of accumulated other comprehensive loss.



     EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE -
     Basic  earnings  per  common  share  excludes  the  effect  of common stock
equivalents  and is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders
by  the  weighted  average number of common shares outstanding during the period
for  Class A Common Stock and Class B Convertible Common Stock. Diluted earnings
per common share reflects the potential dilution that could result if securities
or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common
stock.  Diluted  earnings per common share assumes the exercise of stock options
using  the  treasury  stock  method  and  assumes  the conversion of convertible
securities, if any, using the "if converted" method.

     COMMON STOCK SPLIT -
     During  April  2002,  the  Board  of Directors approved a two-for-one stock
split  of both the Company's Class A Common Stock and Class B Convertible Common
Stock,  which  will  be  distributed  in the form of a stock dividend on May 13,
2002,  to  stockholders  of  record  on  April 30, 2002. All share and per share
amounts  have  been  retroactively  restated  to give effect to the common stock
split.

     OTHER -
     Certain  February  28,  2001,  and  February  29,  2000, balances have been
reclassified to conform to current year presentation.

2.   ACQUISITIONS:

     BLACK VELVET ASSETS ACQUISITION -
     On  April  9,  1999,  in an asset acquisition, the Company acquired several
well-known Canadian whisky brands, including Black Velvet, production facilities
located  in  Alberta  and Quebec, Canada, case goods and bulk whisky inventories
and  other  related  assets  from  affiliates  of  Diageo plc (the "Black Velvet
Assets").  In  connection  with  the  transaction, the Company also entered into
multi-year  agreements  with  affiliates  of Diageo plc to provide packaging and
distilling  services  for  various brands retained by the Diageo plc affiliates.
The  purchase price was $183.6 million and was financed by the proceeds from the
sale of the Senior Subordinated Notes (as defined in Note 7).

     The  Black  Velvet  Assets acquisition was accounted for using the purchase
method;  accordingly,  the acquired assets were recorded at fair market value at
the  date  of  acquisition.  The excess of the purchase price over the estimated
fair market value of the net assets acquired (goodwill), $36.0 million, is being
amortized  on a straight-line basis over 40 years.  The results of operations of
the  Black  Velvet  Assets are reported in the Imported Beer and Spirits segment
and  have  been included in the Consolidated Statements of Income since the date
of acquisition.

     FRANCISCAN AND SIMI ACQUISITIONS -
     On June 4, 1999, the Company purchased all of the outstanding capital stock
of   Franciscan   Vineyards,  Inc.   ("Franciscan  Estates")   and,  in  related
transactions,  purchased  vineyards, equipment and other vineyard related assets
located in Northern California (collectively, the "Franciscan Acquisition"). The
purchase  price  was  $212.4  million  in  cash  plus  assumed debt, net of cash
acquired,  of  $30.8  million.  The  purchase  price  was  financed primarily by
additional  term loan borrowings under the senior credit facility. Also, on June
4,  1999,  the  Company  purchased  all of the outstanding capital stock of Simi
Winery,  Inc.  ("Simi")  (the  "Simi  Acquisition"). The cash purchase price was
$57.5  million  and  was  financed by revolving loan borrowings under the senior
credit  facility.  The  purchases  were accounted for using the purchase method;
accordingly,  the acquired assets were recorded at fair market value at the date
of  acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair market
value  of  the net assets acquired (goodwill) for the Franciscan Acquisition and
the  Simi  Acquisition,  $94.5  million and $5.8 million, respectively, is being
amortized  on  a  straight-line  basis over 40 years. The Franciscan Estates and
Simi  operations, together with  Ravenswood (as defined below), are managed as a
separate business



segment of the Company ("Fine Wine"). The results of operations of the Fine Wine
segment  have  been  included in the Consolidated Statements of Income since the
date of acquisition.

     FORTH WINES ACQUISITION -
     On  October  27,  2000,  the  Company  purchased all of the issued Ordinary
Shares  and  Preference  Shares  of  Forth  Wines  Limited ("Forth Wines").  The
purchase price was $4.5 million and was accounted for using the purchase method;
accordingly,  the  acquired net assets were recorded at fair market value at the
date  of  acquisition.  The  excess  of  the purchase price over the fair market
value of the net assets acquired (goodwill), $2.2 million, is being amortized on
a  straight-line  basis over 40 years.  The results of operations of Forth Wines
are  reported in the U.K. Brands and Wholesale segment and have been included in
the Consolidated Statements of Income since the date of acquisition.

     TURNER ROAD VINTNERS ASSETS ACQUISITION -
     On  March  5,  2001,  in an asset acquisition, the Company acquired several
well-known  premium  wine brands, including Vendange, Nathanson Creek, Heritage,
and  Talus, working capital (primarily inventories), two wineries in California,
and  other  related  assets  from  Sebastiani Vineyards, Inc. and Tuolomne River
Vintners  Group  (the  "Turner  Road Vintners Assets"). The preliminary purchase
price  of  the Turner Road Vintners Assets, including assumption of indebtedness
of  $9.4  million,  was  $289.8  million. The purchase price is subject to final
closing  adjustments  which  the  Company  does  not  expect to be material. The
acquisition  was  financed  by  the  proceeds from the sale of the February 2001
Senior  Notes  (as  defined  in  Note 7) and revolving loan borrowings under the
senior  credit  facility.  The  Turner  Road  Vintners  Assets  acquisition  was
accounted  for  using  the purchase method; accordingly, the acquired net assets
were  recorded at fair market value at the date of acquisition, subject to final
appraisal. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair market value
of  the  net assets acquired (goodwill), $146.1 million, is being amortized on a
straight-line  basis over 40 years. The results of operations of the Turner Road
Vintners  Assets  are  reported in the Popular and Premium Wine segment and have
been  included  in  the  Consolidated  Statements  of  Income  since the date of
acquisition.

     CORUS ASSETS ACQUISITION -
     On  March  26,  2001, in an asset acquisition, the Company acquired certain
wine  brands,  wineries,  working  capital  (primarily  inventories),  and other
related  assets  from   Corus  Brands,  Inc.  (the  "Corus  Assets").   In  this
acquisition,  the  Company  acquired  several  well-known  premium  wine  brands
primarily sold in the northwestern United States, including Covey Run, Columbia,
Ste.  Chapelle  and  Alice  White.  The  preliminary purchase price of the Corus
Assets,  including assumption of indebtedness of $3.0 million, was $52.3 million
plus  an  earn-out  over  six years based on the performance of the brands.  The
purchase  price  is  subject to final closing adjustments which the Company does
not expect to be material.  In connection with the transaction, the Company also
entered  into long-term grape supply agreements with affiliates of Corus Brands,
Inc.  covering  more  than  1,000  acres  of Washington and Idaho vineyards. The
acquisition  was financed with revolving loan borrowings under the senior credit
facility.  The  Corus  Assets  acquisition  was accounted for using the purchase
method;  accordingly, the acquired net assets were recorded at fair market value
at  the  date  of  acquisition,  subject  to final appraisal.  The excess of the
purchase  price  over the estimated fair market value of the net assets acquired
(goodwill),  $44.6  million, is being amortized on a straight-line basis over 40
years.  The  results  of  operations  of  the  Corus  Assets are reported in the
Popular  and  Premium  Wine  segment  and have been included in the Consolidated
Statements of Income since the date of acquisition.

     RAVENSWOOD ACQUISITION -
     On July 2, 2001, the Company acquired  all of the outstanding capital stock
of  Ravenswood  Winery,  Inc.  ("Ravenswood").  Ravenswood produces, markets and
sells  super-premium  and  ultra-premium  California  wine,  primarily under the
Ravenswood  brand name.  The preliminary purchase price of Ravenswood, including
assumption  of  indebtedness  of $2.9 million, was $151.8 million.  The purchase
price  is subject to final closing adjustments which the Company does not expect
to be material. The



purchase  price  was  financed  with  revolving loan borrowings under the senior
credit facility. The Ravenswood acquisition was accounted for using the purchase
method;  accordingly, the acquired net assets were recorded at fair market value
at  the  date  of  acquisition,  subject  to  final appraisal. The excess of the
purchase  price  over the estimated fair market value of the net assets acquired
(goodwill),  $98.9 million, is not amortizable and will be tested for impairment
at  least annually in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 142 (as defined
in  Note  21).  The  Ravenswood  acquisition  was  consistent with the Company's
strategy of further penetrating the higher gross profit margin super-premium and
ultra-premium  wine  categories.  The  results  of  operations of Ravenswood are
reported  in  the  Fine  Wine segment and have been included in the Consolidated
Statements of Income since the date of acquisition.

     The  following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the Ravenswood
assets  acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition. The Company
is  in  the process of obtaining third-party valuations of certain assets; thus,
the  allocation  of  the purchase price is subject to refinement. Estimated fair
values at July 2, 2001, are as follows:

          Current assets                               $  38,044
          Property, plant and equipment                   14,994
          Other assets                                       353
          Trademarks                                      50,000

          Current liabilities                             14,019
          Long-term liabilities                           34,396
                                                       ---------
            Total liabilities assumed                     48,415
                                                       ---------

          Net assets acquired                          $ 148,924
                                                       =========

     The  trademarks  are  not subject to amortization.  None of the goodwill is
expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

     The following table sets forth unaudited pro forma results of operations of
the Company for the fiscal years ended February 28, 2002, and February 28, 2001.
The unaudited pro forma results of operations give effect to the acquisitions of
the  Turner  Road  Vintners  Assets,  the Corus Assets and Ravenswood as if they
occurred on March 1, 2000. The unaudited pro forma results of operations for the
fiscal  year  ended  February  28,  2001,  does not give pro forma effect to the
acquisition  of  Forth  Wines  as  if it occurred on March 1, 2000, as it is not
significant.  The  unaudited pro forma results of operations are presented after
giving effect to certain adjustments for depreciation, amortization of goodwill,
interest  expense  on  the acquisition financing and related income tax effects.
The  unaudited  pro  forma  results  of operations for Fiscal 2002 (shown in the
table  below),  reflect  total  nonrecurring charges of $12.6 million ($0.09 per
share  on  a  diluted  basis)  related  to  transaction costs, primarily for the
acceleration  of  vesting  of  stock  options, which were incurred by Ravenswood
prior to the acquisition.

     The  unaudited  pro  forma  results  of operations are based upon currently
available information and upon certain assumptions that the Company believes are
reasonable  under  the  circumstances.   The  unaudited  pro  forma  results  of
operations  do  not  purport to present what the Company's results of operations
would actually have been if the aforementioned transactions had in fact occurred
on  such  date  or at the beginning of the period indicated, nor do they project
the  Company's financial position or results of operations at any future date or
for any future period.

     The major components of other assets are as follows:





5.   INVESTMENT IN JOINT VENTURE:

     On July 31, 2001, the Company and BRL Hardy Limited completed the formation
of  Pacific  Wine  Partners  LLC  ("PWP"),  a joint venture owned equally by the
Company and BRL Hardy Limited, the second largest wine company in Australia. PWP
produces,  markets  and  sells  a global portfolio of premium wine in the United
States, including a range of Australian imports.  PWP has exclusive distribution
rights in the United States and the Caribbean to seven brands - Banrock Station,
Hardys,  Leasingham,  Barossa Valley Estate and Chateau Reynella from Australia;
Nobilo  from New Zealand; and La Baume from France.  The joint venture also owns
Farallon, a  premium  California  coastal  wine.  In addition, PWP owns a winery
and  controls  1,400 acres  of  vineyards,  all  located  in  Monterey  County,
California.

     The  Company  contributed  to  PWP  assets  with a carrying amount of $30.0
million  plus  $5.5  million  of  cash.  The Company sold assets with a carrying
amount  of  $31.2  million  to BRL Hardy (USA) Inc. ("Hardy") and received $34.9
million  in  cash.  Hardy  contributed these assets plus $5.5 million of cash to
PWP.  The  Company  and  PWP  are parties to the following agreements: crushing,
wine  production,  bottling,  storage, and related services agreement; inventory
supply  agreement;  sublease  and  assumption  agreements  pertaining to certain
vineyards,  which  agreements include a market value adjustment provision; and a
market  value  adjustment agreement relating to a certain vineyard lease held by
PWP.  As  of February 28, 2002, amounts related to the above agreements were not
material.

     On  October 16, 2001, the Company announced that PWP completed the purchase
of  certain  assets of Blackstone Winery, including the Blackstone brand and the
Codera   wine   business  in  Sonoma  County  ("the  Blackstone  Assets").   The
preliminary  purchase  price of the Blackstone Assets was $138.1 million and was
financed  equally  by  the  Company and Hardy.  The purchase price is subject to
final closing adjustments which the Company does not expect to be material.  The
Company  used revolving loan borrowings under its senior credit facility to fund
the Company's portion of the transaction.

     As  of  February  28,  2002,  the  Company's  investment  balance, which is
accounted for under the equity method, was $110.5 million and is included on the
Consolidated  Balance  Sheets  in  other  assets.  The  carrying  amount  of the
investment is less than the Company's equity in the underlying net assets of PWP
by  $4.1 million.  This amount is included in earnings as the assets are used by
PWP.

6.   OTHER ACCRUED EXPENSES AND LIABILITIES:

     The  major  components  of  other  accrued  expenses and liabilities are as

7.   BORROWINGS:

     Borrowings consist of the following:



     SENIOR CREDIT FACILITY -
     On  October  6,  1999,  the  Company,  certain  of  its principal operating
subsidiaries  and  a  syndicate  of banks (the "Syndicate Banks"), for which The
Chase  Manhattan Bank acts as administrative agent, entered into a senior credit
facility (as subsequently amended, the "2000 Credit Agreement"). The 2000 Credit
Agreement  includes  both  U.S. dollar and British pound sterling commitments of
the  Syndicate  Banks of up to, in the aggregate, the equivalent of $1.0 billion
(subject  to increase as therein provided to $1.2 billion). Proceeds of the 2000
Credit  Agreement  were  used  to  repay  all  outstanding principal and accrued
interest  on all loans under the Company's prior senior credit facility, and are
available  to  fund  permitted acquisitions and ongoing working capital needs of
the Company and its subsidiaries.

     The 2000 Credit Agreement provides for a $380.0 million Tranche I Term Loan
facility  due  in  December 2004, a $320.0 million Tranche II Term Loan facility
available  for  borrowing  in British pound sterling due in December 2004, and a
$300.0  million  Revolving  Credit facility (including letters of credit up to a
maximum  of  $20.0  million)  which expires in December 2004. The Tranche I Term
Loan  facility  ($380.0  million) and the Tranche II Term Loan facility ((pound)
193.4  million,  or  $320.0  million) were fully drawn at closing. During Fiscal
2001, the Company used proceeds from operating activities to prepay a portion of
the $380.0 million Tranche I Term Loan facility. During Fiscal 2002, the Company
used  proceeds  from  the sale of 645,000 shares of the Company's Class A Common
Stock (see Note 13) to pay an additional portion of the $380.0 million Tranche I
Term Loan facility. After these repayments, the required quarterly repayments of
the  Tranche I Term Loan facility were revised to $17.4 million for each quarter
in  2002,  $19.6  million  for  each quarter in 2003, and $20.0 million for each
quarter  in  2004. On November 17, 1999, proceeds from the Sterling Senior Notes
(as defined below) were used to repay a portion of the $320.0 million Tranche II
Term  Loan  facility ((pound) 73.0 million, or $118.3 million). On May 15, 2000,
proceeds from the Sterling Series C Senior Notes (as defined below) were used to
repay  an additional portion of the $320.0 million Tranche II Term Loan facility
((pound)  78.8 million, or $118.2 million). After these repayments, the required
quarterly  repayments  of  the  Tranche  II  Term  Loan facility were revised to
(pound)  0.4  million  ($0.6 million) for each quarter in 2001 and 2002, (pound)
0.5  million  ($0.7  million)  for each quarter in 2003, and (pound) 8.5 million
($12.0  million) for each quarter in 2004 (the foregoing U.S. dollar equivalents
are as of February 28, 2002). There are certain mandatory term loan prepayments,
including those based on sale of assets and issuance of debt and equity, in each
case subject to customary baskets, exceptions and thresholds.



     The rate of interest payable, at the Company's option, is a function of the
London  interbank offering rate ("LIBOR") plus a margin, federal funds rate plus
a  margin, or the prime rate plus a margin.  The margin is adjustable based upon
the  Company's  Debt  Ratio  (as defined in the 2000 Credit Agreement) and, with
respect to LIBOR borrowings, ranges between 0.75% and 1.25% for Revolving Credit
loans  and  1.00% and 1.75% for Term Loans.  As of February 28, 2002, the margin
was 1.125% for Revolving Credit loans and 1.625% for Term Loans.  In addition to
interest, the Company pays a facility fee on the Revolving Credit commitments at
0.50%  per  annum as of February 28, 2002.  This fee is based upon the Company's
quarterly Debt Ratio and can range from 0.25% to 0.50%.

     Certain  of  the Company's principal operating subsidiaries have guaranteed
the  Company's  obligations  under  the  2000 Credit Agreement.  The 2000 Credit
Agreement  is secured by (i) first priority pledges of 100% of the capital stock
of  Canandaigua Limited and all of the Company's domestic operating subsidiaries
and (ii) first priority pledges of 65% of the capital stock of Matthew Clark and
certain other foreign subsidiaries.

     The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to customary lending covenants
including those restricting additional liens, incurring additional indebtedness,
the  sale  of assets, the payment of dividends, transactions with affiliates and
the  making  of  certain investments, in each case subject to customary baskets,
exceptions  and  thresholds.   The  primary  financial  covenants   require  the
maintenance  of  a  debt  coverage  ratio, a senior debt coverage ratio, a fixed
charges  ratio  and  an  interest  coverage  ratio.  Among  the most restrictive
covenants contained in the 2000 Credit Agreement is the debt coverage ratio.

     On February 13, 2001, the 2000 Credit Agreement was amended to, among other
things,  permit  the  Company  to  finance  the  acquisition  of the Turner Road
Vintners  Assets  with  revolving loan borrowings, permit the refinancing of the
Original  Notes  (as  defined  below) and Series C Notes (as defined below) with
senior notes, and adjust the senior debt coverage ratio covenant.

     As  of  February 28, 2002, under the 2000 Credit Agreement, the Company had
outstanding  term  loans  of  $281.3 million bearing a weighted average interest
rate  of  3.9%  and  $50.0 million of revolving loans bearing a weighted average
interest  rate  of  3.1%. Amounts available to be drawn down under the Revolving
Credit  Loans,  after  deducting  undrawn letters of credit of $13.2 million and
$12.3  million, were $236.8 million and $287.7 million at February 28, 2002, and
February  28,  2001, respectively. The Company had average outstanding Revolving
Credit  Loans  of  $84.4 million, $47.6 million, and $73.0 million for the years
ended February 28, 2002, February 28, 2001, and February 29, 2000, respectively.
The average interest rate on the Revolving Credit Loans was 4.8%, 7.8%, and 7.4%
for Fiscal 2002, Fiscal 2001, and Fiscal 2000, respectively.

8.   INCOME TAXES:

     The  Company provides for income taxes under the provisions of SFAS No. 109
"Accounting  for  Income  Taxes".  SFAS  No. 109 requires an asset and liability
based approach to accounting for income taxes.

     Deferred  income  taxes reflect the temporary difference between assets and
liabilities  recognized  for financial reporting and such amounts recognized for
tax purposes.

     The income tax provision consisted of the following:



     The foreign provision for income taxes is based on foreign pretax earnings.
Earnings  of  foreign  subsidiaries  would be subject to U.S. income taxation on
repatriation  to the U.S.  The Company's consolidated financial statements fully
provide for any related tax liability on amounts that may be repatriated.

     Deferred  tax  assets and liabilities reflect the future income tax effects
of  temporary  differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying
amounts  of  existing  assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and
are measured using enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income.

     Significant  components of deferred tax (liabilities) assets consist of the
following:





     A  reconciliation  of  the  total  tax  provision to the amount computed by
applying  the  statutory U.S. Federal income tax rate to income before provision
for income taxes is as follows:

10.  PROFIT SHARING AND RETIREMENT SAVINGS PLANS:

     The Company's retirement and profit sharing plan, the Constellation Brands,
Inc.  401(k)  and  Profit  Sharing  Plan  (the "Plan"), covers substantially all
employees, excluding those employees covered by collective bargaining agreements
and  U.K.  employees.  The 401(k) portion of the Plan permits eligible employees
to  defer  a  portion of their compensation (as defined in the Plan) on a pretax
basis.  Participants  may  defer  up  to 12% of their compensation for the year,
subject  to  limitations of the Plan.  The Company makes a matching contribution
of  50% of the first 6% of compensation a participant defers.  The amount of the
Company's  contribution  under the profit sharing portion of the Plan is in such
discretionary  amount  as the Board of Directors may annually determine, subject
to  limitations  of  the  Plan.  Company  contributions were $10.5 million, $8.2
million,  and  $7.3 million, for the years ended February 28, 2002, February 28,
2001, and February 29, 2000, respectively.

     The  Company  has a defined benefit pension plan which covers substantially
all  of its U.K. employees, and its assets are held by a Trustee who administers
funds  separately  from  the  Company's  finances.  In addition, the Company has
defined benefit pension plans covering certain of its Canadian employees.



     Net periodic benefit cost included the following components:




     The  following  table summarizes the funded status of the Company's defined
benefit  pension  plans  and  the related amounts that are primarily included in
other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.



     The following table sets forth the principal assumptions used in developing
the benefit obligation and the net periodic pension expense:





11.  POSTRETIREMENT AND POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS:

     The  Company  currently  sponsors  multiple  non-pension postretirement and
postemployment  benefit  plans  for  certain  of  its  Imported Beer and Spirits
segment employees.

     The status of the plans is as follows:



     The following table sets forth the principal assumptions used in developing
the  benefit  obligation  and  the  net  periodic non-pension postretirement and
postemployment expense:



     At  February  28,  2002,  a 10.0% annual rate of increase and a 7.5% annual
rate  of increase in the per capita cost of covered health benefits were assumed
for  the  first year for the Non-U.S. and U.S. plans, respectively.  These rates
were  assumed  to  decrease  gradually  to 4.7% over seven years and 4.0% over 3
years for the Non-U.S. and U.S. plans, respectively, and to remain at this level
thereafter.  Assumed  healthcare  trend rates could have a significant effect on
the  amount  reported for health care plans.  A 1% change in assumed health care
cost trend rate would have the following effects:

     Rental  expense  was  $24.0  million,  $19.6 million, and $17.4 million for
Fiscal 2002, Fiscal 2001, and Fiscal 2000, respectively.

     PURCHASE COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES -
     The  Company  has  agreements with suppliers to purchase various spirits of
which  certain agreements are denominated in British pound sterling and Canadian
dollars.  The  maximum  future  obligation  under  these  agreements, based upon
exchange  rates  at  February  28,  2002,  aggregate $19.1 million for contracts
expiring through December 2006.

     All  of the Company's imported beer products are marketed and sold pursuant
to  exclusive distribution agreements from the suppliers of these products.  The
Company's agreement to distribute Corona Extra and its other Mexican beer brands
exclusively  throughout  25  primarily  western  U.S. states expires in December
2006,  with  automatic five year renewals thereafter, subject to compliance with
certain performance criteria and other terms under the agreement.  The remaining
agreements  expire   through   June  2008.  Prior  to  their  expiration,  these
agreements  may  be  terminated if the Company fails to meet certain performance
criteria.  At  February  28, 2002, the Company believes it is in compliance with
all  of  its material distribution agreements and, given the Company's long-term
relationships  with  its  suppliers,  the  Company  does  not believe that these
agreements will be terminated.

     In  connection  with  previous acquisitions as well as with the Turner Road
Vintners  Assets  acquisition  and the Corus Assets acquisition, the Company has
assumed  grape  purchase  contracts  with  certain  growers  and  suppliers.  In
addition,  the  Company  has  entered  into  other grape purchase contracts with
various growers and suppliers in the normal course of business.  Under the grape
purchase  contracts,  the  Company is committed to purchase all grape production
yielded   from  a   specified  number  of acres for a period of time from one to
sixteen years.  The actual tonnage and price of grapes that must be purchased by
the Company will vary each year depending on certain factors, including weather,
time  of  harvest,  overall market conditions and the agricultural practices and
location  of  the  growers  and  suppliers under contract. The Company purchased
$177.0  million  of  grapes  under these contracts during Fiscal 2002.  Based on
current production yields and published grape prices, the Company estimates that
the  aggregate  purchases  under  these contracts over the remaining term of the
contracts will be $785.3 million.

     In  connection  with  the  Turner  Road Vintners Assets acquisition and the
Corus  Assets  acquisition,  the Company established a reserve for the estimated
loss  on  firm  purchase commitments assumed at the time of acquisition of $52.6
million.

     The Company's aggregate obligations under bulk wine purchase contracts will
be  $25.0  million over the remaining term of the contracts which expire through
fiscal 2005.



     EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS -
     The Company has employment contracts with certain of its executive officers
and  certain  other management personnel with automatic one year renewals unless
terminated  by  either  party. These agreements provide for minimum salaries, as
adjusted  for  annual  increases,  and  may include incentive bonuses based upon
attainment  of specified management goals. In addition, these agreements provide
for  severance payments in the event of specified termination of employment. The
aggregate  commitment for future compensation and severance, excluding incentive
bonuses,  was $4.8 million as of February 28, 2002, of which none was accrued as
of February 28, 2002.

     EMPLOYEES COVERED BY COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS -
     Approximately  29%  of  the  Company's  full-time  employees are covered by
collective  bargaining  agreements  at  February  28,  2002. Agreements expiring
within one year cover approximately 10% of the Company's full-time employees.

     LEGAL MATTERS -
     The  Company  is  subject  to  litigation from time to time in the ordinary
course  of  business.  Although the amount of any liability with respect to such
litigation  cannot  be  determined,  in the opinion of management such liability
will  not  have  a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition,
results of operations or cash flows.

13.  STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY:

     COMMON STOCK -
     The Company has two classes of common stock: Class A Common Stock and Class
B  Convertible  Common  Stock.  Class  B  Convertible  Common  Stock  shares are
convertible  into  shares  of  Class A Common Stock on a one-to-one basis at any
time  at  the option of the holder.  Holders of Class B Convertible Common Stock
are  entitled  to  ten  votes  per  share.  Holders  of Class A Common Stock are
entitled to one vote per share and a cash dividend premium.  If the Company pays
a  cash  dividend  on  Class  B  Convertible Common Stock, each share of Class A
Common Stock will receive an amount at least ten percent greater than the amount
of  the  cash  dividend  per share paid on Class B Convertible Common Stock.  In
addition,  the  Board  of  Directors  may  declare and pay a dividend on Class A
Common Stock without paying any dividend on Class B Convertible Common Stock.

     At  February 28, 2002, there were 76,413,648 shares of Class A Common Stock
and  12,105,490  shares  of Class B Convertible Common Stock outstanding, net of
treasury stock.

     STOCK REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION -
     In June 1998, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of
up  to $100.0 million of its Class A Common Stock and Class B Convertible Common
Stock.  The  Company  may  finance  such  purchases,  which will become treasury
shares,  through  cash  generated  from  operations or through the senior credit
facility.  No shares were repurchased during Fiscal 2002, Fiscal 2001 and Fiscal
2000.

     EQUITY OFFERINGS -
     During  March  2001,  the  Company completed a public offering of 8,740,000
shares  of  its  Class  A  Common  Stock, which was held as treasury stock. This
resulted  in net proceeds to the Company, after deducting underwriting discounts
and  expenses,  of $139.4 million. The net proceeds were used to repay revolving
loan borrowings under the senior credit facility of which a portion was incurred
to partially finance the acquisition of the Turner Road Vintners Assets.



     During  October 2001, the Company sold 645,000 shares of its Class A Common
Stock, which was held as treasury stock, in connection with a public offering of
Class  A  Common  Stock  by stockholders of the Company. The net proceeds to the
Company,  after  deducting underwriting discounts, of $12.1 million were used to
repay borrowings under the senior credit facility.

     LONG-TERM STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN -
     Under  the  Company's  Long-Term  Stock  Incentive Plan, nonqualified stock
options,  stock  appreciation  rights,  restricted  stock  and other stock-based
awards  may  be  granted to employees, officers and directors of the Company. At
the Company's Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on July 20, 1999, stockholders
approved  the  amendment  to  the  Company's  Long-Term  Stock Incentive Plan to
increase  the  aggregate  number of shares of the Class A Common Stock available
for  awards  under  the  plan  from  16,000,000 shares to 28,000,000 shares. The
exercise  price,  vesting  period and term of nonqualified stock options granted
are  established  by  the  committee  administering  the plan (the "Committee").
Grants  of  stock  appreciation  rights,  restricted stock and other stock-based
awards may contain such vesting, terms, conditions and other requirements as the
Committee  may  establish.   During  Fiscal  2002  and  Fiscal  2001,  no  stock
appreciation  rights were granted. No restricted stock was granted during Fiscal
2002.  During Fiscal 2001, 15,100 shares of restricted Class A Common Stock were
granted at a weighted average grant date fair value of $13.31 per share.

     INCENTIVE STOCK OPTION PLAN -
     Under  the  Company's  Incentive Stock Option Plan, incentive stock options
may be granted to employees, including officers, of the Company.  Grants, in the
aggregate,  may  not  exceed  4,000,000  shares  of the Company's Class A Common
Stock.  The  exercise  price  of any incentive stock option may not be less than
the  fair  market  value  of  the  Company's Class A Common Stock on the date of
grant.  The  vesting  period  and  term  of  incentive stock options granted are
established  by  the  Committee.  The maximum term of incentive stock options is
ten years.

     A  summary  of  stock  option  activity under the Company's long-term stock
incentive plan and the incentive stock option plan is as follows:





     The  following table summarizes information about stock options outstanding
at February 28, 2002:

                   ===========                          ============

     The  weighted  average  fair  value  of options granted during Fiscal 2002,
Fiscal  2001,  and  Fiscal  2000 was $8.99, $5.45, and $6.57, respectively.  The
fair  value of options is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing  model with the following weighted average assumptions: risk-free
interest rate of 4.7% for Fiscal 2002, 6.2% for Fiscal 2001, and 5.7% for Fiscal
2000;  volatility of 41.0% for Fiscal 2002, 38.8% for Fiscal 2001, and 40.0% for
Fiscal  2000;  and  expected option life of 6.0 years for Fiscal 2002, 4.7 years
for  Fiscal  2001, and 7.0 years for Fiscal 2000.  The dividend yield was 0% for
Fiscal  2002,  Fiscal 2001, and Fiscal 2000.  Forfeitures are recognized as they
occur.

     EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLANS -
     The Company has a stock purchase plan under which 4,500,000 shares of Class
A  Common  Stock  may be issued. Under the terms of the plan, eligible employees
may  purchase  shares  of  the  Company's  Class  A Common Stock through payroll
deductions.  The  purchase price is the lower of 85% of the fair market value of
the  stock  on the first or last day of the purchase period. During Fiscal 2002,
Fiscal  2001,  and  Fiscal  2000,  employees  purchased  120,674 shares, 147,776
shares, and 124,248 shares, respectively.

     The  weighted  average  fair value of purchase rights granted during Fiscal
2002,  Fiscal  2001,  and Fiscal 2000 was $5.59, $3.78, and $3.04, respectively.
The  fair  value  of purchase rights is estimated on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes  option-pricing   model  with   the  following  weighted   average
assumptions:  risk-free  interest  rate of 2.6% for Fiscal 2002, 5.7% for Fiscal
2001,  and  5.4% for Fiscal 2000; volatility of 33.2% for Fiscal 2002, 36.8% for
Fiscal  2001,  and  33.6%  for  Fiscal 2000; expected purchase right life of 0.5
years  for Fiscal 2002, Fiscal 2001, and Fiscal 2000.  The dividend yield was 0%
for Fiscal 2002, Fiscal 2001, and Fiscal 2000.

     The  Company  has a stock purchase plan under which 2,000,000 shares of the
Company's Class A Common Stock may be issued to eligible employees and directors
of  the  Company's  United  Kingdom  subsidiaries.  Under the terms of the plan,
participants  may  purchase shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock through
payroll  deductions.  The  purchase price may be no less than 80% of the closing
price  of  the  stock  on  the  day the purchase price is fixed by the committee
administering the plan.  As of February 28, 2002, no shares have been issued.

     PRO FORMA DISCLOSURE -
     The Company applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting
for  Stock  Issued  to Employees," and related interpretations in accounting for
its  plans.  The  Company adopted the disclosure-only provisions of Statement of
Financial   Accounting   Standards   No.  123,   "Accounting   for   Stock-Based
Compensation,"  ("SFAS  No.  123").  Accordingly,  no  incremental  compensation
expense  has  been  recognized  for  its stock-based compensation plans. Had the
Company  recognized  the compensation cost based upon the fair value at the date
of  grant  for awards under its plans consistent with the



methodology prescribed by SFAS No. 123, net income and earnings per common share
would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts as follows:



     The  pro forma effect on net income may not be representative of that to be
expected in future years.

14.  EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE:

     The following table presents earnings per common share as follows:



     Stock  options  to purchase 2.2 million, 1.1 million and 0.3 million shares
of  Class A Common Stock at a weighted average price per share of $20.70, $13.93
and  $14.82  were outstanding during the years ended February 28, 2002, February
28,  2001,  and  February  29,  2000, respectively, but were not included in the
computation  of the diluted earnings per common share because the stock options'
exercise  price  was greater than the average market price of the Class A Common
Stock for the respective periods.



15.  ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS:

     Accumulated other comprehensive loss includes the following components:



16.  RELATED PARTIES:

     Agustin  Francisco  Huneeus,  the  executive  in  charge  of  the Fine Wine
segment,  along  with  other  members  of  his immediate family, through various
family  owned entities (the "Huneeus Interests") engaged in certain transactions
with  the  Fine  Wine segment during each of the three years in the period ended
February  28,  2002.  The  Huneeus Interests engage the Fine Wine segment as the
exclusive  distributor  of  its Quintessa wines under a long-term contract; sell
grapes  to  the  Fine  Wine  segment  pursuant  to existing long-term contracts;
participate  as  partners  with  the  Fine  Wine  segment  in  the ownership and
operation  of  a  winery and vineyards in Chile; and render brand management and
other  consulting and advisory services in the United States and internationally
to  the  Fine  Wine  segment  and  the  Company.  Total  payments to the Huneeus
Interests  pursuant to these transactions and arrangements totaled $4.8 million,
$5.0  million,  and $3.2 million for the years ended February 28, 2002, February
28,  2001,  and  February  29,  2000,  respectively.  In addition, the Fine Wine
segment  performs  certain  wine  processing services for the Huneeus Interests.
Total  fees  received  from  the  Huneeus Interests to the Fine Wine segment for
these  services  totaled  $0.4  million,  $0.6 million, and $0.6 million for the
years  ended  February  28,  2002,  February  28,  2001,  and February 29, 2000,
respectively.  As of February 28, 2002 and 2001, the net amounts due to/from the
Huneeus Interests under these agreements are insignificant.

17.  SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS AND CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK:

     Gross sales to the five largest customers of the Company represented 19.1%,
17.6%,  and  17.1%  of  the  Company's  gross  sales  for the fiscal years ended
February  28,  2002, February 28, 2001, and February 29, 2000, respectively.  No
single  customer  was responsible for greater than 10% of gross sales during the
fiscal  years ended February 28, 2002, February 28, 2001, and February 29, 2000.
Accounts  receivable  from  the  Company's  largest  customer, Southern Wine and
Spirits,  represented  10.0%,  9.8%,  and  8.6%  of the Company's total accounts
receivable  as  of  February 28, 2002, February 28, 2001, and February 29, 2000,
respectively.  Gross  sales to the Company's five largest customers are expected
to  continue  to represent a significant portion of the Company's revenues.  The
Company's  arrangements  with  certain  of  its  customers  may,  generally,  be
terminated  by  either  party  with  prior notice.  The Company performs ongoing
credit  evaluations  of its customers' financial position, and management of the
Company  is  of  the opinion that any risk of significant loss is reduced due to
the diversity of customers and geographic sales area.

18.  CONDENSED CONSOLIDATING FINANCIAL INFORMATION:

     The  following  information  sets forth the condensed consolidating balance
sheets  of  the  Company as of February 28, 2002, and February 28, 2001, and the
condensed  consolidating statements of operations and cash flows for each of the
three  years  in the period ended February 28, 2002, for the Company, the parent
company,  the combined subsidiaries of the Company which guarantee the Company's
senior  notes  and  senior  subordinated notes ("Subsidiary Guarantors") and the
combined



subsidiaries  of  the  Company  which  are  not Subsidiary Guarantors, primarily
Matthew  Clark,  which  is  included  in  the  U.K. Brands and Wholesale segment
("Subsidiary Nonguarantors"). The Subsidiary Guarantors are wholly owned and the
guarantees are full, unconditional, joint and several obligations of each of the
Subsidiary   Guarantors.  Separate  financial  statements  for  the   Subsidiary
Guarantors  of  the Company are not presented because the Company has determined
that  such  financial  statements  would  not  be  material  to  investors.  The
Subsidiary  Guarantors  comprise  all of the direct and indirect subsidiaries of
the  Company,  other  than Matthew Clark, the Company's Canadian subsidiary, and
certain  other  subsidiaries  which  individually,  and  in  the  aggregate, are
inconsequential.  The  accounting  policies  of the subsidiaries are the same as
those  described  in  Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. There
are  no  restrictions  on  the  ability of the Subsidiary Guarantors to transfer
funds to the Company in the form of cash dividends, loans or advances.



19.  BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION:

     The  Company  reports  its  operating results in five segments: Popular and
Premium  Wine (branded popular and premium wine and brandy, and other, primarily
grape  juice  concentrate  and  bulk wine); Imported Beer and Spirits (primarily
imported  beer  and distilled spirits); U.K. Brands and Wholesale (branded wine,
cider  and bottled water, and wholesale wine, cider, distilled spirits, beer and
soft drinks); Fine Wine (primarily branded super-premium and ultra-premium wine)
and  Corporate Operations and Other (primarily corporate related items). Segment
selection  was  based  upon  internal organizational structure, the way in which
these  operations  are managed and their performance evaluated by management and
the  Company's  Board  of  Directors,  the  availability  of  separate financial
results, and materiality considerations. The accounting policies of the segments
are the same as those described in



Note 1 - Summary  of  Significant  Accounting Policies.  The  Company  evaluates
performance based on operating profits of the respective business units.

     Segment information is as follows:



     The  Company's  areas  of  operations are principally in the United States.
Operations  outside  the  United States consist of the U.K. Brands and Wholesale
segment's operations, which are primarily in the United Kingdom. No other single
foreign  country   or  geographic  area  is  significant  to  the   consolidated
operations.

20.  NONRECURRING CHARGES:

     During  Fiscal  2000,  the  Company  incurred  nonrecurring charges of $5.5
million  related  to  the closure of a cider production facility within the U.K.
Brands  and Wholesale operating segment in the United Kingdom ($2.9 million) and
to  a  management  reorganization  within the Popular and Premium Wine operating
segment ($2.6 million).

21.  ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS:

     During  2000  and  2001,  the Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") addressed
various  issues  related  to  the  income  statement  classification  of certain
promotional  payments,  including  EITF  Issue  No.  00-14  ("EITF  No. 00-14"),
"Accounting  for  Certain  Sales  Incentives,"  EITF  Issue No. 00-22 ("EITF No.
00-22"),  "Accounting  for 'Points' and Certain Other Time-Based or Volume-Based
Sales Incentive Offers, and Offers for Free Products or Services to Be Delivered
in the Future," and EITF Issue No. 00-25



("EITF  No.  00-25"), "Vendor Income Statement Characterization of Consideration
Paid  to  a  Reseller  of  the  Vendor's  Products."  In November 2001, the EITF
codified  EITF  No.  00-14,  EITF  No. 00-22, and EITF No. 00-25 as part of EITF
Issue  No.  01-09  ("EITF  No. 01-09"), "Accounting for Consideration Given by a
Vendor  to a Customer (Including a Reseller of the Vendor's Products)." EITF No.
01-09 addresses the recognition, measurement and income statement classification
of  consideration  given by a vendor to a customer (including both a reseller of
the  vendor's products and an entity that purchases the vendor's products from a
reseller).  EITF   No.  01-09,  among   other  things,  requires   that  certain
consideration given by a vendor to a customer be characterized as a reduction of
revenue  when recognized in the vendor's income statement. The Company currently
reports  such costs referred to in EITF No. 00-14 and EITF No. 00-25 as selling,
general  and  administrative expenses. The Company is required to adopt EITF No.
01-09 in its financial statements beginning March 1, 2002. Upon adoption of EITF
No.  01-09,  financial  statements  for  prior periods presented for comparative
purposes will be reclassified to comply with the requirements of EITF No. 01-09.
For  the  fiscal  years ended February 28, 2002, February 28, 2001, and February
29,  2000,  net  sales  will  be  reduced by $222.4 million, $176.2 million, and
$182.5  million,  respectively,  cost  of  product  sold  will increase by $10.1
million,  $7.8 million, and $8.8 million, respectively, and selling, general and
administrative  expenses  will  decrease  by $232.5 million, $184.0 million, and
$191.3  million,  respectively.  This reclassification will not effect operating
income or net income.

     In  July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial   Accounting   Standards   No.  141   ("SFAS   No.  141"),   "Business
Combinations."  SFAS  No.  141  addresses financial accounting and reporting for
business  combinations  requiring  all business combinations to be accounted for
using  one  method,  the  purchase  method. In addition, SFAS No. 141 supersedes
Accounting  Principles  Board  Opinion No. 16, "Business Combinations." SFAS No.
141  is effective immediately for all business combinations initiated after June
30, 2001, as well as for all business combinations accounted for by the purchase
method  for which the date of acquisition is July 1, 2001, or later. The Company
is  required  to  adopt SFAS No. 141 for all business combinations for which the
acquisition  date  was  before July 1, 2001, for fiscal years beginning March 1,
2002.  The  adoption  of the applicable provisions of SFAS No. 141 has not had a
material impact on the Company's financial statements. The Company believes that
the  adoption  of  the  remaining  provisions  of  SFAS  No. 141 will not have a
material  impact  on  its  financial  statements.  On March 1, 2002, the Company
reclassified  $59.9 million of previously identified separable intangible assets
into goodwill in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 141.

     In  July  2001,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  also  issued
Statement  of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 ("SFAS No. 142"), "Goodwill
and  Other  Intangible  Assets." SFAS No. 142 addresses financial accounting and
reporting  for  acquired  goodwill  and  other  intangible assets and supersedes
Accounting  Principles Board Opinion No. 17, "Intangible Assets." Under SFAS No.
142, goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized but
are  reviewed at least annually for impairment. Separable intangible assets that
are  not  deemed  to  have an indefinite life will continue to be amortized over
their  useful lives. The Company is required to apply the provisions of SFAS No.
142  for  all goodwill and intangible assets acquired prior to July 1, 2001, for
fiscal  years  beginning  March  1,  2002.  For  goodwill  and intangible assets
acquired  after  June  30,  2001,  these  assets  are subject immediately to the
nonamortization  and  amortization  provisions  of  SFAS  No. 142. The Company's
assessment  of  the financial impact of SFAS No. 142 on its financial statements
is  that  $27.3  million  of amortization expense of existing goodwill and other
intangible  assets  for  the  fiscal  year ending February 28, 2002, will not be
incurred  in  subsequent  fiscal  years.   The  required  transition  impairment
evaluations are not expected to result in impairment charges.



     In  August  2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.  143 ("SFAS No. 143"), "Accounting for
Asset  Retirement  Obligations." SFAS No. 143 addresses financial accounting and
reporting  for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived
assets  and  the  associated  retirement costs. The Company is required to adopt
SFAS  No. 143 for fiscal years beginning March 1, 2003. The Company is currently
assessing the financial impact of SFAS No. 143 on its financial statements.

     In  October 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of  Financial Accounting Standards No. 144 ("SFAS No. 144"), "Accounting for the
Impairment  or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets."  SFAS No. 144 addresses financial
accounting  and  reporting  for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets.
SFAS  No.  144  supersedes  Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121,
"Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to
Be  Disposed  Of,"  and  the  accounting  and reporting provisions of Accounting
Principles  Board Opinion No. 30, "Reporting the Results of Operations-Reporting
the  Effects  of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual
and  Infrequently  Occurring  Events  and  Transactions,"  for the disposal of a
segment  of  a business (as previously defined in that Opinion).  The Company is
required  to  adopt  SFAS No. 144 for fiscal years beginning March 1, 2002.  The
Company  believes  the financial impact of  SFAS No. 144 will not be material on
its financial statements.

     In April 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.  145 ("SFAS No. 145"), "Rescission of FASB
Statements  No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical
Corrections."  SFAS No. 145 rescinds Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No.  4 ("SFAS No. 4"), "Reporting Gains and Losses from Extinguishment of Debt,"
Statement  of  Financial Accounting Standards No. 44, "Accounting for Intangible
Assets  of  Motor Carriers," and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
64,  "Extinguishments  of  Debt  Made  to Satisfy Sinking-Fund Requirements." In
addition,  SFAS  No.  145 amends Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
13,  "Accounting  for  Leases,"  to  eliminate an inconsistency between required
accounting  for  sale-leaseback  transactions  and  the  required accounting for
certain  lease  modifications  that  have  economic  effects that are similar to
sale-leaseback  transactions.  Lastly,  SFAS  No. 145 also amends other existing
authoritative  pronouncements  to  make  various  technical corrections, clarify
meanings,  or describe their applicability under changed conditions. The Company
is  required to adopt the provisions related to the rescission of SFAS No. 4 for
fiscal  years  beginning March 1, 2003. All other provisions of SFAS No. 145 are
effective  for fiscal years beginning March 1, 2002. The Company does not expect
the  adoption  of  SFAS  No.  145  to  have  a  material impact on its financial
statements.  However,  it  will  result  in a reclassification of the previously
reported  extraordinary  item,  net  of  income  taxes, to increase nonoperating
expense  ($2.6  million)  and  to  decrease the provision for income taxes ($1.0
million).



22.  SELECTED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL INFORMATION (UNAUDITED):

presented and for the full year.
