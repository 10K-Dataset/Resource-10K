This
      Annual Report on Form 10-K contains “forward-looking statements” within the
      meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the
      Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

These
      forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties,
      many of which are beyond the Company’s control, that could cause actual results
      to differ materially from those set forth in, or implied by, such
      forward-looking statements. All statements other than statements of historical
      facts included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including without limitation
      the statements under Item 1 “Business” and Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and
      Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” regarding (i) the
      Company’s business strategy, future financial position, prospects, plans and
      objectives of management, (ii) the expected impact upon the Company’s net sales
      and diluted earnings per share resulting from the decision to reduce distributor
      wine inventory levels in the U.S., (iii) the Company’s expected restructuring
      and related charges, accelerated depreciation costs, acquisition-related
      integration costs, and other related charges, and (iv) information concerning
      expected actions of third parties are forward-looking statements. When used
      in
      this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the words “anticipate,” “intend,” “expect,” and
      similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements,
      although not all forward-looking statements contain such identifying words.
      All
      forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Annual Report
      on
      Form 10-K. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any
      forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future
      events or otherwise. Although the Company believes that the expectations
      reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, it can give no
      assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. In addition to the
      risks and uncertainties of ordinary business operations, the forward-looking
      statements of the Company contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are
      also
      subject to the risk and uncertainty that (i) the impact upon net sales and
      diluted earnings per share resulting from the decision to reduce distributor
      wine inventory levels will vary from current expectations due to the actual
      levels of distributor wine inventory reductions and (ii) the Company’s
      restructuring and related charges, accelerated depreciation costs,
      acquisition-related integration costs, and other related charges may exceed
      current expectations due to, among other reasons, variations in anticipated
      headcount reductions, contract terminations or greater than anticipated
      implementation costs. Additional important factors that could cause actual
      results to differ materially from those set forth in, or implied, by the
      Company’s forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form
      10-K are those described in Item 1A “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this report
      and in other Company filings with the Securities and Exchange
      Commission.

.
      The
      Company has not independently verified the data from the industry and government
      publications. Unless otherwise noted, all references to market positions are
      based on unit volume.

The
      Company is a Delaware corporation incorporated on December 4, 1972, as the
      successor to a business founded in 1945. The Company has approximately
      9,20


employees located throughout the world and the corporate headquarters are
      located in Fairport, New York

.

The
      Company is a leading international producer and marketer of beverage alcohol
      with a broad portfolio of brands across the wine, spirits and imported beer
      categories. The Company has the largest wine business in the world and has
      a
      leading market position in each of its core markets, which include the United
      States (“U.S.”), Canada, United Kingdom (“U.K.”), Australia and New
      Zealand.

The
        Company conducts its business through entities it wholly owns as well as
        through
        a variety of joint ventures with various other entities, both within and
        outside
        the U.S. On January 2, 2007, the Company participated in establishing and
        commencing operations of a joint venture with Grupo Modelo, S.A. de C.V.
        (“Modelo”) pursuant to which Modelo’s Mexican beer portfolio (the “Modelo
        Brands”) are imported, marketed and sold by the joint venture in the U.S., the
        District of Columbia and Guam, along with certain other imported beer brands
        in
        their respective territories. This imported beers joint venture is referred
        to
        hereinafter as “Crown Imports”. On April 17, 2007, the Company participated in
        establishing and commencing operations of a joint venture with Punch Taverns
        plc
        (“Punch”) in which Punch acquired a 50% interest in the Company’s wholesale
        business in the U.K. This U.K. wholesale joint venture is referred to
        hereinafter as “Matthew Clark”.

In
        the
        U.S., the Company is the largest multi-category (wine, spirits and imported
        beer) supplier of beverage alcohol. In addition to having a leading position
        in
        wine, the Company is also a leading producer and marketer of distilled spirits
        in the U.S. The Company is the largest marketer of imported beer in the U.S.
        through its January 2, 2007, investment in Crown Imports (see “Recent
        Acquisitions and Equity Method Investments” below and “Investment in Crown
        Imports” under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
        Results of Operations” in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). Prior to
        January 2, 2007, the Company was the largest marketer of imported beer in
        primarily western U.S. states, where it had exclusive rights to import, market
        and sell the Mexican brands in its portfolio.

With
      its
      broad product portfolio, the Company believes it is distinctly positioned to
      satisfy an array of consumer preferences across all beverage alcohol categories
      and price points. Many of the Company’s products are recognized leaders in their
      respective categories and geographic markets. The Company’s strong market
      positions make the Company a supplier of choice to its customers, who include
      wholesale distributors, retailers, on-premise locations and government alcohol
      beverage control agencies.


Prior
        to
        April 17, 2007, the Company owned and operated the leading independent
        (non-brewery-owned) drinks wholesaler to the on-premise trade in the U.K.,
        providing a full range of beverage alcohol and soft drinks. On April 17,
        2007,
        as discussed above, the Company participated in establishing and commencing
        operations of the Matthew Clark joint venture (see “Recent Acquisitions and
        Equity Method Investments” below and “Recent Developments - Investment in
        Matthew Clark” under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
        Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form
        10-K). The Company intends to continue to leverage Matthew Clark as a strategic
        route-to-market for its branded product portfolio.

The
      Company's net sales by product category are summarized as
      follows:

The
      Company’s geographic markets include North America (primarily the U.S. and
      Canada), Europe (primarily the U.K.) and Australia/New Zealand (primarily
      Australia and New Zealand). The Company’s wholesale and other category net sales
      are primarily related to the Company’s then wholly-owned wholesale business in
      the U.K. Net sales for the imported beers category occurred in the U.S. while
      net sales for spirits occurred in the North America market (primarily the U.S.).
      Branded wine net sales by geographic area (based on the location of the selling
      company) are summarized as follows:

There
      are
      certain key trends within the beverage alcohol industry, which
      include:

·

Consolidation
                of suppliers, wholesalers and
                retailers;

·

An
                increase in global wine consumption;
                and

·

Consumers
                “trading up” to premium products within certain categories. On a global
                basis, within the wine category, premium wines are growing faster
                than
                value-priced wines. In the U.S., within the beer category, imported
                beers
                are growing faster than domestic beers, and premium spirits are growing
                faster than value-priced spirits.


To
      capitalize on these trends, the Company has employed a strategy of growing
      through a combination of internal growth, acquisitions and investments in joint
      ventures to become more competitive, with a focus on the faster growing
      segments of the beverage alcohol industry and developing strong market positions
      in the wine, spirits and imported beers categories. Key elements of the
      Company’s strategy include:

·

Leveraging
                the Company’s existing portfolio of leading
                brands;

·

Developing
                new products, new packaging and line
                extensions;

·

Diversifying
                the Company’s product portfolio with an emphasis on premium spirits and
                premium, super-premium and fine
                wines;

·

Diversifying
                geographic markets with a focus on expansion in Continental Europe
                and
                Japan;

·

Strengthening
                its relationships with wholesalers

and
                retailers;

·

Expanding
                its distribution and enhancing its production
                capabilities;

·

Realizing
                operating synergies; and

·

Acquiring
                additional management, operational, marketing, and product development
                expertise.

Recent
      Acquisitions and Equity Method Investments

In
        April
        2007, the Company along with Punch, the leading pub company in the U.K.,
        commenced operations of Matthew Clark, a joint venture which owns and operates
        the U.K. wholesale business formerly owned entirely by the Company. The Company
        and Punch, directly or indirectly, each have a 50% voting and economic interest
        in Matthew Clark. On April 17, 2007, the Company discontinued consolidation
        of the U.K. wholesale business and began accounting for its investment in
        Matthew Clark under the equity method.

In
        March
        2007, the Company acquired the SVEDKA Vodka brand (“Svedka”) and related
        business. Svedka is produced in Sweden and sold over one million cases in
        calendar 2006. It is the fifth largest imported vodka and the fastest
        growing major imported premium vodka in the U.S.

This
        acquisition increases the Company’s mix of premium spirits and provides a
        selling and marketing platform for further expansion of the Company’s premium
        spirits portfolio.

In
        January 2007, the Company completed the formation of Crown Imports. The Company
        and Modelo indirectly each have equal interest in Crown Imports, which has
        the
        exclusive right to import, market and sell the Modelo Brands, which include
        Corona Extra, Corona Light, Coronita, Modelo Especial, Pacifico, and Negra
        Modelo, in all 50 states of the U.S., the District of Columbia and Guam.
        In
        addition, the owners of the Tsingtao and St. Pauli Girl brands transferred
        exclusive importing, marketing and selling rights with respect to these brands
        in the U.S. to Crown Imports. Prior to January 2007, the Company had the
        exclusive right to import, market and sell Modelo’s Mexican beer portfolio in 25
        primarily western U.S. states and was the exclusive U.S. national importer,
        marketer and seller of the Tsingtao and St. Pauli Girl brands. After completing
        the formation of Crown Imports, the Company discontinued consolidation of
        the
        imported beer business and accounts for its investment in Crown Imports under
        the equity method.


In
      June
      2006, the Company acquired Vincor International Inc. (“Vincor”), Canada’s
      premier wine company. Vincor is Canada’s largest producer and marketer of wines.
      At the time of the acquisition, Vincor was the world’s eighth largest producer
      and distributor of wine and related products by revenue and was also one of
      the
      largest wine importers, marketers and distributors in the U.K. Through this
      transaction, the Company acquired various additional winery and vineyard
      interests used in the production of premium, super-premium and fine wines from
      Canada, California, Washington State, Western Australia and New Zealand. In
      addition, as a result of the acquisition, the Company sources, markets and
      sells
      premium wines from South Africa. Well-known premium brands acquired in the
      Vincor acquisition include Inniskillin, Jackson-Triggs, Sawmill Creek, Sumac
      Ridge, R.H. Phillips, Toasted Head, Hogue, Kim Crawford and Kumala.

In
      December 2004, the Company acquired The Robert Mondavi Corporation (“Robert
      Mondavi”), a leading premium wine producer based in Napa, California.

Through
      this transaction, the Company acquired various additional winery and vineyard
      interests, and, additionally produces, markets and sells premium, super-premium
      and fine California wines

under
      the
      Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi, Robert Mondavi Private Selection and Robert
      Mondavi Winery brand names. Woodbridge and Robert Mondavi Private Selection
      are
      the leading domestic premium and super-premium wine brands, respectively, in
      the
      U.S.

As a
      result of the Robert Mondavi acquisition, the Company acquired an ownership
      interest in Opus One, a joint venture owned equally by Robert Mondavi and Baron
      Philippe de Rothschild, S.A. During September 2005, the Company’s president and
      Baroness Philippine de Rothschild announced an agreement to maintain equal
      ownership of Opus One. Opus One produces fine wines at its Napa Valley winery.
      The Company accounts for its investment in Opus One under the equity
      method.

In
      December 2004, the Company purchased a 40% interest in Ruffino S.r.l.
      (“Ruffino”), the well-known Italian fine wine company, and in February 2005, the
      Constellation Wines segment began distributing Ruffino’s products in the U.S.
      Also in December 2004, the Company became a 50% owner in a joint venture with
      jstar Brands

(“Planet
      10 Spirits”)

. The objective of Planet 10 Spirits is to create and market
      premium spirit brands in the U.S. and key export markets. The first product
      from
      this joint venture is Effen Vodka, a luxury brand imported from
      Holland.

      more
      information about these transactions,

“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
      Operations” in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Business
      Segments

On
        January 2, 2007, as a result of the Company’s investment in Crown Imports, the
        Company changed its internal management financial reporting to consist of
        three
        business divisions, Constellation Wines, Constellation Spirits and Crown
        Imports. Prior to the investment in the joint venture, the Company’s internal
        management financial reporting included the Constellation Beers business
        division. Consequently, as of February 28, 2007, the Company reports its
        operating results in five segments: Constellation Wines (branded wine, and
        U.K.
        wholesale and other), Constellation Spirits (distilled spirits), Constellation
        Beers (imported beer), Crown Imports (imported beer) and Corporate Operations
        and Other. Segment results for Constellation Beers are for the period prior
        to
        January 2, 2007, and segment results for Crown Imports are for the period
        on and
        after January 2, 2007. The new business segments, described more fully below,
        reflect how the Company’s operations are managed, how operating performance
        within the Company is evaluated by senior management and the structure of
        its
        internal financial reporting.


Information
      regarding net sales, operating income and total assets of each of the Company’s
      business segments and information regarding geographic areas is set forth in
      Note 22 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements located in Item 8 of
      this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Constellation
      Beers

Prior
      to
      January 2, 2007, Constellation Beers was the largest marketer of imported beer
      in 25 primarily western U.S. states, where it had exclusive rights to 
import, market and sell the Mexican brands in its portfolio, Corona Extra,
      Corona Light, Coronita, Modelo Especial, Pacifico, and Negra Modelo.
      Constellation Beers also had exclusive rights to the entire U.S.
      to import, market and sell the St. Pauli Girl brand, the number two
      selling German Beer, and the Tsingtao brand, the number one selling Chinese
      Beer.

Crown
      Imports

Effective
        January 2, 2007, the Constellation Beers operating segment was replaced with
        the
        Crown Imports operating segment as the Company completed the formation of
        the
        Crown Imports joint venture with Modelo. The Company and Modelo indirectly
        each
        have equal interest in Crown Imports, which has the exclusive right to import,
        market and sell Corona Extra, Corona Light, Coronita, Modelo Especial, Pacifico,
        Negra Modelo, St. Pauli Girl and Tsingtao brands in all 50 states of the
        U.S.
        The Company accounts for its investment in Crown Imports under the equity
        method. The segment has six of the top-selling 25 imported beer brands in
        the
        U.S. Corona Extra is the best selling imported beer in the U.S. and the sixth
        best selling beer overall in the U.S.

Constellation
      Spirits

Constellation
        Spirits produces, bottles, imports and markets a diversified line of distilled
        spirits. Constellation Spirits is a leading producer and marketer of distilled
        spirits in the U.S. The majority of the segment’s distilled spirits unit volume
        consists of products marketed in the value and mid-premium priced category.
        Principal distilled spirits brands include Black Velvet, Chi-Chi’s prepared
        cocktails, Barton, Sköl, Fleischmann’s, Canadian LTD, Montezuma, Ten High, Mr.
        Boston and Inver House.

The
        segment is continuing efforts to increase its premium spirits offerings,
        with
        brands that include Black Velvet Reserve, the 99 Schnapps family, Effen Vodka,
        1792 Ridgemont Reserve, Meukow Cognac, Cocktails by Jenn, Monte Alban,
        Danfield’s, di Amore, Caravella, Balblair, Old Pulteney and
        Speyburn.

The
      acquisition of Svedka and related business in March 2007 increases the
      Company’s mix of premium spirits and provides a selling and marketing platform
      for further expansion of the premium spirits portfolio.

Corporate
      Operations and Other

The
      Corporate Operations and Other segment includes traditional corporate-related
      items

including
      executive management, corporate development, corporate finance, human resources,
      internal audit, investor relations, legal, public relations, global information
      technology and global strategic sourcing.

Marketing
      and Distribution

The
        Company’s segments employ full-time, in-house marketing, sales and customer
        service organizations to maintain a high degree of focus on their respective
        product categories. The organizations use a range of marketing strategies
        and
        tactics to build brand equity and increase sales, including market research,
        consumer and trade advertising, price promotions, point-of-sale materials,
        event
        sponsorship,

on-premise
        promotions and public relations. Where opportunities exist, particularly
        with
        national accounts, the Company leverages its sales and marketing skills across
        the organization and categories.


In
      North
      America, the Company’s products are primarily distributed by a broad base of

wholesale
      distributors as well as state and provincial alcoholic beverage control
      agencies. As is the case with all other beverage alcohol companies, products
      sold through state or provincial alcoholic beverage control agencies are subject
      to obtaining and maintaining listings to sell the Company’s products in that
      agency’s state or province. State and provincial governments can affect prices
      paid by consumers of the Company’s products. This is possible either through the
      imposition of taxes or, in states and provinces in which the government acts
      as
      the distributor of the Company’s products through an alcohol beverage control
      agency, by directly setting retail prices for the Company’s
      products.

In
      the
      U.K., the Company’s products are distributed either directly to retailers or
      through wholesalers and importers. Matthew Clark sells and distributes
      the Company’s branded products and those of other major drinks companies to
      on-premise locations through a network of depots located throughout the U.K.
      In
      Australia, New Zealand and other markets, the Company’s products are
      primarily distributed either directly to retailers or through wholesalers and
      importers. In the U.K., Australia and New Zealand, the distribution channels
      are
      dominated by a small number of industry leaders.

Trademarks
      and Distribution Agreements

Trademarks
      are an important aspect of the Company’s business. The Company sells its
      products under a number of trademarks, which the Company owns or uses under
      license. Throughout its segments, the Company also has various licenses and
      distribution agreements for the sale, or the production and sale, of its
      products and products of third parties. These licenses and distribution
      agreements have varying terms and durations. Agreements include, among others,
      a
      long-term license agreement with Hiram Walker & Sons, Inc., which expires in
      2116, for the Ten High, Crystal Palace, Northern Light, Lauder’s and Imperial
      Spirits brands, and a long-term license agreement with Chi-Chi’s, Inc., which
      expires in 2117, for the production, marketing and sale of beverage products,
      alcoholic and non-alcoholic, utilizing the Chi-Chi’s brand name.

All
        of
        the Company’s imported beer products are imported, marketed and sold through
        Crown Imports. Crown Imports has entered into exclusive importation agreements
        with the suppliers of the imported beer products. These agreements have terms
        that vary and prohibit Crown Imports from importing beer products from other
        producers from the same country. Crown Imports’ Mexican beer portfolio, the
        Modelo Brands, currently consists of the Corona Extra, Corona Light, Coronita,
        Modelo Especial, Negra Modelo and Pacifico brands and is marketed and sold
        in
        all 50 states of the U.S., the District of Columbia and Guam. Crown Imports
        also
        has entered into license and importation agreements with the owners of the
        German St. Pauli Girl and the Chinese Tsingtao brands for their importation,
        marketing and sale within the U.S. With respect to the Modelo Brands, Crown
        Imports has an exclusive sub-license to use certain trademarks related to
        Modelo
        Brands beer products in the U.S. (including the District of Columbia and
        Guam)
        pursuant to a sub-license agreement between Crown Imports and Marcas Modelo,
        S.A. de C.V. This sub-license agreement continues for the duration of the
        Crown
        Imports joint venture.

Crown
        Imports and Extrade II S.A. de C.V. (“Extrade II”), an affiliate of Modelo, have
        entered into an Importer Agreement (the “Importer Agreement”), pursuant to which
        Extrade II granted to Crown Imports the exclusive right to sell the Modelo
        Brands in the territories mentioned above. The joint venture and the related
        importation arrangements provide that, subject to the terms and conditions
        of
        those agreements, the joint venture and the related importation
        arrangements will continue until 2016 for an initial term of 10 years, and
        renew in 10-year periods unless GModelo Corporation, a Delaware corporation
        and
        subsidiary of Diblo, gives notice prior to the end of year seven of any term.


Competition

The
      beverage alcohol industry is highly competitive. The Company competes on the
      basis of quality, price, brand recognition and distribution strength. The
      Company’s beverage alcohol products compete with other alcoholic and
      non-alcoholic beverages for consumer purchases, as well as shelf space in retail
      stores, restaurant presence and wholesaler attention. The Company competes
      with
      numerous multinational producers and distributors of beverage alcohol products,
      some of which may have greater resources than the Company.

Constellation
        Wines’ principal wine competitors include: E & J Gallo Winery, The Wine
        Group, Foster’s Group, and Kendall-Jackson in the U.S.; Andrew Peller, Foster's
        Group and Maison des Futailles in Canada; E & J Gallo Winery, Diageo,
        Foster’s Group and Pernod Ricard in the U.K.; and Foster’s Group and Pernod
        Ricard in Australia. Constellation Wines’ principal cider competitors include
        Scottish and Newcastle and C&C Group.

Constellation
        Spirits’ principal distilled spirits competitors include: Diageo, Fortune
        Brands, Bacardi,

Pernod
        Ricard

and
        Brown-Forman.

Constellation
        Beers and Crown Imports’ principal competitors include: Heineken, InBev,
        Anheuser-Busch and Diageo in the imported beer category as well as domestic
        producers such as Anheuser-Busch, SABMiller and

Molson
        Coors

.

Production

In
      the
      U.S., the Company operates 21 wineries where wine is produced from many
      varieties of grapes grown principally in the Napa, Sonoma, Monterey and San
      Joaquin regions of California. In Australia, the Company operates 12 wineries
      where wine is produced from many varieties of grapes grown in most of the major
      viticultural regions. The Company also operates eight wineries in Canada and
      four wineries in New Zealand. Grapes are crushed at most of the Company’s
      wineries and stored as wine until packaged for sale under the Company’s brand
      names or sold in bulk. In the U.S. and Canada, the Company’s inventories of wine
      are usually at their highest levels in September through November during and
      after the crush of each year’s grape harvest, and are reduced prior to the
      subsequent year’s crush. Similarly, in Australia and New Zealand, the Company’s
      inventories of wine are usually at their highest levels in March through May
      during and after the crush of each year’s grape harvest, and are reduced prior
      to the subsequent year’s crush.

The
      Company has seven facilities for the production and bottling of its distilled
      spirits products. The bourbon whiskeys and domestic blended whiskeys marketed
      by
      the Company are primarily produced and aged by the Company at its distillery
      in
      Bardstown, Kentucky. The Company’s primary distilled spirits bottling facility
      in the U.S. is in Owensboro, Kentucky. The majority of the Company’s Canadian
      whisky requirements are produced and aged at its Canadian distilleries in
      Lethbridge, Alberta, and Valleyfield, Quebec. The Company’s requirements of
      Scotch whisky, tequila, mezcal and the neutral grain spirits it uses in the
      production of gin, vodka and other spirits products, are primarily purchased
      from various suppliers.

The
      Company

operates
      two facilities in the U.K. that produce, bottle and package wine and cider.
      To
      produce Stowells, wine is imported in bulk from various countries and packaged
      at the Company’s facility at Bristol, England

.
      The
      Bristol facility also produces fortified British wine and wine style drinks.
      All
      cider production takes place at the Company’s facility at Shepton Mallet,
      England.


Sources
      and Availability of Production Materials

The
      principal components in the production of the Company’s branded beverage alcohol
      products are agricultural products, such as grapes and grain, and packaging
      materials (primarily glass).

Most
      of
      the Company’s annual grape requirements are satisfied by purchases from each
      year’s harvest which normally begins in August and runs through October in the
      U.S. and begins in February and runs through May in Australia. The Company
      believes that it has adequate sources of grape supplies to meet its sales
      expectations. However, in the event that demand for certain wine products exceed
      expectations, the Company would seek to source the extra requirements from
      the
      bulk wine markets, but could experience shortages.

The
      Company receives grapes from approximately 1,050 independent growers in the
      U.S., approximately 1,400 growers in Australia and approximately 150
      growers in both Canada and New Zealand. The Company enters into written purchase
      agreements with a majority of these growers and pricing generally varies
      year-to-year and generally based on then-current market prices. In Australia,
      approximately 700 of the 1,400 growers belong to a grape growers’ cooperative.
      The Company purchases the majority of its Australian grape requirements from
      this cooperative under a long-term arrangement. In the U.K., the Company
      produces wine from materials purchased either on a contract basis or on the
      open
      market.

At
      February 28, 2007, the Company owned
      or leased approximately 24,000 acres of land and vineyards, either fully bearing
      or under development, in California (U.S.), New York (U.S.), Washington (U.S.),
      Canada, Australia and New Zealand. This acreage supplies only a small percentage
      of the Company’s overall total wine needs. However, most of this acreage is used
      to supply a large portion of the grapes used for the production of the Company’s
      super-premium and fine wines. The Company continues to consider the purchase
      or
      lease of additional vineyards, and additional land for vineyard plantings,
      to
      supplement its grape supply.

The
      distilled spirits manufactured by
      the Company require various agricultural products, neutral grain spirits and
      bulk spirits. The Company fulfills its requirements through purchases from
      various sources by contractual arrangement and through purchases on the open
      market. The Company believes that adequate supplies of the aforementioned
      products are available at the present time.

In
      the U.K., the Company sources apples
      for cider production primarily through long-term supply arrangements with owners
      of apple orchards. The Company believes there are adequate supplies of apples
      at
      this particular time.

The
        Company utilizes glass and
        polyethylene terephthalate (“PET”) bottles and other materials such as caps,
        corks, capsules, labels, wine bags and cardboard cartons in the bottling
        and
        packaging of its products. Glass bottle costs are one of the largest components
        of the Company’s cost of product sold. In the U.S., Canada and Australia, the
        glass bottle industry is highly concentrated with only a small number of
        producers. The Company has traditionally obtained, and continues to obtain,
        its
        glass requirements from a limited number of producers under long-term supply
        arrangements. Currently, one producer supplies most
        of the Company’s glass container requirements for its U.S.
        operations and another producer supplies substantially all of the
        Company’s glass container requirements for its Australian operations
        and a third producer supplies a majority of the Company’s glass
        container requirements for its Canadian operations. The Company has
        been able to satisfy its requirements with respect to the foregoing
        and considers its sources of supply to be adequate at this time. However,
        the
        inability of any of the Company’s glass bottle suppliers to satisfy the
        Company’s requirements could adversely affect the Company’s
        operations.


Government
      Regulation

The
      Company is subject to a range of
      regulations in the countries in which it operates. Where it produces products,
      the Company is subject to environmental laws and regulations and may be required
      to obtain permits and licenses to operate its facilities. Where it markets
      and
      sells products, it may be subject to laws and regulations on trademark and
      brand
      registration, packaging and labeling, distribution methods and relationships,
      pricing and price changes, sales promotions, advertising and public relations.
      The Company is also subject to rules and regulations relating to changes in
      officers or directors, ownership or control.

The
      Company believes it is in
      compliance in all material respects with all applicable governmental laws and
      regulations in the countries in which it operates. The Company also believes
      that the cost of administration and compliance with, and liability under, such
      laws and regulations does not have, and is not expected to have, a material
      adverse impact on its financial condition, results of operations or cash
      flows.

Seasonality

The
      beverage alcohol industry is
      subject to seasonality in each major category. As a result, in response to
      wholesaler and retailer demand which precedes consumer purchases, the Company’s
      wine and spirits sales are typically highest during the third quarter of its
      fiscal year, primarily due to seasonal holiday buying. Crown Imports’
imported beer sales are typically highest during the first and second quarters
      of the Company’s fiscal year, which correspond to the Spring and Summer periods
      in the U.S.

Employees

As
      of the
      end of March 2007, the Company had

approximately 9,200
      full-time employees throughout the world. Approximately 3,700 full-time
      employees were in the U.S. and approximately 5,500 full-time employees were
      outside of the U.

S.,
      in
      countries including Australia, the U.K., Canada and New Zealand. Additional
      workers may be employed by the Company during the peak and grape crushing
      seasons. The Company considers its employee relations generally to be
      good.

      time to time will depend upon our future operating performance. We do not have
      complete control over our future operating performance because it is subject
      to
      prevailing economic conditions, levels of interest rates and financial, business
      and other factors. We cannot assure you that our business will generate
      sufficient cash flow from operations to meet all of our debt service
      requirements and to fund our capital expenditure requirements.

Our
      current and future debt service obligations and covenants could have important
      consequences to you. These consequences include, or may include, the
      following:

·

Our
                ability to obtain financing for future working capital needs or
                acquisitions or other purposes may be
                limited;

·

Our
                funds available for operations, expansion or distributions will be
                reduced
                because we will dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from
                operations to the payment of principal and interest on our
                indebtedness;

·

Our
                ability to conduct our business could be limited by restrictive covenants;
                and

·

Our
                vulnerability to adverse economic conditions may be greater than
                less
                leveraged competitors and, thus, our ability to withstand competitive
                pressures may be limited.


Our
      senior credit facility and the indentures under which our debt securities have
      been issued contain restrictive covenants and provisions. These covenants and
      provisions affect our ability to grant additional liens, incur additional debt,
      sell assets, engage in changes of control, pay dividends, enter into
      transactions with affiliates, make investments and engage in certain other
      fundamental changes. Our senior credit facility also contains restrictions
      on
      our ability to make acquisitions and certain financial ratio tests, including
      a
      debt coverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio. These restrictions
      could limit our ability to conduct business. If we fail to comply with the
      obligations contained in the senior credit facility, our existing or future
      indentures or other loan agreements, we could be in default under such
      agreements, which could require us to immediately repay the related debt and
      also debt under other agreements that may contain cross-acceleration or
      cross-default provisions.

Our

acquisition and joint venture strategies may not be
      successful.

We
      have
      made a number of acquisitions, including our recent acquisition of Svedka and
      its related business and our acquisition of Vincor International Inc., and
      we anticipate that we may, from time to time, acquire additional businesses,
      assets or securities of companies that we believe would provide a strategic
      fit
      with our business. We will need to integrate acquired businesses with our
      existing operations. We cannot assure you that we will effectively assimilate
      the business or product offerings of acquired companies into our business or
      product offerings. Integrating the operations and personnel of acquired
      companies into our existing operations may result in difficulties and expense,
      disrupt our business or divert management’s time and attention. Acquisitions
      involve numerous other risks, including potential exposure to unknown
      liabilities of acquired companies and the possible loss of key employees and
      customers of the acquired business. In connection with acquisitions or joint
      venture investments outside the U.S., we may enter into derivative contracts
      to
      purchase foreign currency in order to hedge against the risk of foreign currency
      fluctuations in connection with such acquisitions or joint venture investments,
      which subjects us to the risk of foreign currency fluctuations associated with
      such derivative contracts.

We
      have
      entered into joint ventures, including our recently established joint venture
      with Modelo

and
      our
      joint venture with Punch

and
      we
      may enter into additional joint ventures. We share control of our joint
      ventures. Our joint venture partners may at any time have economic, business
      or
      legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our goals or the goals
      of
      the joint venture. In addition, our joint venture partners may be unable to
      meet
      their economic or other obligations and we may be required to fulfill those
      obligations alone. Our failure or the failure of an entity in which we have
      a
      joint venture interest to adequately manage the risks associated with any
      acquisitions or joint ventures could have a material adverse effect on our
      financial condition or results of operations. We cannot assure you that any
      of
      our acquisitions or joint ventures will be profitable. In particular,

risks
      and
      uncertainties associated with our recently established joint venture

s

with
      Modelo

and
      with
      Punch

include,
      among others, the joint venture’s ability to operate its business successfully,
      the joint venture’s ability to develop appropriate standards, controls,
      procedures and policies for the growth and management of the joint venture
      and
      the strength of the joint venture’s relationships with its employees, suppliers
      and customers.


Competition
      could have a material adverse effect on our business.

We
      are in
      a highly competitive industry and the dollar amount and unit volume of our
      sales
      could be negatively affected by our inability to maintain or increase prices,
      changes in geographic or product mix, a general decline in beverage alcohol
      consumption or the decision of wholesalers, retailers or consumers to purchase
      competitive products instead of our products. Wholesaler, retailer and consumer
      purchasing decisions are influenced by, among other things, the perceived
      absolute or relative overall value of our products, including their quality
      or
      pricing, compared to competitive products. Unit volume and dollar sales could
      also be affected by pricing, purchasing, financing, operational, advertising
      or
      promotional decisions made by wholesalers, state and provincial agencies, and
      retailers which could affect their supply of, or consumer demand for, our
      products. We could also experience higher than expected selling, general and
      administrative expenses if we find it necessary to increase the number of our
      personnel or our advertising or promotional expenditures to maintain our
      competitive position or for other reasons.

An
      increase in excise taxes or government regulations could have a material adverse
      effect on our business.

The
      U.S.,
      the U.K.,

Canada,

Australia and other countries in which we operate impose excise and other taxes
      on beverage alcohol products in varying amounts which have been subject to
      change. Significant increases in excise or other taxes on beverage alcohol
      products could materially and adversely affect our financial condition or
      results of operations. Many U.S. states have considered proposals to
      increase, and some of these states have increased, state alcohol excise taxes.
      In addition, federal, state, local and foreign governmental agencies extensively
      regulate the beverage alcohol products industry concerning such matters as
      licensing, trade and pricing practices, permitted and required labeling,
      advertising and relations with wholesalers and retailers. Certain federal and
      state

or
      provincial

regulations also require warning labels and signage. New or revised regulations
      or increased licensing fees, requirements or taxes could also have a material
      adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.

We
      rely on the performance of wholesale distributors, major retailers and chains
      for the success of our business.

In
      the
      U.S., we sell our products principally to wholesalers for resale to retail
      outlets including grocery stores, package liquor stores, club and discount
      stores and restaurants. In the U.K.,

Canada

and
      Australia, we sell our products principally to wholesalers and directly to
      major
      retailers and chains. The replacement or poor performance of our major
      wholesalers, retailers or chains could materially and adversely affect our
      results of operations and financial condition. Our inability to collect accounts
      receivable from our major wholesalers, retailers or chains could also materially
      and adversely affect our results of operations and financial
      condition.

The
      industry is being affected by the trend toward consolidation in the wholesale
      and retail distribution channels, particularly in Europe and the U.S. If we
      are
      unable to successfully adapt to this changing environment, our net income,
      share
      of sales and volume growth could be negatively affected.

In
      addition, wholesalers and retailers of our products offer products which compete
      directly with our products for retail shelf space and consumer purchases.
      Accordingly, wholesalers or retailers may give higher priority to products
      of
      our competitors. In the future, our wholesalers and retailers may not continue
      to purchase our products or provide our products with adequate levels of
      promotional support.


Our
      business could be adversely affected by a decline in the consumption of products
      we sell.

Since
        1995, there have been modest increases in consumption of beverage alcohol
        in
        most of our product categories and geographic markets. There have been periods
        in the past, however, in which there were substantial declines in the overall
        per capita consumption of beverage alcohol products in the U.S. and other
        markets in which we participate. A limited or general decline in consumption
        in
        one or more of our product categories could occur in the future due to a
        variety
        of factors, including:

·

A
                general decline in economic conditions;

·

Increased
                concern about the health consequences of consuming beverage alcohol
                products and about drinking and driving;

·

A
                general decline in the consumption of beverage alcohol products in
                on-premise establishments, such as may result from smoking
                bans;

·

A
                trend toward a healthier diet including lighter, lower calorie beverages
                such as diet soft drinks, juices and water
                products;

·

The
                increased activity of anti-alcohol groups;
                and

·

Increased
                federal, state or foreign excise or other taxes on beverage alcohol
                products.

In
      addition, our continued success depends, in part, on our ability to develop
      new
      products. The launch and ongoing success of new products are inherently
      uncertain especially with regard to their appeal to consumers. The launch of
      a
      new product can give rise to a variety of costs and an unsuccessful launch,
      among other things, can affect consumer perception of existing
      brands.

We
      generally purchase raw materials under short-term supply contracts, and we
      are
      subject to substantial price fluctuations for grapes and grape-related
      materials, and we have a limited group of suppliers of glass
      bottles.

Our
      business is heavily dependent upon raw materials, such as grapes, grape juice
      concentrate, grains, alcohol and packaging materials from third-party suppliers.
      We could experience raw material supply, production or shipment difficulties
      that could adversely affect our ability to supply goods to our customers.
      Increases in the costs of raw materials also directly affect us. In the past,
      we
      have experienced dramatic increases in the cost of grapes. Although we believe
      we have adequate sources of grape supplies, in the event demand for certain
      wine
      products exceed expectations, we could experience shortages.

The
      wine
      industry swings between cycles of grape oversupply and undersupply. In a severe
      oversupply environment, the ability of wine producers, including ourselves,
      to
      raise prices is limited, and, in certain situations, the competitive environment
      may put pressure on producers to lower prices. Further, although an oversupply
      may enhance opportunities to purchase grapes at lower costs, a producer’s
      selling and promotional expenses associated with the sale of its wine products
      can rise in such an environment.

Glass
      bottle costs are one of our largest components of cost of product sold. In
      the
      U.S.,

Canada

and
      Australia, glass bottles have only a small number of producers. Currently,
      one
      producer supplies most of our glass container requirements for our U.S.
      operations and another producer supplies substantially all of our glass
      container requirements for our Australian operations

and
      a
      third producer supplies a majority of our glass container requirements
      for our Canadian operations

.
      The
      inability of any of our glass bottle suppliers to satisfy our requirements
      could
      adversely affect our business.


Our
      operations subject us to risks relating to currency rate fluctuations, interest
      rate fluctuations and geopolitical uncertainty which could have a material
      adverse effect on our business.

We
        have
        operations in different countries throughout the world and, therefore, are
        subject to risks associated with currency fluctuations. As a result of our
        international acquisitions, we have significant exposure to foreign currency
        risk as a result of having international operations in Australia, New Zealand
        and the U.K. Following the Vincor acquisition, our exposure to foreign currency
        risk increased significantly in Canada and also further increased in Australia,
        New Zealand and the U.K. We are also exposed to risks associated with interest
        rate fluctuations. We manage our exposure to foreign currency and interest
        rate
        risks utilizing derivative instruments and other means to reduce those risks.
        We, however, could experience changes in our ability to hedge against or
        manage
        fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates and,
        accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in reducing
        those risks. We could also be affected by nationalizations or unstable
        governments or legal systems or intergovernmental disputes. These currency,
        economic and political uncertainties may have a material adverse effect on
        our
        results of operations, especially to the extent these matters, or the decisions,
        policies or economic strength of our suppliers, affect our global
        operations.

We
        have a material amount of intangible assets, such as goodwill and trademarks,
        and if we are required to write-down any of these intangible assets, it would
        reduce our net income, which in turn could have a material adverse effect
        on our
        results of operations.

We
        have a
        significant amount of intangible assets, such as goodwill and trademarks.
        We
        adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial
        Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,”
in its entirety, on March 1, 2002. Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill and indefinite
        lived intangible assets are no longer amortized, but instead are subject
        to a
        periodic impairment evaluation. Reductions in our net income caused by the
        write-down of any of these intangible assets could materially and adversely
        affect our results of operations.

The
      termination of our joint venture with Modelo relating to importing, marketing
      and selling imported beer could have a material adverse effect on our
      business.

On
        January 2, 2007, we participated in establishing and commencing operations
        of a
        joint venture with Modelo, pursuant to which Corona Extra and the other Modelo
        Brands are imported, marketed and sold by the joint venture in the U.S.
        (including the District of Columbia) and Guam along with certain other imported
        beer brands in their respective territories. Pursuant to the joint venture
        and
        related importation arrangements, the joint venture will continue for an
        initial
        term of 10 years, and renew in 10-year periods unless GModelo Corporation,
        a
        Delaware corporation and subsidiary of Diblo, gives notice prior to the end
        of
        year seven of any term of its intention to purchase our interest we hold
        through
        our subsidiary, Barton Beers, Ltd. (“Barton”). The joint venture may also
        terminate under other circumstances involving action by governmental
        authorities, certain changes in control of us or Barton as well as in connection
        with certain breaches of the importation and related sub-license agreements,
        after notice and cure periods.

The
      termination of the joint venture by acquisition of Barton’s interest or for
      other reasons noted above could have a material adverse effect on our business,
      financial condition or results of operations.


Class
      action or other litigation relating to alcohol abuse or the misuse of alcohol
      could adversely affect our business.

There
      has
      been increased public attention directed at the beverage alcohol industry,
      which
      we believe is due to concern over problems related to alcohol abuse, including
      drinking and driving, underage drinking and health consequences from the misuse
      of alcohol. Several beverage alcohol producers have been sued in several courts
      regarding alleged advertising practices relating to underage consumers. Adverse
      developments in these or similar lawsuits or a significant decline in the social
      acceptability of beverage alcohol products that results from these lawsuits
      could materially adversely affect our business.

We
      depend upon our trademarks and proprietary rights, and any failure to protect
      our intellectual property rights or any claims that we are infringing upon
      the
      rights of others may adversely affect our competitive
      position.

Our
      future success depends significantly on our ability to protect our current
      and
      future brands and products and to defend our intellectual property rights.
      We
      have been granted numerous trademark registrations covering our brands and
      products and have filed, and expect to continue to file, trademark applications
      seeking to protect newly-developed brands and products. We cannot be sure that
      trademark registrations will be issued with respect to any of our trademark
      applications. There is also a risk that we could, by omission, fail to timely
      renew a trademark or that our competitors will challenge, invalidate or
      circumvent any existing or future trademarks issued to, or licensed by,
      us.

Contamination
      could harm the integrity or customer support for our brands and adversely affect
      the sales of our products.

The
      success of our brands depends upon the positive image that consumers have of
      those brands. Contamination, whether arising accidentally or through deliberate
      third-party action, or other events that harm the integrity or consumer support
      for those brands, could adversely affect their sales. Contaminants in raw
      materials purchased from third parties and used in the production of our wine
      and spirits products or defects in the distillation or fermentation process
      could lead to low beverage quality as well as illness among, or injury to,
      consumers of our products and may result in reduced sales of the affected brand
      or all of our brands.

An
      increase in the cost of energy could affect our
      profitability.

We
      have
      experienced significant increases in energy costs, and energy costs could
      continue to rise, which would result in higher transportation, freight and
      other
      operating costs. Our future operating expenses and margins will be dependent
      on
      our ability to manage the impact of cost increases. We cannot guarantee that
      we
      will be able to pass along increased energy costs to our customers through
      increased prices.

Our
      reliance upon complex information systems distributed worldwide and our reliance
      upon third party global networks means we could experience interruptions to
      our
      business services.

We
      depend
      on information technology to enable us to operate efficiently and interface
      with
      customers, as well as maintain financial accuracy and efficiency. If we do
      not
      allocate, and effectively manage, the resources necessary to build and sustain
      the proper technology infrastructure, we could be subject to transaction errors,
      processing inefficiencies, the loss of customers, business disruptions, or
      the
      loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach. As with
      all
      large systems, our information systems could be penetrated by outside parties
      intent on extracting information, corrupting information or disrupting business
      processes. Such unauthorized access could disrupt our business and could result
      in the loss of assets.


Changes
      in accounting standards and taxation requirements could affect our financial
      results.

New
      accounting standards or pronouncements that may become applicable to us from
      time to time, or changes in the interpretation of existing standards and
      pronouncements, could have a significant effect on our reported results for
      the
      affected periods. We are also subject to income tax in the numerous
      jurisdictions in which we generate revenues. In addition, our products are
      subject to import and excise duties and/or sales or value-added taxes in many
      jurisdictions in which we operate. Increases in income tax rates could reduce
      our after-tax income from affected jurisdictions, while increases in indirect
      taxes could affect our

products’
      a

ffordability and therefore reduce our sales.

Various
      diseases, pests and certain weather conditions could affect quality and quantity
      of grapes.

Various
      diseases, pests, fungi, viruses, drought, frosts and certain other weather
      conditions could affect the quality and quantity of grapes available, decreasing
      the supply of our products and negatively impacting profitability. We cannot
      guarantee that our grape suppliers will succeed in preventing contamination
      in
      existing vineyards or that we will succeed in preventing contamination in our
      existing vineyards or future vineyards we may acquire. Future government
      restrictions regarding the use of certain materials used in grape growing may
      increase vineyard costs and/or reduce production. Grape growing also requires
      adequate water supplies. A substantial reduction in water supplies could result
      in material losses of grape crops and vines, which could lead to a shortage
      of
      our product supply.

Properties

Through
      its business segments, the Company operates wineries, distilling plants,
      bottling plants, and cider producing facilities, most of which include
      warehousing and distribution facilities on the premises.

Through Matthew
      Clark, the Company also operates separate distribution centers serving the
      Constellation Wines segment’s wholesaling business

in the
      U.K. In addition to the Company’s properties described below, certain
      of the Company’s businesses maintain office space for sales and similar
      activities and offsite warehouse and distribution facilities in a variety of
      geographic locations.

The
      Company believes that its facilities, taken as a whole, are in good condition
      and working order and have adequate capacity to meet its needs for the
      foreseeable future.

The
      following discussion details the properties associated with the Company’s five
      business segments.

Constellation
      Wines

Through
      the Constellation Wines segment, the Company maintains facilities in the U.S.,
      Australia, New Zealand, the U.K., the Republic of Ireland and Canada. These
      facilities include wineries, bottling plants, cider producing facilities,
      warehousing and distribution facilities, distribution centers and office
      facilities. The segment maintains owned and/or leased division offices in
      Canandaigua, New York; St. Helena, California; Gonzales, California; San
      Francisco, California; Reynella, South Australia; Bristol, England; Guildford,
      England; and Mississaugua, Ontario.


United
      States

In
      the
      U.S., the Company through its Constellation Wines segment operates two wineries
      in New York, located in Canandaigua and Naples; 15 wineries in California,
      located in Acampo, Esparto, Gonzales, Healdsburg, Kenwood, Oakville, Soledad,

      in Washington, located in Prosser, Woodinville and Sunnyside; and one winery
      in
      Caldwell, Idaho. All of these wineries are owned, except for the wineries in
      Caldwell (Idaho) and Woodinville (Washington), which are leased. The
      Constellation Wines segment considers its principal wineries in the U.S. to
      be
      the Mission Bell winery in Madera (California), the Canandaigua winery in
      Canandaigua (New York), the Ravenswood wineries in Sonoma (California), the
      Franciscan Vineyards winery in Rutherford (California), the Woodbridge Winery

      Robert Mondavi Winery in Oakville (California) and the Blackstone Winery in
      Gonzales (California). The Mission Bell winery crushes grapes, produces, bottles
      and distributes wine and produces specialty concentrates and Mega Colors for
      sale. The Canandaigua winery crushes grapes and produces, bottles and
      distributes wine. The other principal wineries crush grapes, vinify, cellar
      and
      bottle wine.

Through
      the Constellation Wines segment, as of February 28, 2007, the Company owned
      or
      leased approximately 11,200 acres of vineyards, either fully bearing or under
      development, in California and New York to supply a portion of the grapes used
      in the production of wine.

Australia/New
      Zealand

Through

Management’s
      Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
      Operations

Overview

The
      Company is a leading international producer and marketer of beverage alcohol
      brands with a broad portfolio across the wine, spirits and imported beer
      categories. As of January 2, 2007, the Company continues to supply imported
      beer
      in the U.S. through its investment in Crown Imports (as defined in “Acquisitions
      in Fiscal 2007 and Fiscal 2005, and Equity Method Investments” below). The
      Company has the largest wine business in the world and is the largest
      multi-category (wine, spirits and imported beer) supplier of beverage alcohol
      in
      the United States (“U.S.”); a leading producer and exporter of wine from
      Australia and New Zealand; and both a major producer and, through its investment
      in Matthew Clark (see “Recent Developments” below), a major independent drinks
      wholesaler in the United Kingdom (“U.K.”). In addition, with the acquisition of
      Vincor (as defined below), the Company is the largest producer and marketer
      of
      wine in Canada.

Through
      January 1, 2007, the Company reported its operating results in three segments:
      Constellation Wines (branded wines, and U.K. wholesale and other), Constellation
      Beers and Spirits (imported beers and distilled spirits) and Corporate
      Operations and Other.

As
      a
      result of the Company’s investment in Crown Imports, the Company has changed its
      internal management financial reporting to consist of three business divisions,
      Constellation Wines, Constellation Spirits and Crown Imports. Prior to the
      investment in Crown Imports, the Company’s internal management financial
      reporting included the Constellation Beers business division. Consequently,
      as
      of February 28, 2007, the Company reports its operating results in five
      segments: Constellation Wines (branded wine, and U.K. wholesale and other),
      Constellation Beers (imported beer), Constellation Spirits (distilled spirits),
      Corporate Operations and Other and Crown Imports (imported beer). Segment
      results for Constellation Beers are for the period prior to January 2, 2007,
      and
      segment results for Crown Imports are for the period on and after January 2,
      2007. Amounts included in the Corporate Operations and Other segment consist
      of
      general corporate administration and finance expenses. These amounts include
      costs of executive management, corporate development, corporate finance, human
      resources, internal audit, investor relations, legal, public relations,

global
      information technology and global strategic sourcing

.
      Any
      costs incurred at the corporate office that are applicable to the segments
      are
      allocated to the appropriate segment. The amounts included in the Corporate
      Operations and Other segment are general costs that are applicable to the
      consolidated group and are therefore not allocated to the other reportable
      segments. All costs reported within the Corporate Operations and Other segment
      are not included in the chief operating decision maker’s evaluation of the
      operating income performance of the other operating segments. The new business
      segments reflect how the Company’s operations are managed, how operating
      performance within the Company is evaluated by senior management and the
      structure of its internal financial reporting. In addition, the Company excludes
      acquisition-related integration costs, restructuring and related charges and
      unusual items that affect comparability from its definition of operating income
      for segment purposes. The financial information for Fiscal 2006 and Fiscal
      (as defined below) have been restated to conform to the new segment
      presentation.


The
        Company’s business strategy is to remain focused across the beverage alcohol
        industry by offering a broad range of products in each of the Company’s three
        major categories: wine and spirits and, through Crown Imports, imported beer.
        The Company intends to keep its portfolio positioned for superior top-line
        growth while maximizing the profitability of its brands. In addition, the
        Company seeks to increase its relative importance to key customers in major
        markets by increasing its share of their overall purchasing, which is
        increasingly important in a consolidating industry. The Company’s strategy of
        breadth across categories and geographies is designed to deliver long-term
        profitable growth. This strategy allows the Company more investment choices,
        provides flexibility to address changing market conditions and creates stronger
        routes-to-market.

Marketing,
        sales and distribution of the Company’s products, particularly the Constellation
        Wines segment’s products, are managed on a geographic basis in order to fully
        leverage leading market positions within each core market. Market dynamics
        and
        consumer trends vary significantly across the Company’s five core markets (U.S.,
        Canada, U.K., Australia and New Zealand) within the Company’s three geographic
        regions (North America, Europe and Australia/New Zealand). Within North America,
        the Company offers a wide range of beverage alcohol products across the branded
        wine and spirits and, through Crown Imports, imported beer categories in
        the
        U.S. and is the largest producer and marketer of branded wines in Canada.
        In
        Europe, the Company leverages its position as the largest wine supplier in
        the
        U.K. In addition, the Company leverages its investment in Matthew Clark as
        a
        strategic route-to-market for its imported wine portfolio and as a key supplier
        of a full range of beverage alcohol products primarily to the on-premise
        business. Within Australia/New Zealand, where consumer trends favor domestic
        wine products, the Company leverages its position as one of the largest
        producers of wine in Australia and New Zealand.

The
      Company remains committed to its long-term financial model of growing sales
      (both organically and through acquisitions), expanding margins and increasing
      cash flow to achieve superior earnings per share growth and improve return
      on
      invested capital.

The
      environment for the Company’s products is competitive in each of the Company’s
      core markets, due, in part, to industry and retail consolidation. In particular,
      the U.K. and Australian markets have grown increasingly competitive, as further
      described below. Competition in the U.S. beer and spirits markets is normally
      intense, with domestic and imported beer producers increasing brand spending
      in
      an effort to gain market share.

The
      U.K.
      wine market is primarily an import market, with Australian wines comprising
      nearly one-quarter of all wine sales in the U.K. off-premise business. The
      Australian wine market is primarily a domestic market. The Company has leading
      share positions in the Australian wine category in both the U.K. and Australian
      markets.

In
      the
      U.K., significant consolidation at the retail level has resulted in a limited
      number of large retailers controlling a significant portion of the off-premise
      wine business. A surplus of Australian wine has made very low cost bulk wine
      available to retailers which has allowed certain of these large retailers to
      quickly create and build private label brands in the Australian wine category.
      With growth in the U.K. wine market moderating and significant growth in private
      label brands, the Company has experienced declines in both volume and pricing.
      These markets have become increasingly competitive resulting in the Company’s
      difficulty to recover certain cost increases, in particular, the duty increases
      in the U.K. which have been imposed annually for the past several years. In
      Australia, the domestic market remains competitive due to the surplus of
      Australian bulk wine, resulting in pricing pressures on the Company’s products,
      in particular on the box wine category. These conditions are expected to persist
      at least until the Australian bulk wine market firms. These factors have
      resulted in a decrease for Fiscal 2007 (as defined below) in the Company’s net
      sales for the U.K. and a decrease in gross profit associated with the Company’s
      Australian portfolio sold in the U.K.


Two
      years
      of record Australian grape harvests in calendar 2004 and 2005 have contributed
      to the surplus of Australian bulk wine. The calendar 2006 Australian grape
      harvest was slightly lower than the prior year’s harvest. However, this has not
      had a significant impact on the current surplus. The calendar 2007 Australian
      grape harvest is expected to be significantly lower than the calendar 2006
      Australian grape harvest as a result of an ongoing drought and late spring
      frosts in several regions. The effects of the ongoing drought conditions are
      also expected by many industry projections to impact the size of the calendar
      2008 Australian grape harvest. Significant reductions in the calendar 2007
      and
      2008 Australian grape harvests could have a substantial impact on the current
      surplus and may result in higher pricing for Australian bulk wine. In the U.S.,
      the smaller than average calendar 2006 California grape harvest which followed
      a
      larger than average calendar 2005 California grape harvest should result in
      overall supply remaining generally in balance with demand.

For
      the
      year ended February 28, 2007 (“Fiscal 2007”), the Company’s net sales increased
      13% over the year ended February 28, 2006 (“Fiscal 2006”), primarily from net
      sales of products acquired in the Vincor acquisition and an increase in base
      branded wine net sales. (References to base branded wine net sales exclude
      the
      net sales of branded wine acquired in the acquisition of Vincor.) Operating
      income increased 5% over the comparable prior year period resulting from the
      increased sales discussed above, partially offset by increased
“acquisition-related integration costs, restructuring and related charges and
      unusual costs,” the recognition of stock-based compensation expense due to the
      Company’s March 1, 2006, adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
      No. 123 (revised 2004) (“SFAS No. 123(R)”), “Share-Based Payment,” and the
      competitive market conditions in the U.K. Net income increased 2% over the
      comparable prior year period primarily due to increased interest expense
      combined with an increased provision for income taxes, partially offset by
      a
      gain on change in fair value of derivative instrument entered into in connection
      with the acquisition of Vincor, an increase in equity in earnings of equity
      method investees in connection with Crown Imports, and the increase in operating
      income.

The
      Company’s Constellation Wines segment has made an operating plan decision to
      reduce distributor wine inventory levels in the U.S. during the year ending
      February 29, 2008 (“Fiscal 2008”), in response to the consolidation of
      distributors over the past few years and supply chain technology improvements.
      As distributors are looking to operate with lower levels of inventory while
      maintaining appropriate service levels to retailers, the Company plans on
      working closely with its distributors on supply-chain efficiencies, thereby
      lowering costs for both the Company and its distributors, and ultimately making
      the Company’s brands more competitive in the marketplace. The Company is
      planning to reduce distributor inventory levels during the first half of Fiscal
      2008. This decision is expected to have a significant impact on the
      Com

pany’s
      Fiscal 2008 financial performance, including a reduction of net sales in the
      range of $160 million to $190 million and a reduction in diluted earnings per
      share in the range of $0.15 to $0.20.

The
      following discussion and analysis summarizes the significant factors affecting
      (i) consolidated results of operations of the Company for Fiscal 2007 compared
      to Fiscal 2006, and Fiscal 2006 compared to the year ended February 28, 2005
      (“Fiscal 2005”), and (ii) financial liquidity and capital resources for Fiscal
      2007. This discussion and analysis also identifies certain acquisition-related
      integration costs, restructuring and related charges and net unusual costs
      expected to affect consolidated results of operations of the Company for Fiscal
      2008. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the
      Company’s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included
      herein.


Recent
        Developments

Investment
      in Matthew Clark

On
        April
        17, 2007, the Company and Punch Taverns plc (“Punch”) commenced operations of a
        joint venture for the U.K. wholesale business (“Matthew Clark”). The U.K.
        wholesale business was formerly owned entirely by the Company. Under the
        terms
        of the arrangement, the Company and Punch, directly or indirectly, each have
        a
        50% voting and economic interest in Matthew Clark. The joint venture will
        reinforce Matthew Clark’s position as the U.K.’s largest independent premier
        drinks wholesaler serving the on-trade drinks industry. The Company
        received $178.8 million of cash proceeds from the formation of the joint
        venture, subject to a post-closing adjustment.

Upon
        formation of the joint venture, the Company discontinued consolidation of
        the
        U.K. wholesale business and accounts for the investment in Matthew Clark
        under
        the equity method. Accordingly, the results of operations of Matthew Clark
        will
        be included in the equity in earnings of equity method investees line in
        the
        Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income from the date of
        investment.

Acquisition
      of Svedka

On
      March
      19, 2007, the Company acquired the SVEDKA Vodka brand (“Svedka”) in connection
      with the acquisition of Spirits Marque One LLC and related business (the “Svedka
      Acquisition”) for cash consideration of $383.7 million, net of cash acquired. In
      addition, the Company expects to incur direct acquisition costs of approximately
      $1.0 million. Svedka is a premium vodka produced in Sweden and is the fastest
      growing major imported premium vodka in the U.S. Svedka is the fifth
      largest imported vodka in the U.S. The purchase price was financed
      with revolver borrowings under the Company’s senior credit
      facility.

The
      results of operations of the Svedka business will be reported in the
      Constellation Spirits segment and will be included in the consolidated results
      of operations of the Company from the date of acquisition. The Company expects
      the Svedka Acquisition to have a significant impact on the Company’s interest
      expense associated with the additional revolver borrowings.

Acquisitions
      in Fiscal 2007 and Fiscal 2005, and Equity Method
      Investments

Acquisition
      of Vincor

On
      June
      5, 2006, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding common shares
      of
      Vincor International Inc. (“Vincor”), Canada’s premier wine company. Vincor is
      Canada’s largest producer and marketer of wine. At the time of the acquisition,
      Vincor was the world’s eighth largest producer and distributor of wine and
      related products by revenue and was also one of the largest wine importers,
      marketers and distributors in the U.K. Through this transaction, the Company
      acquired various additional winery and vineyard interests used in the production
      of premium, super-premium and fine wines from Canada, California, Washington
      State, Western Australia and New Zealand. In addition, as a result of the
      acquisition, the Company sources, markets and sells premium wines from South
      Africa. Well-known premium brands acquired in the Vincor acquisition include
      Inniskillin, Jackson-Triggs, Sawmill Creek, R.H. Phillips, Toasted Head, Hogue,
      Kim Crawford and Kumala.


The
      acquisition of Vincor supports the Company’s strategy of strengthening the
      breadth of its portfolio across price segments and geographic regions to
      capitalize on the overall growth in the wine industry. In addition to
      complementing the Company’s current operations in the U.S., U.K., Australia and
      New Zealand, the acquisition of Vincor increases the Company’s global presence
      by adding Canada as another core market and

provides
      the Company with the ability to capitalize on broader geographic distribution
      in
      strategic international markets

.
      In
      addition, the acquisition of Vincor makes the Company the largest wine company
      in Canada and strengthens the Company’s position as the largest wine company in
      the world and the largest premium wine company in the U.S.

Total
      consideration paid in cash to the Vincor shareholders was $1,115.8 million.
      In
      addition, the Company expects to incur direct acquisition costs of approximately
      $11.0 million. At closing, the Company also assumed outstanding indebtedness
      of
      Vincor, net of cash acquired, of $320.2 million, resulting in a total
      transaction value of $1,447.0 million. The purchase price was financed with
      borrowings under the Company’s June 2006 Credit Agreement (as defined
      below).

The
      results of operations of the Vincor business are reported in the Constellation
      Wines segment and are included in the consolidated results of operations of
      the
      Company from the date of acquisition. The acquisition of Vincor is significant
      and the Company expects it to have a material impact on the Company’s future
      results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In particular, the
      Company expects its future results of operations to be significantly impacted
      by, among other things, the flow through of inventory step-up,
      acquisition-related integration costs and interest expense associated with
      the
      2006 Credit Agreement (as defined below).

Acquisition
      of Robert Mondavi

On
      December 22, 2004, the Company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock
      of
      The Robert Mondavi Corporation (“Robert Mondavi”), a leading premium wine
      producer based in Napa, California. Through this transaction, the Company
      acquired various additional winery and vineyard interests, and, additionally
      produces, markets and sells premium, super-premium and fine California wines

under
      the
      Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi,

Robert
      Mondavi Private Selection and Robert Mondavi Winery brand names. In the United
      States, Woodbridge is the leading domestic premium wine brand and Robert Mondavi
      Private Selection is the leading super-premium wine brand. As a result of the
      Robert Mondavi acquisition, the Company acquired an ownership interest in Opus
      One, a joint venture owned equally by Robert Mondavi and Baron Philippe de
      Rothschild, S.A. During September 2005, the Company’s president and Baroness
      Philippine de Rothschild announced an agreement to maintain equal ownership
      of
      Opus One. Opus One produces fine wines at its Napa Valley winery. T

he
      Company accounts for the investment in Opus One under the equity method.
      Accordingly, the results of operations of Opus One are included in the equity
      in
      earnings of equity method investees line in the Company’s Consolidated
      Statements of Income since December 22, 2004.

The
      acquisition of Robert Mondavi supports the Company’s strategy of strengthening
      the breadth of its portfolio across price segments to capitalize on the overall
      growth in the premium, super-premium and fine wine categories. The Company
      believes that the acquired Robert Mondavi brand names have strong brand
      recognition globally. The vast majority of sales from these brands are generated
      in the United States. The Company is leveraging the Robert Mondavi brands in
      the
      United States through its selling, marketing and distribution infrastructure.
      The Company has also expanded distribution for the Robert Mondavi brands in
      Europe through its Constellation Europe infrastructure.


The
      Robert Mondavi acquisition supports the Company’s strategy of growth and breadth
      across categories and geographies, and strengthens its competitive position
      in
      certain of its core markets.

The
      Robert Mondavi acquisition provides the Company with a greater presence in
      the
      growing premium, super-premium and fine wine sectors within the United States
      and the ability to capitalize on the broader geographic distribution in
      strategic international markets.

In
      particular, the Company believes there are growth opportunities for premium,
      super-premium and fine wines in the United Kingdom and other “new world” wine
      markets.

Total
      consideration paid in cash to the Robert Mondavi sha

reholders
      was $1,030.7 million. Additionally, the Company incurred direct acquisition
      costs of $12.0

million.

The
      purchase price was financed with borrowings under the Company’s prior senior
      credit facility.

The
      results of operations of the Robert Mondavi business have been reported in
      the
      Company’s Constellation Wines segment since December 22, 2004. Accordingly, the
      Company’s results of operations for Fiscal 2007 and Fiscal 2006 include the
      results of operations of the Robert Mondavi business for the entire period,
      whereas the results of operations for Fiscal 2005 only include the results
      of
      operations of the Robert Mondavi business from December 22, 2004, to the end
      of
      Fiscal 2005.

Following
      the Robert Mondavi acquisition, the Company sold certain of the acquired
      vineyard properties and related assets, investments accounted for under the
      equity method, and winery properties and related assets. The Company realized
      net proceeds of $180.7 million from the sale of these assets since the date
      of
      acquisition through the end of Fiscal 2006. No amounts were realized for Fiscal
      2007. No gain or loss was recognized upon the sale of these assets.

Investment
      in Crown Imports

On
        July
        17, 2006, Barton Beers, Ltd. (“Barton”), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of
        the Company, entered into an Agreement to Establish Joint Venture (the “Joint
        Venture Agreement”) with Diblo, S.A. de C.V. (“Diblo”), an entity owned 76.75%
        by Grupo Modelo, S.A. de C.V. (“Modelo”) and 23.25% by Anheuser-Busch, Inc.,
        pursuant to which Modelo’s Mexican beer portfolio (the “Modelo Brands”) will be
        exclusively imported, marketed and sold in the 50 states of the U.S., the
        District of Columbia and Guam. In addition, the owners of the Tsingtao and
        St.
        Pauli Girl brands transferred exclusive importing, marketing and selling
        rights
        with respect to these brands in the U.S. to the joint venture. On January
        2, 2007, the parties completed the closing (the “Closing”) of the transactions
        contemplated in the Joint Venture Agreement, as amended at
        Closing.

Pursuant
      to the Joint Venture Agreement, Barton established Crown Imports LLC, a
      wholly-owned subsidiary formed as a Delaware limited liability company. On
      January 2, 2007, pursuant to a Barton Contribution Agreement, dated July 17,
      2006, among Barton, Diblo and Crown Imports LLC (the “Barton Contribution
      Agreement”), Barton transferred to Crown Imports LLC substantially all of
      its assets relating to importing, marketing and selling beer under the Corona
      Extra, Corona Light, Coronita, Modelo Especial, Negra Modelo, Pacifico, St.
      Pauli Girl and Tsingtao brands and the liabilities associated therewith (the
      “Barton Contributed Net Assets”). At the Closing, GModelo Corporation, a
      Delaware corporation (the “Diblo Subsidiary”), a subsidiary of Diblo joined
      Barton as a member of Crown Imports LLC, and, in exchange for a 50% membership
      interest in Crown Imports LLC, contributed cash in an amount equal to the Barton
      Contributed Net Assets, subject to specified adjustments.

This
      imported beers joint venture is referred to hereinafter as “Crown
      Imports”.


Also
        on
        January 2, 2007, Crown Imports and Extrade II S.A. de C.V. (“Extrade II”), an
        affiliate of Modelo, entered into an Importer Agreement (the “Importer
        Agreement”), pursuant to which Extrade II granted to Crown Imports the exclusive
        right to import, market and sell the Modelo Brands in the territories mentioned
        above, and Crown Imports and Marcas Modelo, S.A. de C.V. (“Marcas Modelo”),
        entered into a Sub-license Agreement (the “Sub-license Agreement”), pursuant to
        which Marcas Modelo granted Crown Imports an exclusive sub-license to use
        certain trademarks related to the Modelo Brands within this
        territory.

As
        a
        result of these transactions, Barton and Diblo each have, directly or
        indirectly, equal interests in Crown Imports and each of Barton and Diblo
        have
        appointed an equal number of directors to the Board of Directors of Crown
        Imports.

The
        Importer Agreement set forth an immediate increase in the price of the products
        sold to Crown Imports of $0.25 per case, subject to adjustment by the parties.
        Such initial price increase was not intended to be reflected in an automatic
        corresponding price increase charged to Crown Imports customers. It was designed
        to reflect the relative values of the importation rights for the Western
        United
        States previously held by B

arton
        and
        the importation rights for the rest of the U.S. Subsequent to January 2,
        2007,
        it was determined that the initial price increase was not necessary as the
        relative value of the importation rights for the Western United States was
        comparable with that of the rest of the U.S. Accordingly, equity in earnings
        of
        equity method investees for Crown Imports does not include any initial price
        increase from the date of investment. The importer agreement that previously
        gave Barton the exclusive right to import, market and sell the Modelo Brands
        primarily west of the Mississippi River was superseded by the transactions
        contemplated by the Joint Venture Agreemen

t,
        as
        amended. The contribution by Diblo Subsidiary in exchange for a 50% membership
        interest in Crown does not constitute the acquisition of a business by the
        Company.

The
        joint
        venture and the related importation arrangements provide that, s

ubject
        to
        the terms and conditions of those agreements, the joint venture and the related
        importation arrangements

will continue for an initial term of 10 years,
        and renew in 10-year periods unless Diblo Subsidiary gives notice prior to
        the
        end of year seven of any term.

Upon
        consummation of the transactions, the Company discontinued consolidation
        of the
        imported beer business and accounts for the investment in Crown Imports under
        the equity method. Accordingly, the results of operations of Crown Imports
        are
        included in the equity in earnings of equity method investees line in the
        Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income from the date of
        investment.

Investment
      in Ruffino

On
      December 3, 2004, the Company purchased a 40% interest in Ruffino S.r.l.
      (“Ruffino”), the well-known Italian fine wine company, for $89.6 million,
      including direct acquisition costs of $7.5 million. As of February 1, 2005,
      the
      Constellation Wines segment began distributing Ruffino’s products in the United
      States. The Company accounts for the investment in Ruffino under the equity
      method; accordingly, the results of operations of Ruffino from December 3,
      2004,
      are included in the equity in earnings of equity method investees line in the
      Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income.


Results
      of Operations

Fiscal
      2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006

Net
      Sales

The
      following table sets forth the net sales (in millions of dollars) by operating
      segment of the Company for Fiscal 2007 and Fiscal 2006.

Net
      sales
      for Fiscal 2007 increased to $5,216.4 million from $4,603.5 million for Fiscal
      2006, an increase of $612.9 million, or 13%. This increase was due primarily
      to
      $405.8 million of net sales of products acquired in the Vincor acquisition,
      an
      increase in base branded wine net sales of $95.7 million (on a constant currency
      basis) and a favorable foreign currency impact of $66.2 million.

Constellation
      Wines

Net
      sales
      for Constellation Wines increased to $3,843.4 million for Fiscal 2007 from
      $3,235.4 million in Fiscal 2006, an increase of $608.0 million, or 19%. Branded
      wine net sales increased $492.3 million primarily due to $379.9 million of
      net
      sales of branded wine acquired in the Vincor acquisition and increased base
      branded wine net sales for North America (primarily the U.S.) of $118.9,
      partially offset by decreased base branded wine net sales for Europe (primarily
      the U.K.) of $27.4 million (on a constant currency basis). The increase in
      base
      branded wine net sales for the U.S. was driven by both higher average selling
      prices as the consumer continues to trade up to higher priced premium wines
      as
      supported by volume gains in both the premium and super-premium categories
      as
      well as volume gains in the wine with fruit category. The decrease in base
      branded wine net sales for the U.K. was driven primarily by lower pricing due
      to
      the highly competitive pricing market for private label and branded wine
      resulting from the significant oversupply of Australian wine and highly
      concentrated retail market place. Wholesale and other net sales increased $115.7
      million primarily due to an increase of $51.0 million (on a constant currency
      basis) in the Company’s U.K. wholesale business as a result of a shift in the
      mix of sales towards higher priced products, a favorable foreign currency impact
      of $48.9 million and $25.9 million of net sales of non-branded products acquired
      in the Vincor acquisition.


Constellation
      Beers

Net
      sales
      for Constellation Beers remained comparable for Fiscal 2007 at $1,043.6 million
      from $1,043.5 million for Fiscal 2006. This is due to the formation of Crown
      Imports on January 2, 2007, and the accounting for this investment under the
      equity method of accounting. As such, Fiscal 2007 net sales include only ten
      months of net sales versus Fiscal 2006 net sales which include twelve months
      of
      net sales. However, on a similar year over year period, with ten months of
      net
      sales for Fiscal 2006, the Constellation Beers net sales increased 15% primarily
      due to volume growth in the Company’s Mexican beer portfolio from increased
      retail consumer demand.

Constellation
      Spirits

Net
      sales
      for Constellation Spirits increased slightly to $329.4 million for Fiscal 2007
      from $324.6 million for Fiscal 2006, an increase of $4.8 million, or 1%. This
      increase resulted primarily from an increase in branded spirits net sales of
      $9.9 million partially offset by a decrease in bulk spirits net sales of
      $5.1 million.

Gross
      Profit

The
      Company’s gross profit increased to $1,523.9 million for Fiscal 2007 from
      $1,324.6 million for Fiscal 2006, an increase of $199.3 million, or 15%. The
      Constellation Wines segment’s gross profit increased $199.1 million primarily
      from gross profit of $166.8 million due to the Vincor acquisition and the
      additional gross profit of $36.8 million associated with the increased base
      branded wine net sales for North America. These amounts were partially offset
      by
      a $14.7 million decrease in U.K. and Australia gross profit resulting from
      the
      increased competition and promotional activities among suppliers in the U.K.
      and
      Australia, reflecting, in part, the effects of the oversupply of Australian
      wine
      and the retailer consolidation in the U.K., plus a late March 2006 increase
      in
      duty costs in the U.K. The Constellation Beers segment’s gross profit was
      comparable with prior year due to ten months of gross profit for Fiscal 2007
      versus twelve months for Fiscal 2006. The Constellation Spirits segment’s gross
      profit was down slightly primarily due to increased material costs for spirits.
      In addition, unusual items, which consist of certain costs that are excluded
      by
      management in their evaluation of the results of each operating segment, were
      lower by $3.8 million in Fiscal 2007 versus Fiscal 2006. This decrease resulted
      primarily from decreased flow through of adverse grape cost associated with
      the
      acquisition of Robert Mondavi of $19.9 million and decreased accelerated
      depreciation costs of $6.8 million associated with the Fiscal 2006 Plan and
      Fiscal 2007 Wine Plan (as each of those terms is defined below in Restructuring
      and Related Charges), partially offset by increased flow through of inventory
      step-up of $22.3 million associated primarily with the Vincor acquisition.
      Gross
      profit as a percent of net sales increased to 29.2% for Fiscal 2007 from 28.8%
      for Fiscal 2006 primarily as a result of the factors discussed
      above.


Selling,
      General and Administrative Expenses

Selling,
      general and administrative expenses increased to $768.8 million for Fiscal
      from $612.4 million for Fiscal 2006, an increase of $156.4 million, or 26%.
      This
      increase is due primarily to an increase of $99.7 million in the Constellation
      Wines segment and a $43.5 million increase in unusual costs which consist of
      certain items that are excluded by management in their evaluation of the results
      of each operating segment. The increase in the Constellation Wines segment’s
      selling, general and administrative expenses is primarily due to increased
      advertising expenses of $28.0 million, selling expenses of $40.8 million and
      general and administrative expenses of $30.9 million resulting primarily from
      the Vincor acquisition and the recognition of stock-based compensation expense
      of $8.4 million. The Constellation Beers segment’s selling, general and
      administrative expenses increased $12.1 million primarily due to increased
      advertising expenses of $12.1 million and general and administrative expenses
      of
      $2.7 million, partially offset by decreased selling expenses of $2.5 million
      and
      the impact of ten months of selling, general and administrative expenses for
      Fiscal 2007 compared to twelve months of selling, general and administrative
      expenses for Fiscal 2006. The Constellation Spirits segment’s selling, general
      and administrative expenses were up slightly primarily due to the recognition
      of
      stock-based compensation expense of $1.5 million. The Corporate Operations
      and
      Other segment’s selling, general and administrative expenses were down slightly,
      primarily due to costs recognized in Fiscal 2006 associated with professional
      service fees incurred in connection with the Company’s tender offer for Vincor
      that expired in December 2005 of $4.3 million and lower annual management
      incentive compensation expense in Fiscal 2007, partially offset by the
      recognition of stock-based compensation expense in Fiscal 2007 of $4.3 million
      and expenses associated with the formation of Crown Imports of $1.5 million.
      The
      increase in unusual costs was primarily due to the recognition of (i) $16.3
      million of other charges associated with the Fiscal 2007 Wine Plan (primarily
      from the write-down of an Australian winery and certain Australian vineyards
      to
      fair value less cost to sell) and the Fiscal 2006 Plan, (ii) a $13.4 million
      loss on the sale of the Company’s branded bottled water business resulting from
      the write-off of $27.7 million of non-deductible intangible assets, primarily
      goodwill, (iii) financing costs of $11.9 million related primarily to the
      Company’s new senior credit facility entered into in connection with the Vincor
      acquisition and (iv) foreign currency losses of $5.4 million on foreign
      denominated intercompany loan balances associated with the Vincor acquisition.
      Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales increased
      to 14.7% for Fiscal 2007 as compared to 13.3% for Fiscal 2006 primarily due
      to
      the increase in unusual costs and the recognition of stock-based compensation
      expense of $16.5 million.

Restructuring
      and Related Charges

The
        Company recorded $32.5 million of restructuring and related charges for Fiscal
        2007 associated primarily with the Company’s plan to invest in new distribution
        and bottling facilities in the U.K. and to streamline certain Australian
        wine
        operations (collectively, the “Fiscal 2007 Wine Plan”) and the Company’s
        worldwide wine reorganizations announced during Fiscal 2006 and the Company’s
        program to consolidate certain west coast production processes in the U.S.
        (collectively, the “Fiscal 2006 Plan”). Restructuring and related charges
        included $5.9 million of employee termination benefit costs (net of reversal
        of
        prior accruals of $2.0 million), $25.6 million of contract termination costs
        and
        $1.0 million of facility consolidation/relocation costs (net of reversal
        of
        prior accruals of $0.4 million). In addition, in connection with the Fiscal
        Wine Plan, the Fiscal 2006 Plan and the Company’s plan to restructure and
        integrate the operations of Vincor (the “Vincor Plan”), the Company recorded (i)
        $6.6 million of accelerated depreciation costs and $0.6 million of inventory
        write-downs and (ii) $16.3 million of other related costs which were recorded
        in
        the cost of product sold line and selling, general and administrative expenses
        line, respectively, within the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income. The
        Company recorded $29.3 million of restructuring and related charges for Fiscal
        2006 associated primarily with the Fiscal 2006 Plan.


For
        Fiscal 2008, the Company expects to incur total restructuring and related
        charges of $4.5 million associated with the Fiscal 2006 Plan, Fiscal 2007
        Wine
        Plan and Vincor Plan. In addition, with respect to these plans, the Company
        expects to incur total accelerated depreciation costs, other charges and
        inventory write-downs for Fiscal 2008 of $6.7 million, $1.9 million and $0.3
        million, respectively.

Acquisition-Related
        Integration Costs

Acquisition-related
        integration costs increased to $23.6 million for Fiscal 2007 from $16.8 million
        for Fiscal 2006, an increase of $6.8 million, or 40%. Acquisition-related
        integration costs consisted of costs recorded primarily in connection with
        the
        Vincor Plan. Acquisition-related integration costs included $9.8 million
        of
        employee-related costs and $13.8 million of facilities and other one-time
        costs.
        The Company recorded $16.8 million of acquisition-related integration costs
        for
        Fiscal 2006 in connection with the

Company’s
        plan to restructure and integrate the operations of The Robert Mondavi
        Corporation (the “Robert Mondavi Plan”).

For
        Fiscal 2008, the Company expects to incur total acquisition-related integration
        costs of $10.2 million, including $0.5 million of employee-related costs
        and
        $9.7 million of facilities and other one-time costs, primarily in connection
        with the Vincor Plan.

Operating
      Income

The
      following table sets forth the operating income (loss) (in millions of dollars)
      by operating segment of the Company for Fiscal 2007 and Fiscal
      2006.


As
      a
      result of the factors discussed above, consolidated operating income increased
      to $699.0 million for Fiscal 2007 from $666.1 million for Fiscal 2006, an
      increase of $32.9 million, or 5%. Acquisition-related integration costs,
      restructuring and related charges and unusual costs of $143.6 million for Fiscal
      2007 consist of certain costs that are excluded by management in their
      evaluation of the results of each operating segment. These costs represent
      restructuring and related charges of $32.5 million associated primarily with
      the
      Fiscal 2007 Wine Plan and Fiscal 2006 Plan; the flow through of inventory
      step-up of $30.2 million associated primarily with the Company’s acquisition of
      Vincor; acquisition-related integration costs of $23.6 million associated
      primarily with the Vincor Plan; other charges of $16.3 million associated with
      the Fiscal 2007 Wine Plan and Fiscal 2006 Plan included within selling, general
      and administrative expenses; loss on the sale of the branded bottled water
      business of $13.4 million; financing costs of $11.9 million related primarily
      to
      the Company’s new senior credit facility entered into in connection with the
      Vincor acquisition; foreign currency losses of $5.4 million on foreign
      denominated intercompany loan balances associated with the Vincor acquisition;
      the flow through of adverse grape cost of $3.1 million associated with the
      acquisition of Robert Mondavi; and accelerated depreciation costs and the
      write-down of certain inventory of $6.6 million and $0.6 million, respectively,
      associated primarily with the Fiscal 2006 Plan and Fiscal 2007 Wine Plan.
      Acquisition-related integration costs, restructuring and related charges and
      unusual costs of $93.9 million for Fiscal 2006 represent restructuring and
      related charges of $29.3 million associated primarily with the Fiscal 2006
      Plan
      and the Robert Mondavi Plan; the flow through of adverse grape cost,
      acquisition-related integration costs, and the flow through of inventory step-up
      associated primarily with the Company’s acquisition of Robert Mondavi of $23.0
      million, $16.8 million, and $7.9 million, respectively; accelerated depreciation
      costs and other charges of $13.4 million and $0.1 million, respectively,
      associated with the Fiscal 2006 Plan; and costs associated with professional
      service fees incurred for due diligence in connection with the Company’s
      evaluation of a potential offer for Allied Domecq of $3.4 million.

Equity
      in Earnings of Equity Method Investees

The
      Company’s equity in earnings of equity method investees increased to $49.9
      million in Fiscal 2007 from $0.8 million in Fiscal 2006, an increase of $49.1
      million. This increase is primarily due to (i) the January 2, 2007, consummation
      of the beer joint venture and the reporting of the results of operations of
      the
      joint venture since that date under the equity method of accounting of $38.9
      million, and (ii) an increase of $8.1 million associated with the Company’s
      investment in Ruffino due primarily to the write-down in Fiscal 2006 of certain
      pre-acquisition Ruffino inventories.

Gain
      on Change in Fair Value of Derivative Instrument

In
      April
      2006, the Company entered into a foreign currency forward contract in connection
      with the acquisition of Vincor to fix the U.S. dollar cost of the acquisition
      and the payment of certain outstanding indebtedness. For Fiscal 2007, the
      Company recorded a gain of $55.1 million in connection with this derivative
      instrument. Under SFAS No. 133, a transaction that involves a business
      combination is not eligible for hedge accounting treatment. As such, the gain
      was recognized separately on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of
      Income.

Interest
      Expense, Net

Interest
      expense, net of interest income of $5.4 million and $4.2 million for Fiscal
      and Fiscal 2006, respectively, increased to $268.7 million for Fiscal 2007
      from
      $189.6 million for Fiscal 2006, an increase of $79.1 million, or 41.7%. The
      increase resulted from both higher average borrowings in Fiscal 2007 (primarily
      as a result of the financing of the Vincor acquisition) and higher average
      interest rates.


Provision
      for Income Taxes

The
      Company’s effective tax rate increased to 38.0% for Fiscal 2007 from 31.8% for
      Fiscal 2006, an increase of 6.2%. In Fiscal 2007, the Company sold its branded
      bottled water business that resulted in the write-off of $27.7 million of
      non-deductible intangible assets, primarily goodwill. The provision for income
      taxes on the sale of the branded bottled water business increased the Company’s
      effective tax rate for Fiscal 2007. In addition, the effective tax rate for
      Fiscal 2006 reflected the benefits recorded for adjustments to income tax
      accruals of $16.2 million in connection with the completion of various income
      tax examinations as well as the preliminary conclusion regarding the impact
      of
      the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 on planned distributions of certain
      foreign earnings.

Net
      Income

As
      a
      result of the above factors, net income increased to $

331.9

million
      for Fiscal 2007 from $

325.3

million
      for Fiscal 2006, an increase of $6.6 million, or 2%.

Fiscal
      2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005

Net
      Sales

The
      following table sets forth the net sales (in millions of dollars) by operating
      segment of the Company for Fiscal 2006 and Fiscal 2005.

Net
      sales
      for Fiscal 2006 increased to $4,603.5 million from $4,087.6 million for Fiscal
      2005, an increase of $515.9 million, or 13%. This increase resulted primarily
      from an increase in branded wine net sales of $440.1 million (on a constant
      currency basis) and imported beer net sales of $120.5 million, partially offset
      by an unfavorable foreign currency impact of $35.5 million.

Constellation
      Wines

Net
      sales
      for Constellation Wines increased to $3,235.4 million for Fiscal 2006 from
      $2,851.4 million in Fiscal 2005, an increase of $384.0 million, or 13%. Branded
      wine net sales increased $432.6 million primarily from $337.5 million of net
      sales of the acquired Robert Mondavi brands and $43.6 million of net sales
      of
      Ruffino brands, which the Company began distributing in the U.S. on February
      1,
      2005, as well as a $51.5 million increase in branded wine net sales (excluding
      sales of Robert Mondavi and Ruffino brands). The $51.5 million increase is
      due
      primarily to growth in the Company’s branded wine net sales in the U.S. of $45.2
      million resulting from a $28.2 million benefit from a shift in the mix of sales
      towards higher priced products and $17.0 million from new product introductions.
      Wholesale and other net sales decreased $48.5 million ($20.5 million on a
      constant currency basis) as constant currency growth in the U.K. wholesale
      business of $13.0 million was more than offset by a decrease in other net sales
      of $33.5 million. The decrease in other net sales is primarily due to the
      Company’s Fiscal 2004 decision to exit the commodity concentrate business during
      Fiscal 2005.


Constellation
      Beers

Net
      sales
      for Constellation Beers increased to $1,043.5 million for Fiscal 2006 from
      $922.9 million for Fiscal 2005, an increase of $120.6 million, or 13%. This
      increase resulted from volume growth in the Company’s Mexican beer portfolio
      resulting from increased retail consumer demand.

Constellation
      Spirits

Net
      sales
      for Constellation Spirits increased to $324.6 million for Fiscal 2006 from
      $313.3 million for Fiscal 2005, an increase of $11.3 million, or 4%. This
      increase is attributable primarily to an increase in the Company’s contract
      production net sales for Fiscal 2006.

Gross
      Profit

The
      Company’s gross profit increased to $1,324.6 million for Fiscal 2006 from
      $1,140.6 million for Fiscal 2005, an increase of $184.0 million, or 16%. The
      Constellation Wines segment’s gross profit increased $191.0 million primarily
      due to the additional gross profit of $171.7 million from the Robert Mondavi
      acquisition and additional gross profit of $50.4 million from branded wine
      net
      sales in the U.S. primarily due to the favorable mix of sales towards higher
      margin products and new product introductions, partially offset by reduced
      gross
      profit of $41.5 million from the decrease in other net sales. The Constellation
      Beers segment’s gross profit increased $18.1 million primarily due to volume
      growth in the Company’s Mexican beer portfolio of $37.4 million, partially
      offset by higher Mexican beer product costs of $9.5 million and transportation
      costs of $4.0 million. However, in connection with certain supply arrangements,
      the higher Mexican beer product costs were offset by a corresponding decrease
      in
      advertising expenses resulting in no impact to operating income. The
      Constellation Spirits segment’s gross profit increased $2.9 million. In
      addition, unusual items, which consist of certain costs that are excluded by
      management in their evaluation of the results of each operating segment, were
      higher by $28.1 million in Fiscal 2006 versus Fiscal 2005. This increase
      resulted primarily from accelerated depreciation costs associated with the
      Fiscal 2006 Plan (as defined below) of $13.4 million and increased flow through
      of adverse grape cost associated with the Robert Mondavi acquisition of $13.2
      million. Gross profit as a percent of net sales increased to 28.8% for Fiscal
      2006 from 27.9% for Fiscal 2005 primarily due to sales of higher-margin wine
      brands acquired in the Robert Mondavi acquisition, partially offset by the
      higher unusual items and higher Mexican beer product costs and transportation
      costs.


Selling,
      General and Administrative Expenses

Selling,
      general and administrative expenses increased to $612.4 million for Fiscal
      from $555.7 million for Fiscal 2005, an increase of $56.7 million, or 10%.
      The
      Constellation Wines segment’s selling, general and administrative expenses
      increased $67.2 million primarily due to increased selling expenses of $31.6
      million, general and administrative expenses of $26.8 million, and advertising
      expenses of $8.8 million to support the growth in the segment’s business,
      primarily due to the costs related to the brands acquired in the Robert Mondavi
      acquisition. Included in the increase in general and administrative expenses
      was
      an expense of $6.4 million associated with the segment’s U.K. defined benefit
      pension plan related to a reduction in the period over which unrecognized
      actuarial losses are amortized. The Constellation Beers segment’s selling,
      general and administrative expenses decreased $4.3 million due to lower
      advertising expenses of $8.3 million, partially offset by increased selling
      expenses of $3.1 million and general and administrative expenses of $0.9
      million. The Constellation Spirits segment’s selling, general and administrative
      expenses increased $9.0 million due primarily to increased advertising expenses
      of $5.2 million and selling expenses of $4.2 million. The Corporate Operations
      and Other segment’s selling, general and administrative expenses increased $7.0
      million primarily due to costs associated with professional service fees
      incurred in connection with the Company’s tender offer for Vincor that expired
      in December 2005 of $4.3 million and increased general and administrative
      expenses of $2.7 million to support the Company’s growth. Lastly, there was a
      decrease of $22.1 million of unusual costs which consist of certain items that
      are excluded by management in their evaluation of the results of each operating
      segment. Fiscal 2006 included costs associated primarily with professional
      service fees incurred for due diligence in connection with the Company’s
      evaluation of a potential offer for Allied Domecq of $3.4 million. Fiscal 2005
      costs included $31.7 million of financing costs recorded in Fiscal 2005 related
      to (i) the Company’s redemption of its $200.0 million aggregate principal amount
      of 8 1/2% Senior Subordinated Notes due March 2009 (the “Senior Subordinated
      Notes”) of $10.3 million and (ii) the Company’s new senior credit facility
      entered into in connection with the Robert Mondavi acquisition of $21.4 million,
      partially offset by net gains of $6.1 million recorded in Fiscal 2005 on the
      sales of non-strategic assets of $3.1 million and the receipt of a payment
      associated with the termination of a previously announced potential fine wine
      joint venture of $3.0 million. Selling, general and administrative expenses
      as a
      percent of net sales decreased to 13.3% for Fiscal 2006 as compared to 13.6%
      for
      Fiscal 2005 primarily due to the decrease in unusual costs.

Restructuring
      and Related Charges

The
      Company recorded $29.3 million of restructuring and related charges for Fiscal
      2006 associated with the restructuring plans of the Constellation Wines segment.
      Restructuring and related charges resulted from (i) the further realignment
      of
      business operations and the Company’s plan to exit the commodity concentrate
      product line in the U.S., both announced during fiscal 2004, (the “Fiscal 2004
      Plan”), (ii) the Robert Mondavi Plan, and (iii) the Fiscal 2006 Plan.
      Restructuring and related charges recorded in connection with the Fiscal 2004
      Plan included $0.7 million of employee termination benefit costs and $1.3
      million of facility consolidation and relocation costs. Restructuring and
      related charges recorded in connection with the Robert Mondavi Plan included
      $1.6 million of employee termination benefit costs, $0.7 million of contract
      termination costs and $0.5 million of facility consolidation and relocation
      costs. Restructuring and related charges recorded in connection with the Fiscal
      2006 Plan included $24.3 million of employee termination benefit costs and
      $0.2
      million of facility consolidation and relocation costs. In addition, in
      connection with the Fiscal 2006 Plan, the Company recorded (i) $13.4 million
      of
      accelerated depreciation costs in connection with the Company’s investment in
      new assets and reconfiguration of certain existing assets under the plan and
      (ii) $0.1 million of other related costs which were recorded in the cost of
      product sold line and the selling, general and administrative expenses line,
      respectively, within the Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company recorded
      $7.6 million of restructuring and related charges for Fiscal 2005 associated
      with the Fiscal 2004 Plan and the Robert Mondavi Plan.


Acquisition-Related
      Integration Costs

The
      Company recorded $16.8 million of acquisition-related integration costs for
      Fiscal 2006 in connection with the Robert Mondavi Plan. Acquisition-related
      integration costs included $5.3 million of employee-related costs and $11.5
      million of facilities and other one-time costs. The Company recorded $9.4
      million of acquisition-related integration costs for Fiscal 2005 in connection
      with the Robert Mondavi Plan.

Operating
      Income

The
      following table sets forth the operating income (loss) (in millions of dollars)
      by operating segment of the Company for Fiscal 2006 and Fiscal
      2005.

As
      a
      result of the factors discussed above, consolidated operating income increased
      to $666.1 million for Fiscal 2006 from $567.9 million for Fiscal 2005, an
      increase of $98.2 million, or 17%. Acquisition-related integration costs,
      restructuring and related charges and unusual costs of $93.9 million for Fiscal
      2006 consist of certain costs that are excluded by management in their
      evaluation of the results of each operating segment. These costs represent
      restructuring and related charges of $29.3 million associated primarily with
      the
      Fiscal 2006 Plan and the Robert Mondavi Plan; the flow through of adverse grape
      cost, acquisition-related integration costs, and the flow through of inventory
      step-up associated primarily with the Company’s acquisition of Robert Mondavi of
      $23.0 million, $16.8 million, and $7.9 million, respectively; accelerated
      depreciation costs and other charges of $13.4 million and $0.1 million,
      respectively, associated with the Fiscal 2006 Plan; and costs associated with
      professional service fees incurred for due diligence in connection with the
      Company’s evaluation of a potential offer for Allied Domecq of $3.4 million.
      Acquisition-related integration costs, restructuring and related charges and
      unusual costs of $58.8 million for Fiscal 2005 consist of financing costs
      associated with the redemption of the Company’s Senior Subordinated Notes

and
      the
      repayment of the Company’s prior senior credit facility in connection with the
      Robert Mondavi acquisition of $31.7 million

;
      the
      flow through of adverse grape cost and acquisition-related integration costs
      associated with the Robert Mondavi acquisition of $9.8 million and $9.4 million,
      respectively; restructuring and related charges of $7.6 million associated
      with
      the Fiscal 2004 Plan and the Robert Mondavi Plan; and the flow through of
      inventory step-up associated primarily with the acquisition of all of the
      outstanding capital stock of BRL Hardy Limited, now known as Hardy Wine Company
      Limited (the “Hardy Acquisition”) of $6.4 million; partially offset by a net
      gain on the sale of non-strategic assets of $3.1 million and a gain related
      to
      the receipt of a payment associated with the termination of a previously
      announced potential fine wine joint venture of $3.0 million.


Equity
      in Earnings of Equity Method Investees

The
      Company’s equity in earnings of equity method investees decreased to $0.8
      million in Fiscal 2006 from $1.8 million in Fiscal 2005, a decrease of $0.9
      million due primarily to a $5.0 million loss from the Company’s investment in
      Ruffino, partially offset by an increase in earnings of $4.1 million associated
      primarily with the Company’s investment in Opus One as a result of the Robert
      Mondavi acquisition. The $5.0 million loss from the Company’s investment in
      Ruffino is due primarily to the write-down of certain pre-acquisition Ruffino
      inventories.

Interest
      Expense, Net

Interest
      expense, net of interest income of $4.2 million and $2.3 million for Fiscal
      and Fiscal 2005, respectively, increased to $189.7 million for Fiscal 2006
      from
      $137.7 million for Fiscal 2005, an increase of $52.0 million, or 38%. The
      increase resulted primarily from higher average borrowings in Fiscal 2006
      primarily due to the Robert Mondavi acquisition and the investment in Ruffino
      in
      the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005.

Provision
      for Income Taxes

The
      Company’s effective tax rate was 31.8% for Fiscal 2006 and 36.0% for Fiscal
      2005, a decrease of 4.2%. This decrease was primarily due to a non-cash
      reduction in the Company’s provision for income taxes of $16.2 million, or 3.4%,
      as a result of adjustments to income tax accruals in connection with the
      completion of various income tax examinations plus the income tax benefit the
      Company recorded under the repatriation provisions of the “American Jobs
      Creation Act of 2004” in connection with distributions of certain foreign
      earnings.

Net
      Income

As
      a
      result of the above factors, net income increased to $

325.3

million
      for Fiscal 2006 from $276.5 million for Fiscal 2005, an increase of
      $

48.8

million,
      or 18%.

Financial
      Liquidity and Capital Resources

General

The
      Company’s principal use of cash in its operating activities is for purchasing
      and carrying inventories and carrying seasonal accounts receivable. The
      Company’s primary source of liquidity has historically been cash flow from
      operations, except during annual grape harvests when the Company has relied
      on
      short-term borrowings. In the United States, the annual grape crush normally
      begins in August and runs through October. In Australia, the annual grape crush
      normally begins in February and runs through May. The Company generally begins
      taking delivery of grapes at the beginning of the crush season with payments
      for
      such grapes beginning to come due one month later. The Company’s short-term
      borrowings to support such purchases generally reach their highest levels one
      to
      two months after the crush season has ended. Historically, the Company has
      used
      cash flow from operating activities to repay its short-term borrowings and
      fund
      capital expenditures. The Company will continue to use its short-term borrowings
      to support its working capital requirements. The Company believes that cash
      provided by operating activities and its financing activities, primarily
      short-term borrowings, will provide adequate resources to satisfy its working
      capital, scheduled principal and interest payments on debt, and anticipated
      capital expenditure requirements for both its short-term and long-term capital
      needs.


Fiscal
      2007 Cash Flows

Operating
      Activities

Net
      cash
      provided by operating activities for Fiscal 2007 was $313.2 million, which
      resulted from $331.9 million of net income, plus $199.8 million of net non-cash
      items charged to the Consolidated Statement of Income, less $163.4 million
      representing the net change in the Company’s operating assets and liabilities
      and $55.1 million of proceeds from maturity of derivative instrument reflected
      in investing activities.

The
      net
      non-cash items consisted primarily of depreciation of property, plant and
      equipment, the deferred tax provision and equity in earnings of equity method
      investments. The net change in operating assets and liabilities resulted
      primarily from a decrease in other accrued expenses and liabilities of $157.2
      million and an increase in inventories of $85.1 million, partially offset by
      a
      decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $44.3 million. The
      decrease in other accrued expenses and liabilities is primarily due to the
      settlement of an outstanding marketing accrual in connection with the Company’s
      prior Mexican beers distribution agreement, settlement of restructuring
      accruals, increased income tax payments, and payments of non-recurring
      liabilities assumed in connection with the Vincor acquisition. The increase
      in
      inventories was primarily due to the build-up of the imported beer inventories
      prior to the Company’s contribution of the beer business to Crown Imports. As
      Crown Imports began selling and importing under the Importer Agreement

in
      the 50
      states of the United States of America, the District of Columbia and Guam on
      January 2, 2007, i

t
      was
      necessary to increase inventory levels in order to ensure there were adequate
      inventory levels to support the additional territories. The decrease in prepaid
      expenses and other current assets is primarily due to a decrease in prepaid
      marketing expense due to the settlement of the outstanding marketing accrual
      in
      connection with the Company’s prior Mexican beers distribution agreement noted
      above.

Investing
      Activities

Net
      cash
      used in investing activities for Fiscal 2007 was $1,197.1 million, which
      resulted primarily from $1,093.7 million for the purchase of a business and
      $192.0 million of capital expenditures, partially offset by $55.1 million of
      proceeds from maturity of derivative instrument entered into to fix the U.S.
      dollar cost of the acquisition of Vincor.

Financing
      Activities

Net
      cash
      provided by financing activities for Fiscal 2007 was $925.2 million resulting
      primarily from proceeds from issuance of long-term debt of $3,705.4 million,
      net
      proceeds of $63.4 million from the exercise of employee stock options and net
      proceeds of $47.1 million from notes payable partially offset by principal
      payments of long-term debt of $2,786.9 million and purchases of treasury stock
      of $100.0 million.

Fiscal
      2006 Cash Flows

Operating
      Activities

Net
      cash
      provided by operating activities for Fiscal 2006 was $436.0 million, which
      resulted from $325.3 million of net income, plus $167.2 million of net non-cash
      items charged to the Consolidated Statements of Income and $48.8 million of
      cash
      proceeds credited to accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) within the
      Consolidated Balance Sheet, less $105.2 million representing the net change
      in
      the Company’s operating assets and liabilities.


The
      net
      non-cash items consisted primarily of depreciation of property, plant and
      equipment and deferred tax provision. The cash proceeds credited to AOCI
      consisted of $30.3 million in proceeds from the unwinding of certain interest
      rate swaps (see discussion below under Senior Credit Facilities) and $18.5
      million in proceeds from the early termination of certain foreign currency
      derivative instruments related to the Company’s change in its structure of
      certain of its cash flow hedges of forecasted foreign currency denominated
      transactions. As the forecasted transactions are still probable, this amount
      was
      recorded to AOCI and will be reclassified from AOCI into earnings in the same
      periods in which the original hedged items are recorded in the Consolidated
      Statements of Income. The net change in operating assets and liabilities
      resulted primarily from an increase in inventories of $121.9 million and
      decreases in restructuring accruals and accrued advertising and promotion of
      $31.8 million and $19.2 million, respectively, partially offset by a decrease
      in
      accounts receivable of $44.2 million. The increase in inventories was due
      primarily to higher than expected yields for the 2005 calendar grape harvests
      for both the U.S. and Australia. The decreases in restructuring accruals and
      accrued advertising and promotion accruals were primarily due to timing of
      cash
      payments. The decrease in accounts receivable was due primarily to efforts
      in
      the Company’s U.K. business to reduce the number of days sales outstanding in
      its accounts receivables.

Investing
      Activities

Net
      cash
      used in investing activities for Fiscal 2006 was $15.6 million, which resulted
      primarily from $132.5 million of capital expenditures and net cash paid of
      $45.9
      million for purchases of businesses, partially offset by $173.5 million of
      net
      proceeds from sales of assets, equity method investment, and businesses,
      primarily attributable to sales of non-strategic Robert Mondavi
      assets.

Financing
      Activities

Net
      cash
      used in financing activities for Fiscal 2006 was $426.2 million resulting
      primarily from principal payments of long-term debt of $527.6 million partially
      offset by net proceeds of $63.8 million from notes payable and $31.5 million
      of
      proceeds from employee stock option exercises.

Share
      Repurchase Programs

During
        February 2006, the Company’s Board of Directors replenished a June 1998 Board of
        Directors authorization to repurchase up to $100.0 million of the Company’s
        Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock. During Fiscal 2007, the Company
        repurchased 3,894,978 shares of Class A Common Stock at an aggregate cost
        of
        $100.0 million, or at an average cost of $25.67 per share. The Company used
        revolver borrowings under the June 2006 Credit Agreement to pay the
        purchase price for these shares. No shares were repurchased during Fiscal
        or Fiscal 2005. During February 2007, the Company’s Board of Directors
        authorized the repurchase of up to $500.0 million of the Company’s Class A
        Common Stock and Class B Common Stock.

Between
        the end of Fiscal 2007 and

April
        27,
        2007, the Company repurchased 2,457,200 shares of Class A Common Stock
        pursuant to this authorization in open market transactions.

The
        aggregate cost of these shares was $55.1 million, or an average cost of $22.44
        per share.

The
        Company used revolver borrowings under the 2006 Credit Agreement to pay the
        purchase price for these shares.

The
        Company may finance future share repurchases through cash generated
        from operations or through revolver borrowings under the 2006 Credit
        Agreement.

The
        repurchased shares will become treasury shares.


Debt

Total
      debt outstanding as of February 28, 2007, amounted to $4,185.5

million,
      an increase of $1,375.7

million
      from February 28, 2006. The ratio of total debt to total capitalization
      increased to

55.1

%
      as of
      February 28, 2007, from 48.6% as of February 28, 2006,

primarily
      as a result of the additional borrowings in the second quarter of fiscal 2007
      to
      finance the acquisition of Vincor.

If
      the
      Company’s financing of the Svedka Acquisition, the repurchase of shares and the
      proceeds from the Matthew Clark joint venture had occurred as
      of February 28, 2007, the Company’s ratio of total debt to total
      capitalization would have increased to 56.9%.

Senior
      Credit Facility

      Credit Agreement

In
      connection with the acquisition of Vincor, on June 5, 2006, the Company and
      certain of its U.S. subsidiaries, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as a lender and
      administrative agent, and certain other agents, lenders, and financial
      institutions entered into a new credit agreement

(the
      “June 2006 Credit Agreement”). On February 23, 2007, the June 2006 Credit
      Agreement was amended (the “February Amendment”). The June 2006 Credit Agreement
      together with the February Amendment is referred to as the “2006 Credit
      Agreement”.

The 2006 Credit Agreement provides for aggregate
      credit facilities of $3.9 billion, consisting of a $1.2 billion tranche A term
      loan facility due in June 2011, a $1.8 billion tranche B term loan facility
      due
      in June 2013, and a $900 million revolving credit facility (including a
      sub-facility for letters of credit of up to $200 million) which terminates
      in
      June 2011. Proceeds of the June 2006 Credit Agreement were used to pay off
      the Company’s obligations under its prior senior credit facility, to fund the
      acquisition of Vincor and to repay certain indebtedness of Vincor. The Company
      uses its revolving credit facility under the 2006 Credit Agreement for general
      corporate purposes, including working capital, on an as needed
      basis.

The
      tranche A term loan facility and the tranche B term loan facility were fully
      drawn on June 5, 2006. In August 2006, the Company used proceeds from the August
      2006 Senior Notes (as defined below) to repay $180.0 million of the tranche
      A
      term loan and $200.0 million of the tranche B term loan. In addition, the
      Company prepaid an additional $100.0 million on the tranche B term loan in
      August 2006. As of February 28, 2007, the required principal repayments of
      the
      tranche A term loan and the tranche B term loan for each of the five succeeding
      fiscal years and thereafter are as follows:

The
      rate
      of interest on borrowings under the 2006 Credit Agreement is a function of
      LIBOR
      plus a margin, the federal funds rate plus a margin, or the prime rate plus
      a
      margin. The margin is fixed with respect to the tranche B term loan facility
      and
      is adjustable based upon the Company’s debt ratio (as defined in the 2006 Credit
      Agreement) with respect to the tranche A term loan facility and the revolving
      credit facility. As of February 28, 2007, the LIBOR margin for the revolving
      credit facility and the tranche A term loan facility is 1.25%, while the LIBOR
      margin on the tranche B term loan facility is 1.50%.


The
      February Amendment amended the June 2006 Credit Agreement to, among other
      things, (i) increase the revolving credit facility from $500.0 million to $900.0
      million, which increased the aggregate credit facilities from $3.5 billion
      to
      $3.9 billion; (ii) increase the aggregate amount of cash payments the Company
      is
      permitted to make in respect or on account of its capital stock; (iii) remove
      certain limitations on the application of proceeds from the incurrence of senior
      unsecured indebtedness; (iv) increase the maximum permitted total “Debt Ratio”
and decrease the required minimum “Interest Coverage Ratio”; and (v) eliminate
      the “Senior Debt Ratio” covenant and the “Fixed Charges Ratio”
covenant.

The
      Company’s obligations are guaranteed by certain of its U.S. subsidiaries. These
      obligations are also secured by a pledge of (i) 100% of the ownership interests
      in certain of the Company’s U.S. subsidiaries and (ii) 65% of the voting capital
      stock of certain of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries.

The
      Company and its subsidiaries are also subject to covenants that are contained
      in
      the 2006 Credit Agreement, including those restricting the incurrence of
      additional indebtedness (including guarantees of indebtedness), additional
      liens, mergers and consolidations, disposition or acquisition of property,
      the
      payment of dividends, transactions with affiliates and the making of certain
      investments, in each case subject to numerous conditions, exceptions and
      thresholds. The financial covenants are limited to maximum total debt coverage
      ratio and minimum interest coverage ratio.

As
      of
      February 28, 2007, under the 2006 Credit Agreement, the Company had outstanding
      tranche A term loans of $1.0 billion bearing an interest rate of 6.6%, tranche
      B
      term loans of $1.5 billion bearing an interest rate of 6.9%, revolving loans
      of
      $30.0 million bearing an interest rate of 6.6%, outstanding letters of credit
      of
      $50.9 million, and $819.1 million in revolving loans available to be
      drawn.

As
      of
      April 27, 2007, reflecting the Company's activities subsequent to February
      28,
      2007, the Company had outstanding tranche A term loans of $1.0 billion bearing
      an interest rate of 6.6%, tranche B term loans of $1.5 billion bearing an
      interest rate of 6.9%, revolving loans of $337.5 million bearing an interest
      rate of 6.6%, outstanding letters of credit of $40.7 million, and $521.8 million
      in revolving loans available to be drawn, under the 2006 Credit
      Agreement.

In
      March
      2005, the Company replaced its then outstanding five year interest rate swap
      agreements with new five year delayed start interest rate swap agreements
      effective March 1, 2006, which are outstanding as of February 28, 2007. These
      delayed start interest rate swap agreements extended the original hedged period
      through fiscal 2010. The swap agreements fixed LIBOR interest rates on $1,200.0
      million of the Company’s floating LIBOR rate debt at an average rate of 4.1%
      over the five year term. The Company received $30.3 million in proceeds from
      the
      unwinding of the original swaps. This amount will be reclassified from
      Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (“AOCI”) ratably into earnings in the
      same period in which the original hedged item is recorded in the Consolidated
      Statements of Income. For Fiscal 2007 and Fiscal 2006, the Company reclassified

$5.9

million
      and

$3.6

million,
      respectively, from AOCI to Interest Expense, net in the Company’s Consolidated
      Statements of Income. This non-cash operating activity is included in the Other,
      net line in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Senior
      Notes

On
      August
      4, 1999, the Company issued $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of 8
      5/8%
      Senior Notes due August 2006 (the “August 1999 Senior Notes”). On August 1,
      2006, the Company repaid the August 1999 Senior Notes with proceeds from its
      revolving credit facility under the June 2006 Credit
      Agreement.


As
      of
      February 28, 2007, the Company had outstanding £1.0 million ($2.0 million)
      aggregate principal amount of 8 1/2% Series B Senior Notes due November 2009
      (the “Sterling Series B Senior Notes”). In addition, as of February 28, 2007,
      the Company had outstanding £154.0 million ($302.1 million, net of $0.3 million
      unamortized discount) aggregate principal amount of 8 1/2% Series C Senior
      Notes
      due November 2009 (the “Sterling Series C Senior Notes”). The Sterling Series B
      Senior Notes and Sterling Series C Senior Notes are currently redeemable, in
      whole or in part, at the option of the Company.

Also,
      as
      of February 28, 2007, the Company had outstanding $200.0 million aggregate
      principal amount of 8% Senior Notes due February 2008 (the “February 2001 Senior
      Notes”). The February 2001 Senior Notes are currently redeemable, in whole or in
      part, at the option of the Company.

On
      August
      15, 2006, the Company issued $700.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7
      1/4%

Senior
      Notes due September 2016 at an issuance price of $693.1 million (net of $6.9
      million unamortized discount, with an effective interest rate of 7.4%) (the
      “August 2006 Senior Notes”). The net proceeds of the offering (

$685.6

million)
      were used to reduce a corresponding amount of borrowings under the Company’s
      June 2006 Credit Agreement. Interest on the August 2006 Senior Notes is payable
      semiannually on March 1 and September 1 of each year, beginning March 1, 2007.
      The August 2006 Senior Notes are redeemable, in whole or in part, at the option
      of the Company at any time at a redemption price equal to 100% of the
      outstanding principal amount and a make whole payment based on the present
      value
      of the future payments at the adjusted Treasury rate plus 50 basis points.
      The
      August 2006 Senior Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally
      in
      right of payment to all existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness of
      the
      Company. Certain of the Company’s significant operating subsidiaries guarantee
      the August 2006 Senior Notes, on a senior basis. As of February 28, 2007, the
      Company had outstanding $693.4 million (net of $6.6 million unamortized
      discount) aggregate principal amount of August 2006 Senior Notes.

Senior
      Subordinated Notes

As
      of
      February 28, 2007, the Company had outstanding $250.0 million aggregate
      principal amount of 8 1/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due January 2012 (the
      “January 2002 Senior Subordinated Notes”). The January 2002 Senior Subordinated
      Notes are currently redeemable, in whole or in part, at the option of the
      Company.

Subsidiary
      Credit Facilities

In
      addition to the above arrangements, the Company has additional credit
      arrangements totaling $386.1 million as of February 28, 2007. These arrangements
      primarily support the financing needs of the Company’s domestic and foreign
      subsidiary operations. Interest rates and other terms of these borrowings vary
      from country to country, depending on local market conditions. As of February
      28, 2007, and February 28, 2006, amounts outstanding under these arrangements
      were $188.0 million and $69.8 million, respectively.


Contractual
      Obligations and Commitments

The
        following table sets forth information about the Company’s long-term contractual
        obligations outstanding at February 28, 2007. It brings tog

ether
        data for easy reference from the consolidated balance sheet and from individual
        notes to the Company’s consolidated financial statements. See Notes 8, 9, 11,
        12, 13 and 14 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements
        locat

ed
        in
        Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for detailed discussion of items
        noted
        in the following table.

(1)

Interest
                  payments on notes payable to banks include interest on both revolving
                  loans under the Company’s senior credit facility and on foreign subsidiary
                  facilities. The weighted average interest rate on the revolving
                  loans
                  under the Company’s senior credit facility was 6.6% as of February 28,
                  2007. Interest rates on foreign subsidiary facilities range from
                  1.8% to
                  9.2% as of February 28, 2007.

(2)

Interest
                  rates on long-term debt obligations range from 6.4% to 8.5%. Interest
                  payments on long-term debt obligations include amounts associated
                  with the
                  Company’s outstanding interest rate swap agreements to fix LIBOR interest
                  rates on $1,200.0 million of the Company’s floating LIBOR rate debt.
                  Interest payments on long-term debt do not include interest related
                  to
                  capital lease obligations or certain foreign credit arrangements,
                  which
                  represent approximately 1.6% of the Company’s total long-term debt, as
                  amounts are not material.

(3)

Total
                  unconditional purchase obligations consist of $26.0

million
                  for contracts to purchase various spirits over the next

six

fiscal years, $2,182.2 million for contracts to purchase grapes
                  over the
                  next eighteen fiscal years, $82.5 million for contracts to purchase
                  bulk
                  wine over the next four fiscal years and $30.0 million for processing
                  contracts over the next four

fiscal
                  years. See Note 14 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements
                  located in Item 8 of this Annual Repo

rt
                  on Form 10-K for a detailed discussion of these
                  items.


Capital
      Expenditures

During
      Fiscal 2007, the Company incurred $192.0 million for capital expenditures.
      The
      Company plans to spend approximately $165 million for capital expenditures
      in
      Fiscal 2008.

In
      addition, the Company continues to consider the purchase, lease and development
      of vineyards and may incur additional expenditures for vineyards if
      opportunities become available. See “Business - Sources and Availability of Raw
      Materials” under Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management reviews
      the capital expenditure program periodically and modifies it as required to
      meet
      current business needs.

Effects
      of Inflation and Changing Prices

The
      Company’s results of operations and financial condition have not been
      significantly affected by inflation and changing prices. The Company has been
      able, subject to normal competitive conditions, to pass along rising costs
      through increased selling prices and identifying on-going cost savings
      initiatives. There can be no assurances, however, that the Company will continue
      to be able to pass along rising costs through increased selling
      prices.

Critical
      Accounting Policies

The
      Company’s significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to
      the Company’s consolidated financial statements located in Item 8 of this Annual
      Report on Form 10-K. However, certain of the Company’s accounting policies are
      particularly important to the portrayal of the Company’s financial position and
      results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by
      the
      Company’s management; as a result they are subject to an inherent degree of
      uncertainty. In applying those policies, the Company’s management uses its
      judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the
      determination of certain estimates. Those estimates are based on the Company’s
      historical experience, the Company’s observance of trends in the industry,
      information provided by the Company’s customers and information available from
      other outside sources, as appropriate. On an ongoing basis, the Company reviews
      its estimates to ensure that they appropriately reflect changes in the Company’s
      business. The Company’s critical accounting policies include:

·

Accounting
                for promotional activities.

Sales
                reflect reductions attributable to consideration given to customers
                in
                various customer incentive programs, including pricing discounts
                on single
                transactions, volume discounts, promotional and advertising allowances,
                coupons, and rebates. Certain customer incentive programs require
                management to estimate the cost of those programs. The accrued liability
                for these programs is determined through analysis of programs offered,
                historical trends, expectations regarding customer and consumer
                participation, sales and payment trends, and experience with payment
                patterns associated with similar programs that had been previously
                offered. If assumptions included in the Company’s estimates were to change
                or market conditions were to change, then material incremental reductions
                to revenue could be required, which would have a material adverse
                impact
                on the Company’s financial statements. Promotional costs were $635.6
                million, $501.9 million and $390.9 million for Fiscal 2007, Fiscal
                and Fiscal 2005, respectively. Accrued promotion costs were $150.3
                million
                and $135.4 million as of February 28, 2007, and February 28, 2006,
                respectively.


·

Inventory
                valuation.

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, cost being
                determined on the first-in, first-out method. The Company assesses
                the
                valuation of its inventories and reduces the carrying value of those
                inventories that are obsolete or in excess of the Company’s forecasted
                usage to their estimated net realizable value. The Company estimates
                the
                net realizable value of such inventories based on analyses and assumptions
                including, but not limited to, historical usage, future demand and
                market
                requirements. Reductions to the carrying value of inventories are
                recorded
                in cost of product sold. If the future demand for the Company’s products
                is less favorable than the Company’s forecasts, then the value of the
                inventories may be required to be reduced, which could result in
                material
                additional expense to the Company and have a material adverse impact
                on
                the Company’s financial statements. Inventories were $1,948.1 million and
                $1,704.4 million as of February 28, 2007, and February 28, 2006,
                respectively.

·

Accounting
                for business combinations.

The acquisition of businesses is an important element of the Company’s
                strategy. Under the purchase method, the Company is required to record
                the
                net assets acquired at the estimated fair value at the date of
                acquisition. The determination of the fair value of the assets acquired
                and liabilities assumed requires the Company to make estimates and
                assumptions that affect the Company’s financial statements. For example,
                the Company’s acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other
                intangible assets; the value and estimated life of those assets may
                affect
                the amount of future period amortization expense for intangible assets
                with finite lives as well as possible impairment charges that may
                be
                incurred. Amortization expense for amortizable intangible assets
                was $2.8
                million, $1.9 million and $2.8 million for Fiscal 2007, Fiscal 2006
                and
                Fiscal 2005, respectively. Amortizable intangible assets were $39.3
                million and $11.9 million as of February 28, 2007, and February 28,
                2006,
                respectively.

Impairment
                of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives.

Intangible assets with indefinite lives consist primarily of trademarks
                as
                well as agency relationships. The Company is required to analyze
                its
                goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment
                on an annual basis as well as when events and circumstances indicate
                that
                an impairment may have occurred. Certain factors that may occur and
                indicate that an impairment exists include, but are not limited to,
                operating results that are lower than expected and adverse industry
                or
                market economic trends. The impairment testing requires management
                to
                estimate the fair value of the assets or reporting unit and record
                an
                impairment loss for the excess of the carrying value over the fair
                value.
                The estimate of fair value of the assets is generally determined
                on the
                basis of discounted future cash flows. The estimate of fair value
                of the
                reporting unit is generally determined on the basis of discounted
                future
                cash flows supplemented by the market approach. In estimating the
                fair
                value, management must make assumptions and projections regarding
                such
                items as future cash flows, future revenues, future earnings and
                other
                factors. The assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are generally
                consistent with the past performance of each reporting unit and other
                intangible assets and are also consistent with the projections and
                assumptions that are used in current operating plans. Such assumptions
                are
                subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive
                conditions. If these estimates or their related assumptions change
                in the
                future, the Company may be required to record an impairment loss
                for these
                assets. The recording of any resulting impairment loss could have
                a
                material adverse impact on the Company’s financial statements. The most
                significant assumptions used in the discounted future cash flows
                calculation to determine the fair value of the Company’s reporting units
                and the fair value of intangible assets with indefinite lives in
                connection with impairment testing are: (i) the discount rate, (ii)
                the
                expected long-term growth rate and (iii) the annual cash flow projections.
                If the Company used a discount rate that was 50 basis points higher
                or
                used an expected long-term growth rate that was 50 basis points lower
                or
                used annual cash flow projections that were 100 basis points lower
                in its
                impairment testing of goodwill, then each change individually would
                not
                have resulted in the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting
                unit, including its goodwill, exceeding the fair value. If the Company
                used a discount rate that was 50 basis points higher or used an expected
                long-term growth rate that was 50 basis points lower or used annual
                cash
                flow projections that were 100 basis points lower in its impairment
                testing of intangible assets with indefinite lives, then the changes
                individually, for only the discount rate and the expected long-term
                growth
                rate, would have resulted in only one unit of accounting’s carrying value
                exceeding the fair value by an immaterial amount. For this sensitivity
                analysis, the Company excluded reporting units and units of accounting
                acquired during Fiscal 2007 and reporting units disposed of after
                the
                annual testing date.

The
      Company recorded an immaterial impairment loss for Fiscal 2007 for intangible
      assets with indefinite lives associated with assets held-for-sale. No impairment
      loss was recorded in Fiscal 2006 and Fiscal 2005. With regard to goodwill,
      no
      impairment loss was recorded in Fiscal 2007, Fiscal 2006 and Fiscal 2005.
      Intangible assets with indefinite lives were $1,096.1 million and $872.0 million
      as of February 28, 2007, and February 28, 2006, respectively. Goodwill was
      $3,083.9 million and $2,193.6 million as of February 28, 2007, and February
      28,
      2006, respectively.

Accounting
                for Stock-Based Compensation.

The
                Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No.
                123(R)
                using the modified prospective transition method on March 1, 2006.
                Under
                the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), stock-based
                compensation cost is calculated at the grant date based on the fair
                value
                of the award and is recognized as expense, net of estimated pre-vesting
                forfeitures, ratably over the vesting period of the award. In addition,
                SFAS No. 123(R) requires additional accounting related to the income
                tax
                effects and disclosure regarding the cash flow effects resulting
                from
                stock-based payment arrangements. In March 2005, the Securities and
                Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, which
                provided supplemental implementation guidance for SFAS No. 123(R).
                The
                Company selected the Black-Scholes option-pricing model as the most
                appropriate fair value method for its awards granted after March
                1, 2006.
                The calculation of fair value of stock-based awards requires the
                input of
                assumptions, including the expected term of the stock-based awards
                and the
                associated stock price volatility. The assumptions used in calculating
                the
                fair value of stock-based awards represent the Company’s best estimates,
                but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application
                of
                management judgment. As a result, if factors change and the Company
                uses
                different assumptions, then stock-based compensation expense could
                be
                materially different in the future. If the Company used an expected
                term
                of the stock-based awards that was one year longer, the fair value
                of the
                stock-based awards would have increased by $5.9 million, resulting
                in an
                increase of $1.2 million of stock-based compensation expense for
                Fiscal
                2007. If the Company used an expected term of the stock-based awards
                that
                was one year shorter, the fair value of the stock-based awards would
                have
                decreased by $6.3 million, resulting in a decrease of $1.3 million
                of
                stock-based compensation expense for Fiscal 2007. The total amount
                of
                stock-based compensation recognized under SFAS 123(R) was $18.1 million
                for Fiscal 2007, of which $16.5 million was expensed for Fiscal 2007
                and
                $1.6 million was capitalized in inventory as of February 28,
                2007.

Accounting
      Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted

In
      July
      2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued FASB
      Interpretation No. 48 (“FIN No. 48”), “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
      Taxes - an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109.” FIN No. 48 clarifies the
      accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s
      financial statements in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109. FIN No. 48
      prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial
      statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to
      be
      taken in a tax return. Additionally, FIN No. 48 provides guidance on
      derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim
      periods, disclosure and transition. The Company is required to adopt FIN No.
      for fiscal years beginning March 1, 2007, with the cumulative effect of applying
      the provisions of FIN No. 48 reported as an adjustment to opening retained
      earnings.

The
      Company is continuing to evaluate the financial impact of adopting FIN No.
      48 on
      its consolidated financial statements. However, the Company does not expect
      the
      adoption of FIN No. 48 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial
      statements.


In
      September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
      No.
      157 (“SFAS No. 157”), “Fair Value Measurements.” SFAS No. 157 defines fair
      value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted
      accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
      SFAS No. 157 emphasizes that fair value is a market-based measurement, not
      an
      entity-specific measurement, and states that a fair value measurement should
      be
      determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing
      the asset or liability. The Company is required to adopt SFAS No. 157 for fiscal
      years and interim periods beginning March 1, 2008. The Company is currently
      assessing the financial impact of SFAS No. 157 on its consolidated financial
      statements.

In
      September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
      No.
      158 (“SFAS No. 158”), “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
      Other Postretirement Plans - an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106,
      and 132(R).” SFAS No. 158 requires companies to recognize the overfunded or
      underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan (other than a
      multiemployer plan) as an asset or liability in its balance sheet and to
      recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur
      through comprehensive income. The Company has adopted this provision of SFAS
      No.
      158 and has provided the required disclosures as of February 28, 2007. SFAS
      No.
      158 also requires companies to measure the funded status of a plan as of the
      date of the company’s fiscal year-end (with limited exceptions), which provision
      the Company is required to adopt as of February 28, 2009. The Company does
      not
      expect the adoption of the remaining provision of SFAS No. 158 to have a
      material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

In
        February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
        No.
        159 (“SFAS No. 159”), “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
        Liabilities - Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115.” SFAS No. 159
        permits companies to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain
        other items at fair value. Most of the provisions in SFAS No. 159 are elective;
        however, the amendment to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
        115,
“Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities”

,

applies
        to all entities with available-for-sale and trading securities. The fair
        value
        option established by SFAS No. 159 allows companies to choose to measure
        eligible items at fair value at specified election dates. The Company will
        report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option
        has
        been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. The fair value
        option: (i) may be applied instrument by instrument, with a few exceptions,
        such
        as investments otherwise accounted for by the equity method; (ii) is irrevocable
        (unless a new election date occurs); and (iii) is applied only to entire
        instruments and not to portions of instruments. The Company is required to
        adopt
        SFAS No. 159 for fiscal years beginning after February 28, 2009. The Company
        does not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 159 to have a material impact on
        its
        consolidated financial statements.


Item
      7A.

Quantitative
      and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

The
      Company, as a result of its global operating, acquisition and financing
      activities, is exposed to market risk associated with changes in foreign
      currency exchange rates and interest rates. To manage the volatility relating
      to
      these risks, the Company periodically purchases and/or sells derivative
      instruments including foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate
      swap
      agreements. The Company uses derivative instruments solely to reduce the
      financial impact of these risks and does not use derivative instruments for
      trading purposes.

Foreign
      currency forward contracts are or may be used to hedge existing foreign currency
      denominated assets and liabilities, forecasted foreign currency denominated
      sales both to third parties as well as intercompany sales, intercompany
      principal and interest payments, and in connection with acquisitions or joint
      venture investments outside the U.S. As of February 28, 2007, the Company had
      exposures to foreign currency risk primarily related to the Australian dollar,
      euro, New Zealand dollar, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar and Mexican
      peso.

As
      of
      February 28, 2007, and February 28, 2006, the Company had outstanding foreign
      exchange derivative instruments with a notional value of $2,383.3 million and
      $1,254.7 million

,

respectively. Approximately 69% of the Company’s total exposures were hedged as
      of February 28, 2007. Using a sensitivity analysis based on estimated fair
      value
      of open contracts using forward rates, if the contract base currency had been
      10% weaker as of February 28, 2007, and February 28, 2006, the fair value of
      open foreign exchange contracts would have been decreased by $161.8 million
      and
      $77.5 million, respectively. Losses or gains from the revaluation or settlement
      of the related underlying positions would substantially offset such gains or
      losses on the derivative instruments.

The
      fair
      value of fixed rate debt is subject to interest rate risk, credit risk and
      foreign currency risk. The estimated fair value of the Company’s total fixed
      rate debt, including current maturities, was $1,589.3 million and $1,010.5
      million as of February 28, 2007

,
      and
      February 28, 2006, respectively. A hypothetical 1% increase from prevailing
      interest rates as of February 28, 2007,

and
      February 28, 2006, would have resulted in a decrease in fair value of fixed
      interest rate long-term debt by $69.6 million

and

$26.9
      million,

respectively.

As
      of
      February 28, 2007, and February 28, 2006, the Company had outstanding interest
      rate swap agreements to minimize interest rate volatility. The swap agreements
      fix LIBOR interest rates on $1,200.0 million of the Company’s floating LIBOR
      rate debt at an average rate of 4.1% over the five year term. A hypothetical
      1%
      increase from prevailing interest rates as of

February
      28, 2007, and February 28, 2006, would have increased the fair value of the
      interest rate swaps by $36.7 million and $43.8 million,
      respectively.

In
      addition

to
      the
      $1,589.3 million and $1,010.5 million estimated fair value of fixed

rate
      debt outstanding as of February 28, 2007, and February 28, 2006, respectively,
      the Company also had variable rate debt

outstanding
      (primarily LIBOR based) as of February 28, 2007, and February 28, 2006, of
      $2,688.7 million and $1,856.1 million, respectively. Using a sensitivity
      analysis based on a hypothetical 1% increase in prevailing interest rates
      over

a
      12-month

period,
      the approximate increase in cash required for interest as of February 28, 2007,
      and February 28, 2006, is $26.9 million and $18.6 million,
      respectively.

The
      Board
      of Directors and Stockholders

Constellation
      Brands, Inc.:

We
      have
      audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Constellation Brands,
      Inc. and subsidiaries as of February 28, 2007 and 2006, and the related
      consolidated statements of income, changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash
      flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended February 28, 2007.
      These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s
      management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
      financial statements based on our audits.

We
      conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
      Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
      plan
      and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
      statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining,
      on a
      test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
      statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used
      and
      significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
      financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
      reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
      our
      opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly,
      in all material respects, the financial position of Constellation Brands, Inc.
      and subsidiaries as of February 28, 2007 and 2006, and the results of their
      operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period
      ended February 28, 2007, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
      principles.

As
      discussed in Note 1, effective March 1, 2006, the Company adopted Statement
      of
      Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R),

Share-Based
      Payment

.

We
      also
      have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
      Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of Constellation Brands,
      Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of February 28, 2007, based
      on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the
      Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and
      our
      report dated April 30, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on management’s
      assessment of, and the effective operation of, internal control over financial
      reporting.

Report
      of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The
      Board
      of Directors and Stockholders

Constellation
      Brands, Inc.:

We
      have
      audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s
      Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that Constellation
      Brands, Inc. maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
      as
      of February 28, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal
      Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
      of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Constellation Brands, Inc.’s management is
      responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
      and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
      reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s
      assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control
      over financial reporting based on our audit.

We
      conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
      Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
      plan
      and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
      internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
      respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
      over
      financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating
      the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
      such
      other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
      that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
      company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
      provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
      and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
      with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over
      financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain
      to
      the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
      reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)
      provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
      permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
      accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
      being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
      of
      the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
      detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s
      assets that could have a material effect on the financial
      statements.

Because
      of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may
      not
      prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
      effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
      inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance
      with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
      our
      opinion, management’s assessment that Constellation Brands, Inc. maintained
      effective internal control over financial reporting as of February 28, 2007,
      is
      fairly stated, in all material respects, based on criteria established in
      Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
      Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Also, in our opinion,
      Constellation Brands, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective
      internal control over financial reporting as of February 28, 2007, based on

criteria
      established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee

of
      Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO)

.


As
      described in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial
      Reporting, management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the system
      of internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal
      Control - Integrated Framework

issued
      by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
      Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Company’s system of
      internal control over financial reporting was effective as of February 28,
      2007.
      This evaluation excluded the internal control over financial reporting of the
      Canadian operations of Vincor International Inc., which the Company acquired
      on
      June 5, 2006. As of February 28, 2007, total assets, net sales and income
      before income taxes of the Canadian operations of Vincor International Inc.
      not
      evaluated with respect to the effectiveness of internal control over financial
      reporting comprised 9.4%, 4.7%, and 3.1% of the consolidated total assets,
      net
      sales, and income before income taxes of the Company. Our audit of internal
      control over financial reporting of Constellation Brands, Inc. also excluded
      an
      evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of the Canadian
      operations of Vincor International Inc.

We
      also
      have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
      Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of
      Constellation Brands, Inc. and subsidiaries as of February 28, 2007 and 2006,
      and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in stockholders’
equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
      February 28, 2007, and our report dated April 30, 2007 expressed an unqualified
      opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

Management’s
      Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management
      of Constellation Brands, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, the “Company”) is
      responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal
      control over financial reporting. This system is designed to provide reasonable
      assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
      of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting
      principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

The
      Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
      procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
      reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
      dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable
      assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation
      of
      financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
      principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made
      only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
      Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
      timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
      Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial
      statements.

Because
      of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial
      reporting can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect
      misstatements. Further, because of changes in conditions, effectiveness of
      internal controls over financial reporting may vary over time. Our system
      contains self-monitoring mechanisms, and actions are taken to correct
      deficiencies as they are identified.

Management
      conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the system of internal control
      over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal
      Control - Integrated Framework

issued
      by
      the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
      Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Company’s system of
      internal control over financial reporting was effective as of February 28,
      2007.
      This evaluation excluded the internal control over financial reporting of the
      Canadian operations of Vincor International Inc., which the Company acquired
      on
      June 5, 2006.

As
      of
      February 28, 2007, total assets, net sales and income before income taxes of
      the
      Canadian operations of Vincor International Inc. not evaluated with respect
      to
      the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting comprised 9.4%,
      4.7%, and 3.1% of the consolidated total assets, net sales, and income before
      income taxes of the Company.

Management’s
      assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial
      reporting has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public
      accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included
      herein.

NOTES
      TO
      CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FEBRUARY

SUMMARY
      OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

Description
      of business -

Constellation
      Brands, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) operate primarily in the
      beverage alcohol industry. The Company is a leading international producer
      and
      marketer of beverage alcohol with a broad portfolio of brands across the wine,
      spirits and imported beer categories. The Company has the largest wine business
      in the world and is the largest multi-category supplier of beverage alcohol
      in
      the United States (“U.S.”); a leading producer and exporter of wine from
      Australia and New Zealand; and both a major producer and independent drinks
      wholesaler in the United Kingdom (“U.K.”). In North America, the Company
      distributes its products through wholesale distributors. In addition, the
      Company imports, markets and sells the Modelo Brands (as defined in Note 7)
      and
      certain other imported beer brands through the Company’s joint venture, Crown
      Imports (as defined in Note 7). In Australia, the Company distributes its
      products directly to off-premise accounts, such as major retail chains,
      on-premise accounts, such as hotels and restaurants, and large wholesalers.
      In
      the U.K., the Company distributes its products directly to off-premise accounts,
      such as major retail chains, and to other wholesalers. Through the Company’s
      U.K. wholesale business, the Company distributes its branded products and those
      of other major drinks companies to on-premise accounts: pubs, clubs, hotels
      and
      restaurants (see Note 24).

Principles
      of consolidation -

The
      consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of the
      Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries and entities in which the Company
      has a controlling financial interest after the elimination of intercompany
      accounts and transactions. The Company has a controlling financial interest
      if
      the Company owns a majority of the outstanding voting common stock or has
      significant control over an entity through contractual or economic interests
      in
      which the Company is the primary beneficiary.

Equity
        investments -

If
        the
        Company is not required to consolidate its investment in another company,
        the
        Company uses the equity method if the Company can exercise significant influence
        over the other company. Under the equity method, investments are carried
        at
        cost, plus or minus the Company’s equity in the increases and decreases in the
        investee’s net assets after the date of acquisition and certain other
        adjustments. The Company’s share of the net income or loss of the investee is
        included in equity in earnings of equity method investees on the Company’s
        Consolidated Statements of Income. Dividends received from the investee reduce
        the carrying amount of the investment. Equity investments are reviewed for
        impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
        carrying amount of the investments may not be recoverable.

Management’s
      use of estimates -

The
      preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
      accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
      that
      affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
      contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
      the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
      Actual results could differ from those estimates.


Revenue
      recognition -

Sales
      are
      recognized when title passes to the customer, which is generally when the
      product is shipped. Amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling are
      classified as sales. Sales reflect reductions attributable to consideration
      given to customers in various customer incentive programs, including pricing
      discounts on single transactions, volume discounts, promotional and advertising
      allowances, coupons, and rebates.

Cost
      of product sold -

The
      types
      of costs included in cost of product sold are raw materials, packaging
      materials, manufacturing costs, plant administrative support and overheads,
      and
      freight and warehouse costs (including distribution network costs). Distribution
      network costs include inbound freight charges and outbound shipping and handling
      costs, purchasing and receiving costs, inspection costs, warehousing and
      internal transfer costs.

Selling,
      general and administrative expenses -

The
      types
      of costs included in selling, general and administrative expenses consist
      predominately of advertising and non-manufacturing administrative and overhead
      costs. Distribution network costs are not included in the Company’s selling,
      general and administrative expenses, but are included in cost of product sold
      as
      described above. The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred, shown
      or
      distributed. Prepaid advertising costs at February 28, 2007, and February 28,
      2006, were not material. Advertising expense for the years ended February 28,
      2007, February 28, 2006, and February 28, 2005, was $182.7 million, $142.4
      million and $139.1 million, respectively.

Foreign

currency
      translation -

The
      “functional currency” for translating the accounts of the Company’s operations
      outside the U.S. is the local currency. The translation from the applicable
      foreign currencies to U.S. dollars is performed for balance sheet accounts
      using
      exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense
      accounts using a weighted average exchange rate for the period. The resulting
      translation adjustments are recorded as a component of Accumulated Other
      Comprehensive Income (Loss) (“AOCI”). Gains or losses resulting from foreign
      currency denominated transactions are included in selling, general and
      administrative expenses in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income.

The
      Company engages in foreign currency denominated transactions with customers
      and
      suppliers, as well as between subsidiaries with different functional currencies.
      Aggregate foreign currency transaction net gains were $9.9 million, $5.1 million
      and $5.3 million for the years ended February 28, 2007, February 28, 2006,
      and
      February 28, 2005, respectively.

Cash
      investments -

Cash
      investments consist of highly liquid investments with an original maturity
      when
      purchased of three months or less and are stated at cost, which approximates
      market value. The amounts at February 28, 2007, and February 28, 2006, are
      not
      significant.

Allowance
      for doubtful accounts -

The
      Company records an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses
      resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. The
      majority of the accounts receivable balance is generated from sales to
      independent distributors with whom the Company has a predetermined collection
      date arranged through electronic funds transfer. The allowance for doubtful
      accounts was $14.4 million and $13.5 million as of February 28, 2007, and
      February 28, 2006, respectively.


Fair
      value of financial instruments -

To
      meet
      the reporting requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
      107, “Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments,” the Company
      calculates the fair value of financial instruments using quoted market prices
      whenever available. When quoted market prices are not available, the Company
      uses standard pricing models for various types of financial instruments (such
      as
      forwards, options, swaps, etc.) which take into account the present value of
      estimated future cash flows.

The
      carrying amount and estimated fair value of the Company’s financial instruments
      are summarized as follows:

The
      following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each
      class of financial instruments:

Cash
      and cash investments, accounts receivable and accounts payable

:
      The
      carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the short maturity of these
      instruments.

Currency
      forward contracts:

The fair
      value is estimated based on quoted market prices.

Interest
      rate swap contracts:

The fair
      value is estimated based on quoted market prices.

Notes
      payable to banks:

These
      instruments are variable interest rate bearing notes for which the carrying
      value approximates the fair value.

Long-term
      debt

:
      The
      senior credit facility is subject to variable interest rates which are
      frequently reset; accordingly, the carrying value of this debt approximates
      its
      fair value. The fair value of the remaining long-term debt, which is all fixed
      rate, is estimated by discounting cash flows using interest rates currently
      available for debt with similar terms and maturities.

Derivative
      instruments -

As
      a
      multinational company, the Company is exposed to market risk from changes in
      foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates that could affect the
      Company’s results of operations and financial condition. The amount of
      volatility realized will vary based upon the effectiveness and level of
      derivative instruments outstanding during a particular period of time, as well
      as the currency and interest rate market movements during that same
      period.


The
      Company enters into derivative instruments, primarily interest rate swaps and
      foreign currency forwards, to manage interest rate and foreign currency risks.
      In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 (“SFAS
      No. 133”), “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as
      amended, the Company recognizes all derivatives as either assets or liabilities
      on the balance sheet and measures those instruments at fair value. The fair
      values of the Company’s derivative instruments change with fluctuations in
      interest rates and/or currency rates and are expected to offset changes in
      the
      values of the underlying exposures. The Company’s derivative instruments are
      held solely to hedge economic exposures. The Company follows strict policies
      to
      manage interest rate and foreign currency risks, including prohibitions on
      derivative market-making or other speculative activities. As of February 28,
      2007, and February 28, 2006, the Company had foreign exchange contracts
      outstanding with a notional value of $2,383.3 million and $1,254.7 million,
      respectively. In addition, as of February 28, 2007, and February 28, 2006,
      the
      Company had interest rate swap agreements outstanding with a notional value
      of
      $1,200.0 million (see Note 9).

To
      qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS No. 133, the details of the hedging
      relationship must be formally documented at inception of the arrangement,
      including the risk management objective, hedging strategy, hedged item, specific
      risk that is being hedged, the derivative instrument, how effectiveness is
      being
      assessed and how ineffectiveness will be measured. The derivative must be highly
      effective in offsetting either changes in the fair value or cash flows, as
      appropriate, of the risk being hedged. Effectiveness is evaluated on a
      retrospective and prospective basis based on quantitative measures.

Certain
      of the Company’s derivative instruments do not qualify for SFAS No. 133 hedge
      accounting treatment; for others, the Company chooses not to maintain the
      required documentation to apply hedge accounting treatment. These instruments
      are used to hedge the Company’s exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign
      currency denominated receivables and payables, foreign currency investments,
      primarily consisting of loans to subsidiaries, and cash flows related primarily
      to repatriation of those loans or investments. Forward contracts, generally
      less
      than 12 months in duration, are used to hedge some of these risks. The Company’s
      derivative policy permits the use of non-SFAS No. 133 hedging when the hedging
      instrument is settled within the fiscal quarter or offsets a recognized balance
      sheet exposure. In these circumstances, the mark to fair value is reported
      currently through earnings in selling, general and administrative expenses
      in
      the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income.

Furthermore, when
      it is determined that a derivative instrument which qualifies for hedge
      accounting treatment is not, or has ceased to be, highly effective as a hedge,
      the Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively. The Company
      discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when (i) the derivative is no longer
      highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of a hedged item;
      (ii)
      the derivative expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised; (iii) it is no
      longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur; or (iv) management
      determines that designating the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer
      appropriate.


Cash
      flow hedges:

The
      Company is exposed to foreign denominated cash flow fluctuations in connection
      with sales to third parties, intercompany sales, and intercompany financing
      arrangements. Foreign currency forward contracts are used to hedge certain
      of
      these risks. In addition, the Company utilizes interest rate swaps to manage
      its
      exposure to changes in interest rates. Derivatives managing the Company’s cash
      flow exposures generally mature within three years or less, with a maximum
      maturity of five years. Throughout the term of the designated cash flow hedge
      relationship, but at least quarterly, a retrospective evaluation and prospective
      assessment of hedge effectiveness is performed. In the event the relationship
      is
      no longer effective, the fair market value of the hedging derivative instrument
      is recognized immediately in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income. In
      conjunction with its effectiveness testing, the Company also evaluates
      ineffectiveness associated with the hedge relationship. Resulting
      ineffectiveness, if any, is recognized immediately in the Company’s Consolidated
      Statements of Income.

The
      Company records the fair value of its foreign exchange contracts qualifying
      for
      cash flow hedge accounting treatment in its consolidated balance sheet with
      the
      related gain or loss on those contracts deferred in stockholders’ equity (as a
      component of AOCI). These deferred gains or losses are recognized in the
      Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income in the same period in which the
      underlying hedged items are recognized, and on the same line item as the
      underlying hedged items. However, to the extent that any derivative instrument
      is not considered to be perfectly effective in offsetting the change in the
      value of the hedged item, the amount related to the ineffective portion of
      this
      derivative instrument is immediately recognized in the Company’s Consolidated
      Statements of Income in selling, general and administrative
      expenses.

The
      Company expects $5.1 million of net gains, net of $2.8 million tax expense,
      to
      be reclassified from AOCI to earnings within the next 12 months. The amount
      of
      hedge ineffectiveness associated with the Company’s designated cash flow hedge
      instruments recognized in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income for
      the years ended February 28, 2007, February 28, 2006, and February 28, 2005,
      was
      not material. All components of the Company’s derivative instruments’ gains or
      losses are included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness. In addition,
      the
      amount of net gains reclassified into earnings as a result of the discontinuance
      of cash flow hedge accounting due to the probability that the original
      forecasted transaction would not occur by the end of the originally specified
      time period was not material for the years ended February 28, 2007, February
      28,
      2006, and February 28, 2005.

Fair
      value
      hedges

:

Fair
      value hedges are hedges that
      offset the risk of changes in the fair values of recorded assets and
      liabilities, and firm commitments. The Company records changes in fair value
      of
      derivative instruments which are designated and deemed effective as fair value
      hedges, in earnings offset by the corresponding changes in the fair value of
      the
      hedged items.

The
      amount of hedge ineffectiveness
      associated with the Company’s designated fair value hedge instruments recognized
      in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income for the years ended February
      28, 2007, February 28, 2006, and February 28, 2005, was not material. All
      components of the Company’s derivative instruments’ gains or losses are included
      in the assessment of hedge effectiveness. There were no gains or losses
      recognized in earnings resulting from a hedged firm commitment no longer
      qualifying as a fair value hedge for the years ended February 28, 2007, February
      28, 2006, and February 28, 2005.


Net
      investment
      hedges

:

Net
      investment hedges are hedges that
      use derivative instruments or non-derivative instruments to hedge the foreign
      currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation. The Company
      manages currency exposures resulting from its net investments in foreign
      subsidiaries principally with debt denominated in the related foreign currency.
      Gains and losses on these instruments are recorded as foreign currency
      translation adjustments in AOCI. Currently, the Company has designated the
      Sterling Senior Notes and the Sterling Series C Senior Notes (as defined in
      Note
      9) totaling £155.0 million aggregate principal amount as a hedge against the net
      investment in the Company’s U.K. subsidiary. For the years ended February 28,
      2007, February 28, 2006, and February 28, 2005, net gains (losses) of $32.6
      million, $25.9 million and ($8.1) million, respectively, are included in foreign
      currency translation adjustments within AOCI.

Counterparty
      credit
      risk

:

Counterparty
      credit risk relates to
      losses the Company could incur if a counterparty defaults on a derivative
      contract. The Company manages exposure to counterparty credit risk by requiring
      specified minimum credit standards and diversification of counterparties. The
      Company enters into master agreements with its counterparties that allow netting
      of certain exposures in order to manage this risk. All of the Company’s
      counterpart exposures are with counterparts that have investment grade ratings.
      The Company has procedures to monitor the credit exposure for both mark to
      market and future potential exposures.

Inventories
      -

Inventories
      are stated at the lower of cost (computed in accordance with the first-in,
      first-out method) or market. Elements of cost include materials, labor and
      overhead and are classified as follows:

A
      substantial portion of barreled whiskey and brandy will not be sold within
      one
      year because of the duration of the aging process. All barreled whiskey and
      brandy are classified as in-process inventories and are included in current
      assets, in accordance with industry practice. Bulk wine inventories are also
      included as in-process inventories within current assets, in accordance with
      the
      general practices of the wine industry, although a portion of such inventories
      may be aged for periods greater than one year. Warehousing, insurance, ad
      valorem taxes and other carrying charges applicable to barreled whiskey and
      brandy held for aging are included in inventory costs.

The
      Company assesses the valuation of its inventories and reduces the carrying
      value
      of those inventories that are obsolete or in excess of the Company’s forecasted
      usage to their estimated net realizable value. The Company estimates the net
      realizable value of such inventories based on analyses and assumptions
      including, but not limited to, historical usage, future demand and market
      requirements. Reductions to the carrying value of inventories are recorded
      in
      cost of product sold. If the future demand for the Company’s products is less
      favorable than the Company’s forecasts, then the value of the inventories may be
      required to be reduced, which would result in additional expense to the Company
      and affect its results of operations.


Property,
      plant and equipment -

Property,
      plant and equipment is stated at cost. Major additions and betterments are
      charged to property accounts, while maintenance and repairs are charged to
      operations as incurred. The cost of properties sold or otherwise disposed of
      and
      the related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts at the
      time of disposal and resulting gains and losses are included as a component
      of
      operating income.

Depreciation
      -

Depreciation
      is computed primarily using the straight-line method over the following
      estimated useful lives:

Goodwill
      and other intangible assets -

In
      accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 (“SFAS No.
      142”), “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” the Company reviews its goodwill
      and indefinite lived intangible assets annually for impairment, or sooner,
      if
      events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an
      asset
      may not be recoverable. The Company uses December 31 as its annual impairment
      test measurement date. Indefinite lived intangible assets consist principally
      of
      trademarks. Intangible assets determined to have a finite life, primarily
      distribution agreements, are amortized over their estimated useful lives and
      are
      subject to review for impairment in accordance with the provisions of SFAS
      No.
      144 (as defined below).

Note
      provides a summary of intangible assets segregated between amortizable and
      nonamortizable amounts.

No
      instances of impairment were noted on the Company’s goodwill for the years ended
      February 28, 2007, February 28, 2006, and February 28, 2005. The Company
      recorded an immaterial impairment loss for the year ended February 28, 2007,
      for
      indefinite lived intangible assets associated with assets held-for-sale. No
      instances of impairment were noted on the Company’s indefinite lived
      intangible assets for the years ended February 28, 2006, and February 28,
      2005.

Other
      assets -

Other
      assets include the following: (i) investments in equity method investees which
      are carried under the equity method of accounting (see

Note
      7);

(ii)
      deferred

financing
      costs which are stated at cost, net of accumulated amortization, and are
      amortized on an effective interest basis over the term of the related debt;
      (iii) deferred tax assets which are stated at cost, net of valuation allowances
      (see Note 10); and (iv) derivative assets which are stated at fair value (see
      discussion above).

Long-lived
      assets impairment -

In
      accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144 (“SFAS No.
      144”), “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” the
      Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes
      in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be
      recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a
      comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted cash
      flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset
      exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment charge
      is
      recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds
      its
      fair value. Assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying
      amount or fair value less costs to

sell
      and
      are no longer depreciated.


Pursuant
      to this policy and as part of the Constellation Wines segment’s Fiscal 2007 Wine
      Plan (as defined in Note 19)

,
      the
      Company recorded an asset impairment charge of $11.8 million for the year ended
      February 28, 2007, in connection with the write-down of certain winery and
      vineyard assets which satisfied the conditions necessary to be classified as
      held-for-sale. These assets were written down to a value based on the Company’s
      estimate of fair value less cost to sell.

Total
      assets held for sale as of February 28, 2007, are not material. This impairment
      charge is included in selling, general and administrative expenses on the
      Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income. No losses were recorded for the
      years ended February 28, 2006, and February 28, 2005.

Income
      taxes -

The
      Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes.
      This
      method accounts for deferred income taxes by applying statutory rates in effect
      at the balance sheet date to the difference between the financial reporting
      and
      tax bases of assets and liabilities.

Environmental
      -

Environmental
      expenditures that relate to current operations or to an existing condition
      caused by past operations, and which do not contribute to current or future
      revenue generation, are expensed. Liabilities for environmental risks or
      components thereof are recorded when environmental assessments and/or remedial
      efforts are probable, and the cost can be reasonably estimated. Generally,
      the
      timing of these accruals coincides with the completion of a feasibility study
      or
      the Company’s commitment to a formal plan of action.

Liabilities
      for environmental costs were not material at February 28, 2007, and February
      28,
      2006.

Earnings
      per common share -

The
      Company has two classes of common stock: Class A Common Stock and Class B
      Convertible Common Stock. With respect to dividend rights, the Class A Common
      Stock is entitled to cash dividends of at least ten percent higher than those
      declared and paid on the Class B Convertible Common Stock. Accordingly, the
      Company uses the two-class method for the computation of earnings per common
      share - basic and earnings per common share - diluted. The two-class computation
      method for each period reflects the amount of allocated undistributed earnings
      per share computed using the participation percentage which reflects the minimum
      dividend rights of each class of stock. Earnings per common share - basic has
      been computed using the two-class method. Earnings per common share - diluted
      for Class A Common Stock has been computed using the more dilutive of the
      if-converted method or the two-class method. Earnings per common share - diluted
      for Class B Convertible Common Stock has been computed using the two-class
      method (see Note 16).

Basic
      earnings per common share excludes the effect of common stock equivalents and
      is
      computed using the two-class computation method. Diluted earnings per common
      share for Class A Common Stock reflects the potential dilution that could result
      if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or
      converted into common stock. Diluted earnings per common share for Class A
      Common Stock assumes the exercise of stock options using the treasury stock
      method and the conversion of Class B Convertible Common Stock and Preferred
      Stock (as defined in Note 15) using the more dilutive if-converted method.
      Diluted earnings per common share for Class B Convertible Common Stock is
      presented without assuming conversion into Class A Common Stock and is computed
      using the two-class computation method.


Stock-based
      employee compensation plans

-

Effective
      March 1, 2006, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
      No. 123 (revised 2004) (“SFAS No. 123(R)”), “Share-Based Payment,” for its

four
      stock-based employee compensation plans, which are described more fully

in
      Note
      15.

SFAS
      No.
      123(R) replaces Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (“SFAS No.
      123”), “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” and supersedes Accounting
      Principles Board Opinion No. 25 (“APB Opinion No. 25”), “Accounting for Stock
      Issued to Employees.” SFAS No. 123(R) requires the cost resulting from all
      share-based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements.
      In
      addition, SFAS No. 123(R) establishes fair value as the measurement objective
      in
      accounting for share-based payment arrangements and requires all entities to
      apply a grant date fair-value-based measurement method in accounting for
      share-based payment transactions. SFAS No. 123(R) also amends Statement of
      Financial Accounting Standards No. 95 (“SFAS No. 95”), “Statement of Cash
      Flows,” to require that excess tax benefits be reported as a financing cash
      inflow rather than as a reduction of taxes paid. SFAS No. 123(R) applies to
      all
      awards granted, modified, repurchased, or cancelled by the Company after March
      1, 2006.

On
      March
      29, 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) staff issued Staff
      Accounting Bulletin No. 107 (“SAB No. 107”), “Share-Based Payment,” to express
      the views of the staff regarding the interaction between SFAS No. 123(R) and
      certain SEC rules and regulations and to provide the staff’s views regarding the
      valuation of share-based payment arrangements for public companies. The SAB
      No.
      107 guidance was taken into consideration with the implementation of SFAS No.
      123(R).

Prior
      to
      March 1, 2006, t

he

Company
      applied the intrinsic value method described in Accounting Principles Board
      Opinion No. 25 (“APB No. 25”), “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and
      related interpretations in accounting for its stock-based employee compensation
      plans. In accordance with APB No. 25, the compensation cost for stock options
      was recognized in income based on the excess, if any, of the quoted market
      price
      of the stock at the grant date of the award or other measurement date over
      the
      amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock. Options granted under the
      Company’s stock option plans have an exercise price equal to the market value of
      the underlying common stock on the date of grant; therefore, no incremental
      compensation expense has been recognized for grants made to employees under
      the
      Company’s stock option plans. The Company utilized the disclosure-only
      provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (“SFAS No.
      123”), “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” as amended.

The
      Company adopted SFAS No. 123(R) using the modified prospective transition
      method. Under the modified prospective transition method, the Company is
      required to record stock-based compensation expense for all awards granted
      after
      the adoption date and for the unvested portion of previously granted awards
      outstanding on the adoption date. Compensation cost related to the unvested
      portion of previously granted awards is based on the grant-date fair value
      estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS No. 123.
      Compensation cost for awards granted after the adoption date is based on the
      grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No.
      123(R). Results for prior periods have not been restated and do not reflect
      the
      recognition of stock-based compensation in accordance with the provisions of
      SFAS No. 123(R).


Stock-based
      awards, primarily stock options, granted by the Company are subject to specific
      vesting conditions, generally time vesting, or upon retirement, disability
      or
      death of the employee (as defined by the stock option plan), if earlier. Under
      APB No. 25, as the exercise price is equal to the market value of the underlying
      common stock on the date of grant, no compensation expense is recognized for
      the
      granting of these stock options. Under the disclosure only provisions of SFAS
      No. 123, for stock-based awards that specify an employee vests in the award
      upon
      retirement, the Company accounts for the compensation expense ratably over
      the
      stated vesting period. If the employee retires, becomes disabled or dies before
      the end of the stated vesting period, then any remaining unrecognized
      compensation expense is accounted for at the date of the event. The Company
      continues to apply this policy for any awards granted prior to the Company’s
      adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) on March 1, 2006, and for the unrecognized
      compensation expense associated with the remaining portion of the then unvested
      outstanding awards. The remaining portion of the unvested outstanding awards
      as
      of February 28, 2007, and February 28, 2006, was not material.

With
      the
      Company’s adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) on March 1, 2006, the Company revised its
      approach for recognition of compensation expense for all new stock-based awards
      that accelerate vesting upon retirement. Under this revised approach,
      compensation expense will be recognized immediately for awards granted to
      retirement-eligible employees or over the period from the date of grant to
      the
      date of retirement-eligibility if that is expected to occur during the requisite
      service period.

Prior
      to
      the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), the Company reported all tax benefits resulting
      from the exercise of stock options as operating cash flows in the Consolidated
      Statements of Cash Flows. SFAS No. 123(R) requires cash flows resulting from
      the
      tax deductions in excess of the related compensation cost recognized in the
      financial statements (excess tax benefits) to be classified as financing cash
      flows. In accordance with SFAS No. 123(R), excess tax benefits recognized in
      periods after the adoption date have been properly classified as financing
      cash
      flows. Excess tax benefits recognized in periods prior to the adoption date
      are
      classified as operating cash flows.

During
      the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, in connection with the Company’s adoption of
      SFAS No. 123(R), the Company elected to use the alternative transition method,
      or “short-cut” method, to calculate the Company’s historical pool of windfall
      tax benefits as allowed under the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
      Staff Position No. FAS 123(R)-3, “Transition Election Related to Accounting for
      the Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment Awards.” Prior to electing this method,
      the Company assumed the use of the “long-haul” method as described in SFAS No.
      123(R). This policy election resulted in a change to the amounts reported as
      financing cash flows. This policy election did not impact net income nor require
      an adjustment to cumulative retained earnings.

Total
      compensation cost for stock-based awards is as follows:

On
      December 21, 2006, the Human Resources Committee of the Company’s Board of
      Directors approved the accelerated vesting of certain unvested stock options
      held by approximately 100 employees of the Company who transferred to Crown
      Imports

on
      January 2, 2007, effective as of the end of the day on the date preceding the
      formation of the joint venture, January 1, 2007. The total incremental
      compensation cost associated with this modification was $1.8
      million.

On
      February 16, 2006, the Company’s Board of Directors approved the accelerated
      vesting of certain unvested stock options previously awarded under the Company’s
      Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan and Incentive Stock Option Plan. Nearly all
      of
      the accelerated vesting was for stock options awarded with a performance-based
      acceleration feature. The acceleration of these stock options enabled the
      Company to more accurately forecast future compensation expense and to reduce
      related earnings volatility. As a result of the accelerated vesting, options
      to
      purchase 5,130,778 shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock, of which 98.7%
      were in-the-money, became fully exercisable. The acceleration eliminated future
      compensation expense of approximately $38.8 million that would have otherwise
      been recognized in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income beginning
      March 1, 2006, through February 28, 2010. Also on February 16, 2006, the Company
      announced its worldwide wines reorganization (see Note 19). As a result of
      these
      foregoing actions, the Company recorded $7.3 million of stock-based employee
      compensation expense for the year ended February 28, 2006, of which $6.9 million
      is recorded as Restructuring and Related Charges and $0.4 million is recorded
      as
      selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company’s Consolidated
      Statements of Income.

The
      following table illustrates the effect of adopting SFAS No. 123(R) for the
      year

RECENTLY
      ADOPTED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS:

Effective
      March 1, 2006, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
      No. 151 (“SFAS No. 151”), “Inventory Costs - an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter
      4.” SFAS No. 151 amends the guidance in Accounting Research Bulletin No. 43
      (“ARB No. 43”), “Restatement and Revision of Accounting Research Bulletins,”
Chapter 4, “Inventory Pricing,” to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts
      of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material
      (spoilage). SFAS No. 151 requires that those items be recognized as current
      period charges. In addition, SFAS No. 151 requires that allocation of fixed
      production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity
      of the production facilities. The adoption of SFAS No. 151 did not have a
      material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

As
      discussed in Note 1, e

ffective
      March 1, 2006, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
      No. 123 (revised 2004) (“SFAS No. 123(R)”), “Share-Based Payment.” Under SFAS
      No. 123(R), all stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date,
      based on the fair value of the award, and is recognized as an expense in the
      income statement over the requisite service period (see Note 15).


Effective
      March 1, 2006, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
      No. 154 (“SFAS No. 154”), “Accounting Changes and Error Corrections - a
      replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3.” SFAS No. 154
      changes the requirements for the accounting of and reporting of a change in
      accounting principle. SFAS No. 154 applies to all voluntary changes in
      accounting principle and requires retrospective application to prior periods’
financial statements of changes in accounting principle, unless it is
      impracticable to determine either the period-specific effects or the cumulative
      effect of changing to the new accounting principle. SFAS No. 154 requires that
      a
      change in depreciation, amortization, or depletion method for long-lived,
      nonfinancial assets be accounted for as a change of estimate effected by a
      change in accounting principle. SFAS No. 154 also carries forward without change
      the guidance in APB Opinion No. 20 with respect to accounting for changes in
      accounting estimates, changes in the reporting unit and correction of an error
      in previously issued financial statements. The adoption of SFAS No. 154 did
      not
      have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial
      statements.

Effective
      February 28, 2007, the Company adopted the Securities and Exchange Commission’s
      Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108 (“SAB No. 108”), “Considering the Effects of
      Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year
      Financial Statements.” SAB No. 108 addresses how the effects of prior year
      uncorrected misstatements should be considered when quantifying misstatements
      in
      current year financial statements. SAB No. 108 requires companies to quantify
      misstatements using a balance sheet and income statement approach and to
      evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying an error that is
      material in light of relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. The initial
      adoption of SAB No. 108 did not have a material impact on the Company’s
      consolidated financial statements.

ACQUISITIONS:

Acquisition
      of Vincor -

On
      June
      5, 2006, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding common shares
      of
      Vincor International Inc. (“Vincor”), Canada’s premier wine company. Vincor is
      Canada’s largest producer and marketer of wine. At the time of the acquisition,
      Vincor was the world’s eighth largest producer and distributor of wine and
      related products by revenue and was also one of the largest wine importers,
      marketers and distributors in the U.K. Through this transaction, the Company
      acquired various additional winery and vineyard interests used in the production
      of premium, super-premium and fine wines from Canada, California, Washington
      State, Western Australia and New Zealand. In addition, as a result of the
      acquisition, the Company sources, markets and sells premium wines from South
      Africa. Well-known premium brands acquired in the Vincor acquisition include
      Inniskillin, Jackson-Triggs, Sumac Ridge, Hawthorne Mountain, R.H. Phillips,
      Toasted Head, Hogue, Kim Crawford and Kumala.

The
      acquisition of Vincor supports the Company’s strategy of strengthening the
      breadth of its portfolio across price segments and geographic regions to
      capitalize on the overall growth in the wine industry. In addition to
      complementing the Company’s current operations in the U.S., U.K., Australia and
      New Zealand, the acquisition of Vincor increases the Company’s global presence
      by adding Canada as another core market and provides the Company with the
      ability to capitalize on broader geographic distribution in strategic
      international markets. In addition, the acquisition of Vincor makes the Company
      the largest wine company in Canada and strengthens the Company’s position as the
      largest wine company in the world and the largest premium wine company in the
      U.S.


Total
      consideration paid in cash to the Vincor shareholders was $1,115.8 million.
      In
      addition, the Company expects to incur direct acquisition costs of approximately
      $11.0 million. At closing, the Company also assumed outstanding indebtedness
      of
      Vincor, net of cash acquired, of $320.2 million. The purchase price was financed
      with borrowings under the Company’s June 2006 Credit Agreement (as defined in
      Note 9). In accordance with the purchase method of accounting, the acquired
      net
      assets are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition. The purchase
      price
      was based primarily on the estimated future operating results of the Vincor
      business, including the factors described above, as well as an estimated benefit
      from operating cost synergies.

In
      connection with the Vincor acquisition, the Company entered into a foreign
      currency forward contract to fix the U.S. dollar cost of the acquisition and
      the
      payment of certain outstanding indebtedness in April 2006. For the year ended
      February 28, 2007, the Company recorded a gain of $55.1 million in connection
      with this derivative instrument. Under SFAS No. 133, a transaction that involves
      a business combination is not eligible for hedge accounting treatment. As such,
      the gain was recognized separately on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of
      Income, and the proceeds from maturity of the derivative instrument were
      reported as cash flows provided by investing activities on the Company’s
      Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

The
      results of operations of the Vincor business are reported in the Constellation
      Wines segment and have been included in the Consolidated Statements of Income
      since the acquisition date.

The
      following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets acquired
      and
      liabilities assumed in the Vincor acquisition at the date of acquisition. The
      Company is in the process of obtaining third-party valuations of certain assets
      and liabilities, and refining its restructuring plan which is under development
      and will be finalized during the Company’s first quarter of fiscal 2008 (see
      Note 19). Accordingly, the allocation of the purchase price is preliminary
      and
      subject to change. Estimated fair values at June 5, 2006, are as
      follows:

The
      trademarks are not subject to amortization. None of the goodwill is expected
      to
      be deductible for tax purposes.


Acquisition
      of Robert Mondavi -

On
      December 22, 2004, the Company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock
      of
      The Robert Mondavi Corporation (“Robert Mondavi”), a leading premium wine
      producer based in Napa, California. Through this transaction, the Company
      acquired various additional winery and vineyard interests, and, additionally
      produces, markets and sells premium, super-premium and fine California wines
      under the Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi, Robert Mondavi Private Selection and
      Robert Mondavi Winery brand names. As a result of the Robert Mondavi
      acquisition, the Company acquired an ownership interest in Opus One, a joint
      venture owned equally by Robert Mondavi and Baron Philippe de Rothschild, S.A.
      During September 2005, the Company’s president and Baroness Philippine de
      Rothschild announced an agreement to maintain equal ownership of Opus One.
      Opus
      One produces fine wines at its Napa Valley winery. T

he
      Company accounts for the investment in Opus One under the equity method.
      Accordingly, the results of operations of Opus One are included in the equity
      in
      earnings of equity method investees line in the Company’s Consolidated
      Statements of Income since December 22, 2004.

The
      acquisition of Robert Mondavi supports the Company’s strategy of strengthening
      the breadth of its portfolio across price segments to capitalize on the overall
      growth in the premium, super-premium and fine wine categories. The Company
      believes that the acquired Robert Mondavi brand names have strong brand
      recognition globally. The vast majority of sales from these brands are generated
      in the United States. The Company is leveraging the Robert Mondavi brands in
      the
      United States through its selling, marketing and distribution infrastructure.
      The Company also intends to further expand distribution for the Robert Mondavi
      brands in Europe through its Constellation Europe infrastructure.

The
      Robert Mondavi acquisition supports the Company’s strategy of growth and breadth
      across categories and geographies, and strengthens its competitive position
      in
      its core markets. The Robert Mondavi acquisition provides the Company with
      a
      greater presence in the growing premium, super-premium and fine wine sectors
      within the United States and the ability to capitalize on the broader geographic
      distribution in strategic international markets. In particular, the Company
      believes there are growth opportunities for premium, super-premium and fine
      wines in the United Kingdom and other “new world” wine markets. Total
      consideration paid in cash to the Robert Mondavi shareholders was $1,030.7
      million. Additionally, the Company incurred direct acquisition costs of $12.0
      million. The purchase price was financed with borrowings under the Company’s
      prior senior credit facility. In accordance with the purchase method of
      accounting, the acquired net assets are recorded at fair value at the date
      of
      acquisition. The purchase price was based primarily on the estimated future
      operating results of the Robert Mondavi business, including the factors
      described above, as well as an estimated benefit from operating cost
      synergies.

The
      results of operations of the Robert Mondavi business are reported in the
      Constellation Wines segment and have been included in the Consolidated
      Statements of Income since the acquisition date.


The
      following table summarizes the fair values of the assets acquired and
      liabilities assumed in the Robert Mondavi acquisition at the date of
      acquisition, as adjusted for the final appraisal:

The
      trademarks are not subject to amortization. None of the goodwill is expected
      to
      be deductible for tax purposes.

Following
      the Robert Mondavi acquisition, the Company sold certain of the acquired
      vineyard properties and related assets, investments accounted for under the
      equity method, and other winery properties and related assets, during the years
      ended February 28, 2006, and February 28, 2005. The Company realized net
      proceeds of $170.8 million from the sale of these assets for the year ended
      February 28, 2006. Amounts realized for the year ended February 28, 2005, were
      not material. No gain or loss has been recognized upon the sale of these
      assets.

The
      following table sets forth the unaudited pro forma

results
      of operations of the Company for the years ended February 28, 2007, and February
      28, 2006, respectively. The unaudited pro forma results of operations for the
      years ended February 28, 2007, and February 28, 2006, give effect to the Vincor
      acquisition as if it occurred on March 1, 2005. The unaudited pro forma results
      of operations are presented after giving effect to certain adjustments for
      depreciation, amortization of certain intangible assets and deferred financing
      costs, interest expense on the acquisition financing, interest expense
      associated with adverse grape contracts, and related income tax effects. The
      unaudited pro forma results of operations are based upon currently available
      information and certain assumptions that the Company believes are reasonable
      under the circumstances. The unaudited pro forma results of operations for
      the
      year ended February 28, 2006, do not reflect total pretax nonrecurring charges
      of $29.5 million ($0.09 per share on a diluted basis) related to transaction
      costs, primarily for the acceleration of vesting of stock options, legal fees
      and investment banker fees, all of which were incurred by Vincor prior to the
      acquisition. The unaudited pro forma results of operations do not purport to
      present what the Company’s results of operations would actually have been if the
      aforementioned transactions had in fact occurred on such date or at the
      beginning of the period indicated, nor do they project the Company’s financial
      position or results of operations at any future date or for any future
      period.


During
      the year ended February 28, 2006, the Company completed its acquisition of
      two
      businesses, Rex Goliath and Cocktails by Jenn, for a total combined purchased
      price of $48.2 million. Unaudited pro forma results of operations for the year
      ended February 28, 2006, to give pro forma effect to these acquisitions as
      if
      they occurred on March 1, 2005, are not shown as they are not
      significant.

Investment
      in equity method investees -

Crown
      Imports:

On
      July
      17, 2006, Barton Beers, Ltd. (“Barton”), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of
      the Company, entered into an Agreement to Establish Joint Venture (the “Joint
      Venture Agreement”) with Diblo, S.A. de C.V. (“Diblo”), an entity owned 76.75%
      by Grupo Modelo, S.A. de C.V. (“Modelo”) and 23.25% by Anheuser-Busch, Inc.,
      pursuant to which Modelo’s Mexican beer portfolio (the “Modelo Brands”) will
      be exclusively imported, marketed and sold in the 50 states of the
      U.S., the District of Columbia and Guam. In addition, the owners of the Tsingtao
      and St. Pauli Girl brands have transferred exclusive importing,
      marketing and selling rights with respect to those brands in the
      U.S. to the joint venture. On January 2, 2007, the parties completed the
      closing (the “Closing”) of the transactions contemplated in the Joint Venture
      Agreement, as amended at Closing.

Pursuant
      to the Joint Venture Agreement, Barton established Crown Imports LLC, a
      wholly-owned subsidiary formed as a Delaware limited liability
      company

.
      On
      January 2, 2007, pursuant to a Barton Contribution Agreement, dated July 17,
      2006, among Barton, Diblo and Crown

Imports

LLC
      (the “Barton Contribution Agreement”), Barton transferred to Crown

Imports

LLC
      substantially all of its assets relating to importing, marketing and selling
      beer under the Corona Extra, Corona Light, Coronita, Modelo Especial, Negra
      Modelo, Pacifico, St. Pauli Girl and Tsingtao brands and the liabilities
      associated therewith (the “Barton Contributed Net Assets”). At the Closing,
      GModelo Corporation, a Dela

ware
      corporation (the “Diblo Subsidiary”), a subsidiary of Diblo joined Barton as a
      member of Crown

Imports
      LLC

,

and,
      in
      exchange for a 50% membership interest in Crown

Imports
      LLC

,
      contributed cash in an amount equal to the Barton Contributed Net Assets,
      subject to specified adjustments.

This
      imported beers joint venture is referred to hereinafter as “Crown
      Imports”.


Also
      on
      January 2, 2007, Crown Imports and Extrade II S.A. de C.V. (“Extrade II”), an
      affiliate of Modelo, entered into an Importer Agreement (the “Importer
      Agreement”), pursuant to which Extrade II granted to Crown Imports the exclusive
      right to import, market and sell the Modelo Brands in the territories mentioned
      above, and Crown Imports and Marcas Modelo, S.A. de C.V. (“Marcas Modelo”),
      entered into a Sub-license Agreement (the “Sub-license Agreement”), pursuant to
      which Marcas Modelo granted Crown Imports an exclusive sub-license to use
      certain trademarks related to the Modelo Brands within this
      territory.

As
      a
      result of these transactions, Barton and Diblo each have, directly or
      indirectly, equal interests in Crown Imports and each of Barton and Diblo have
      appointed an equal number of directors to the Board of Directors of Crown
      Imports. The importer agreement that previously gave Barton the exclusive right
      to import, market and sell the Modelo Brands primarily west of the Mississippi
      River was superseded by the transactions contemplated by the Joint Venture
      Agreement, as amended. The contribution by Diblo Subsidiary in exchange for
      a
      50% membership interest in Crown Imports does not constitute the acquisition
      of
      a business by the Company.

The
      joint
      venture and the related importation arrangements provide that, subject to the
      terms and conditions of those agreements, the joint venture and the related
      importation arrangements will continue for an initial term of 10 years, and
      renew in 10-year periods unless Diblo Subsidiary gives notice prior to the
      end
      of year seven of any term. Upon consummation of the transactions, the Company
      discontinued consolidation of the imported beer business and accounts for the
      investment in Crown Imports under the equity method. Accordingly, the results
      of
      operations of Crown Imports are included in the equity in earnings of equity
      method investees line in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income from
      the date of investment. As of February 28, 2007, the Company’s investment in
      Crown Imports was $163.4 million. The carrying amount of the investment is
      greater than the Company’s equity in the underlying assets of Crown Imports by
      $13.6 million due to the difference in the carrying amounts of the indefinite
      lived intangible assets contributed to Crown Imports by each party.

Other:

In
      connection with prior acquisitions, the Company acquired several investments
      which are being accounted for under the equity method. The primary investment
      consists of Opus One, a 50% owned joint venture arrangement. As of February
      28,
      2007, the Company’s investment in Opus One was $63.1 million. The percentage of
      ownership of the remaining investments ranges from 20% to 50%.

In
      addition, in December 2004, the Company purchased a 40% interest in Ruffino
      S.r.l. (“Ruffino”), the well-known Italian fine wine company, for $89.6 million,
      including direct acquisition costs of $7.5 million. The Company does not have
      a
      controlling interest in Ruffino or exert any managerial control. The Company
      accou

nts
      for
      the investment in Ruffino under the equity method; accordingly, the
      results of operations of Ruffino from December 2004 are included in the equity
      in earnings of equity method investees line in the Company’s Consolidated
      Statements of Income.

As
      of
      February 1, 2005, the Company’s Constellation Wines segment began distribution
      of Ruffino’s products in the U.S. Amounts purchased from Ruffino under this
      arrangement for the years ended February 28, 2007, February 28, 2006, and
      February 28, 2005, were not material. As of February 28, 2007, amounts payable
      to Ruffino were not material.

As
      of
      February 28, 2007, the Company’s investment in Ruffino was $86.3
      million.

      ended
      February 28, 2007, February 28, 2006, and February 28, 2005,
      respectively.

Senior
      credit facility -

In
      connection with the acquisition of Vincor, on June 5, 2006, the Company and
      certain of its U.S. subsidiaries, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as a lender and
      administrative agent, and certain other agents, lenders, and financial
      institutions entered into a new credit agreement

(the
      “June 2006 Credit Agreement”). On February 23, 2007, the June 2006 Credit
      Agreement was amended (the “February Amendment”). The June 2006 Credit Agreement
      together with the February Amendment is referred to as the “2006 Credit
      Agreement”

. The 2006 Credit Agreement provides for aggregate credit
      facilities of $3.9 billion, consisting of a $1.2 billion tranche A term loan
      facility due in June 2011, a $1.8 billion tranche B term loan facility due
      in
      June 2013, and a $900 million revolving credit facility (including a
      sub-facility for letters of credit of up to $200 million) which terminates
      in
      June 2011. Proceeds of the June 2006 Credit Agreement were used to pay
      off the Company’s obligations under its prior senior credit facility, to fund
      the acquisition of Vincor and to repay certain indebtedness of Vincor. The
      Company uses its revolving credit facility under the 2006 Credit Agreement
      for
      general corporate purposes, including working capital, on an as needed
      basis.


The
      tranche A term loan facility and the tranche B term loan facility were fully
      drawn on June 5, 2006. In August 2006, the Company used proceeds from the August
      2006 Senior Notes (as defined below) to repay $180.0 million of the tranche
      A
      term loan and $200.0 million of the tranche B term loan. In addition, the
      Company prepaid an additional $100.0 million on the tranche B term loan in
      August 2006. As of February 28, 2007, the required principal repayments of
      the
      tranche A term loan and the tranche B term loan for each of the five succeeding
      fiscal years and thereafter are as follows:

The
      rate
      of interest on borrowings under the 2006 Credit Agreement is a function of
      LIBOR
      plus a margin, the federal funds rate plus a margin, or the prime rate plus
      a
      margin. The margin is fixed with respect to the tranche B term loan facility
      and
      is adjustable based upon the Company’s debt ratio (as defined in the 2006 Credit
      Agreement) with respect to the tranche A term loan facility and the revolving
      credit facility. As of February 28, 2007, the LIBOR margin for the revolving
      credit facility and the tranche A term loan facility is 1.25%, while the LIBOR
      margin on the tranche B term loan facility is 1.50%.

The
      February Amendment amended the June 2006 Credit
      Agreement to, among other things, (i) increase the revolving credit
      facility from $500.0 million to $900.0 million, which increased the aggregate
      credit facilities from $3.5 billion to $3.9 billion; (ii) increase the aggregate
      amount of cash payments the Company is permitted to make in respect or on
      account of its capital stock; (iii) remove certain limitations on the
      application of proceeds from the incurrence of senior unsecured indebtedness;
      (iv) increase the maximum permitted total “Debt Ratio” and decrease the required
      minimum “Interest Coverage Ratio”; and (v) eliminate the “Senior Debt Ratio”
covenant and the “Fixed Charges Ratio” covenant.

The
      Company’s obligations are guaranteed by certain of its U.S. subsidiaries. These
      obligations are also secured by a pledge of (i) 100% of the ownership interests
      in certain of the Company’s U.S. subsidiaries and (ii) 65% of the voting capital
      stock of certain of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries.

The
      Company and its subsidiaries are also subject to covenants that are contained
      in
      the 2006 Credit Agreement, including those restricting the incurrence of
      additional indebtedness (including guarantees of indebtedness), additional
      liens, mergers and consolidations, disposition or acquisition of property,
      the
      payment of dividends, transactions with affiliates and the making of certain
      investments, in each case subject to numerous conditions, exceptions and
      thresholds. The financial covenants are limited to maximum total
      debt

coverage
      ratios and minimum interest coverage ratios.

As
      of
      February 28, 2007, under the 2006 Credit Agreement, the Company had outstanding
      tranche A term loans of $1.0 billion bearing an interest rate of 6.6%, tranche
      B
      term loans of $1.5 billion bearing an interest rate of 6.9%, revolving loans
      of
      $30.0 million bearing an interest rate of 6.6%, outstanding letters of credit
      of
      $50.9 million, and $819.1 million in revolving loans available to be
      drawn.


In
      March
      2005, the Company replaced its then outstanding five year interest rate swap
      agreements with new five year delayed start interest rate swap agreements
      effective March 1, 2006, which are outstanding as of February 28, 2007. These
      delayed start interest rate swap agreements extended the original hedged period
      through fiscal 2010. The swap agreements fixed LIBOR interest rates on $1,200.0
      million of the Company’s floating LIBOR rate debt at an average rate of 4.1%
      over the five year term. The Company received $30.3 million in proceeds from
      the
      unwinding of the original swaps. This amount will be reclassified from
      Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (“AOCI”) ratably into earnings in the
      same period in which the original hedged item is recorded in the Consolidated
      Statements of Income. For the years ended February 28, 2007, and February 28,
      2006, the Company reclassified

$5.9
      million

and

$3.6
      million

,
      respectively, from AOCI to Interest Expense, net in the Company’s Consolidated
      Statements of Income

.
      This
      non-cash operating activity is included in the Other, net line in the Company’s
      Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

The
      foreign provision for income taxes is based on foreign pretax earnings. Earnings
      of foreign subsidiaries would be subject to U.S. income taxation on repatriation
      to the U.S. The Company’s consolidated financial statements provide for
      anticipated tax liabilities on amounts that may be repatriated.

Deferred
      tax assets and liabilities reflect the future income tax effects of temporary
      differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of
      existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and are measured
      using enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income.

Significant
      components of deferred tax assets (liabilities) consist of the
      following:

In
      assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether
      it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will
      not
      be realized. Management considers the reversal of deferred tax liabilities
      and
      projected future taxable income in making this assessment. Based upon this
      assessment, management believes it is more likely than not that the Company
      will
      realize the benefits of these deductible differences, net of any valuation
      allowances.

Operating
      loss carryforwards totaling $304.0 million at February 28, 2007, are being
      carried forward in a number of U.S. and foreign jurisdictions where the Company
      is permitted to use tax operating losses from prior periods to reduce future
      taxable income. Of these operating loss carryforwards, $45.5 million will expire
      in 2008 through 2027 and $258.5 million of operating losses in foreign
      jurisdictions may be carried forward indefinitely. In addition, certain tax
      credits generated of $13.8 million are available to offset future income taxes.
      These credits will expire, if not utilized, in 2013 through 2016.


On
      October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act (“AJCA”) was signed into law.
      The AJCA includes a special one-time 85% dividends received deduction for
      certain foreign earnings that are repatriated. For the year ended February
      28,
      2006, the Company repatriated $95.7 million of earnings under the provisions
      of
      the AJCA. Deferred taxes had previously been provided for a portion of the
      dividends remitted. The reversal of deferred taxes offset the tax costs to
      repatriate the earnings and the Company recorded a net benefit of $6.8
      million.

The
      AJCA
      also provides relief to U.S. domestic manufacturers by providing a tax deduction
      related to “qualified production income,” which will be phased in over five
      years. In accordance with FASB Staff Position No. FAS 109-1 (“FSP FAS 109-1”),
“Application of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, for the
      Tax
      Deduction on Qualified Production Activities Provided by the American Jobs
      Creation Act of 2004,” the Company will recognize these benefits in the period
      in which the deduction is claimed. The tax benefit for the years ended February
      28, 2007, and February 28, 2006, was $1.9 million and $2.0 million,
      respectively.

The
      Company is subject to ongoing tax examinations and assessments in various
      jurisdictions. Accordingly, the Company provides for additional tax expense
      based on probable outcomes of such matters. While it is often difficult to
      predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax
      matter, the Company believes the reserves reflect the probable outcome of known
      tax contingencies. Unfavorable settlement of any particular issue would require
      use of cash. Favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction to the
      effective tax rate in the year of resolution. During the year ended February
      28,
      2006, various federal, state, and international examinations were finalized.
      A
      tax benefit of $16.2 million was recorded primarily related to the resolution
      of
      certain tax positions in connection with those examinations.

      reconciliation of the total tax provision to the amount computed by applying
      the
      statutory U.S. Federal income tax rate to income before provision for income
      taxes is as follows:

The
      effect of earnings of foreign subsidiaries includes the difference between
      the
      U.S. statutory rate and local jurisdiction tax rates, as well as the (benefit)
      provision for incremental U.S. taxes on unremitted earnings of foreign
      subsidiaries offset by foreign tax credits and other foreign adjustments.

The
      miscellaneous items, net for the year ended February 28, 2007, consist primarily
      of the write-off of nondeductible intangible assets related to the sale of
      the
      Company’s branded water business.

OTHER
      LIABILITIES:

The
      major
      components of other liabilities are as follows:

12.

PROFIT
        SHARING AND RETIREMENT SAVINGS PLANS:

The
        Company’s retirement and profit sharing plan, the Constellation Brands, Inc.
        401(k) and Profit Sharing Plan (the “Plan”), covers substantially all U.S.
        employees, excluding those employees covered by collective bargaining
        agreements. The 401(k) portion of the Plan permits eligible employees to
        defer a
        portion of their compensation (as defined in the Plan) on a pretax basis.
        Participants may defer up to 50% of their compensation for the year, subject
        to
        limitations of the Plan. The Company makes a matching contribution of 50%
        of the
        first 6% of compensation a participant defers. The amount of the Company’s
        contribution under the profit sharing portion of the Plan is a discretionary
        amount as determined by the Board of

Directors
        on an annual basis, subject to limitations of the Plan. Company contributions
        under the Plan were $15.2 million, $15.9 million and $13.0 million for the
        years
        ended February 28, 2007, February 28, 2006, and February 28, 2005

,
        respectively.

In
        addition to the Plan discussed above, the Company has the Hardy Wine Company
        Superannuation Plan (the “Hardy Plan”) which covers substantially all of its
        salaried Australian employees. The Hardy Plan has a defined benefit component
        and a defined contribution component. The Company also has a statutory
        obligation to provide a minimum defined contribution on behalf of any Australian
        employees who are not covered by the Hardy Plan. In addition, the Company
        has a
        defined contribution plan that covers substantially all of its U.K. employees
        and a defined contribution plan that covers certain of its Canadian employees.
        Lastly, in connection with the Vincor acquisition, the Company acquired the
        Retirement Plan for Salaried Employees of Vincor International Inc. (the
“Vincor
        Plan”) which covers substantially all of its salaried Canadian employees. The
        Vincor Plan has a defined benefit component and a defined contribution
        component. Company contributions under the defined contribution component
        of the
        Hardy Plan, the Australian statutory obligation, the U.K. defined contribution
        plan, the Canadian defined contribution plan and the defined contribution
        component of the Vincor Plan aggregated $9.3 million,

$7.7
        million and $6.7

million

for
        the

years
        ended February 28, 2007, February 28, 2006, and February 28, 2005,
        respectively.


The
        Company also has defined benefit pension plan

s
        that
        cover certain of its non-U.S. employees. These consist of a Canadian plan,
        an
        U.K. plan, the defined benefit components of the Hardy Plan and the Vincor
        Plan,
        and two defined benefit pension plans acquired in connection with the Vincor
        acquisition which cover substantially all of its hourly Canadian employees.
        For
        the year ended February 28, 2006, the Company’s net periodic benefit cost
        included $6.4 million of recognized net actuarial loss due to an adjustment
        in
        the Company’s defined benefit U.K. pension plan. Of that amount, $2.7 million
        represented current year expense.

The
        Company uses a December 31 measurement date for all of its plans. Net periodic
        benefit cost reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income for these
        plans
        includes the following components:

The
        Company adopted the recognition and related disclosure provisions of

Statement
        of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158 (“SFAS No. 158”), “Employers’
Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans - an
        amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R),” as of February 28,
        2007 (see Note 23). The following table presents the incremental effect of
        applying SFAS No. 158 on individual line items in the Company’s Consolidated
        Balance Sheets as of February 28, 2007:


The
        following table summarizes the funded status of the Company’s defined benefit
        pension plans and the related amounts included in the Consolidated Balance
        Sheets:


The
        estimated amounts that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive
        income into net periodic benefit cost over the next fiscal year are as
        follows:

As
        of
        February 28, 2007, and February 28, 2006, the accumulated benefit obligation
        for
        all defined benefit pension plans was $449.5 million and $379.7 million,
        respectively. The following table summarizes the projected benefit obligation,
        accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for only those
        pension plans with an accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan
        assets:

The
        following table sets forth the weighted average assumptions used in developing
        the net periodic pension expense:

The
        Company’s weighted average expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is
        7.64%. The Company considers the historical level of long-term returns and
        the
        current level of expected long-term returns for each asset class, as well
        as the
        current and expected allocation of assets when developing its expected long-term
        rate of return on assets assumption. The expected return for each asset class
        is
        weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the expected long-term
        rate of return on assets assumption for the Company’s portfolios.

The
        following table sets forth the weighted average asset allocations by asset
        category:


For
        each
        of its Canadian, U.K. and Australian defined benefit plans, the Company employs
        an investment return approach whereby a mix of equities and fixed income
        investments are used (on a plan by plan basis) to maximize the long-term
        rate of
        return on plan assets for a prudent level of risk. From time to time, the
        Company will target asset allocation on a plan by plan basis to enhance total
        return while balancing risks. The established weighted average target
        allocations across all of the Company’s plans are approximately 40% equity
        securities, 22% fixed income securities, 4% real estate and 34% other. The
        other
        component results primarily from investments held by the Company’s U.K. plan and
        consists primarily of U.K. hedge funds which have characteristics of both
        equity
        and fixed income securities. Risk tolerance is established
        separately

for each
        plan through careful consideration of plan liabilities, plan funded status,
        and
        corporate financial condition. The individual investment portfolios contain
        a
        diversified blend of equity and fixed-income investments. Equity investments
        are
        diversified across each plan’s local jurisdiction stocks as well as
        international stocks, and across multiple asset classifications, including
        growth, value, and large and small capitalizations. Investment risk is measured
        and monitored for each plan separately on an ongoing basis through periodic
        investment portfolio reviews and annual liability measures.

The
        Company expects to contribute $11.7 million to its pension plans during the
        year
        ended February 28, 2008.

Benefit
        payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, expected
        to be
        paid during the next ten fiscal years are as follows:

13.

POSTRETIREMENT
        BENEFITS:

The
        Company currently sponsors multiple unfunded postretirement benefit plans
        for
        certain of its Constellation Spirits segment employees, and, during the year
        ended February 28, 2007, in connection with the Vincor acquisition, the Company
        acquired an additional unfunded postretirement benefit plan covering certain
        of
        the Company’s Canadian employees

.

The
        Company adopted the recognition and related disclosure provisions of Statement
        of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158 (“SFAS No. 158”), “Employers’
Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans - an
        amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R),” as of February 28,
        2007 (see Note 23). The following table presents the incremental effect of

COMMITMENTS
        AND CONTINGENCIES:

Operating
        leases -

Step
        rent
        provisions, escalation clauses, capital improvement funding and other lease
        concessions, when present in the Company’s leases, are taken into account in
        computing the minimum lease payments. The minimum lease payments for the
        Company’s operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the
        minimum lease term. Future payments under noncancelable operating leases
        having
        initial or remaining terms of one year or more are as follows during the
        next
        five fiscal years and thereafter:

Rental
        expense

was
        $79.4
        million, $70.5 million and $47.8 million for the years ended February 28,
        2007,
        February 28, 2006, and February 28, 2005, respectively.

Purchase
        commitments and contingencies -

The
        Company has agreements with suppliers to purchase various spirits of which
        certain agreements are denomina

ted
        in
        British pound sterling. The maximum future obligation under these agreements,
        based upon exchange rates at February 28, 2007, aggregate $26.0 million for
        contracts expiring through December 2012.

In
        connection with previous acquisitions as well as with the Vincor acquisition
        and
        Robert Mondavi acquisition, the Company has assumed grape purchase contracts
        with certain growers and suppliers. In addition, the Company has entered
        into
        other grape purchase contracts with various growers and suppliers in the
        normal
        course of business. Under the grape purchase contracts, the Company is committed
        to purchase all grape production yielded from a specified number of acres
        for a
        period of time from one to eighteen years. The actual tonnage and price of
        grapes that must be purchased by the Company will vary each year depending
        on
        certain factors, including weather, time of harvest, overall market conditions
        and the agri

cultural
        practices and location of the growers and suppliers under contract. The Company
        purchased $364.2 million and $491.8 million of grapes under contracts for
        the
        years ended February 28, 2007, and February 28, 2006, respectively. Based
        on
        current production yields and published grape prices, the Company estimates
        that
        the aggregate purchases under these contracts over the remaining terms of
        the
        contracts will be $2,182.2 million.

In
        connection with previous acquisitions as well as with the Vincor acquisition
        and
        Robert Mondavi acquisition, the Company established a liability for the
        estimated loss on firm purchase commitments assumed at the time of acquisition.
        As of February 28, 2007, the remaining balance on this liability is $71.0
        million.

T

he
        Company’s aggregate obligations under bulk wine purchase contracts will be $82.5
        million over the remaining terms of the contracts which extend through fiscal
        2011.


In
        connection with a previous acquisition, the Company assumed certain processing
        contracts which commit the Company to utilize outside services to process
        and/or
        package a minimum volume quantity. In addition, the Company has a processing
        contract utilizing outside services to process a minimum volume of brandy
        at
        prices which are dependent on the processing ingredients provided by the
        Company. The Company’s aggregate obligations under these processing contracts
        will be $30.0 million over the remaining terms of the contracts which extend
        through fiscal 2011.

Employment
        contracts -

The
        Company has employment contracts with certain of its executive offic

ers
        and
        certain other management personnel with either automatic one year renewals
        or an
        indefinite term of employment unless terminated by either party. These
        employment contracts provide for minimum salaries, as adjusted for annual
        increases, and may include incentive bonuses based upon attainment of specified
        management goals. These employment contracts also provide for severance payments
        in the event of specified termination of employment. In addition, the Company
        has employment arrangements with certain other management personnel which
        provide for severance payments in the event of specified termination of
        employment. As of February 28, 2007, the aggregate commitment for future
        compensation and severance, excluding incentive bonuses, was $11.9 million,
        none
        of which was accruable at that date.

Employees
        covered by collective bargaining agreements -

Approximately
        28% of the Company’s full-time employees are covered by collective bargaining
        agreements at February 28, 2007. Agreements expiring within one year cover
        approximately 10% of the Company’s full-time employees.

Legal
        matters -

In
        the
        course of its business, the Company is subject to litigation from time to
        time.
        Although the amount of any liability with respect to such litigation cannot
        be
        determined, in the opinion of management, such liability will not have a
        material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of
        operations or cash flows.

15.

STOCKHOLDERS’
        EQUITY:

Common
        stock -

The
        Company has two classes of common stock: Class A Common Stock and Class B
        Convertible Common Stock. Class B Convertible Common Stock shares are
        convertible into shares of Class A Common Stock on a one-to-one basis at
        any
        time at the option of the holder. Holders of Class B Convertible Common Stock
        are entitled to ten votes per share. Holders of Class A Common Stock are
        entitled to one vote per share and a cash dividend premium. If the Company
        pays
        a cash dividend on Class B Convertible Common Stock, each share of Class
        A
        Common Stock will receive an amount at least ten percent greater than the
        amount
        of the cash dividend per share paid on Class B Convertible Common Stock.
        In
        addition, the Board of Directors may declare and pay a dividend on Class
        A
        Common Stock without paying any dividend on Class B Convertible Common Stock.
        However, under the terms of the Company’s senior credit facility, the Company is
        currently constrained from paying cash dividends on its common stock. In
        addition, the indentures for the Company’s outstanding senior notes and senior
        subordinated notes may restrict the payment of cash dividends on its common
        stock under certain circumstances.

In
        July
        2005, the stockholders of the Company approved an increase in the number
        of
        authorized shares of Class A Common Stock from 275,000,000 shares to 300,000,000
        shares, thereby increasing the aggregate number of authorized shares of the
        Company’s common and preferred stock to 331,000,000 shares.


At
        February 28, 2007, there were 211,043,939 shares of Class A Common Stock
        and
        23,825,338 shares of Class B Convertible Common Stock outstanding, net of
        treasury stock.

Stock
        repurchase -

In
        February 2006, the Company’s Board of Directors replenished a June 1998 Board of
        Directors authorization to repurchase up to $100.0 million of the Company’s
        Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock. During the year ended
        February 28, 2007, the Company repurchased 3,894,978 shares of Class A Common
        Stock at an aggregate cost of $100.0 million, or at an average cost of $25.67
        per share. The Company used revolver borrowings under the June 2006 Credit
        Agreement to pay the purchase price for these shares. No shares were repurchased
        during the years ended February 28, 2006, and February 28, 2005. In February
        2007, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $500.0
        million of the Company’s Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock.

Between
        February 28, 2007, and April 27, 2007, the Company repurchased 2,457,200
        shares of Class A Common Stock pursuant to this authorization in open market
        transactions.

The
        aggregate cost of these shares was $55.1 million, or an average cost of $22.44
        per share. The Company used revolver borrowings under the 2006 Credit Agreement
        to pay the purchase price for these shares.

The
        Company may finance future share repurchases through cash generated from
        operations or through revolver borrowings under the 2006 Credit Agreement. 
The repurchased shares will become treasury shares.

Preferred
        stock -

During
        the year ended February 29, 2004, the Company issued 5.75% Series A Mandatory
        Convertible Preferred Stock (“Preferred Stock”). Dividends were cumulative and
        payable quarterly, if declared, in cash, shares of the Company’s Class A Common
        Stock, or a combination thereof, at the discretion of the Company. Dividends
        were payable, if declared, on the first business day of March, June, September,
        and December of each year, commencing on December 1, 2003. On September 1,
        2006,
        the

Preferred
        Stock was converted into 9,983,066 shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock.
        The September 1, 2006, conversion includes both mandatory conversions as
        well as
        optional conversions initiated during August 2006. No fractional shares of
        the
        Company’s Class A Common Stock were issued in the conversions.

Long-term
        stock incentive plan -

Under
        the
        Company’s Long-Term Stock Incentive Plan, nonqualified stock options, stock
        appreciation rights, restricted stock and other stock-based awards may be

        exercise price, vesting period and term of nonqualified stock options granted
        are established by the committee administering the plan (the “Committee”). The
        exercise price of any nonqualified stock option may not be less than the
        fair
        market value of the Company’s Class A Common Stock on the date of grant. Grants
        of stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and other stock-based awards
        may
        contain such vesting, terms, conditions and other requirements as the Committee
        may establish.

During
        the years ended February 28, 2007, February 28, 2006, and February 28, 2005,
        no
        stock appreciation rights were granted. During the years ended February 28,

        and
        5,330 shares of restricted Class A Common Stock were granted at a weighted
        average grant date fair value of $24.75 per share, $27.96 per share and $18.86
        per share, respectively.

-

Under
        the
        Company’s Incentive Stock Option Plan, incentive stock options may be granted to
        employees, including officers, of the Company. Grants, in the aggregate,
        may not
        exceed 8,000,000 shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock. The exercise
        price of any incentive stock option may not be less than the fair market
        value
        of the Company’s Class A Common Stock on the date of grant. The vesting period
        and term of incentive stock options granted are established by the Committee.
        The maximum term of incentive stock options is ten years.

        the
        Company used a projected expected life for each award granted based on
        historical experience of employees’ exercise behavior for similar type grants.
        Expected volatility for the years ended February 28, 2007, February 28, 2006,
        and February 28, 2005, is based on historical volatility levels of the Company’s
        Class A Common Stock. The risk-free interest rate for the years ended February
        28, 2007, February 28, 2006, and February 28, 2005, is based on the implied
        yield currently available on U.S. Treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining
        term equal to the expected life.

Employee
        stock purchase plans

-

The
        Company has a stock purchase plan under which 9,000,000 shares of Class A
        Common
        Stock may be issued. Under the terms of the plan, eligible employees may
        purchase shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock through payroll
        deductions. The purchase price is the lower of 85% of the fair market value
        of
        the stock on the first or last day of the purchase period. During the years
        ended February 28, 2007, February 28, 2006, and February 28, 2005, employees
        purchased 265,295 shares, 249,507 shares and 274,106 shares, respectively,
        under
        this plan.

The
        weighted average fair value of purchase rights granted during the years ended
        February 28, 2007, February 28, 2006, and February 28, 2005, was $5.50, $6.23
        and $4.98, respectively. The fair value of purchase rights granted is estimated
        on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the
        following weighted average assumptions:

The
        Company has a stock purchase plan under which 2,000,000 shares of the Company’s
        Class A Common Stock may be issued to eligible employees and directors of
        the
        Company’s U.K. subsidiaries. Under the terms of the plan, participants may
        purchase shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock through payroll
        deductions. The purchase price may be no less than 80% of the closing price
        of
        the stock on the day the purchase price is fixed by the committee administering
        the plan. During the years ended February 28, 2007, February 28, 2006, and
        February 28, 2005, employees purchased 52,842 shares, 92,622 shares and 74,164
        shares, respectively, under this plan. During the year ended February 28,
        2007,
        the Company granted purchase rights with a weighted average fair value of
        $11.22. The fair value of the purchase rights granted is estimated on the
        date
        of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following
        weighted average assumptions: expected purchase right life of 3.9 years,
        expected volatility of 27.9%, risk-free interest rate of 4.8% and expected
        dividend yield of 0%. The maximum number of shares which can be purchased
        under
        this grant is 396,803 shares. During the years ended February 28, 2006, and
        February 28, 2005, there were no purchase rights granted.


As
        of
        February 28, 2007, there was $42.9 million of total unrecognized compensation
        cost related to nonvested stock-based com

pensation
        arrangements granted under the Company’s four stock-based employee compensation
        plans. This cost is expected to be recognized in the Company’s Consolidated
        Statements of Income over a weighted-average period of 3.0 years.

With
        respect to the issuance of shares under any of the Company’s stock-based
        compensation plans, the Company has the option to issue authorized but unissued
        shares or treasury shares.

During

        of its cash flow hedges of forecasted foreign currency denominated transactions.
        As a result, the Company received $18.5 million in proceeds from the early
        termination of related foreign currency derivative instruments. As the
        forecasted transactions are still probable, this amount was recorded to AOCI
        and
        will be reclassified from AOCI into earnings in the same periods in which
        the
        original hedged items are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
        See
        Note 9 for discussion of $30.3 million cash proceeds received from the early
        termination of interest rate swap agreements in March 2005.

        of
        sales during these years. Accounts receivable from the Company’s largest
        customer, Southern Wine and Spirits, represented 13.0%, 11.0% and 10.2% of
        the
        Company’s total accounts receivable as of February 28, 2007, February 28, 2006,
        and February 28, 2005, respectively. Sales to the Company’s five largest
        customers are expected to continue to represent a significant portion of
        the
        Company’s revenues. The Company’s arrangements with certain of its customers
        may, generally, be terminated by either party with prior notice. The Company
        performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers’ financial position, and
        management of the Company is of the opinion that any risk of significant
        loss is
        reduced due to the diversity of customers and geographic sales
        area.

RESTRUCTURING
        AND RELATED CHARGES:

The
        Company has several restructuring plans within its Constellation Wines segment
        as follows:

Fiscal
        2004 Plan -

The
        further realignment of business operations and the Company’s plan to exit the
        commodity concentrate product line in the U.S., both announced during fiscal
        2004, (the “Fiscal 2004 Plan”). The Fiscal 2004 Plan consists of exiting the
        commodity concentrate product line located in Madera, California, and selling
        the Company’s Escalon facility located in Escalon, California. The decision to
        exit the commodity concentrate product line resulted from the fact that the
        line
        was facing declining sales and profits and was not part of the Company’s core
        beverage alcohol business. By exiting the commodity concentrate line, the
        Company was able to free up capacity at its winery in Madera, and move
        production and storage from Escalon to Madera, and forego further investment
        in
        its aging Escalon facility. The Fiscal 2004 Plan includes the renegotiation
        of
        existing grape contracts associated with commodity concentrate inventory,
        asset
        write-offs and severance-related costs. The Fiscal 2004 Plan has been completed
        as of February 28, 2007.


Robert
        Mondavi Plan -

The
        Company’s plan announced in January 2005 to restructure and integrate the
        operations of The Robert Mondavi Corporation (the “Robert Mondavi Plan”). The
        objective of the Robert Mondavi Plan is to achieve operational efficiencies
        and
        eliminate redundant costs resulting from the December 22, 2004, acquisition
        of
        Robert Mondavi. The Robert Mondavi Plan includes the elimination of certain
        employees, the consolidation of certain field sales and administrative offices,
        and the termination of various contracts. The Robert Mondavi Plan has been
        completed as of February 28, 2007.

Fiscal
        2006 Plan -

The
        Company’s worldwide wine reorganizations and the Company’s plan to consolidate
        certain west coast production processes in the U.S., both announced during
        fiscal 2006, (collectively, the “Fiscal 2006 Plan”). The Fiscal 2006 Plan’s
        principal features are to reorganize and simplify the infrastructure and
        reporting structure of the Company’s global wine business and to consolidate
        certain west coast production processes. This Fiscal 2006 Plan is part of
        the
        Company’s ongoing effort to enhance its administrative, operational and
        production efficiencies in light of its ongoing growth. The objective of
        the
        Fiscal 2006 Plan is to achieve greater efficiency in sales, administrative
        and
        operational activities and eliminate redundant costs. The Fiscal 2006 Plan
        includes the termination of employment of certain employees in various locations
        worldwide, the consolidation of certain worldwide wine selling and
        administrative functions, the consolidation of certain warehouse and production
        functions, the termination of various contracts, investment in new assets
        and
        the reconfiguration of certain existing assets. The Company expects the Fiscal
        2006 Plan to be complete by February 28, 2009.

Vincor
        Plan -

The
        Company’s plan announced in July 2006 to restructure and integrate the
        operations of Vincor (the “Vincor Plan”). The objective of the Vincor Plan is to
        achieve operational efficiencies and eliminate redundant costs resulting
        from
        the June 5, 2006, acquisition of Vincor, as well as to achieve greater
        efficiency in sales, marketing, administrative and operational activities.
        The
        Vincor Plan includes the elimination of certain employment redundancies,
        primarily in the United States, United Kingdom and Australia, and the
        termination of various contracts. The Company expects the Vincor Plan to
        be
        complete by February 28, 2009.

Fiscal
        2007 Wine Plan -

The
        Company’s plans announced in August 2006 to invest in new distribution and
        bottling facilities in the U.K. and to streamline certain Australian wine
        operations (collectively, the “Fiscal 2007 Wine Plan”). The U.K. portion of the
        plan includes new investments in property, plant and equipment and certain
        disposals of property, plant and equipment and is expected to increase wine
        bottling capacity and efficiency and reduce costs of transport, production
        and
        distribution. The U.K. portion of the plan also includes costs for employee
        terminations. The Australian portion of the plan includes the buy-out of
        certain
        grape supply and processing contracts and the sale of certain property, plant
        and equipment. The initiatives are part of the Company’s ongoing efforts to
        maximize asset utilization, further reduce costs and improve long-term return
        on
        invested capital throughout its international operations. The Company expects
        the Australian portion of the plan to be complete by February 29, 2008, and
        the
        U.K. portion of the plan to be complete by February 28, 2009.


For
        the
        year ended February 28, 2007, the Company recorded $32.5 million of
        restructuring and related charges associated with these plans. For the year
        ended February 28, 2006, the Company recorded $29.3 million of restructuring
        and
        related charges associated primarily with the Fiscal 2006 Plan and the Robert
        Mondavi Plan. Included in the $29.3 million of restructuring and related
        charges
        incurred for the year ended February 28, 2006, is $6.9 million of non-cash
        charges for stock-based compensation (which are excluded from the restructuring
        liability rollforward table below). For the year ended February 28, 2005,
        the
        Company recorded $7.6 million of restructuring and related charges associated
        with the Fiscal 2004 Plan and the Robert Mondavi Plan, which consists of
        $6.2
        million of restructuring charges and $1.4 million of other related restructuring
        charges.

Restructuring
        and related charges consisting of employee termination benefit costs, contract
        termination costs, and other associated costs are accounted for under either
        SFAS 112 or SFAS 146, as appropriate. Employee termination benefit costs
        are
        accounted for under SFAS 112, as the Company has had several restructuring
        programs which have provided employee termination benefits in the past. The
        Company includes employee severance, related payroll benefit costs such as
        costs
        to provide continuing health insurance, and outplacement services as employee
        termination benefit costs. Contract termination costs, and other associated
        costs including, but not limited to, facility consolidation and relocation
        costs
        are accounted for under SFAS 146. Per SFAS 146, contract termination costs
        are
        costs to terminate a contract that is not a capital lease, including costs
        to
        terminate the contract before the end of its term or costs that will continue
        to
        be incurred under the contract for its remaining term without economic benefit
        to the entity. The Company includes costs to terminate certain operating
        leases
        for buildings, computer and IT equipment, and costs to terminate contracts,
        including distributor contracts and contracts for long-term purchase
        commitments, as contract termination costs. Per SFAS 146, other associated
        costs
        include, but are not limited to, costs to consolidate or close facilities
        and
        relocate employees. The Company includes employee relocation costs and equipment
        relocation costs as other associated costs.

        and
        $50.5 mi

llion
        of
        liabilities for exit costs, respectively, as of the respective acquisition
        date.
        The Robert Mondavi acquisition line item in the table above for the year
        ended
        February 28, 2006, reflects adjustments to the fair value of liabilities
        assumed
        in the acquisition. As of February 28, 2007, the balances of the

Vincor
        and

Robert
        Mondavi purchase accounting accruals were $19.3 million and $5.4 million,

ACQUISITION-RELATED
        INTEGRATION COSTS:

For
        the
        year ended February 28, 2007, the Company recorded $

23.6

million
        of acquisition-related integration costs associated primarily with the Vincor
        Plan. The Company defines acquisition-related integration costs as nonrecurring
        costs incurred to integrate newly acquired businesses after a business
        combination which are incremental to those of the Company prior to the business
        combination. As such, acquisition-related integration costs include, but
        are not
        limited to, (i) employee-related costs such as salaries and stay bonuses
        paid to
        employees of the acquired business that will be terminated after their
        integration activities are completed, (ii) costs to relocate fixed assets
        and
        inventories, and (iii) facility costs and other one-time costs such as external
        services and consulting fees. For the year ended February 28, 2007,
        acquisition-related integration costs included $

9.8

million
        of employee-related costs and $

13.8

million
        of facilities and other one-time costs. For the years ended February 28,
        2006,
        and February 28, 2005, the Company recorded $16.8 million and $9.4 million,
        respectively, of acquisition-related integration costs associated with the
        Robert Mondavi Plan.

        (primarily foreign subsidiaries) (“Subsidiary Nonguarantors”), as if the new
        Subsidiary Nonguarantors and the new Subsidiary Guarantors had been in place
        as
        of and for all periods presented. The Subsidiary Guarantors are wholly owned
        and
        the guarantees are full, unconditional, joint and several obligations of
        each of
        the Subsidiary Guarantors. Separate financial statements for the Subsidiary
        Guarantors of the Company are not presented because the Company has determined
        that such financial statements would not be material to investors. The
        accounting policies of the parent company, the Subsidiary Guarantors and
        the
        Subsidiary Nonguarantors are the same as those described for the Company
        in the
        Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Note 1 and include the recently
        adopted accounting pronouncements described in Note 2. There are no restrictions
        on the ability of the Subsidiary Guarantors to transfer funds to the Company
        in
        the form of cash dividends, loans or advances.

BUSINESS
        SEGMENT INFORMATION:

As
        a
        result of the Company’s investment in Crown Imports, the Company has changed its
        internal management financial reporting to consist of three business divisions,
        Constellation Wines, Constellation Spirits and Crown Imports. Prior to the
        investment in the joint venture, the Company’s internal management financial
        reporting included the Constellation Beers business division. Consequently,
        the
        Company reports its operating results in five segments: Constellation Wines
        (branded wine, and U.K. wholesale and other), Constellation Beers (imported
        beer), Constellation Spirits (distilled spirits), Corporate Operations and
        Other
        and Crown Imports (imported beer). Segment results for Constellation Beers
        are
        for the period prior to January 2, 2007, and segment results for Crown Imports
        are for the period on and after January 2, 2007. Amounts included in the
        Corporate Operations and Other segment consist of general corporate
        administration and finance expenses. These amounts include costs of executive
        management, corporate development, corporate finance, human resources, internal
        audit, investor relations, legal, public relations,

global
        information technology and global strategic sourcing

.
        Any
        costs incurred at the corporate office that are applicable to the segments
        are
        allocated to the appropriate segment. The amounts included in the Corporate
        Operations and Other segment are general costs that are applicable to the
        consolidated group and are therefore not allocated to the other reportable
        segments. All costs reported within the Corporate Operations and Other segment
        are not included in the chief operating decision maker’s evaluation of the
        operating income performance of the other operating segments.


The
        new
        business segments reflect how the Company’s operations are managed, how
        operating performance within the Company is evaluated by senior management
        and the structure of its internal financial reporting. In addition, the Company
        excludes acquisition-related integration costs, restructuring and related
        charges and unusual items that affect comparability from its definition of
        operating income for segment purposes. The financial information for the
        years
        ended February 28, 2006, and February 28, 2005, has been restated to conform
        to
        the new segment presentation.

For
        the
        year ended February 28, 2007, acquisition-related integration costs,
        restructuring and related charges and unusual costs consist of restructuring
        and
        related charges of $32.5 million associated primarily with the Fiscal 2007
        Wine
        Plan and Fiscal 2006 Plan; the flow through of inventory step-up of $30.2
        million associated primarily with the Company’s acquisition of Vincor;
        acquisition-related integration costs of $23.6 million associated primarily
        with
        the Vincor Plan; other charges of $16.3 million associated with the Fiscal
        Wine Plan and Fiscal 2006 Plan included within selling, general and
        administrative expenses; loss on the sale of the branded bottled water business
        of $13.4 million; financing costs of $11.9 million related primarily to the
        Company’s new senior credit facility entered into in connection with the Vincor
        acquisition; foreign currency losses of $5.4 million on foreign denominated
        intercompany loan balances associated with the Vincor acquisition; the flow
        through of adverse grape cost (as described below) of $3.1 million associated
        with the acquisition of Robert Mondavi; and accelerated depreciation costs
        and
        the write-down of certain inventory of $6.6 million and $0.6 million,
        respectively, associated primarily with the Fiscal 2006 Plan and Fiscal 2007
        Wine Plan. Adverse grape cost represents the amount of historical inventory
        cost
        on Robert Mondavi’s balance sheet that exceeds the Company’s estimated ongoing
        grape cost and is primarily due to the purchase of grapes by Robert Mondavi
        prior to the acquisition date at above-market prices as required under the
        terms
        of their existing grape purchase contracts. For the year ended February 28,
        2006, acquisition-related integration costs, restructuring and related charges
        and unusual costs consist of restructuring and related charges associated
        primarily with the Fiscal 2006 Plan and the Robert Mondavi Plan of $29.3
        million; the flow through of adverse grape cost, acquisition-related integration
        costs and the flow through of inventory step-up associated primarily with
        the
        Company’s acquisition of Robert Mondavi of $23.0 million, $16.8 million, and
        $7.9 million, respectively; accelerated depreciation costs and other charges
        associated with the Fiscal 2006 Plan of $13.4 million and $0.1 million,
        respectively; and costs associated with professional service fees incurred
        for
        due diligence in connection with the Company’s evaluation of a potential offer
        for Allied Domecq of $3.4 million. For the year ended February 28, 2005,
        acquisition-related integration costs, restructuring and related charges
        and
        unusual costs consist of financing costs associat

ed
        with
        the redemption of the Company’s Senior Subordinated Notes (as defined in Note 9)

and
        the
        repayment

of the
        Company’s prior senior credit facility in connection with the Robert Mondavi
        acquisition of $31.7 million

;
        the
        flow through of adverse grape cost and acquisition-related integration costs
        associated with the Robert Mondavi acquisition of $9.8 million and $9.4 million,
        respectively; restructuring and related charges of $7.6 million associated
        with
        the Fiscal 2004 Plan and the Robert Mon

davi
        Plan; and the flow through of inventory step-up associated primarily with
        the
        acquisition of all of the outstanding capital stock of BRL Hardy Limited,
        now
        known as Hardy Wine Company Limited (the “

Hardy
        Acquisition”) of $6.4 million; partially offset by a net gain on the sale of
        non-strategic assets of $3.1 million and a gain related to the receipt of
        a
        payment associated with the termination of a previously announced potential
        fine
        wine joint venture of $3.0 million.

The
        Company evaluates performance based on operating income of the respective
        business units. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those
        described for the Company in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
        in
        Note 1 and include the recently adopted accounting pronouncements described
        in
        Note 2. Transactions between segments consist mainly of sales of products
        and
        are accounted for at cost plus an applicable margin.

ACCOUNTING
        PRONOUNCEMENTS NOT YET ADOPTED:

In
        July
        2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48 (“FIN No. 48”),
“Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes - an interpretation of FASB
        Statement No. 109.” FIN No. 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in
        income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements in accordance
        with FASB Statement No. 109. FIN No. 48 prescribes a recognition threshold
        and
        measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement
        of
        a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Additionally,
        FIN
        No. 48 provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and
        penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The
        Company
        is required to adopt FIN No. 48 for fiscal years beginning March 1, 2007,
        with
        the cumulative effect of applying the provisions of FIN No. 48 reported as
        an
        adjustment to opening retained earnings.

The
        Company is continuing to evaluate the financial impact of adopting FIN No.
        48 on
        its consolidated financial statements. However, the Company does not expect
        the
        adoption of FIN No. 48 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial
        statements.

In
        September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
        No.
        157 (“SFAS No. 157”), “Fair Value Measurements.” SFAS No. 157 defines fair
        value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted
        accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
        SFAS No. 157 emphasizes that fair value is a market-based measurement, not
        an
        entity-specific measurement, and states that a fair value measurement should
        be
        determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing
        the asset or liability. The Company is required to adopt SFAS No. 157 for
        fiscal
        years and interim periods beginning March 1, 2008. The Company is currently
        assessing the financial impact of SFAS No. 157 on its consolidated financial
        statements.

In
        September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
        No.
        158 (“SFAS No. 158”), “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
        Other Postretirement Plans - an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88,
        106,
        and 132(R).” SFAS No. 158 requires companies to recognize the overfunded or
        underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan (other than a
        multiemployer plan) as an asset or liability in its balance sheet and to
        recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes
        occur
        through comprehensive income. The Company has adopted this provision of SFAS
        No.
        158 and has provided the required disclosures as of February 28, 2007. SFAS
        No.
        158 also requires companies to measure the funded status of a plan as of
        the
        date of the company’s fiscal year-end (with limited exceptions), which provision
        the Company is required to adopt as of February 28, 2009. The Company does
        not
        expect the adoption of the remaining provision of SFAS No. 158 to have a
        material impact on its consolidated financial statements.


In
        February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
        No.
        159 (“SFAS No. 159”), “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
        Liabilities - Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115.” SFAS No. 159
        permits companies to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain
        other items at fair value. Most of the provisions in SFAS No. 159 are elective;
        however, the amendment to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
        115,
“Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities”

,

applies
        to all entities with available-for-sale and trading securities. The fair
        value
        option established by SFAS No. 159 allows companies to choose to measure
        eligible items at fair value at specified election dates. The Company will
        report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option
        has
        been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. The fair value
        option: (i) may be applied instrument by instrument, with a few exceptions,
        such
        as investments otherwise accounted for by the equity method; (ii) is irrevocable
        (unless a new election date occurs); and (iii) is applied only to entire
        instruments and not to portions of instruments. The Company is required to
        adopt
        SFAS No. 159 for fiscal years beginning after February 28, 2009. The Company
        does not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 159 to have a material impact on
        its
        consolidated financial statements.

SUBSEQUENT
        EVENTS:

Acquisition
        of Svedka -

On
        March
        19, 2007, the Company acquired the SVEDKA Vodka brand (“Svedka”) in connection
        with the acquisition of Spirits Marque One LLC and related business (the
“Svedka
        Acquisition”) for cash consideration of $383.7 million, net of cash acquired. In
        addition, the Company expects to incur direct acquisition costs of approximately
        $1.0 million. Svedka is a premium vodka produced in Sweden and is the fastest
        growing major imported premium vodka in the U.S. Svedka is the fifth
        largest imported vodka in the U.S. The purchase price was financed
        with revolver borrowings under the Company’s senior credit
        facility.

The
        results of operations of the Svedka business will be reported in the
        Constellation Spirits segment and will be included in the consolidated results
        of operations of the Company from the date of acquisition.

Investment
        in Matthew Clark -

On
          April
          17, 2007, the Company and Punch Taverns plc (“Punch”) commenced operations of a
          joint venture for the U.K. wholesale business (“Matthew Clark”). The U.K.
          wholesale business was formerly owned entirely by the Company. Under the
          terms
          of the arrangement, the Company and Punch, directly or indirectly, each
          have a
          50% voting and economic interest in Matthew Clark. The Company received
          $178.8
          million of cash proceeds from the formation of the joint venture, subject
          to a
          post-closing adjustment.

Upon
        formation of the joint venture, the Company discontinued consolidation of
        the
        U.K. wholesale business and accounts for the investment in Matthew Clark
        under
        the equity method. Accordingly, the results of operations of Matthew Clark
        will
        be included in the equity in earnings of equity method investees line in
        the
        Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income from the date of
        investment.

In
