Significant Developments

As part of our efforts to focus and grow our core
businesses, we have taken the following significant measures in recent years.

Acquisition of Elcos AG.

In February 2005, we acquired Elcos AG, a leading European designer and manufacturer of custom light emitting diode, or LED, solutions for biomedical and industrial applications. The
transaction combines Elcos’ visible LED technology platform and strong customer and application base with our global sales, application and support organization, therefore expanding the sales growth opportunities for the Elcos technology.

American Job Creation Act.

The homeland investment
provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act enacted October 22, 2004, provides us with the opportunity to repatriate earnings from our foreign subsidiaries in a more tax and cash flow efficient manner.

Computer-To-Plate Business.

In September 2004, our Board of Directors
approved a plan to shut down our Computer-To-Plate business as part of our continued efforts to focus on higher growth opportunities. We reflected this business as a discontinued operation for all periods presented in this annual report on Form
10-K. The abandonment of this business resulted in a $1.0 million pre-tax loss related to a write-down of fixed assets and inventory. We recognized this loss during fiscal 2004 as a loss on the disposition of discontinued operations.



Electroformed Products and Ultraviolet Lighting Businesses.

In June 2004, our Board of Directors
approved, and we executed, separate plans to shut down our Electroformed Products business and sell our Ultraviolet Lighting business as part of our continued efforts to focus on higher growth opportunities. We reflect these businesses as
discontinued operations for all periods presented in this annual report on Form 10-K. The net assets of the Electroformed Products business were written off, resulting in a $1.6 million pre-tax loss in fiscal 2004. We sold the fixed assets and
inventory of the Ultraviolet Lighting business in July 2004 for their approximate book value.

Fluid Sciences

Our Fluid Sciences business provides a variety of precision valves, seals,
bellows and pneumatic joints for critical fluid control and containment systems for highly demanding environments such as turbine engines and semiconductor fabrication facilities. This business has an extensive network of strategic alliances with
major original equipment manufacturers worldwide. For fiscal 2004, our Fluid Sciences business generated sales of $243.8 million.



In the aerospace market, we are a leading provider of sealing and pneumatic systems for large commercial
transport aircraft, military, business and regional jets. Most major aircraft and turbine engine manufacturers use our products to reduce leakage and improve reliability. For example, we design and produce high-pressure accumulators used to moderate
pressure in hydraulic systems that provide additional hydraulic power when heavy demands are placed on the system. New fleet orders and maintenance on existing aircraft generally create demand for our aerospace products and services.

In the semiconductor equipment market, we provide components, sub-assembly
integration and processing services to many of the world’s leading semiconductor equipment manufacturers. Our bellows sealing and linear motion devices are used on wafer-processing equipment manufactured by the world’s leading
semiconductor equipment manufacturers. Building upon our understanding of our customers’ needs, we have expanded our product offerings to include a broad range of assemblies and related after-market services used in semiconductor
wafer-processing equipment and maintenance.

We also provide
static and dynamic seals that reduce emissions and improve efficiency on many new power generation equipment platforms. Our fluid testing business has been providing fuel and lubricant testing services for almost 50 years to the gasoline refining

Marketing

All of our businesses market their products and services directly through their own specialized sales forces. As of January 2, 2005, we had approximately
2,600 internally employed sales and service representatives operating in approximately 40 countries and marketing products and services in approximately 125 countries. In addition, in geographic regions where we do not have a sales and service
presence, we utilize distributors to sell our products.

Raw Materials and
Supplies

Each of our businesses uses raw materials and
supplies that are generally readily available in adequate quantities from domestic and foreign sources. We typically do not have long-term contracts with any of our suppliers. In some cases, we may rely on a single supplier for particular items,
although we believe that we could obtain these items from alternative suppliers, if necessary.

Intellectual Property

We own numerous United States and foreign patents and have patent applications pending in the United States and abroad. We also license intellectual property rights to and from third parties, some of which bear royalties and are terminable
in specified circumstances. In addition to our patent portfolio, we possess a wide array of unpatented proprietary technology and know-how. We also own numerous United States and foreign trademarks, registered trademarks and trade names for a
variety of our product names, and have applications for the registration of trademarks and trade names pending in the United States and abroad. We believe that patents and other proprietary rights are important to the development of each of our
reporting segments, but we also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain the competitive position of each of our reporting segments. We do not believe that the loss
of any one patent or other proprietary right would have a material adverse effect on our overall business or on any of our reporting segments.

In some cases, we may participate in litigation or other proceedings to defend against or assert claims of infringement, to enforce our patents or our
licensors’ patents, to protect our trade secrets, know-how or other intellectual property rights, or to determine the scope and validity of our or third parties’ intellectual property rights. Litigation of this type could result in
substantial cost to us and diversion of our resources. An adverse



outcome in any litigation or proceeding could subject us to significant liabilities or expenses, require us to cease using disputed intellectual property or
cease the sale of a commercial product or require us to license the disputed property from third parties. We are currently one of several parties defending litigation brought by Enzo Biochem, Inc. and Enzo Life Sciences, Inc. alleging that our Life
and Analytical Sciences business breached our distributorship and settlement agreements with the plaintiffs, infringed the plaintiffs’ patents, engaged in unfair competition and fraud and committed torts against the plaintiffs by, among other
things, engaging in commercial development and exploitation of the plaintiffs’ patented products and technology, separately and together with the other defendants. See “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” for a discussion of this matter.

Backlog

We believe that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects for any of our business units due to the
short lead time required on a majority of our sales. Therefore, we believe that backlog information is not material to an understanding of our business.

Competition

Because of the wide range of our products and services, we face many different types of competition and competitors. This affects our ability to sell our
products and services and the prices at which these products and services are sold. Our competitors range from large foreign and domestic organizations that produce a comprehensive array of goods and services and that may have greater financial and
other resources than we do, to small firms producing a limited number of goods or services for specialized market segments.

In our Life and Analytical Sciences reporting segment, we compete on the basis of service level, price, technological innovation, product differentiation,
product availability and quality and reliability. Competitors range from multinational organizations with a wide range of products to specialized firms that in some cases have well- established market niches. We expect the proportion of large
competitors in this reporting segment to increase through the continued consolidation of competitors.

We do not believe any single competitor competes directly with our Optoelectronics reporting segment across its full product range. However, we do compete
with specialized manufacturing companies in the manufacturing and sale of specialty flashtubes and ultraspecialty lighting sources, photodetectors and photodiodes and switched power supplies. Competition is based on price, technological innovation,
operational efficiency, and product reliability and quality.

Competition in our Fluid Sciences reporting segment is typically based on product performance and innovation, quality, service and price. In a few markets, competitors are large, diversified engineering and manufacturing concerns. Most of
our competitors, however, are small specialized manufacturing companies offering limited product lines for narrow market segments. Competition for lubricant testing services is primarily from one large non-profit institute and some customer-owned
laboratories, and is mainly based on quality and price.

We
believe we compete effectively in each of the areas in which our businesses experience competition.

Research and Development

PerkinElmer-sponsored research and development expenditures were approximately $87.1 million during fiscal 2004, approximately $81.4 million during fiscal 2003 and approximately $85.0 million during fiscal 2002.

We directed our research and development efforts in both 2004 and 2003
primarily toward genetic screening and biopharmaceutical end markets within our Life and Analytical Sciences reporting segment and medical digital imaging and Cermax Lighting within our Optoelectronics reporting segment.



Environmental Matters

Our operations are subject to various foreign, federal, state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations. These requirements include those
governing emissions and discharges of hazardous substances, the remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater, the regulation of radioactive materials and the health and safety of our employees.

We may have liability under the Comprehensive Environmental Response
Compensation and Liability Act, and comparable state statutes that impose liability for investigation and remediation of contamination without regard to fault, in connection with materials that we or our former businesses sent to various third-party
sites. We have incurred, and expect to incur, costs pursuant to these statutes.

We are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at current and former locations and, along with other companies, have been named a potentially responsible party for specific waste
disposal sites. We accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period in which our responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated. We have accrued $3.8 million as of January 2, 2005, representing management’s
estimate of the total cost for the ultimate disposition of known environmental matters. This amount is not discounted and does not reflect the potential recovery of any amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements. These cost estimates
are subject to a number of variables, including the stage of the environmental investigations, the magnitude of the possible contamination, the nature of the potential remedies, possible joint and several liability, the timeframe over which
remediation may occur and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations. We expect that these accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to ten years. As assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site, we
review these liabilities and adjust them to reflect additional information as it becomes available. There have been no environmental problems to date that have had or that we expect to have a material effect on our financial position, results of
operations or cash flows. While it is possible that we may incur a material loss exceeding the amounts recorded, we do not expect the potential exposure to be materially different than the amounts recorded.

We may become subject to new or unforeseen environmental costs or
liabilities. Compliance with new or more stringent laws or regulations, stricter interpretations of existing laws or the discovery of new contamination could cause us to incur additional costs.

Employees

As of January 2, 2005, we employed approximately 10,000 employees. Several of our subsidiaries are parties to contracts with
labor unions and workers’ councils. As of January 2, 2005, we employed an aggregate of approximately 2,100 union and workers’ council employees. We consider our relations with employees to be satisfactory.

square feet of leased space in Wellesley, Massachusetts. We conduct our other operations in manufacturing and assembly plants, research laboratories,
administrative offices and other facilities located in 12 states and 36 foreign countries.

Facilities outside of the United States account for approximately 1,481,000 square feet of our owned and leased property, or approximately 46% of our total occupied space.

Our real property leases are both short-term and long-term. We believe that
our properties are well-maintained and are adequate for our present requirements.

The following table indicates, as of January 2, 2005, the approximate square footage of real property owned and leased attributable to the continuing operations of each of our reporting segments:

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

We are subject to various claims, legal proceedings and investigations covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities. Each of these matters is subject to various
uncertainties, and it is possible that some of these matters may be resolved in a manner that is unfavorable to us. In addition:

Our subsidiary, EG&G Rocky Flats, Inc., and two other companies were served with a complaint in January 2000 naming EG&G Rocky Flats, Inc. as a
defendant in a civil false claim action pending in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado, involving alleged false claims arising out of security issues at the United States Department of Energy’s Rocky Flats Plant. In
response to a motion filed by the United States Department of Justice, the District Court dismissed the case. In February 2004, the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed the District Court’s dismissal of the case.
Further appeals are possible.

In papers dated July 1, 2002,
Kevin Hatch filed a purported class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, Civil Action No. 02-11314 GAO, against PerkinElmer, Inc. and certain of our senior officers, on behalf of himself and
purchasers of our common stock between July 15, 2001 and April 11, 2002. The lawsuit seeks an unspecified amount of damages and claims violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of, and Rule 10b-5 under, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
alleging various statements made during the putative class period by PerkinElmer and its management were misleading with respect to our prospects and future operating results. At least eleven virtually identical lawsuits subsequently have been filed
in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts against PerkinElmer. The Court granted the plaintiffs’ motion to consolidate these matters, and on January 13, 2003, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. On February
25, 2003, we and the other defendants filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit. The motion was opposed by the plaintiffs, and oral arguments concerning the motion took place on May 5, 2003. On September 30, 2003, the Court issued a memorandum and order
denying the motion to dismiss. On October 10, 2003, we and the other defendants filed a motion for reconsideration or, in the alternative, for an order allowing immediate appeal of several issues of law to the appellate court. On October 23, 2003,
the plaintiffs filed an opposition to the motion for reconsideration. Our and the other defendants’ answers to the amended complaint were filed on November 6, 2003. On September 7, 2004, the Court issued a memorandum and order denying the
defendants’ motion for reconsideration or, in the alternative, for an order allowing immediate appeal of several issues of law to the appellate court.

In papers dated June 28, 2004, David Jaroslawicz filed a purported derivative action in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts
against certain of our senior officers and four of our directors, and nominal defendant PerkinElmer seeking unspecified damages and purporting to make claims of breach of fiduciary duty, gross negligence, breach of contract, breach of duty of
loyalty and unjust enrichment. At least one



virtually identical derivative action was subsequently filed in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. On August 24, 2004, the
plaintiffs filed a motion to consolidate the cases. The derivative complaints contain allegations similar to those included in the Hatch matter described above, in addition to claims that certain defendants engaged in insider trading and that
members of our audit committee breached their duties to us by failing to establish and maintain an adequate system of internal controls to assure that proper revenue recognition practices were being followed. On January 28, 2005, the parties to the
derivative actions filed a joint stipulation and proposed pretrial order, agreeing to consolidate the cases and proposing a schedule for filing a consolidated derivative complaint and responsive pleadings.

In papers dated October 23, 2002, Enzo Biochem, Inc. and Enzo Life Sciences,
Inc. filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Civil Action No. 02-8448, against Amersham PLC, Amersham BioSciences, PerkinElmer, Inc., PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Inc., Sigma-Aldrich Corporation,
Sigma Chemical Company, Inc., Molecular Probes, Inc., and Orchid BioSciences, Inc. The six count complaint alleges that we have breached our distributorship and settlement agreements with Enzo, infringed Enzo’s patents, engaged in unfair
competition and fraud, and committed torts against Enzo by, among other things, engaging in commercial development and exploitation of Enzo’s patented products and technology, separately and together with the other defendants. Enzo seeks
injunctive and monetary relief. On May 28, 2003, the Court severed the lawsuit and ordered Enzo Life Sciences to serve individual complaints against the five defendants. Enzo Life Sciences served its new complaint on July 16, 2003, and we
subsequently filed an answer denying the substantive allegations and including a counterclaim alleging that several of Enzo’s patents are invalid.

On October 17, 2003, Amersham Biosciences Corp. filed a complaint, which was subsequently amended, in the United States District Court for New Jersey,
Civil Action No. 03-4901, against our subsidiary, PerkinElmer LAS, Inc., alleging that our ViewLux

™

and certain of our Image FlashPlates

™

infringe three of Amersham’s patents related to high-throughput screening. On August 18, 2004, Amersham Plc filed a complaint against two of our United Kingdom based subsidiaries,
PerkinElmer Life Sciences (UK) Ltd. and PerkinElmer LAS (UK) Ltd., in the Patent Court of the English High Court of Justice, Case No. 04C02688, alleging that the same PerkinElmer products infringe Amersham’s European (United Kingdom) patent
granted in August 2004. Amersham seeks injunctive and monetary relief in both cases. We subsequently filed an answer in both cases denying the substantive allegations and including affirmative defenses and counterclaims. On October 29, 2003,
PerkinElmer LAS, Inc. filed a complaint, which was subsequently amended, against Amersham Biosciences Corp. in the United States District Court for Massachusetts, Civil Action No. 03-12098, alleging that Amersham’s IN Cell Analyzer,
LEADseeker

™

Multimodality Imaging system and
certain Cyclic AMP and IP3 assays infringe two of our patents related to high-throughput screening. We seek injunctive and monetary relief. Amersham subsequently filed an answer denying the substantive allegations and including affirmative defenses
and counterclaims.

On June 14, 2002, we sold our Security and
Detection Systems business to L-3 Communications Corporation. L-3 and several of its affiliates have been named as defendants in litigation arising out of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. Among the claims in that litigation are
allegations that there were defects in the products of the Security and Detection Systems business that we sold to L-3. L-3 has asserted that we are contractually obligated to indemnify L-3 for any liability it may incur as a result of that
litigation. By letter dated January 20, 2005, L-3 has agreed to release us from any and all claims relating to the events of September 11, 2001. L-3 also agreed to irrevocably withdraw its claim for indemnification. In exchange for this release and
withdrawal of indemnification, we have agreed to join as a plaintiff in a lawsuit filed by L-3 in the Superior Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Civil Action No. 03-05810-BLS1 against Reveal Imaging Technologies and former employees of
PerkinElmer. The lawsuit alleges that the defendants breached their obligations under agreements with PerkinElmer, including their obligations to assign to our Security and Detection Systems business (now owned by L-3) the inventions they made while
employed by such business.

We intend to defend ourselves
vigorously in all of the above matters. We are currently unable, however, to determine whether resolution of any or all of these matters will have a material adverse impact on our financial position or consolidated results of operations.

Overview

We are a leading provider of scientific instruments, consumables and services to the pharmaceutical, biomedical, environmental testing and general
industrial markets. We design, manufacture, market and service products and systems within three businesses, each constituting one reporting segment:

•

Life and Analytical Sciences.

We are a leading provider of drug discovery, genetic screening and environmental and chemical analysis tools, including instruments, reagents,
consumables and services.

•

Optoelectronics.

We provide a broad range of digital imaging, sensor and specialty lighting components used in the biomedical, consumer products and other specialty end
markets.

•

Fluid Sciences.

We provide a variety of precision valves, seals, bellows and pneumatic joints for critical control and containment systems for highly demanding environments
such as turbine engines and semiconductor fabrication equipment.

Formation of our Life and Analytical Sciences Business Unit

We combined our Life Sciences and Analytical Instruments businesses to form our Life and Analytical Sciences business in the fourth quarter of 2002 to improve our operational scale, which we believe is enabling us to
better serve our customers and more fully capitalize on the strengths of the combined businesses’ sales, service and research and development organizations. In the second quarter of 2003, we completed many of the changes involved in combining
the two businesses, including the integration of facilities and management reporting and other systems.

Accounting Period

Our fiscal year ends on the Sunday nearest December 31. We report fiscal years under a 52/53 week format. Under this method, certain years will contain 53 weeks. The fiscal year ended January 2, 2005 included 53 weeks. The fiscal years
ended December 28, 2003 and December 29, 2002 included 52 weeks. We believe that this additional week of operations had a $2.9 million beneficial impact on revenue and an immaterial impact on operating profit.

Consolidated Results of Continuing Operations

Sales

2004 Compared to 2003.

Sales for 2004 were
$1,687.2 million, versus $1,532.1 million during 2003, an increase of $155.1 million, or 10%. Changes in foreign exchange rates, primarily the Euro, increased sales by approximately $47.1 million in 2004, as compared to 2003. The overall increase in
sales reflects a $59.1 million, or 6%, increase in our Life and Analytical Sciences segment sales, which grew from $1,003.7 million in 2003 to



$1,062.8 in 2004, and reflects approximately $39.2 million in sales attributable to favorable changes in foreign exchange rates, as compared to 2003. Our
Optoelectronics segment sales grew $31.9 million, or 9%, from $348.7 million in 2003 to $380.6 million in 2004, including approximately $6.5 million in sales attributable to favorable changes in foreign exchange rates, as compared to 2003. The Fluid
Sciences segment grew sales by $64.1 million, or 36%, from $179.7 million in 2003 to $243.8 million in 2004, including approximately $1.4 attributable to favorable changes in foreign exchange rates, as compared to 2003.

2003 Compared to 2002.

Sales for 2003 were
$1,532.1 million, versus $1,501.0 million during 2002, an increase of $31.1 million, or 2%. Changes in foreign exchange rates, primarily the Euro, increased sales by approximately $73.0 million in 2003, as compared to 2002. The overall increase in
sales reflects a $12.0 million, or 1%, increase in our Life and Analytical Sciences segment sales, which grew from $991.7 million in 2002 to $1,003.7 in 2003, and includes approximately $61.0 million in sales attributable to favorable changes in
foreign exchange rates, as compared to 2002. Our Optoelectronics segment sales grew $28.9 million, or 9%, from $319.8 million in 2002 to $348.7 million in 2003, including approximately $10.0 million in sales attributable to favorable changes in
foreign exchange rates, as compared to 2002. The increased sales in our Life and Analytical Sciences and Optoelectronics segments were offset by a decrease in sales of $9.8 million, or 5%, in our Fluid Sciences segment, which declined from $189.5
million in 2002 to $179.7 million in 2003. Changes in foreign exchange rates increased Fluid Sciences segment sales by approximately $2.4 million in 2003, as compared to 2002.

Cost of Sales

2004 Compared to 2003.

Cost of sales for 2004 was $1,006.7 million, versus $900.8 million for 2003, an increase of $105.9
million, or 11.8%. As a percentage of sales, cost of sales increased to 59.7% in 2004 from 58.8% in 2003, resulting in a decrease in gross margin of 90 basis points from 41.2% in 2003 to 40.3% in 2004. The decrease in gross margin was largely
attributable to greater revenue contribution, as a percentage of overall sales, from Optoelectronics and Fluid Sciences versus Life and Analytical Sciences. Although our Optoelectronics and Fluid Sciences segments have lower gross margins than our
Life and Analytical Sciences segment, they also have lower operating expenses as a percentage of sales.

2003 Compared to 2002.

Cost of sales for 2003 was $900.8 million, versus $898.5 million for 2002, an increase of $2.3
million, or 0.2%. As a percentage of sales, cost of sales decreased to 58.8% in 2003 from 59.9% in 2002, resulting in an increase in gross margin of 110 basis points from 40.1% in 2002 to 41.2% in 2003. The 110 basis point increase in gross margin
was primarily attributable to a 2002 $17.2 million inventory adjustment charge recorded within our Optoelectronics segment. We did not record a similar charge in 2003.

Research and Development Expenses

2004 Compared to 2003.

Research and development expenses for 2004 were $87.1 million versus
$81.4 million in 2003, an increase of $5.7 million, or 7%. As a percentage of sales, research and development expenses decreased to 5.2% in 2004 from 5.3% in 2003, due to the increase in sales. We directed research and development efforts during
2004 and 2003 primarily toward genetic screening and biopharmaceutical end markets within our Life and Analytical Sciences reporting segment and medical digital imaging and Cermax lighting within our Optoelectronics reporting segment. We expect our
research and development spending to increase in 2005 and to continue to emphasize the health sciences end markets.

2003 Compared to 2002.

Research and development expenses for 2003 were $81.4 million versus $85.0 million in 2002, a
decrease of $3.6 million, or 4%. As a percentage of sales, research and development expenses decreased to 5.3% in 2003 from 5.7% in 2002, primarily due to our consolidation of research and development activities to take advantage of increased
synergies and corresponding cost savings as a result of fewer sites. We directed research and development efforts during 2003 and 2002 primarily toward genetic screening and biopharmaceutical end markets within our Life and Analytical Sciences
reporting segment, and medical digital imaging and industrial sensors within our Optoelectronics reporting segment.



Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

2004 Compared to 2003.

Selling, general and
administrative expenses for 2004 were $387.5 million, versus $386.0 million for 2003, an increase of $1.5 million, or 0.4%. As a percentage of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 220 basis points to 23.0% in 2004 from 25.2%
in 2003. The decrease as a percentage of sales of 220 basis points in 2004 was predominately due to net productivity improvements and cost reductions in our Life and Analytical Sciences reporting segment.

2003 Compared to 2002.

Selling, general and
administrative expenses for 2003 were $386.0 million, versus $430.8 million for 2002, a decrease of $44.8 million, or 10%. As a percentage of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 350 basis points to 25.2% in 2003 from 28.7%
in 2002. Proportionately, the decrease as a percentage of sales of 350 basis points in 2003 was due to a 200 basis point decrease attributable to reduced expenses in Life and Analytical Sciences, a 100 basis point decrease in Optoelectronics and a
50 basis point decrease in Fluid Sciences. The overall decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to productivity improvements throughout our company, including cost savings we derived from restructuring actions.

Restructuring (Reversals) Charges, Net

2004 Compared to
2003.

Restructuring charges for 2004 were zero versus $3.5 million of net reversals for 2003. The 2003 reversals comprised a combination of our 2003 changes in estimates of $5.8 million and our 2003 charges of $2.3
million. The following table summarizes our restructuring accrual balances and related activity by restructuring plan during 2004, 2003 and 2002:

Q2 2003 Plan:

During 2003, we incurred a $2.3 million restructuring charge in Life and
Analytical Sciences and Optoelectronics, which we refer to as our “Q2 2003 Plan”. The purpose of the restructuring was to further improve performance and take advantage of synergies between our former Life Sciences and Analytical
Instruments businesses which we began integrating in the fourth quarter of 2002. The principal actions in this restructuring plan included lower headcount due to the continued integration of the Life and Analytical Sciences business in a European
manufacturing and customer care center as well, as headcount reduction at one of the Optoelectronics manufacturing facilities to reflect recent declining demand for several product lines. We planned to reduce headcount by 120. We recorded
restructuring charges by segment for 2003 as follows:

(In millions)

Life and Analytical Sciences

Optoelectronics

Total

Q2 2003 Plan

$2.0

$0.3

$2.3

This restructuring
charge was primarily recorded in the second quarter of 2003. However, we recorded additional charges of $0.5 million and $0.1 million in the third and fourth quarters of 2003, as required by SFAS 146, as some employees who were notified of their
employment termination in the second quarter were required to work for a period of time prior to receiving their severance. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2003, we



recorded a pre-tax restructuring reversal of $0.4 million due to 30 fewer employee terminations as a result of higher attrition rates in several countries
prior to ultimate termination and, accordingly, lower severance costs.

During 2004, we completed all actions under the Q2 2003 Plan, with the exception of a headcount reduction of one person that we expect to complete by the second quarter of 2005.

Q4 2002 Plan:

In connection with our decision to combine our Life Sciences and Analytical Instruments businesses in order to reduce costs and achieve operational
efficiencies, we recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of $26.0 million during the fourth quarter of 2002, which we refer to as our Q4 2002 Plan. The Q4 2002 Plan allowed us to combine many business functions worldwide, with the intention to
better serve our customers and more fully capitalize on the strengths of the businesses’ sales, service and research and development organizations. The principal actions in the Q4 2002 Plan included planned workforce reductions of 546 people,
closure of approximately 20 facilities and disposal of underutilized assets.

The Q4 2002 Plan resulted in the integration of our United States Life and Analytical Sciences sales, service and customer care centers, the integration of European customer care and finance centers, the merging of a
former Life Sciences European manufacturing facility with a former Analytical Instruments European manufacturing facility, and the merging of a portion of a former Life Sciences research and development facility in Europe with a former Analytical
Instruments facility in Europe.

During 2003, we expended $13.8
million to execute these actions. In addition, we recorded a reversal of $6.2 million in the Q4 2002 Plan due to 182 fewer terminations as a result of higher than expected employee attrition rates in several countries prior to ultimate termination
and lower severance costs for actual terminations.

During
2004, we expended an additional $3.3 million to execute these actions. The remaining liability associated with the Q4 2002 Plan represents severance related to 11 employees and ongoing lease commitments. We expect to settle the remaining severance
liability by the end of the first quarter of 2005. Our current estimate is that our lease commitments on unoccupied buildings vary in length but primarily extend until mid-2005.

Q1 2002 Plan:

During the first quarter of 2002, our management developed a plan to restructure several businesses. We refer to these activities as our Q1 2002 Plan. The
plan resulted in pre-tax restructuring charges totaling $9.2 million. The principal actions in the Q1 2002 Plan included planned workforce and overhead reductions resulting from reorganization activities, including the closure of a manufacturing
facility, disposal of underutilized assets and general cost reductions.

Q1 2002 Plan charges in our Life and Analytical Sciences segment totaled $5.5 million. These charges comprised $4.4 million in severance costs, $1.0 million in asset impairments and $0.1 million in lease commitments. The charges were a
result of actions we took as a response to decreased sales of components in our Life and Analytical Sciences business. These actions under the charges primarily included the downsizing of an additional manufacturing location and streamlining of the
global sales and research and development organizations, primarily in Europe, Japan and the Pacific Rim. We took these actions to reduce the number of employees in components of our business that had experienced declining demand.

Q1 2002 Plan charges in our Optoelectronics segment totaled $3.7 million,
comprising $3.5 million in severance costs and $0.2 million in asset write-offs. This charge was primarily due to the removal of a layer of management structure within our Optoelectronics reporting segment which led to a flatter and less expensive
organization structure.

Total headcount was reduced by 276.



During 2003, we recorded a restructuring reversal of $1.0 million in the Q1 2002 Plan primarily due to
lower than expected employee separation costs associated with our Optoelectronics segment.

During 2004, we expended $0.1 million to complete the remaining actions associated with the Q1 2002 Plan.

Q4 2001 Plan:

During the fourth quarter of 2001, in connection with the integration of Packard and a restructuring of our sales offices in Europe, we recorded a
restructuring charge of $9.2 million in our Life and Analytical Sciences segment and incurred $1.6 million in charges in 2002. We refer to these activities as our Q4 2001 Plan. The principal actions in the Q4 2001 Plan included the closing or
consolidation of several leased sales and services offices in Europe, as well as costs associated with the closure of a manufacturing facility in Europe, the closure of leased manufacturing facilities in the United States and the disposal of related
assets.

In 2003, we recorded an additional pre-tax
restructuring charge associated with the Q4 2001 Plan of $1.8 million. This charge was primarily due to additional severance and severance related benefits of the previously identified employees associated with the closure of our European
manufacturing facility in the Life and Analytical Sciences segment.

In 2004, we expended $1.0 million to execute the actions associated with the Q4 2001 Plan. We will pay the remaining balance in 2005 for previously identified employees associated with the closure of our European manufacturing facility in
the Life and Analytical Sciences segment.

(Losses) Gains
on Dispositions

2004 Compared to
2003.

Dispositions resulted in a net loss of $0.4 million in 2004 versus a net gain of $2.7 million in 2003. Loss on dispositions in 2004 included a $0.7 million loss from the sale of a business and was partially offset by
a $0.3 million gain from the sale of facilities. Gains on dispositions in 2003 included $2.2 million from sales of facilities and $0.5 million from post closing adjustments relating to the resolution of contingencies related to the sale of our
Instruments for Research and Applied Sciences business, which we refer to as IRAS.

2003 Compared to 2002.

Dispositions resulted in a net gain of $2.7 million in 2003 versus a net gain of $5.2 million in 2002. Gains on dispositions in 2002 included $4.4 million from the
sale of facilities and $0.8 million from post closing entries relating to our sale of our IRAS business, which was formerly part of our Life and Analytical Sciences segment.

Amortization of Intangible Assets

2004 Compared to 2003.

Amortization of intangible assets was $28.5 million in 2004 and $28.3
million in 2003. Slight increases in the Life and Analytical Sciences amortization due to the effect of foreign exchange were partially offset by slight decreases in Fluid Sciences amortization.

2003 Compared to 2002.

Amortization of
intangible assets was $28.3 million for both 2003 and 2002. Slight increases in the Life and Analytical Sciences amortization due to the effect of foreign exchange were offset by slight decreases in Optoelectronics and Fluid Sciences amortization.



Interest and Other Expense, Net

Interest and other expense, net consisted of the following:

2004 Compared to

.    Interest and other expense, net for 2004 was $40.3 million versus $56.4 million for 2003, a decrease of $16.1 million or 29%. The decrease in interest and other expense, net in 2004 as compared to 2003, was due
primarily to approximately $100.0 million of lower average outstanding term loan balances combined with lower interest rates applicable to our term loan due to an amendment of our credit facility in the fourth quarter of 2003. A more complete
discussion of our liquidity is set forth below under the heading, “Liquidity and Capital Resources.” The remaining decrease in interest and other expense was the result of (i) swapping $100 million of our 8.875% Notes from fixed rate debt
to a floating rate based on six-month USD Libor in January 2004, resulting in a $2.2 million decrease in interest expense, and (ii) $2.3 million of net interest expense not incurred in 2004 as it was related to our zero coupon convertible debentures
which we redeemed in 2003. The decrease in interest and other expense was partially offset by our increased acceleration of debt issuance costs of $4.1 million resulting from partial prepayments of our term debt during 2004 versus $1.9 million in
2003. We expect interest expense in 2005 to decrease due to lower outstanding debt balances and the expected benefit derived from the January 2005 swapping of an additional $100 million of our 8.875% Notes from fixed rate debt to a floating rate
based on six-month USD Libor.

2003 Compared to

.    Interest and other expense, net for 2003 was $56.4 million versus $32.9 million for 2002, an increase of $23.5 million or 71%. The increase in interest and other expense, net in 2003 as compared to 2002, was due
primarily to higher average borrowing rates resulting from our financing completed in December 2002. The remaining increase in interest and other expense, net of $3.0 million was due primarily to our increased acceleration of the amortization of
debt issuance costs of $1.9 million resulting from partial prepayments of our term debt during 2003 versus $0.4 million in 2002 and $0.6 million of transaction costs we incurred in the fourth quarter of 2003 in connection with amending our credit
facility to reduce the margin applicable to our term loan.

Provision/Benefit for Income Taxes

2004 Compared to 2003.

The 2004 provision for income taxes was $38.5 million, versus a provision of $27.5 million in 2003. The 2004 effective tax rate was 28.2% as compared to the 2003 effective tax rate of
32.2%. The change in the effective tax rate was primarily due to $10.4 million of benefit associated with the resolution of our successful appeal in 2004 of an Internal Revenue Service audit finding with respect to our 1997 and 1998 taxes,
additional benefits resulting from the conclusion of Canadian and U.K. tax audits, reduction in state tax expense and our use of existing, and our reduced generation of new, net operating losses. These benefits were partially offset by an accrual of
$8.7 million for the estimated U.S. tax cost of repatriation calculated under the homeland investment provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.

2003 Compared to 2002.

The 2003 provision for income taxes was $27.5 million, versus a benefit of $3.5 million in 2002. Our
2003 effective tax rate was 32.2% as compared to our 2002 effective tax rate of 69.7%. The change in our effective tax rate was primarily due to a relatively high ratio in 2002 of permanent tax differences to loss from continuing operations before
income taxes.



Discontinued Operations

We recorded the following gains and losses, which we report as the loss on dispositions of discontinued operations, during the years ended January 2,
2005 and December 28, 2003:

As part of our
continued efforts to focus on higher growth opportunities, in June 2004, we approved a plan to shut down our Electroformed Products business and sell our Ultraviolet Lighting business. In September 2004, we approved a plan to shut down our
Computer-To-Plate business. We previously had reported the results of all three of these businesses as part of the Optoelectronics reporting segment. We have accounted for these businesses as discontinued operations in accordance with SFAS No. 144
and, accordingly, have presented the results of operations and related cash flows as part of discontinued operations for all periods presented. The assets and liabilities of these businesses have been presented separately and are reflected within
the assets and liabilities from discontinued operations in the accompanying balance sheets as of January 2, 2005 and December 28, 2003. The net assets of the Electroformed Products business were written off resulting in a $1.6 million pre-tax loss
for the year ended January 2, 2005. We sold the fixed assets and inventory of the Ultraviolet Lighting business in July 2004 for their approximate book value. The abandonment of the Computer-To-Plate business resulted in a $1.0 million write-down of
fixed assets and inventory which we recognized in our loss on dispositions for the year ended January 2, 2005.

During 2004 and 2003, we settled various claims under certain long-term contracts and transition services with our Technical Services business, which we
sold in August 1999. The net settlement and the reversal of certain previously established contingencies resulted in pre-tax gains of $1.5 million in 2004 and $6.5 million in 2003 that are included in gain (loss) on dispositions of discontinued
operations. We reversed contingencies in the period in which the related issues were resolved. We may increase or reverse remaining contingencies in the future, pending resolution of the underlying matters.

In June 2002, we completed the sale of our Security and Detection Systems
business for cash consideration of approximately $100.0 million and a net working capital adjustment. We recorded a net pre-tax gain of approximately $15.0 million pursuant to this transaction in 2002 as a gain on the disposition of discontinued
operations. We accounted for our Security and Detection Systems business as a discontinued operation in accordance with APB No. 30, and accordingly, the results of operations and related cash flows of this business through the disposal date were
segregated from continuing operations and reported as a separate line on our consolidated income statements. We have presented the resulting gain from the sale as a component of net income within dispositions of discontinued operations, net of
income tax on our 2002 consolidated income statement. Adjustments relating to this sale resulted in a pre-tax loss from discontinued operations of $2.4 million in 2003, primarily due to revised estimates of the working capital adjustment.

In June 2002, our Board of Directors approved a plan to shut
down our Telecommunications Components business as of June 30, 2002 and a plan to sell our Entertainment Lighting business as part of our continued efforts to focus on higher growth opportunities. We have reflected both businesses as discontinued
operations in



our consolidated financial statements. As of June 29, 2003, we had exited our Entertainment Lighting business, completing the sale of a substantial portion
of that business for cash consideration of $1.4 million and abandoning the remaining assets. We recorded a gain of $0.3 million in fiscal 2004 and a net loss of $2.0 million in fiscal 2003 pursuant to this transaction.

Summary operating results of the discontinued operations of the Security and
Detection Systems, Telecommunications Component, Entertainment Lighting, Electroformed Products, Ultraviolet Lighting and Computer-To-Plate businesses for the periods prior to disposition were as follows:

Effect of Accounting Change

As required by SFAS 142, we completed the transitional
impairment analysis of our recorded goodwill as of January 1, 2002. In connection with the adoption of this standard, we reviewed our forecasts and projections of all of our reporting units and determined that, based on decreased demand for certain
specialty lamps resulting from a downturn in the printed circuit board production worldwide and other smaller markets, the fair value of the lighting reporting unit was less than its carrying value. With the assistance of valuation specialists and
using a discounted cash flow model, we determined that the carrying value of the recorded goodwill was in excess of the fair value of that goodwill. As a result, we recorded an impairment charge totaling $117.8 million as a cumulative effect of an
accounting change. The entire transition adjustment related to our lighting reporting unit within our Optoelectronics reporting segment. In addition, as part of our ongoing compliance with SFAS No. 142, we completed our annual assessment of goodwill
using a measurement date of January 3, 2005. This annual assessment did not result in an impairment charge.

Acquisitions and Divestitures

In February 2005, we acquired Elcos AG, a leading European designer and manufacturer of custom light emitting diode, or LED, solutions for biomedical and industrial applications. The transaction combines Elcos’ visible LED technology
platform and strong customer and application base with our global sales, application and support organization, therefore expanding the sales growth opportunities for the Elcos technology. Consideration for the transaction was approximately $15.1
million in cash at the time of closing with additional consideration of approximately $1.4 million due through fiscal 2007. In addition, potential earn out payments of up to approximately $8.2 million may be made based on the future performance of
the business.

In November 2001, we completed our acquisition
of Packard BioScience Company. The integration activities are complete with the exception of $0.4 million in remaining payments due on leased facilities exited in 2001 that will be paid through 2005. These integration activities are linked to the Q4
2001 Plan and are disclosed in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.



The following table summarizes integration reserve activity during 2004, 2003 and 2002 related to the
acquisition of Packard:

Contingencies

We are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial
actions at our current and former locations and, along with other companies, have been named a potentially responsible party for certain waste disposal sites. We accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period that our responsibility is
established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated. We have accrued $3.8 million as of January 2, 2005, representing our management’s estimate of the total cost of ultimate disposition of known environmental matters. This amount is not
discounted and does not reflect any recovery of any amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements. These cost estimates are subject to a number of variables, including the stage of the environmental investigations, the magnitude of the
possible contamination, the nature of the potential remedies, possible joint and several liability, the timeframe over which remediation may occur, and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations. For sites where we have been named a
potentially responsible party, our management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute. We expect that such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period
of up to ten years. As assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site, these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available. There have been no environmental problems to date
that have had or are expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. While it is possible that a material loss exceeding the amounts recorded may be incurred, we do not expect the potential exposure to
be materially different from the amounts we recorded.

We and
certain of our officers have been named as defendants in a class action lawsuit filed in July 2002, and we and certain officers and directors have been named as defendants in purported derivative lawsuits filed in June and July 2004. The plaintiffs
in all of these suits have alleged, among other things, various statements made by the Company and management, during the same time period for all three suits, were misleading with respect to our prospects and future operating results. Further
information with respect to these lawsuits is contained in

Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings

of this annual report. We believe we have meritorious defenses to these lawsuits and are contesting the actions vigorously. We are currently unable,
however, to reasonably estimate the amount of the loss, if any, that may result from the resolution of these matters.

We previously received a notice from the Internal Revenue Service asserting federal income tax deficiencies for 1997 and 1998. The Company and the
Internal Revenue Service resolved these matters in 2004. As a result of the settlement, we have reversed the reserves of $10.4 million that had been established in accordance with FAS 5 based on our previous assessment of the resolution of these
matters, which assessment was less favorable than the ultimate outcome.

We are under regular examination by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities in the United States and other countries, such as Canada, Finland, and the United Kingdom, and states in which we have significant business
operations, such as California and New York. The tax years under examination vary by



jurisdiction; for example, the IRS is currently examining 1999 through 2002. Assuming current progress, we expect the IRS examination to be completed in
fiscal 2005. We regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments in each of the taxing jurisdictions resulting from these and subsequent years’ examinations. Tax reserves have been established, which we believe to be adequate in
relation to the potential for additional assessments. Once established, reserves are adjusted as information becomes available and when an event occurs requiring a change to the reserves. The resolution of tax matters will not have a material effect
on our consolidated financial condition, although such settlement could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and consolidated statement of income for a particular future period.

Reporting Segment Results of Continuing Operations

Life and Analytical Sciences

2004 Compared to 2003.

Sales for 2004 were
$1,062.8 million, versus $1,003.7 million in 2003, an increase of $59.1 million, or 6%. Changes in foreign exchange rates, primarily the Euro, increased sales by approximately $39.2 million in 2004, as compared to 2003. The following analysis
compares significant sales by market and product type for 2004, as compared to 2003, and includes the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Sales to environmental and chemical analysis customers increased $24.8 million, OneSource

™

service sales increased by $20.4 million, sales to
genetic screening customers increased $11.4 million, and sales to biopharmaceutical customers increased $2.5 million. Service revenue included approximately $2.9 million for the additional week in the 2004 fiscal year. Sales by type of product
included increases in sales of instruments of $33.5 million, service of $20.4 million, and consumables of $5.2 million.

Operating profit for 2004 was $103.6 million, versus $94.7 million in 2003, an increase of $8.9 million. Research and development increased $3.5 million
in 2004, as compared to 2003. Contributing to the increase were net cost savings associated with various productivity initiatives, including our restructuring and integration activities which resulted in a reduction of employees and the elimination
of excess facilities. Offsetting these net cost savings were a $1.9 million restructuring reversal in 2003 for which there was no similar reversal in 2004, and dispositions which created a $0.8 million loss in 2004 versus dispositions which created
a $1.6 million gain in 2003. Amortization of intangibles was $26.4 million for the year ended January 2, 2005, versus $26.0 million for the year ended December 28, 2003.

2003 Compared to 2002.

Sales for 2003 were $1,003.7 million, versus $991.7 million in 2002, an
increase of $12.0 million, or 1%. Changes in foreign exchange rates, primarily the Euro, increased sales by approximately $61.0 million in 2003, as compared to 2002. The favorable effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations was offset in part by
reduced unit sales volume. The following analysis compares significant sales by market and product type for 2003, as compared to 2002, and includes the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Sales to environmental and chemical analysis
customers increased $22.7 million, sales to genetic screening customers increased $6.3 million and our OneSource

™

laboratory service sales increased by $14.8 million. These increases were offset by a $31.8 million decrease in sales to biopharmaceutical customers, primarily in sales of liquid
handling instruments and radiochemical reagents, as general biopharmaceutical market demand remained weak throughout 2003. Sales by type of product included increases in sales of consumables of $23.5 million, and service of $14.8 million, partially
offset by decreases in sales of instruments of $26.3 million.

Operating profit for 2003 was $94.7 million, versus $27.4 million in 2002, an increase of $67.3 million. The increase in 2003 as compared to 2002, was primarily the result of approximately $43.0 million of overall cost savings in 2003
associated with restructuring and integration activities, mainly due to a reduction of employees and the elimination of excess facilities. The increase in operating profit in 2003, as compared to 2002, was also due to approximately $31.5 million of
net restructuring charges included in our results for 2002, compared to a net restructuring credit of $1.9 million in 2003. Amortization of intangibles was $26.0 million for the year ended December 28, 2003, versus $25.5 million for the year ended
December 29, 2002.



Optoelectronics

2004 Compared to 2003.

Sales for 2004 were $380.6 million, versus $348.7 million for 2003, an increase of $31.9 million,
or 9%. Changes in foreign exchange rates increased sales by approximately $6.5 million. The following analysis of significant sales by product line for 2004, as compared to 2003, includes the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates. Sales of
digital imaging products increased by $21.4 million due to increased sales of diagnostic and radiotherapy digital x-ray products. Sales of sensors, lithography, and fiber optic test product lines increased $15.0 million. Sales of specialty lighting
products decreased by $4.5 million due to lower photoflash sales into single-use cameras.

Operating profit for 2004 was $57.4 million, versus $46.8 million for 2003, an increase of $10.6 million. The increase in operating profit was primarily the result of increased sales volume, which increased operating
profit by approximately $11.5 million, and net productivity improvements and cost reduction actions of $14.0 million, both offset in part by pricing reductions of approximately $14.9 million. Amortization of intangible assets was $1.2 million for
2004 and 2003.

2003 Compared to
2002.

Sales for 2003 were $348.7 million, versus $319.8 million for 2002, an increase of $28.9 million, or 9%. Changes in foreign exchange rates increased sales by approximately $10.0 million. The following analysis of
significant sales by product line for 2003, as compared to 2002, includes the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates. Sales of specialty lighting products increased by $18.5 million due to growth in sales of flash products, and sales of
digital imaging products increased by $18.9 million due to increased sales of diagnostic and radiotherapy digital x-ray products. These increases were offset in part by sales decreases totaling $8.5 million in our sensors, lithography, and fiber
optic test product lines due to limited demand in these end markets.

Operating profit for 2003 was $46.8 million, versus an operating loss of $0.5 million for 2002, an increase of $47.3 million. The operating loss for 2002 includes a charge of $17.2 million for an inventory write down which was not repeated
in 2003. Fiscal 2003 included a net restructuring reversal of $1.8 million compared to a net restructuring charge of $3.7 million in 2002. Increased sales and productivity improvements, including improved manufacturing performance and reduced
operating expenses, and a headcount reduction of more than 200, reduced expenses by a total of approximately $20.0 million in 2003 compared to 2002. Amortization of intangible assets was $1.2 million for 2003 and $1.3 million for 2002.

Fluid Sciences

2004 Compared to 2003.

Sales for 2004 were
$243.8 million, versus $179.7 million for 2003, an increase of $64.1 million, or 36%. Changes in foreign exchange rates increased sales by approximately $1.4 million. The following analysis of significant sales by product line for 2004, as compared
to 2003, includes the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates. Sales increased $30.5 million in our semiconductor products due to increased demand, $28.9 million in aerospace products, and $4.7 million in fluid testing and energy technology
products.

Operating profit for 2004 was $38.2 million, versus
$17.9 million for 2003, an increase of $20.3 million, or 113%. The increase in operating profit resulted primarily from increased sales, shifting production to lower cost locations in Asia, other productivity improvements resulting from Six Sigma
and lean manufacturing initiatives. Amortization of intangible assets was $.9 million for 2004 and $1.1 million for 2003.

2003 Compared to 2002.

Sales for 2003 were $179.7 million, versus $189.5 million for 2002, a decrease of $9.8 million, or
5%. Changes in foreign exchange rates increased sales by approximately $2.4 million. The following analysis of significant sales by product line for 2003, as compared to 2002, includes the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates. Sales
decreased $4.4 million in our semiconductor products due to declining demand, and $2.7 million in our energy technology products. In addition, sales to our aerospace and fluid testing customers declined modestly by $1.7 million and $1.0 million,
respectively, in two difficult markets.



Operating profit for 2003 was $17.9 million, versus $17.5 million for 2002, an increase of $0.4 million,
or 2%. The increase in operating profit resulted primarily from shifting production to lower cost locations in Asia, cost controls, cost reduction actions and other productivity improvements resulting from Six Sigma and lean manufacturing
initiatives that more than offset an operating profit decrease due to reduced sales. Amortization of intangible assets was $1.1 million for 2003 and $1.5 million for 2002.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

We require cash to pay our operating expenses, make capital expenditures, service our debt and other long-term liabilities and pay dividends on our common
stock. Our principal sources of funds are from our operations and the capital markets, particularly the debt markets. In the near term, we anticipate that our operations will generate sufficient cash to fund our operating expenses, capital
expenditures, interest payments on our debt and dividends on our common stock. In the long-term, we expect to use internally generated funds and external sources to satisfy our debt and other long-term liabilities.

Principal factors that could affect the availability of our internally
generated funds include:

•

deterioration of sales due to weakness in markets in which we sell our products and services,

•

changes in our working capital requirements, and

•

our ability to successfully repatriate cash balances from our foreign subsidiaries for use in settling domestic obligations.

Principal factors that could affect our ability to obtain cash from external
sources include:

•

financial covenants contained in our borrowings that limit our total borrowing capacity,

•

increases in interest rates applicable to our outstanding variable rate debt,

•

a ratings downgrade that would limit our ability to borrow under our accounts receivable facility and our overall access to the corporate debt market,

•

volatility in the markets for corporate debt,

•

a decrease in the market price for our common stock, and

•

volatility in the public equity markets.

Cash Flows

Fiscal Year 2004

Operating Activities.

Net cash generated by continuing operations operating activities was $199.5 million in 2004.
Contributing to the generation of cash from operating activities during 2004 was net income from continuing operations of $98.3 million, depreciation and amortization of $76.2 million, and a decrease in working capital accounts of $4.9 million.
Contributing to the decrease in working capital in 2004 were decreases in accounts receivable of $14.6 million and inventory of $1.9 million, offset by decreases in accounts payable of $11.6 million. In general, accounts receivable collections
increased due primarily to our focus on improved processes and collections, whereas inventory balances decreased primarily due to improved logistics and inventory management processes. Accounts payable decreased primarily due to timing of payments.
There was no incremental use of our accounts receivable securitization facility during 2004. The outstanding amount under this facility totaled $45.0 million at both January 2, 2005 and December 28, 2003. As discussed under “Off-Balance Sheet
Arrangements”, we had approximately $20 million of undrawn capacity available under the facility at January 2, 2005.

Investing Activities.

Investing activities related to continuing operations used $12.3 million in 2004. In 2004, we made
capital expenditures of $19.0 million, mainly for tooling and productivity improvements and for



system and facility costs. We derived $3.4 million from sales of a building and equipment and $2.8 million from the settlement of an escrow related to an
entity acquired in 2000.

Financing
Activities

.

In 2004, we used $195.9 million of net cash in financing activities. Debt reductions during 2004 totaled $175.2 million, primarily comprising $175.0 million used to repay a portion of our term loan. We
also paid $35.8 million in dividends and received net cash proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options of $15.0 million in 2004.

Fiscal Year 2003

Operating Activities.

Net cash generated by continuing operations operating activities was $163.7 million in 2003.
Contributing to the generation of cash from operating activities during 2003 was net income from continuing operations of $57.9 million, depreciation and amortization of $79.5 million and a decrease in working capital accounts of $70.9 million.
Contributing to the decrease in working capital in 2003 were reductions in accounts receivable of $43.4 million and inventory of $28.2 million. In general, accounts receivable and inventory levels declined due to our focus on customer payment terms
as well as enhanced inventory management. Accounts receivable also decreased as a result of increased use of our accounts receivable securitization facility, which increased $16 million, from $29 million at December 29, 2002 to $45 million at
January 2, 2005. Cash outlays for accrued expenses, restructuring and other assets and liabilities totaled $46.0 million during 2003, primarily as a result of payments toward restructuring plans and other obligations. We expect our restructuring
expenditures to be reduced in 2004.

Investing
Activities.

In 2003, we withdrew $187.5 million of cash held in escrow to retire substantially all of our remaining outstanding indebtedness under our zero coupon convertible debentures. In 2003, we made capital
expenditures of $16.6 million mainly in the areas of tooling and productivity improvements along with system and facility costs related to integration activities. Net proceeds from the dispositions of businesses and fixed assets during 2003 were
$4.4 million. We derived $4.9 million of these proceeds from the sale of a building made redundant due to integration activities.

Financing Activities

.

In 2003, we used $298.4 million of net cash in financing activities. We expended $187.5 million
of cash withdrawn from our designated escrow account along with approximately $2.4 million of available cash to redeem our outstanding zero coupon convertible debentures. Debt reductions during 2003 also included $70.0 million of cash used to repay
a portion of our term loan. In December 2003, we amended our credit facility to, among other things, reduce the interest rate applicable to our term loan. We paid $4.4 million transaction in fees during 2003 in connection with that amendment. We
also paid $35.4 million in dividends and received net cash proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options of $3.6 million in 2003.

Borrowing Arrangements

Senior Secured Credit Facility.

In December 2002, we entered into a senior credit facility. This facility comprises a
six-year term loan in the amount of $315.0 million and a $100.0 million five-year revolving credit facility. In 2004, we made $175.0 million of principal payments on the term loan. Accordingly, at January 2, 2005 we had $70.0 million outstanding
under our term loan and no outstanding principal balance under our revolving credit facility at January 2, 2005 or at any other time.

Interest rates under the senior credit facility applicable to the term loan and to the revolving credit facility are determined as a margin over either
the Eurodollar rate or the base rate. The base rate is the higher of (1) the corporate base rate announced from time to time by Bank of America, N.A. and (2) the Federal Funds rate plus 50 basis points. The applicable margins for the term loan and
the revolving credit facility vary based upon our leverage ratio at the end of the prior quarter. The applicable margin as of January 2, 2005 was 200 basis points for the Eurodollar rate and 100 basis points for the base rate. We may allocate all or
a portion of our indebtedness under the senior credit facility to interest based upon the margin over the Eurodollar rate or the base rate. At



January 2, 2005, the Eurodollar rate was approximately 247 basis points and the base rate was 525 basis points resulting in a Eurodollar interest rate on the
senior credit facility of 447 basis points.

In October 2004,
we amended our senior credit facility to allow greater flexibility regarding acquisitions, stock repurchases, debt reduction and cash repatriation. The amount of permitted acquisitions and any related indebtedness was raised from $125 million to
$250 million. The amount of indebtedness related to acquisitions is subject to compliance with all financial covenants.

The term loan is repayable in mandatory nominal quarterly installments of $0.8 million of the outstanding balance until December 2007, and thereafter in
four equal quarterly installments of 25% of the then outstanding balance until December 2008. Additionally, annual principal payments as a percentage of excess cash flow, defined as a ratio based on our cash flow and leverage ratio in the credit
agreement, are payable six months following the end of each fiscal year. We are not required to make any such principal payment in 2005, with respect to our 2004 excess cash flow. In 2004, we made $175 million in principal payments on the term loan.
The revolving credit facility is available to us through December 2007 for our working capital needs. At no point in fiscal 2004 nor at any other time, did we have any outstanding principal balance under the revolving credit facility.

Our senior credit facility contains covenants that require us to maintain
specific financial ratios, including:

•

a minimum interest coverage ratio,

•

a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio,

•

a maximum senior leverage ratio, and

•

a maximum total leverage ratio.

As of January 2, 2005, and at all other times during fiscal 2004, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants.



/


% Notes.

In December 2002, we issued and sold ten-year senior subordinated notes at a rate
of 8


/


% with a face value of $300.0 million. We received $297.5 million in gross proceeds from the issuance. We
recorded deferred issuance costs of $7.0 million as a non-current asset. The debt, which matures in January 2013, is unsecured but is guaranteed by substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries. Interest on our 8


/


% notes is payable semi-annually on January 15 and July 15. In January 2004, we swapped the fixed rate on $100
million of these notes to a floating rate using swap instruments which reset semi-annually in arrears based upon six-month USD LIBOR and an applicable spread as defined in the swap agreements. In January 2005, we swapped an additional $100 million
of these notes from fixed rate to floating rate at similar terms to the January 2004 swap, and therefore we now pay the applicable six-month USD LIBOR rate, plus the applicable spread, on $200 million of our obligations represented by the notes.

If a change of control of our company
occurs, each holder of 8


/


% notes may require us to repurchase some or all of its notes at a purchase price
equal to 101% of the principal amount of the notes, plus accrued interest. Before January 15, 2006, we may redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount with the net proceeds of specified public equity offerings at 108.875% of the principal
amount of the notes, plus accrued interest, if at least 65% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes remains outstanding after the redemption. We may redeem some or all of our 8


/


% notes at any time on or after January 15, 2008, at a redemption price of 104.438%. The redemption price decreases to 102.958% on January 15, 2009, to
101.479% on January 15, 2010 and to 100% on January 15, 2011. The debt is subordinated to our senior credit facility. These notes contain financial and other covenants. Most of these covenants terminate if the notes obtain an investment grade rating
by Standard & Poor’s Rating Services and Moody’s Investors Service. At January 2, 2005, and at all times during fiscal 2004, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants.

Zero Coupon Convertible Debentures.

Through the
first quarter of 2003, we repurchased $344.7 million in accreted amount of our zero coupon convertible debentures due 2020 in open market purchases and through a



December 2002 tender offer. We redeemed the remaining $157.4 million of accreted value of zero coupon debentures on August 7, 2003 in accordance with their
terms. We used approximately $155.0 million held in escrow pursuant to the terms of our senior secured credit facility along with available cash of approximately $2.4 million, to redeem the zero coupon convertible debentures. As of December 28, 2003
the zero coupon convertible debentures had been fully retired.

6.8% Notes.

In December 2002, we initiated a tender offer for all of our outstanding 6.8% notes. We completed the tender offer and repurchased all but $4.7 million of these notes as of December 26, 2002. We
paid consent payments pursuant to a consent solicitation we made concurrently with the tender offer. The consent solicitation eliminated substantially all of the restrictive covenants contained in the indenture governing our 6.8% notes as of
December 29, 2002. We may from time to time repurchase outstanding 6.8% notes through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. The remaining $4.7 million in notes are due to be paid in October 2005.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Receivables Securitization Facility

In December 2001, we established a wholly owned consolidated subsidiary to
purchase, on a revolving basis, certain of our accounts receivable balances and simultaneously sell an undivided interest in this pool of receivables to a financial institution. In September 2003, we amended the facility to increase total funding
capacity from $50.0 million to $65.0 million to expand our sources of liquidity. Amounts funded under this facility were $45.0 million at both January 2, 2005 and December 28, 2003. As of January 2, 2005, we had approximately $20 million of undrawn
capacity available under the facility. The facility had an effective interest rate of approximately LIBOR plus 74 basis points as of January 2, 2005. The facility includes conditions that require us to maintain a senior unsecured credit rating of BB
or above, as defined by Standard & Poor’s Rating Services, and Ba2 or above, as defined by Moody’s Investors Service. At January 2, 2005, we had a senior unsecured credit rating of BB+ with a stable outlook from Standard &
Poor’s Rating Services, and of Ba2 with a positive outlook from Moody’s Investors Service. The facility expires on January 27, 2006.

Dividends

Our Board of Directors declared regular quarterly cash dividends of seven cents per share in each quarter of 2004 and 2003, resulting in an annual
dividend rate of 28 cents per share. Our senior credit facility and the indenture governing our outstanding 8


/


% senior subordinated notes contain restrictions that may limit our ability to pay our regular quarterly cash dividend in the future if we are unable to comply with certain financial covenants that primarily relate to cash flow.

Contractual Obligations

The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at January 2,
2005:



Capital Expenditures

During 2005, we expect to make capital expenditures of approximately $25 million to $35 million primarily to introduce new products, to improve our
operating processes, to shift the production capacity to lower cost locations, and to capitalize expenses related to internally developed information technology. We expect to use our available cash and internally generated funds to fund these
expenditures.

Future Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued
FASB No. 123R,

Share-Based Payment

. This Statement is a revision of SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,

and supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion, or APB, No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees,

and its related implementation guidance. SFAS No. 123R focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions. The Statement requires entities to recognize
stock compensation expense for awards of equity instruments to employees based on the grant-date fair value of those awards, with limited exceptions. SFAS No. 123R is effective for the first interim or annual reporting period that begins after June
15, 2005.

We expect to adopt SFAS No. 123R using the
Statement’s modified prospective application method. We expect our adoption of SFAS No. 123R to increase stock compensation expense. We are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of SFAS No. 123R will have on our financial results.

On November 29, 2004, the FASB issued Statement No. 151,

Inventory Costs

, an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4. Statement 151 clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted material. Statement 151 is effective for inventory costs incurred
during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. We are evaluating the potential impact, if any, the adoption of Statement 151 will have on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make
estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to bad debts,
inventories, intangible assets, income taxes, restructuring, pensions and other post-retirement benefits, contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable
under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different
assumptions or conditions.

We believe the following critical
accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements.

Revenue recognition.

We record product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price to the buyer is
fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. For products that include installation, if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element, we recognize product revenue upon delivery, and we delay recognition
of installation revenue until the installation is complete. For sales that include customer-specified acceptance criteria, we recognize revenue only after the acceptance criteria have been met. We defer revenue from services and recognize it over
the contractual period or as we render services and the customer accepts them. When arrangements include multiple elements, we use objective evidence of fair value to allocate revenue to the elements and recognize revenue when the criteria for
revenue recognition have been met for each element, all in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 00-21,

Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables

. Because the majority of our sales relate to specific



manufactured products or units rather than long-term customized projects, we generally do not experience significant changes in original estimates. Further,
we have not experienced any significant product returns or refunds or promotional allowances that require significant estimation.

Allowances for doubtful accounts.

We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers
to make required payments. We generally compute our allowance for doubtful accounts by (1) applying specific percentage reserves on accounts that are past due and deemed uncollectible; and (2) specifically reserving for customers known to be in
financial difficulty. Therefore, if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate beyond our estimates, we may have to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts. This would reduce our earnings.

Inventory valuation.

We initially value inventory at actual cost to
purchase and/or manufacture. We periodically review these values to ascertain that market value of the inventory continues to exceed its recorded cost. Generally, reductions in value of inventory below cost are caused by our maintenance of stocks of
products in excess of demand or technological obsolescence of the inventory. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand and, when necessary, record provisions for excess and obsolete inventory based on either our estimated forecast of product
demand and production requirements or historical trailing usage of the product. If our sales do not materialize as planned or at historic levels, we may have to increase our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory. This would reduce our earnings.
If actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated, inventory previously written down may be sold, resulting in lower costs of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period.

Value of long-lived assets, including intangibles.

We carry a variety
of long-lived assets on our balance sheet including property and equipment, investments, identifiable intangible assets and goodwill. We periodically review the carrying value of all of these assets based, in part, upon current estimated market
values and our projections of anticipated future cash flows. We undertake this review (1) on an annual basis for assets such as goodwill and non-amortizing intangible assets and (2) on a periodic basis for other long-lived assets when facts and
circumstances suggest that cash flows emanating from those assets may be diminished. Any impairment charge that we record reduces our earnings. The 2002 initial assessment of goodwill recoverability under SFAS No. 142 resulted in a $117.8 million
charge to our earnings. This charge, relating to goodwill in our lighting reporting unit within our Optoelectronics business segment, was caused by expected declines in profitability and cash flows as a result of softness in key end-markets. We
completed the annual impairment tests of goodwill for 2003 and 2004 and concluded that there was no impairment. While we believe that our estimates of current value are reasonable, different assumptions regarding items such as future cash flows and
the volatility inherent in markets which we serve could affect our evaluations and result in impairment charges against the carrying value of those assets. In addition, we currently evaluate the remaining useful life of our intangible assets that
are not being amortized at least annually to determine whether events or circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life. If events or circumstances indicate that the useful life of nonamortizing intangible assets are no longer
indefinite, the assets will be tested for impairment in accordance with SFAS 142. These intangible assets will then be amortized prospectively over their estimated remaining useful life and accounted for in the same manner as other intangible assets
that are subject to amortization.

Employee compensation and
benefits.

Retirement and post retirement benefit plans are a significant cost of doing business and represent obligations that will be ultimately settled far in the future and therefore are subject to estimation.
Retirement and post retirement benefit plan expenses are allocated to cost of sales, research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of operations. We incurred expenses of $9.1 million in 2004,
$6.2 million in 2003 and $3.9 million in 2002 for our retirement and post retirement plans. We expect expenses of approximately $12.8 million in 2005 for our retirement and post retirement plans. Pension accounting is intended to reflect the
recognition of future benefit costs over the employee’s approximate service period based on the terms of the plans and the investment and funding decisions made. We are required to make assumptions regarding such variables as the expected
long-term rate of return on assets and the discount rate applied to determine service cost and interest cost to arrive at pension income or



expense for the year. As of January 2, 2005, we estimated the expected long-term rate of return of assets in our pension portfolios in the United States was
8.5% percent, and was 7.5% percent for plans outside the United States. We have analyzed the rates of return on assets used and determined that these rates are reasonable based on the plans’ historical performance relative to the overall
markets in the countries where we invest the assets as well as our current expectations for long- term rates of returns for our pension assets. Our management will continue to assess the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption
for each plan based on relevant market conditions and will make adjustments to the assumptions as appropriate. Discount rate assumptions have been, and continue to be based on the prevailing market long-term interest rates at the measurement date.
If any of our assumptions were to change, our pension plan expenses would also change. A one percent decrease in the estimated return on plan assets would increase our pre-tax pension expense by $2.1 million for 2005 in the United States and by $0.7
million for 2005 for all plans outside the United States. We have reduced the volatility in our health care costs provided to our retirees by adopting a defined dollar plan feature. Under the defined dollar plan feature, our total annual liability
for health care costs to any one retiree is limited to a fixed dollar amount, regardless of the nature or cost of the health care needs of that retiree. Our maximum future liability therefore, cannot be increased by future changes in the cost of
health care.

Restructuring
activities.

Our financial statements detail specific charges relating to restructuring activities as well as the actual spending that has occurred against the resulting accruals. Our restructuring charges are estimates
based on our preliminary assessments of (1) severance benefits to be granted to employees, based on known benefit formulas and identified job grades, (2) costs to abandon certain facilities based on known lease costs of sub-rental income and (3)
asset impairments as discussed above under “Value of Long-Lived Assets, Including Intangibles.” Because these accruals are estimates, they are subject to change as a result of deviations from initial restructuring plans or subsequent
information that may come to our attention. For example, actual severance costs may be less than anticipated if employees voluntarily leave prior to the time at which they would be entitled to severance or if anticipated legal hurdles in foreign
jurisdictions prove to be less onerous than expected. In addition, unanticipated successes or difficulties in terminating leases and other contractual obligations may lead to changes in estimates. When such changes in estimates occur, they are
reflected in our financial statements on the income statement line entitled “restructuring charges, net”.

Gains or losses on dispositions.

When we record the disposition of an asset or discontinuance of an operation, we make an
estimate relative to the amount we expect to realize on the sale or disposition. This estimate is based on a variety of factors, including current interest in the market, alternative markets for the assets and other relevant factors. If anticipated
proceeds are less than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation, we record a loss. If anticipated proceeds are greater than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation, we recognize a gain net of expected contingencies when
the transaction has been consummated. Accordingly, we may realize amounts different than were first estimated. During the year ended January 2, 2005, we recognized $0.4 million in losses from disposition of a business and excess facilities. We also
recorded $0.5 million in losses from the disposition of discontinued operations comprised of gains from the final disposition of our Telecommunications Components and Technical Services businesses. These gains were offset by losses associated with
the disposition of our Electroformed Products and Computer-To-Plate businesses. Any such changes decrease or increase current earnings and are recorded either against the “gains on disposition” or “discontinued operations” line
items appearing in our income statement.

Income
taxes.

Our business operations are global in nature, and we are subject to taxes in more than 40 countries. Tax laws and tax rates vary substantially in these jurisdictions and are subject to change given the political and
economic climate in those countries. We report and pay income tax based on operational results and applicable law. Our tax provision contemplates tax rates in effect to determine both our current and deferred tax position. Any significant
fluctuation in rates or changes in tax laws could cause our estimates of taxes we anticipate either paying or recovering in the future to change. Such changes could lead to either increases or decreases in our effective tax rate.

Our tax positions are consistently subject to challenge by taxing authorities
throughout the world. Where appropriate, we reserve for tax matters where we believe that there is a significant likelihood of an



incremental liability being incurred. Any significant changes as a result of changes in underlying facts, law, tax rates, tax audit or review could lead to
adjustments in our effective tax rate or cash flow.

In
addition, we have established valuation allowances against a variety of deferred tax assets, including net operating loss carryforwards, foreign tax credits and other credits. Valuation allowances take into consideration our ability to ultimately
use these deferred tax assets and reduce the value of such items to the amount that is deemed to be recoverable. Improvements or other changes in our operations, domestically and internationally, could increase our ability to utilize these tax
attributes in the future. The release of valuation allowances in periods when these tax attributes become realizable would reduce our effective tax rate.

The FASB also issued FASB Staff Position, or FSP, No. 109-2,

Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within
the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004

. The American Jobs Creation Act introduces a special one-time dividends received deduction on the repatriation of specified foreign earnings to a U.S. taxpayer, provided criteria are met. FSP 109-2 provides
accounting and disclosure guidance for the repatriation provision. Until the Treasury Department or Congress provides additional clarifying language on key elements of the repatriation provision, the total amount of foreign earnings to be
repatriated by us cannot be determined and the presumption that such unremitted earnings will not be repatriated cannot be overcome. FSP 109-2 grants an enterprise additional time beyond the year ended December 31, 2004, in which the Act was
enacted, to evaluate the effects of the Act on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of unremitted earnings. FSP 109-2 calls for enhanced disclosures of, among other items, the status of a company’s evaluations, the effects of completed
evaluations, and the potential range of income tax effects of repatriations. Such disclosures are included in Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements.

Forward-Looking Information and Factors Affecting Future Performance

The following important factors affect our business and operations generally or affect multiple segments of our business and operations:

Economic, political and other risks associated with foreign operations
could adversely affect our international sales.

Because we sell our products worldwide, our businesses are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. Our sales originating outside the United States represented more than 50% of our total sales in the fiscal year
ended January 2, 2005. We anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total sales. In addition, many of our manufacturing facilities, employees and suppliers are located outside the
United States. Accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including:

•

changes in foreign currency exchange rates,

•

changes in a country’s or region’s political or economic conditions, particularly in developing or emerging markets,

•

longer payment cycles of foreign customers and difficulty of collecting receivables in foreign jurisdictions,

•

trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements,

•

differing tax laws and changes in those laws,

•

difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations,

•

differing labor laws and changes in those laws,

•

differing protection of intellectual property and changes in that protection, and

•

differing regulatory requirements and changes in those requirements.



If we do not introduce new products in a timely manner, our products could become obsolete and our
operating results would suffer.

We sell many of our
products in industries characterized by rapid technological change, frequent new product and service introductions, and evolving industry standards. Without the timely introduction of new products and enhancements, our products could become
technologically obsolete over time, in which case our sales and operating results would suffer. The success of our new product offerings will depend upon several factors, including our ability to:

•

accurately anticipate customer needs,

•

innovate and develop new technologies and applications,

•

successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner,

•

price our products competitively and manufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes and on time, and

•

differentiate our offerings from our competitors’ offerings.

Many of our products are used by our customers to develop, test and manufacture their products. Therefore, we must anticipate industry trends and develop
products in advance of the commercialization of our customers’ products. In developing new products, we may be required to make significant investments before we can determine the commercial viability of the new product. If we fail to
accurately foresee our customers’ needs and future activities, we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant sales.

In addition, some of our licensed technology is subject to contractual restrictions, which may limit our ability to develop
or commercialize products for some applications. For example, some of our license agreements are limited to the field of life sciences research, and exclude clinical diagnostics applications.

Our debt may adversely affect our cash flow and may restrict our
investment opportunities.

As of January 2, 2005, we
had approximately $374.6 million in outstanding indebtedness.

We have $100.0 million in additional borrowing capacity available to us under our revolving credit facility and $20 million under our receivable securitization program. We may also obtain additional long-term debt and working capital lines
of credit to meet future financing needs, which would have the effect of increasing our total leverage.

Our leverage could have negative consequences, including:

•

increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions,

•

limiting our ability to obtain additional financing,

•

limiting our ability to acquire new products and technologies through acquisitions or licensing, and

•

limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we compete.

Approximately $70 million of our indebtedness bears interest at floating
rates pursuant to the terms of the original agreements. However, after giving effect to the interest rate swaps entered into in January 2004 and January 2005, approximately $270 million of our indebtedness now bears interest at floating rates. As a
result, our interest payment obligations on this indebtedness will increase if interest rates increase.

Our ability to satisfy our obligations and to reduce our total debt depends on our future operating performance and on economic, financial, competitive
and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not



generate sufficient cash flow to meet these obligations or to successfully execute our business strategy. If we are unable to service our debt and fund our
business, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures or research and development expenditures, seek additional financing or equity capital, restructure or refinance our debt or sell assets. We may not be able to obtain additional
financing or refinance existing debt or sell assets on terms acceptable to us or at all.

Restrictions in our senior credit facility and the indenture governing our 8


/


% notes may limit our activities.

Our senior credit facility and the indenture relating to our 8


/


% notes contain, and future debt
instruments to which we may become subject may contain, restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit our company, including restrictions on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to:

•

incur additional indebtedness,

•

pay dividends on, redeem or repurchase our capital stock,

•

make investments,

•

create liens,

•

sell assets,

•

in the case of our restricted subsidiaries, incur obligations that restrict their ability to make dividend or other payments to us,

•

in the case of our restricted subsidiaries, guarantee or secure indebtedness,

•

enter into transactions with affiliates,

•

create unrestricted subsidiaries, and

•

consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.

We are also required to meet specified financial ratios under the terms of
our senior credit facility. Our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance, which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors, including factors that are beyond our
control such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates, changes in technology and changes in the level of competition.

Our failure to comply with any of these restrictions or covenants may result in an event of default under the applicable debt instrument, which could
permit acceleration of the debt under that instrument and require us to prepay that debt before its scheduled due date. Also, an acceleration of the debt under our senior credit facility would trigger an event of default under our 8


/


% notes, and a default under our 8


/


% notes would trigger an event of default under the senior credit facility and possibly other debt.

If an event of default occurs, we may not have sufficient funds available to
make the required payments under our indebtedness. If we are unable to repay amounts owed under our senior credit facility, those lenders may be entitled to foreclose on and sell the collateral that secures our borrowings under that agreement. Our
inability to repay amounts owed under our senior credit facility may also cause a default under other of our obligations including our accounts receivable securitization facility.

Our operating results may could be harmed by cyclical downturns affecting several of the industries into which we sell
our products.

Some of the industries and markets into
which we sell our products are cyclical. Industry downturns are often characterized by reduced product demand, excess manufacturing capacity and erosion of average selling



prices and profits. In the past, significant downturns in our customers’ markets and in general economic conditions have resulted in a reduced demand
for several of our products and have hurt our operating results. For example, during 2002, our operating results were reduced by downturns in many of the markets we serve, including the pharmaceutical, biomedical, semiconductor and aerospace
markets.

Our quarterly operating results could be
subject to significant fluctuation, and we may not be able to adjust our operations to effectively address changes we do not anticipate.

Given the nature of the markets in which we participate, we cannot reliably predict future sales and profitability. Changes in competitive, market and
economic conditions may require us to adjust our operations, and we may not be able to make those adjustments or to make them quickly enough to adapt to changing conditions. A high proportion of our costs are fixed, due in part to our significant
sales, research and development and manufacturing costs. Thus, small declines in sales could disproportionately affect our operating results in a quarter. Factors that may affect our quarterly operating results include:

•

demand for and market acceptance of our products,

•

competitive pressures resulting in lower selling prices,

•

adverse changes in the level of economic activity in regions in which we do business,

•

adverse changes in industries, such as pharmaceutical, biomedical, semiconductors and aerospace, on which we are particularly dependent,

•

changes in the portions of our sales represented by our various products and customers,

•

delays or problems in the introduction of new products,

•

our competitors’ announcement or introduction of new products, services or technological innovations,

•

increased costs of raw materials or supplies, and

•

changes in the volume or timing of product orders.

We may not be able to successfully execute acquisitions or license
technologies, integrate acquired businesses or licensed technologies into our existing business or make acquired businesses or licensed technologies profitable.

We have in the past, and may in the future, supplement our internal growth by acquiring businesses and licensing
technologies that complement or augment our existing product lines, such as our acquisition of Elcos AG in February 2005. However, we may be unable to identify, complete promising acquisitions or license transactions for many reasons, including:

•

competition among buyers and licensees,

•

the need for regulatory and other approvals,

•

our inability to raise capital to fund these acquisitions,

•

the high valuations of businesses and technologies, and

•

restrictions in the instruments governing our indebtedness, including the indenture governing our 8


/


% notes and our
new senior credit facility.

Some of the
businesses we may seek to acquire may be unprofitable or marginally profitable. Accordingly, the earnings or losses of acquired businesses may dilute our earnings. For these acquired businesses to achieve acceptable levels of profitability, we must
improve their management, operations, products and market penetration. We may not be successful in this regard and may encounter other difficulties in integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations, such as incompatible management,
information or other systems or cultural differences.



To finance our acquisitions, we may have to raise additional funds, either through public or private
financings. We may be unable to obtain such funds or may be able to do so only on terms unacceptable to us.

If we are unable to renew our licenses or otherwise lose our licensed rights, we may have to stop selling products or we may lose competitive
advantage.

We may not be able to renew our existing
licenses or licenses we may obtain in the future on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we lose the rights to a patented or other proprietary technology, we may need to stop selling products incorporating that technology and possibly other
products, redesign our products or lose a competitive advantage. Potential competitors could in-license technologies that we fail to license and potentially erode our market share.

Our licenses typically subject us to various economic and commercialization obligations. If we fail to comply with these
obligations we could lose important rights under a license, such as the right to exclusivity in a market. In some cases, we could lose all rights under the license. In addition, rights granted under the license could be lost for reasons out of our
control. For example, the licensor could lose patent protection for a number of reasons, including invalidity of the licensed patent, or a third party could obtain a patent that curtails our freedom to operate under one or more licenses.

If we do not compete effectively, our business will be harmed.

We encounter aggressive competition from numerous
competitors in many areas of our business. We may not be able to compete effectively with all of these competitors. To remain competitive, we must develop new products and periodically enhance our existing products. We anticipate that we may also
have to adjust the prices of many of our products to stay competitive. In addition, new competitors, technologies or market trends may emerge to threaten or reduce the value of entire product lines.

If we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with the regulations of
the United States Food and Drug Administration and other governmental agencies, we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution, and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties.

Some of the products produced by our Life and Analytical Sciences business
unit are subject to regulation by the United States Food and Drug Administration and similar international agencies. In addition, some of the activities of our Fluid Sciences business unit are subject to regulation by the United States Federal
Aviation Administration. These regulations govern a wide variety of product activities, from design and development to labeling, manufacturing, promotion, sales, resales and distribution. If we fail to comply with those regulations or those of
similar international agencies, we may have to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution. We had to do this on a temporary basis in 2004 in response to an FDA directive at one of our Life and Analytical Sciences locations until we
were able to resolve the matter by implementing additional testing and labeling conditions on the relevant product. In addition, we could be subject to fines or criminal prosecution.

Changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses.

We compete in markets in which we or our customers must comply with
federal, state, local and foreign regulations, such as environmental, health and safety, and food and drug regulations. We develop, configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations. Any significant change in
these regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our costs of producing these products.

Obtaining and enforcing patent protection for our proprietary products, processes and technologies may be difficult and expensive; we may infringe
intellectual property rights of third parties.

Patent
and trade secret protection is important to us because developing and marketing new technologies and products is time-consuming and expensive. We own many United States and foreign patents and intend to



apply for additional patents to cover our products. We may not obtain issued patents from any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to
us. The claims allowed under any issued patents may not be broad enough to protect our technology.

Third parties may seek to challenge, invalidate or circumvent issued patents owned by or licensed to us or claim that our products and operations
infringe their patent or other intellectual property rights.

In addition to our patents, we possess an array of unpatented proprietary technology and know-how and we license intellectual property rights to and from third parties. The measures that we employ to protect this technology and these rights
may not be adequate. Moreover, in some cases, the licensor can terminate a license or convert it to a non-exclusive arrangement if we fail to meet specified performance targets.

We may incur significant expense in any legal proceedings to protect our proprietary rights or to defend infringement claims
by third parties. In addition, claims of third parties against us, such as the pending actions by, respectively, Enzo Biochem, Inc. and Enzo Life Sciences, Inc., and by Amersham Biosciences Corp. and Amersham Plc, could result in awards of
substantial damages or court orders that could effectively prevent us from manufacturing, using, importing or selling our products in the United States or abroad.

Our results of operations will be adversely affected if we fail to realize the full value of our intangible assets.

As of January 2, 2005, our total assets included $1.5
billion of net intangible assets. Net intangible assets consist principally of goodwill associated with acquisitions and costs associated with securing patent rights, trademark rights and technology licenses, net of accumulated amortization. We test
these items on an annual basis for potential impairment by comparing the carrying value to the fair market value of the reporting unit to which they are assigned.

Adverse changes in our business or the failure to grow our Life and Analytical Sciences business may result in impairment of
our intangible assets which could adversely affect our results of operations.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risks

Financial Instruments

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash investments, marketable
securities and accounts receivable. We believe we had no significant concentrations of credit risk as of January 2, 2005.

In the ordinary course of business, we enter into foreign exchange contracts for periods consistent with our committed exposures to mitigate the effect of
foreign currency movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Transactions covered by hedge contracts include inter-company and third-party receivables and payables. The contracts are primarily in European and Asian currencies, have
maturities that do not exceed 12 months, have no cash requirements until maturity and are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet. Credit risk is minimal as the foreign exchange instruments are contracted with major banking
institutions. Unrealized gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts are recognized immediately in earnings for hedges designated as fair value and, for hedges designated as cash flow, the related unrealized gains or losses are deferred as a
component of other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. Deferred gains and losses are recognized in income in the period in which the underlying anticipated transaction occurs. For the year ended January 2, 2005, we
did not engage in any designated cash flow hedges. The notional amount of the outstanding foreign currency contracts was approximately $166.8 million at January 2, 2005 and $168.5 million as of December 28, 2003, and the approximate fair value of
these foreign currency derivative contracts was insignificant. The duration of the foreign currency derivative contracts was generally 30 days for 2004.



Market Risk

Market Risk.

We are exposed to market risk, including changes in interest rates and currency
exchange rates. To manage the volatility relating to these exposures, we enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted market exposures.

Foreign Exchange Risk.

As a multinational
corporation, we are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. These exposures can take a variety of different forms:

(1) As our international sales grow, exposure to volatility in exchange rates could have a material impact on our financial results.
Reported sales made in foreign currencies by our international subsidiaries, when translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes, can fluctuate due to exchange rate movements. While exchange rate fluctuations can impact reported
revenues and earnings, this impact is purely a result of the translation effect and does not materially impact our short-term cash flows.

(2) In all parts of the world our subsidiaries, on occasion, invoice third-party customers in foreign currencies other than the one in
which they primarily do business. We refer to our subsidiaries’ primary business currencies as the “functional currencies.” Movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency result in both realized and unrealized
transaction gains or losses that directly impact our cash flows and our results of operations.

(3) Our manufacturing and distribution organization is worldwide. Accordingly, inventories may be manufactured in one location, stored in
another, and distributed in a third location. This results in a wide array of intercompany transactions—transactions that are billed and paid in many different currencies. Our cash flows and our results of operations are therefore directly
impacted by fluctuations in exchange rates of currencies involved.

(4) The cash flow needs of each of our foreign subsidiaries vary through time. Accordingly, there may be times when a subsidiary lends to or borrows from either the parent company or another affiliate. These advances,
again being denominated in currencies other than a particular entity’s functional currency, can expose it to fluctuations in exchange rates that can impact both our cash flows and results of operations.

(5) In order to repay debt or satisfy operational needs, we
may remit cash from our foreign locations to the United States. When this occurs, we are liquidating foreign currency net asset positions and converting them into United States dollars. Our cash flows and our results of operations are therefore also
impacted by these transactions.

We use foreign currency
forward and option contracts to manage the risk of exchange rate fluctuations. The derivative instruments held by us are not leveraged and are not held for trading purposes. We specifically use forward contracts to hedge our foreign denominated
assets and liabilities and use a combination of forward and option contracts to hedge anticipated cash flows. Our hedging activity is intended to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on assets, liabilities and cash flows denominated in foreign
currencies. The success of our hedging program depends on forecasts of transaction activity in various currencies. To the extent that these forecasts are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility, we could experience
unanticipated currency gains or losses. The principal currencies we hedge are the British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Euro, Japanese Yen, and Singapore Dollar. In those currencies where there is a liquid, cost-effective forward market, we maintain hedge
coverage between our established minimum and maximum percentages of our anticipated transaction exposure for periods not to exceed one year. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of the related exposure.

Foreign Currency Risk—Value-at-Risk Disclosure

—We utilize a
Value-at-Risk model to determine the potential earning/fair value exposures presented by our foreign currency related financial instruments. As discussed above, we seek to minimize this exposure through our hedging program. Our Value-at-Risk
computation is based on the Monte Carlo simulation, utilizing a 95% confidence interval and a holding period of 30 days. As of January 2, 2005, this computation estimated that there is a 5% chance that the market value of the



underlying exposures and the corresponding derivative instruments either increase or decrease due to foreign currency fluctuations by more than $0.1 million.
This Value-At-Risk measure is consistent with our financial statement disclosures relative to our foreign currency hedging program. Specifically, during each of the four quarters ended in fiscal 2004, the Value-At-Risk ranged between $0.1 million
and $0.3 million, and averaged approximately $0.2 million.

Interest Rate Risk.

As described above, our debt portfolio includes both fixed rate and variable rate instruments. Fluctuations in interest rates can therefore have a direct impact on both our short-term cash
flows, as they relate to interest, and our earnings. In January 2005 and January 2004, we effected, for a portion of our fixed rate debt portfolio, interest rate swaps that in effect convert fixed rate debt to variable rate debt. These swaps have
been designated as fair value hedges. These swaps are marked to market in our consolidated financial statements. The fair value movements in these swaps are offset by the fair value movement in the debt.

Interest Rate Risk—Sensitivity

—As of January 2, 2005, our
debt portfolio was comprised of $304.6 million fixed rate debt and $70.0 million of variable rate debt. After giving effect to the interest rate swaps entered into in January 2004 and January 2005, $104.6 million of our debt portfolio is fixed and
$270.0 million is variable. In addition, our cash and cash equivalents, for which we receive interest at variable rates, were $197.5 million at January 2, 2005. Our current earnings exposure for changes in interest rates can be summarized as
follows:

(1) changes in interest rates can
cause interest charges on our variable rate debt comprised of $70 million of term loan and $200 million of swapped 8


/


% notes to fluctuate. A 10% increase, or approximately 64 basis points, in current interest rates would cause an additional pre-tax charge to our earnings of $1.7 million for fiscal year 2005.

(2) changes in interest rates can cause our cash flows
relative to interest payments on variable rate debt to fluctuate. As described above, an increase of 10%, or approximately 64 basis points, in current interest rates would cause our cash outflows to increase by $1.7 million for fiscal year 2005.

(3) changes in interest rates can cause our
cash flows relative to interest received to fluctuate.

(4) changes in interest rates can cause the value of our fixed rate debt to change. However, such a value change has no impact on either our earnings or our cash flows unless we determine that we wish to retire this debt in the open market.

Financial Statements and Supplemental Data




REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of PerkinElmer, Inc.

Wellesley, Massachusetts

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of PerkinElmer,
Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of January 2, 2005 and December 28, 2003, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended January 2, 2005. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at ITEM 15(a)2. These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of PerkinElmer, Inc. and subsidiaries as of January 2, 2005 and December 28, 2003, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 2, 2005, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents
fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of January 2, 2005, based on the
criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 10, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on management’s
assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting and an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

As discussed in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company
changed its method of accounting for goodwill and intangible assets in 2002 to conform to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142,

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1:

Nature of Operations and Accounting Policies

Nature of Operations:

PerkinElmer, Inc. is a global high technology company which designs, manufactures, markets and
supports products, systems and service offerings within three reporting segments: Life and Analytical Sciences, Optoelectronics and Fluid Sciences.

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of PerkinElmer, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company). All material intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

The
Company’s fiscal year ends on the Sunday nearest December 31. The Company reports fiscal years under a 52/53 week format. Under this method, certain years will contain 53 weeks. The fiscal year ended January 2, 2005 included 53 weeks. The
fiscal years ended December 28, 2003 and December 29, 2002 included 52 weeks.

Accounting Policies and Estimates:

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its
estimates. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of
assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

Sales:

The Company’s product sales are recorded when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has
occurred, the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. For products that include installation, and if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element, product revenue is recognized
upon delivery, and installation revenue is recognized when the installation is complete. For sales that include customer-specified acceptance criteria, revenue is recognized after the acceptance criteria have been met. Certain of the Company’s
products require specialized installation. Revenue for these products is deferred until installation is completed. Revenue from services is deferred and recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer.
When arrangements include multiple elements, the Company uses objective evidence of fair value to allocate revenue to the elements and recognize revenue when the criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element. Shipping and handling
costs are reflected in both revenue and cost of goods sold to the extent they are billed to customers. In all other instances they are reflected as a component of cost of goods sold.

In November 2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached a consensus on Issue No. 00-21,

Revenue Arrangements with
Multiple Deliverables.

EITF Issue No. 00-21 provides guidance on how to account for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products, services and/or rights to use assets. The provisions of EITF Issue No. 00-21 apply to
revenue arrangements entered into in the third quarter of 2003 and thereafter. The adoption of EITF Issue No. 00-21 did not have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations or financial condition.

On December 17, 2003, the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104 (SAB 104),

Revenue Recognition,

which supersedes SAB 101,

Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements.

SAB 104’s primary purpose is to rescind accounting guidance contained in SAB 101
related to multiple element revenue arrangements, superseded as a result of the issuance of EITF No. 00-21. The adoption of SAB 104 did not materially affect the Company’s revenue recognition policies, or the Company’s results of
operations, financial position or cash flows.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Inventories:

Inventories, which include material, labor and
manufacturing overhead, are valued at the lower of cost or market. Substantially all inventories are accounted for using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method of determining inventory costs. Inventory quantities on-hand are regularly reviewed, and
where necessary, provisions for excess and obsolete inventory are recorded based primarily on the Company’s estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements.

On November 29, 2004, the FASB issued Statement No. 151,

Inventory Costs

, an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4.
Statement 151 clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted material. Statement 151 is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company
is evaluating the potential impact, if any, the adoption of Statement 151 will have on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Income Taxes:

The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the asset and
liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
This method also requires the recognition of future tax benefits such as net operating loss carryforwards, to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax
rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. A valuation allowance is established for any deferred tax asset for which realization is not more likely than not.
Pursuant to Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 23,

Accounting for Income Taxes—Special Areas

(APB 23) and related interpretations with respect to corporate earnings permanently reinvested offshore, the Company does not accrue tax
for the repatriation of its foreign earnings that it considers to be permanently reinvested outside the United States.

The FASB also issued FASB Staff Position No. 109-2, Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American
Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (FSP 109-2). The AJCA introduces a special one-time dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a U.S. taxpayer (repatriation provision), provided certain criteria are met. FSP 109-2
provides accounting and disclosure guidance for the repatriation provision. Until the Treasury Department or Congress provides additional clarifying language on key elements of the repatriation provision, the total amount of foreign earnings to be
repatriated by the Company cannot be determined and the presumption that such unremitted earnings will not be repatriated cannot be overcome. FSP 109-2 grants an enterprise additional time beyond the year ended December 31, 2004, in which the AJCA
was enacted, to evaluate the effects of the AJCA on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of unremitted earnings. FSP 109-2 calls for enhanced disclosures of, among other items, the status of a company’s evaluations, the effects of
completed evaluations, and the potential range of income tax effects of repatriations.

Property, Plant and Equipment:

The Company depreciates plant and equipment using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which generally fall within the following
ranges: buildings—10 to 40 years; leasehold improvements—estimated useful life or remaining term of lease, whichever is shorter; machinery and equipment—3 to 7 years. Certain tooling costs are capitalized and amortized over a 3 year
life, while repairs and maintenance costs are expensed.

Pension Plans:

The Company’s funding policy provides that payments to the U.S. pension trusts shall at least be equal to the minimum funding requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974. Non-U.S. plans are accrued for, but generally not fully funded, and benefits are paid from operating funds. A minimum pension liability adjustment is recorded when the actuarial present value of accumulated benefits exceeds plan assets and
accrued pension liabilities.

Translation of Foreign
Currencies:

For foreign operations with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar, asset and liability accounts are translated at current exchange rates; income and expenses are translated using weighted average
exchange rates. Resulting translation adjustments, as well as gains and losses from



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

certain intercompany transactions, are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income, a separate component of stockholders’ equity.

Intangible Assets:

The Company’s
intangible assets consist of (1) goodwill, which is not being amortized; (2) indefinite lived intangibles, which consist of certain trademarks and trade names that are not subject to amortization; and (3) amortizing intangibles, which consist of
patents, and purchased technologies, which are being amortized over their useful lives. All intangible assets are subject to impairment tests on an annual or periodic basis.

Note 12 describes the impact of accounting for the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142,

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

, and the annual impairment methodology that the Company employs on the later of January 1 or the first day of each fiscal year in calculating the recoverability of goodwill. This same impairment test will be
performed at other times during the course of the year should an event occur which suggests that the recoverability of goodwill should be challenged. Non-amortizing intangibles are also subject to an annual impairment test. The impairment test
consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess is recognized

.

Amortizing
intangibles are currently evaluated for impairment using the methodology set forth in SFAS No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

(SFAS No. 144). Recoverability of these assets is assessed only when events
have occurred that may give rise to an impairment. When a potential impairment has been identified, forecasted undiscounted net cash flows of the operations to which the asset relates are compared to the current carrying value of the long-lived
assets present in that operation. If such cash flows are less than such carrying amounts, long-lived assets, including such intangibles, are written down to their respective fair values.

Stock-Based Compensation:

At January 2, 2005, the Company had two stock-based compensation
plans from which it makes grants, which are described more fully in Note 18. The Company accounts for these plans under the recognition and measurement principles of APB Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

, and related
interpretations. As allowed by SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for Stock Based Compensation

, no stock-based employee compensation cost related to stock options is reflected in net income, as all options granted under those plans had an exercise
price at least equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. The Company has also issued restricted stock to certain employees and has reflected the intrinsic value of these awards as unearned compensation until the
restrictions are released and the compensation is earned. The Company has elected to account for disclosure of the effects of fair value accounting on net income and earnings per share on a pro forma basis which is presented below. The following
table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R,

Share-Based Payment

(“SFAS No. 123R”). This Statement is a revision of SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,

and supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,

and its related implementation guidance. SFAS No. 123R focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions. The Statement
requires entities to recognize stock compensation expense for awards of equity instruments to employees based on the grant-date fair value of those awards (with limited exceptions). SFAS No. 123R is effective for the first interim or annual
reporting period that begins after June 15, 2005.

The Company
expects to adopt SFAS No. 123R using the Statement’s modified prospective application method. Adoption of SFAS No. 123R is expected to increase stock compensation expense. We are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of SFAS No.
123R will have on our financial results.

Marketable
Securities and Investments:

Marketable Securities and Investments, whether debt or equity, are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 115,

Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities

. The
cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. Should securities be classified as available for sale, the Company records these investments at their fair values with unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other
comprehensive income/(loss). Under the cost method of accounting, equity investments in private companies are carried at cost and are adjusted only for other-than-temporary declines in fair value or additional investments.

Investments in business entities in which the Company does not have control,
but has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies, are accounted for by the equity method.

Cash Flows:

For purposes of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, the Company considers all highly liquid unrestricted
instruments with a purchased maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value due to the short maturities.

Environmental Matters:

The Company accrues for costs associated with the remediation of
environmental pollution when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the Company’s proportionate share of the amount can be reasonably estimated. The recorded liabilities have not been discounted.

Comprehensive Income (Loss):

Comprehensive
income (loss) is defined as net income or loss and other changes in stockholders’ equity from transactions and other events from sources other than stockholders. Comprehensive income (loss) is reflected in the Consolidated Statements of
Stockholders’ Equity.

Derivative Instruments and
Hedging:

The Company records derivative instruments on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities, measured at fair value. Gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives would be accounted for
depending on the use of the derivative instrument and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting.

Reclassifications:

Certain financial statement amounts from prior years have been reclassified to conform with current year
presentation.

Note 2:

Acquisitions and Divestitures

In February 2005, the Company acquired Elcos AG, a leading European designer and manufacturer of custom light emitting diode, or LED, solutions for
biomedical and industrial applications. Consideration for the transaction was approximately $15.1 million in cash at the time of closing with additional consideration of approximately $1.4 million due through fiscal 2007. In addition, potential earn
out payments of up to approximately $8.2 million may be made based on the future performance of the business.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Integration activity

The Company has undertaken integration actions in connection with acquired businesses. These activities, which were
accounted for in accordance with EITF 95-3,

Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Business Combination,

have primarily included employee separation costs, the abandonment of excess facilities and the termination of leases
and other contractual obligations. In connection with these integration activities, as part of the cost of acquisitions, the Company established reserves as detailed below. All changes in estimates within one year of the integration plan inception
have been recorded as an adjustment of the cost of the acquired company (usually as a change in goodwill). Any incremental charges incurred more than twelve months after the commencement of the integration activities are charged to the income
statement. Any incremental credits were reversed against the existing goodwill balance.

In November 2001, the Company completed its acquisition of Packard BioScience Company (Packard). The integration activities were completed in early 2003 with the exception of $0.4 million in remaining payments due on
leased facilities exited in 2001 that will be paid through 2005.

The following table summarizes integration reserve activity during 2004, 2003 and 2002 related to the acquisition of Packard:

Divestitures

Losses on dispositions in 2004 included $0.8 in
losses from the sale of facilities and $0.4 millions in gains related to the sale of machinery and equipment.

Gains on dispositions in 2003 included $2.2 million from sale of facilities and $0.5 million from the final resolution of contingencies related to the
2001 sale of the Instruments for Research and Applied Sciences (IRAS) business.

Gains on dispositions in 2002 included $4.4 million from the sale of facilities and approximately $0.8 million from the resolution of certain contingencies related to the sale of the IRAS business.

All of the gains and losses described above are reported in losses (gains) on
dispositions, net in the consolidated income statements.

Note 3:

Restructuring Charges

The Company has undertaken three separate restructuring actions over the past three years and had continuing activity on one restructuring action
initiated in 2001. Restructuring actions initiated in 2001 and 2002 were recorded in accordance with EITF 94-3,

Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred
in a Restructuring)

(EITF 94-03). Restructuring actions taken after 2002 were recorded in accordance with SFAS No. 146,

Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities

(SFAS 146).



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

A description of each of the four restructuring plans is as follows:

Q2 2003 Plan:

During 2003, the Company incurred a $2.0 million restructuring charge in the
Life and Analytical Sciences business and a $0.3 million restructuring charge in the Optoelectronics business. The purpose of the restructuring was to further improve performance and take advantage of synergies between the Company’s former Life
Sciences and Analytical Instruments businesses. The principal actions in this restructuring plan included lower headcount due to the continued integration of the Life and Analytical Sciences business in a European manufacturing facility and a
customer care center as well as a headcount reduction at one of the Optoelectronics manufacturing facilities to reflect recent declining demand for several product lines.

This restructuring charge was primarily recorded in the second quarter, but additional charges were recorded in the third
and fourth quarters as required by SFAS 146, as people were notified in the second quarter but were required to work for a period of time prior to receiving their severance. In addition, the Company recorded a restructuring reversal of $0.4 million
due to higher than expected employee attrition rates prior to planned termination and, accordingly, lower severance costs. The following table summarizes the restructuring plan activity for the year ended January 2, 2004:

Actions under the plan
were completed by January 2, 2005 with the exception of a headcount reduction of one person that will be completed by the second quarter of 2005.

Q4 2002 Plan

In connection with the Company’s decision to combine the Life Sciences and Analytical Instruments businesses in order to reduce costs and achieve
operational efficiencies, the Company recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of $26.0 million during the fourth quarter of 2002 (the Q4 2002 Plan). This plan allowed the Company to combine many business functions worldwide, with the intention to
better serve its customers and more fully capitalize on the strengths of the businesses’ sales, service and research and development organizations. The principal actions in the restructuring plan included workforce reductions, closure of
facilities and disposal of underutilized assets. The following table summarizes the components of the Company’s Q4 2002 Plan and related accrual activity:



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

During 2003, the Company expended $13.8 million to execute these actions. In addition, the Company
recorded a reversal of $6.2 million in the Q4 2002 Plan due to higher than expected employee attrition rates in several countries prior to planned termination, and accordingly lower severance costs, plus lower than expected lease termination costs
in certain locations.

During 2004, the Company expended $3.3
million to execute these actions. The remaining liability represents severance and lease commitments. The Company expects to settle the remaining severance liability by the first quarter of 2005. The Company’s current estimate of its lease
commitments on unoccupied buildings is that they vary in length but primarily extend until mid-2005.

Q1 2002 Plan

During the first quarter of 2002, the Company’s management developed a plan to restructure several businesses within its Life and Analytical Sciences
and Optoelectronics segments. The plan resulted in pre-tax restructuring charges totaling $9.2 million. The principal actions in the restructuring plan included workforce and overhead reductions resulting from reorganization activities, including
the closure of a manufacturing facility, disposal of underutilized assets and general cost reductions. The following table summarizes the components of the Company’s Q1 2002 Plan and related accrual activity:

in the Company’s Life and Analytical Sciences segment totaled $5.5 million. The charges were a result of actions we took as a response to decreased sales of components in our Life and Analytical Sciences business. These actions under the
charges primarily included the downsizing of an additional manufacturing location and the streamlining of the global sales and research and development organizations, primarily in Europe, Japan and the Pacific Rim. These actions were undertaken to
reduce the number of employees in components of its business that had experienced declining demand. The Q1 2002 Plan charges in the Company’s Optoelectronics segment totaled $3.7 million. This charge was primarily due to the removal of a layer
of management structure within Optoelectronics that led to a flatter and less expensive organization structure. Planned headcount reductions for Q1 2002 Plan totaled 276.

During 2003, the Company recorded a reversal of $1.0 million in the Q1 2002 Plan due to lower than expected headcount
reductions and severance costs resulting from higher than expected attrition rates in several countries prior to ultimate termination.

During 2004, the Company completed the actions associated with the Q1 2002 Plan with the charges of $0.1 million that were incurred during the year.

Q4 2001 Plan:

During the fourth quarter of 2001, in connection with the integration of
Packard and a restructuring of its sales offices in Europe, the Company recorded a restructuring charge of $9.2 million in the Life and Analytical



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Sciences segment. The principal actions in the restructuring plan include the closing or consolidation of several leased sales and services offices in
Europe, as well as costs associated with the closure of a manufacturing facility in Europe, the closure of leased manufacturing facilities in the United States and the disposal of related assets.

The following table summarizes the original restructuring charge and
subsequent activity of the Company’s Q4 2001 Plan:

In 2003, the Company
recorded an additional pre-tax restructuring charge associated with the Q4 2001 Plan of $1.8 million. This charge was primarily due to additional severance and severance related benefits of the previously identified employees associated with the
closure of the Company’s European manufacturing facility in the Life and Analytical Sciences segment.

During 2004, the Company paid $1.0 million in relation to the headcount actions associated with the Q4 2001 plan. The remaining liability relates to
European severance obligations and will be paid in 2005.

The tax effects of temporary differences and attributes that gave rise to deferred income tax assets
and liabilities as of January 2, 2005 and December 28, 2003 were as follows:

At January 2, 2005,
the Company had net operating loss carryovers of approximately $59 million, research and development credits totaling $12 million and excess foreign tax credits of $27 million, subject to various carryforward periods. Based on the judgment of the
Company, and consistent with prior years, full valuation allowances have been established against these tax attributes. Valuation allowances take into consideration limitations imposed upon the use of the tax attributes and reduce the value of such
items to the likely net realizable amount. The Company continues to monitor operations to determine whether a change in its valuation allowance estimate is warranted.

Current deferred tax assets of $28 million and $53 million were included in other current assets at January 2, 2005, and
December 28, 2003, respectively. Long-term deferred tax assets of $10 million and $5 million were included in other assets at January 2, 2005, and December 28, 2003, respectively. Long-term deferred tax liabilities of $87 million and $67 million
were included in other long-term liabilities at January 2, 2005, and December 28, 2003, respectively.

Pursuant to Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 23,

Accounting for Income Taxes – Special Areas

(“APB 23”) and related
interpretations with respect to corporate earnings permanently reinvested offshore, the Company does not accrue U.S. tax for the repatriation of its foreign earnings that it considers to be permanently reinvested outside the United States.
Consequently, the Company has not provided any U.S. cost on the unremitted earnings of its foreign subsidiaries unless the earnings can be repatriated in a cash and tax efficient manner. As of January 2, 2005, the amount of earnings for which no
repatriation tax cost has been provided was approximately $477 million.

The homeland investment provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act, or AJCA, enacted on October 22, 2004 have provided the Company with a limited opportunity to repatriate cash earnings from foreign operations in a tax efficient manner.
As of January 2, 2005, the Company has provided $8.7 million to cover the estimated federal and state tax cost associated with these anticipated repatriations. The Company is currently assessing its ability to repatriate additional amounts in 2005
to take further advantage of the benefits created by the AJCA. In addition, the Company is currently reviewing the future impact of the repeal of the extra-territorial income provision exclusion and the domestic production activity deduction
contained in the AJCA.

Discontinued Operations

As part of its continued efforts to focus on higher growth opportunities, the Company has discontinued certain businesses. In September 2004, the
Company’s Board of Directors approved a plan to shut down its Computer-To-Plate business. In June 2004, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a plan to shut down its Electroformed Products business and sell its Ultraviolet Lighting
business. The results of these businesses were previously reported as part of the Optoelectronics reporting segment. The Company has accounted for these businesses as discontinued operations in accordance with SFAS No. 144 and, accordingly, has
presented the results of operations and related cash flows as a discontinued operation for all periods presented. The assets and liabilities of these businesses have been presented separately and are reflected within the assets and liabilities from
discontinued operations in the accompanying balance sheets as of January 2, 2005 and December 29, 2003. The abandonment of the Computer-To-Plate business resulted in a $1.0 million write-down of certain fixed assets and inventory which is recognized
in the loss on dispositions for the year ended January 2, 2005. The net assets of the Electroformed Products business were written off resulting in a $1.6 million pre-tax loss in 2004. The fixed assets and inventory of the Ultraviolet Lighting
business were sold in July 2004 for their approximate book value.

During 2004 and 2003, the Company settled various claims under certain long-term contracts and transition services with its Technical Services business, which was sold in August of 1999. The net settlement and the reversal of certain
previously established contingency reserves resulted in pre-tax gains of $1.5 million and $6.5 million that were recognized in 2004 and 2003, respectively, and are included in gain (loss) on dispositions of discontinued operations.

In June 2002, the Company completed the sale of its Security and Detection
Systems business for cash consideration of approximately $100.0 million and a net working capital adjustment A net pre-tax gain of approximately $15.0 million was recorded pursuant to this transaction in 2002 as a gain on the disposition of a
discontinued operation. Adjustments relating to this sale resulted in a pre-tax loss of $2.4 million in 2003, primarily due to revised estimates of the working capital adjustment. The Company has accounted for its Security and Detection Systems
business as a discontinued operation in accordance with APB No. 30. The loss in 2003 and the gain in 2002 are presented as a component of net income within dispositions of discontinued operations, net of income tax in the Company’s Consolidated
Income Statement.

During June 2002, the Company’s Board
of Directors approved separate plans to shut down its Telecommunications Component and sell its Entertainment Lighting businesses. This resulted in an initial pre-tax loss of approximately $20.5 million in 2002. In June 2003, the Company completed
the sale of a significant portion of its Entertainment Lighting business and abandoned the remaining assets. In addition, the Company incurred adjustments relating to the shut down of its Telecommunications business. Accordingly, a pre-tax loss of
$4.3 million was recorded in 2003. The results of these businesses were previously reported as part of the Optoelectronics reporting segment. The Company has accounted for these businesses as discontinued operations and accordingly, has presented
the results of operations and related cash flows of these businesses as discontinued operations for all periods presented.

Earnings per Share

Basic earnings per share was computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the year less restricted
unvested shares. Diluted earnings per share was computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding plus the dilutive effects of common shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options using the treasury
stock method and the release of restrictions on restricted stock awards. The following table reconciles the number of shares utilized in the earnings per share calculations:

Shares of common stock
related to employee stock options to purchase 5.3 million, 8.3 million and 15.5 million shares of common stock were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, because their effect would have
been antidilutive.

Accounts Receivable

Accounts receivable were net of reserves for doubtful accounts of $18.4 million and $20.2 million as of January 2, 2005 and December 28, 2003,
respectively.

During 2001, the Company established a wholly
owned consolidated subsidiary to fund, on a revolving basis, certain of the Company’s accounts receivable balances and simultaneously sell an undivided interest in this pool of receivables to a financial institution. As collections reduce the
balance of sold accounts receivable, new receivables are sold. The Company’s consolidated subsidiary retains the risk of credit loss on the receivables. Accordingly, the full amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts has been provided for
on the Company’s balance sheet. Under the terms of this arrangement, the Company retains collection and administrative responsibilities for the balances. The servicing fees received constitute adequate compensation for services performed. No
servicing asset or liability is therefore recorded. The accounts receivable securitization facility provides for up to $65.0 million in accounts receivable funding. The facility had an effective interest rate at January 2, 2005 of approximately
LIBOR plus 74 basis points. The amount funded under this facility was $45 million on January 2, 2005 and December 28, 2003, respectively. The facility includes conditions that require the Company to maintain a corporate credit rating of BB or above
as defined by Standard & Poor’s Rating Services, and Ba2 or above as defined by Moody’s Investors Service. At January 2, 2005 the Company had a senior unsecured credit rating of BB+ with a stable outlook from Standard & Poor’s
Rating Services and of Ba2 with a positive outlook from Moody’s Investors Service. In January 2005, the Company entered into an agreement to extend the term of its accounts receivable securitization facility to January 27, 2006.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

In connection with adopting FAS 142 in fiscal 2002, the Company, assisted by valuation consultants, completed the transitional testing of goodwill using a
measurement date of January 1, 2002. The results of the transitional testing indicated that the carrying values of the lighting reporting unit within the Optoelectronics reporting segment exceeded the estimated fair value of this unit as determined
utilizing various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow and comparative market analysis. Accordingly, an impairment charge was recognized as a change in accounting principle as of the beginning of 2002. The impairment charge was
$117.8 million on a before-tax and after-tax basis.

The
Company performs its annual goodwill assessment on the later of January 1 or the first day of each fiscal year. The Company completed its annual impairment tests for the year ending January 2, 2005 as required by FAS 142 and determined that there

Debt

Senior Secured Credit Facility.

In December 2002, the Company entered into a senior credit facility. This facility was originally comprised of a six-year term loan in the amount of $315.0
million and a $100.0 million five-year revolving credit facility. This credit facility is secured primarily by a substantial portion of the Company’s and its subsidiaries’ domestic assets. In 2004 and 2003, principal payments of $175
million and $70 million, respectively, were made on the term loan. Accordingly, at January 2, 2005, $70 million was outstanding on the term loan and no principal balance was outstanding under the revolving credit facility at year end or at any point
during the year.

The Company has amended this facility four
times. While the first and second amendments were administrative, the third, executed in December 2003, amended the senior credit facility to reduce the margin paid on the term loan, as well as to amend several restrictive covenants and the fourth,
executed in October 2004, amended the senior credit facility to allow greater flexibility regarding acquisitions, stock repurchases, debt reduction and foreign cash repatriation. Interest rates under the amended senior credit facility applicable to
the term loan and to the revolving credit facility are determined as a margin over either the Eurodollar rate or the base rate. The base rate is the higher of (1) the corporate base rate announced from time to time by Bank of America, N.A. and (2)
the Federal Funds rate plus 50 basis points. The applicable margins for the term loan and the revolving credit facility vary based upon the Company’s leverage ratio at the end of the prior quarter. Should the Company achieve a leverage ratio
below 2.5 times, its applicable margin for the term loan will decrease to 200 basis points over the Euro rate or 100 basis points over the base rate. All or a portion of indebtedness under the senior credit facility may be based upon the margin over
the Eurodollar rate or the base rate. At January 2, 2005, the applicable margin for the term loan was 200 basis points for the Eurodollar rate and 100 basis points for the base rate. The Eurodollar rate was approximately 247 basis points and the
base rate was 525 basis points. The term loan is repayable in mandatory nominal quarterly installments of $0.8 million until December 2007, and thereafter in four equal quarterly installments of 25% of the then outstanding indebtedness until
December 2008. The revolving credit facility is available to the Company through December 2007 for working capital needs.

The senior credit facility contains covenants requiring specific financial ratios, including:

•

a minimum interest coverage ratio,

•

a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio,

•

a maximum senior leverage ratio, and

•

a maximum total leverage ratio.

% Notes contain financial and other covenants. Most of these
covenants terminate if the notes obtain an investment grade rating by Standard & Poor’s Rating Services and Moody’s Investors Service.

During 2004, the fixed rate on $100.0 million of these notes was swapped to a floating rate using swap instruments which reset semi-annually in arrears
based upon six-month USD LIBOR, plus an applicable margin. These swaps have been designated as fair value hedges. In January 2005, an additional $100.0 million of notional value was swapped on similar terms.

Zero Coupon Convertible Debentures.

Through the
first quarter of 2003, the Company repurchased $344.7 million in accreted amount of its zero coupon convertible debentures due 2020 in open market purchases and through a December 2002 tender offer. The remaining $157.4 million of accreted value of
zero coupon debentures was redeemed on August 7, 2003 in accordance with their terms. The Company used approximately $155.0 million held in escrow pursuant to the terms of its senior secured credit facility along with available cash of approximately
$2.4 million, to redeem the zero coupon convertible debentures. As such, as of December 28, 2003, the zero coupon convertible debentures were fully retired.

6.8% Notes.

In December 2002, the Company initiated a tender offer for all of its outstanding 6.8% unsecured notes. The
Company completed the tender offer and repurchased all but $4.7 million of these notes. The Company paid consent payments pursuant to a consent solicitation it made concurrently with the tender offer. The consent solicitation eliminated
substantially all of the restrictive covenants contained in the indenture governing the 6.8% notes. The Company may from time to time repurchase outstanding 6.8% notes through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise.
These notes are due to be paid in 2005.

Employee Benefit Plans

Savings Plan:

The Company has a savings plan for the benefit of qualified United States employees. Under this plan, for Life
and Analytical Sciences and corporate employees, the Company contributes an amount equal to the lesser of 100% of the employee’s voluntary contribution or 5.0% of the employee’s annual compensation up to applicable IRS limits. For
Optoelectronics and Fluid Sciences employees, the Company contributes an amount equal to the lesser of 55% of the amount of the employee’s voluntary contribution or 3.3% of the employee’s annual compensation up to applicable IRS limits.
Savings plan expense was $7.8 million in 2004, $8.0 million in 2003 and $7.3 million in 2002.

Pension Plans:

The Company has defined benefit pension plans covering some United States employees and non-U.S. pension plans for some non-U.S. employees. The principal United States
defined benefit pension plans were closed to new hires effective January 31, 2001 and benefits for those employed by the Company’s former Life Sciences businesses within the Company’s Life and Analytical Sciences reporting segment were
frozen as of that date. Plan benefits were frozen as of March 2003 for those employed by the Company’s former Analytical Instruments business within its Life and Analytical Sciences reporting segment and corporate employees. The plans provide
benefits that are based on an employee’s years of service and compensation near retirement.

Net periodic pension cost included the following components:

and the principal non-U.S. pension plans and the amounts recognized in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets as of January 2, 2005 and December 28, 2003.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company also sponsors a supplemental executive retirement plan to provide senior management with
benefits in excess of normal pension benefits. Effective July 31, 2000, this plan was closed to new entrants. At January 2, 2005 and December 28, 2003, the projected benefit obligations were $18.4 million and $16.8 million, respectively. Assets with
a fair value of $3.5 million and $4.7 million, segregated in a trust, were available to meet this obligation as of January 2, 2005 and December 28, 2003, respectively. Pension expense for this plan was approximately $1.9 million in 2004, $1.5
million in 2003 and $1.6 million in 2002.

An incremental
additional minimum liability of $12.0 million, $9.1 million and $3.9 million was recorded to stockholder’s equity and included in other comprehensive income during 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, related to the Company’s non-U.S.
pension plans in the United Kingdom and Germany. Unrecognized net losses are amortized over the remaining service period in accordance with accounting regulations.

Assets of the defined benefit pension plans are primarily equity and debt securities. Asset allocation at January 2, 2005
and December 28, 2003, and target asset allocations for fiscal 2005, are as follows:

The Company maintains
target allocation percentages among various asset classes based on investment policies established for the pension plans which are designed to maximize the total rate of return (income and appreciation) after inflation within the limits of prudent
risk taking, while providing for adequate near-term liquidity for benefit payments. The Company’s expected returns on assets assumptions are derived from studies conducted by actuaries and investment advisors. The studies include a review of
anticipated future long-term performance of individual asset classes and consideration of the appropriate asset allocation strategy given the anticipated requirements of the plans to determine the average rate of earnings expected on the funds
invested to provide for the pension plans benefits. While the study gives appropriate consideration to recent fund performance and historical returns, the assumption is primarily a long-term, prospective rate.

The Company does not expect to make any contributions to the U.S. pension
plan during fiscal 2005. With respect to non-U.S. plans, the Company expects to contribute $10.0 million in 2005.

The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid as follows:

Postretirement
Medical Plans:

The Company provides health care benefits for eligible retired U.S. employees under a comprehensive major medical plan or under health maintenance organizations where available. The majority of the
Company’s U.S. employees become eligible for retiree health benefits if they retire directly from the Company and have at least ten years of service. Generally, the major medical plan pays stated



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

percentages of covered expenses after a deductible is met and takes into consideration payments by other group coverages and by Medicare. The plan requires
retiree contributions under most circumstances and has provisions for cost-sharing charges. Effective January 1, 2000, this plan was closed to new hires. For employees retiring after 1991, the Company has capped its medical premium contribution
based on employees’ years of service. The Company funds the amount allowable under a 401(h) provision in the Company’s defined benefit pension plan. Assets of the plan are primarily equity and debt securities.

Net periodic post-retirement medical benefit cost (credit) included the
following components:

In 2001, the Company moved entirely to a defined dollar plan. Accordingly, such assumptions are no longer applicable.

The accrued postretirement medical liability included $2.5 million and $3.2
million classified as long-term liabilities as of January 2, 2005 and December 28, 2003, respectively.

The Company maintains a Master Trust for plan assets related to the U.S. defined benefit plans and the U.S. postretirement medical plan. Accordingly,
investment policies, target asset allocations and actual asset allocations are the same as those disclosed for the U.S. defined benefit plans.

The Company does not expect to make any contributions to the postretirement medical plan during 2005.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected
to be paid as follows:

Deferred
Compensation Plans:

During 1998, the Company implemented a nonqualified deferred compensation plan that provides benefits payable to officers and certain key employees or their designated beneficiaries at specified future
dates, or upon retirement or death. Benefit payments under the plan are funded by a combination of contributions from participants and the Company. The Company has not made any cash contributions to this plan since inception. The obligations related
to the deferred compensation plan totaled $4.7 million and $3.8 million at January 2, 2005 and December 28, 2003, respectively.

Note 16:

Contingencies

The Company is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and investigations covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of its
business activities. Each of these matters is subject to various uncertainties, and it is possible that some of these matters may be resolved unfavorably to the Company. The Company has established accruals for matters that are probable and
reasonably estimable.

In addition, the Company is conducting a
number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at current and former Company locations and, along with other companies, has been named a potentially responsible party (PRP) for certain waste disposal sites. The Company accrues for
environmental issues in the accounting period that the Company’s responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated. The Company has accrued $3.8 million as of January 2, 2005, representing management’s estimate of
the total cost of ultimate disposition of known environmental matters. Such amount is not discounted and does not reflect the recovery of any amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements. These cost estimates are subject to a number of
variables, including the stage of the environmental investigations, the magnitude of the possible contamination, the nature of the potential remedies, possible joint and several liability, the timeframe over which remediation may occur and the
possible effects of changing laws and regulations. For sites where the company has been named a PRP, management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute. The
Company expects that such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to ten years. As assessments and remediation activities progress at each individual site, these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information
as it becomes available. There have been no environmental problems to date that have had or are expected to have a material effect on the Company’s financial position or results of operations. While it is reasonably possible that a material
loss exceeding the amounts recorded may have been incurred, the potential exposure is not expected to be materially different than the amounts recorded.

Multimodality Imaging system and certain Cyclic AMP and IP3 assays infringe two of the Company’s patents related
to high-throughput screening. The Company seeks injunctive and monetary relief. Amersham subsequently filed an answer denying the substantive allegations and including affirmative defenses and counterclaims.

On June 14, 2002, the Company sold its Security and Detection Systems
business to L-3 Communications Corporation (“L-3”). L-3 and several of its affiliates have been named as defendants in litigation arising out of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. Among the claims in that litigation are
allegations that there were defects in the products of the Security and Detection Systems business that the Company sold to L-3. L-3 has asserted that the Company is contractually obligated to indemnify L-3 for any liability it may incur as a result
of that litigation. By letter dated January 20, 2005, L-3 has agreed to release the Company from any and all claims relating to the events of September 11, 2001. L-3 also agreed to irrevocably withdraw its claim for indemnification. In exchange for
this release and withdrawal of indemnification, the Company has agreed to join as a plaintiff in a lawsuit filed by L-3 in the Superior Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Civil Action No. 03-05810-BLS1 against Reveal Imaging Technologies
and former employees of the Company. The lawsuit alleges that the defendants breached their obligations under agreements with the Company, including their obligations to assign to the Company’s Security and Detection Systems business (now owned
by L-3) the inventions they made while employed by such business.

The Company and certain of its officers have been named as defendants in a class action lawsuit filed in July 2002, and the Company and certain of its officers and directors have been named as defendants in purported derivative lawsuits
filed in June and July 2004. The plaintiffs in all of these suits have alleged, among other things, various statements made by the Company and management, during the same time period for all three suits, were misleading with respect to its prospects
and future operating results. The Company believes it has meritorious defenses to these lawsuits and is contesting the actions vigorously. The Company is currently unable, however, to reasonably estimate the amount of the loss, if any, that may
result from the resolution of these matters.

Note 17:

Warranty Reserves

The Company provides warranty protection for certain products for periods ranging from one to three years beyond the date of sale. The majority of costs
associated with warranty obligations include the replacement of parts and the time of service personnel to respond to repair and replacement requests. A warranty reserve is

recorded based upon historical results, supplemented by management’s expectations of future costs. A summary of warranty reserve activity for the years
ended January 2, 2005 and December 28, 2003 is as follows:

Stockholders’ Equity

Stock-Based Compensation.

As of January 2, 2005, the Company had two stock-based compensation plans. Under the 2001
Incentive Plan, 8.8 million shares of the Company’s common stock were made available for option grants, restricted stock awards, performance units and other stock-based awards. Under the Life Sciences Plan, 2.3 million shares of the
Company’s common stock were made available for option grants.

The following table summarizes stock option activity for the three years ended January 2, 2005:

The following table
summarizes information about stock options outstanding at January 2, 2005:



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The weighted-average fair value of options granted during 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $8.26, $4.95 and
$12.06, respectively. The values were estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The following weighted-average assumptions were used in the model:

In April 1999, the
Company’s stockholders approved the 1998 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, whereby participating employees currently have the right to purchase common stock at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the closing price on the first day or the last day
of the six-month offering period. The number of shares which an employee may purchase, subject to certain aggregate limits, is determined by the employee’s voluntary contribution, which may not exceed 10% of base compensation. During 2004, the
Company issued 416,223 shares under this plan at a weighted-average price of $15.658 per share. During 2003, the Company issued 676,368 shares under this plan at a weighted-average price of $9.10 per share. During 2002, the Company issued 739,302
shares under this plan at a weighted-average price of $8.39 per share. There remains available for sale to employees an aggregate of 2.12 million shares of the Company’s stock out of 5 million shares authorized by shareholders.

Other:

The Company has awarded restricted stock
to certain executive employees that contain vesting provisions and performance targets. These shares were awarded under the Company’s 2001 Incentive Plan. The compensation expense associated with the fair value of these awards is recognized
over the period that the performance targets are expected to be achieved. The unearned portion of the awards is reflected in stockholders’ equity as unearned compensation until the restrictions are released and the compensation is earned.
During the three years ended January 2, 2005, the Company awarded 182,000 shares of restricted stock in 2004, 5,000 shares of restricted stock in 2003 and 190,000 shares of restricted stock in 2002, with weighted-average fair values of $20.06 per
share in 2004, $15.83 per share in 2003 and $23.45 per share in 2002. The total compensation recognized related to these restricted shares was approximately $2.3 million in 2004, $2.8 million in 2003 and $2.6 million in 2002. As of January 2, 2005,
there were 343,002 restricted shares outstanding subject to forfeiture.

Comprehensive Income:

The components of accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income, net of tax were as follows:



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The tax effects related to each component of other comprehensive income (loss) were as follows:

Cost of Shares Held
In Treasury:

Effective July 1, 2004, companies incorporated in Massachusetts became subject to the Massachusetts Business Corporation Act, Chapter 156D. Chapter 156D provides that shares that are reacquired by a company
become authorized but unissued shares. As a result, Chapter 156D eliminates the concept of “treasury shares” and provides that shares reacquired by a company become “authorized but unissued” shares. Accordingly, the Company has
redesignated its existing treasury shares, at an aggregate cost of $168,837,000, as authorized but unissued and has allocated this amount to the common stock par value and additional paid in capital.

Note 19:

Financial Instruments

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash investments and accounts
receivable. The Company believes it had no significant concentrations of credit risk as of January 2, 2005.

In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into foreign exchange contracts for periods consistent with its committed exposures to mitigate the
effect of foreign currency movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Transactions covered by hedge contracts include intercompany and third-party receivables and payables. The contracts are primarily in European and Asian
currencies, generally have maturities that do not exceed 12 months, have no cash requirements until maturity and are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet. Credit risk and market risk are not significant as the foreign exchange
instruments are contracted with major banking institutions. Gains and losses on the Company’s foreign currency contracts are recognized immediately in earnings for hedges designated as fair value and, for hedges designated as cash flow, the
related unrealized gains or losses are deferred as a component of other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. Deferred gains and losses are recognized in income in the



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

period in which the underlying anticipated transaction occurs. For the year ended January 2, 2005, the Company did not engage in hedges designated as cash
flow. The notional amount of the outstanding foreign currency contracts designated as fair value was approximately $166.8 million as of January 2, 2005 and $168.5 million at December 28, 2003. The fair value of the Company’s foreign currency
derivative contracts was insignificant. The gains and losses realized on foreign currency contracts are not material.

In January 2004, the Company entered into $100 million of interest rate swap instruments with financial institutions. In January 2005, the Company entered
into an additional $100 million of interest rate swaps with financial institutions on similar terms. The swap agreements were designated as a fair value hedge related to $200 million of its senior subordinated notes due 2013.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The Company estimates the fair value of financial instruments based on
interest rates available to the Company and by comparison to quoted market prices. The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value due to the short-term maturities
of these assets and liabilities.

The fair values of marketable
securities included in investments have been determined using available quoted market prices for such securities. The carrying value of the Company’s investments in joint ventures and other equity investments are considered reasonable estimates
of the fair values of those investments. The fair value and carrying value of the Company’s investments are disclosed in Note 11 above.

The outstanding term debt on the Company’s senior credit facility totaled $70.0 million and $245.0 million at January 2, 2005 and December 28, 2003,
respectively. No amounts were outstanding under the revolving facility. The interest rate on the Company’s senior credit facility is reset monthly to reflect variable rates that reflect currently available terms and conditions for similar debt.
Consequently, the carrying value of the credit facility approximates fair value.

The fair value of 8


/


% notes and the 6.8% notes are estimated using market
quotes from brokers or are based on current rates offered for similar debt. At January 2, 2005, the 8


/


% notes
and the 6.8% notes had an aggregate carrying value of $303 million and a fair value of $347 million. At December 28, 2003, the 8

% notes and the 6.8% notes had an aggregate carrying value of $302 million and a fair value of $350 million.

Note 20:

Leases

The Company leases certain property and equipment under operating leases. Rental expense charged to continuing operations for 2004, 2003 and 2002 amounted
to $37.1 million, $37.1 million and $36.6 million, respectively. Minimum rental commitments under noncancelable operating leases are as follows: $30.5 million in 2005, $25.5 million in 2006, $17.1 million in 2007, $13.8 million in 2008, $12.5
million in 2009 and $122.2 million in 2010 and thereafter.

Note 21:

Guarantor Financial Information

The Company has outstanding $300 million in aggregate principal amount of 8

% Senior Subordinated Notes (the “8

Notes”) due 2013. The Company’s payment obligations under the 8

guaranteed by some of the Company’s domestic subsidiaries (the “Guarantor Subsidiaries”), all of which are wholly owned by the Company. These guarantees are full and unconditional and joint and several. The following supplemental
financial information sets forth, on an unconsolidated basis, income statement, balance sheet and statements of cash flow information for the Company (“Parent Company Only”), for the Guarantor Subsidiaries and for the Company’s other
subsidiaries (the “Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries”). The supplemental financial information reflects the investments of the Company and the Guarantor Subsidiaries in the Guarantor and Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries using the equity method of
accounting.

22:    Industry Segment and Geographic Area Information

In the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company announced plans to combine its Life Sciences and Analytical Instruments businesses into one business, Life and Analytical Sciences, with changes to organization, processes
and systems expected during 2003. In the second quarter of 2003, the Company completed many of the changes involved in the combination, including the integration of facilities and management reporting and systems. Therefore, commencing in the second
quarter of 2003, the two segments were aggregated into one reporting segment for financial statement purposes as discrete financial information is only available on a combined basis. The three reportable segments reflect the Company’s
management and structure under three strategic business units (SBUs). For comparative purposes, the Company has disclosed its Life Science and Analytical Science segments as one reporting segment for all periods presented.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The accounting policies of the reporting segments are the same as those described in Note 1. The
Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on sales and operating profit. Intersegment sales and transfers are not significant. The reporting segments and their principal products and services are:

•

Life and Analytical Sciences.

The Company is a leading provider of drug discovery, genetic screening, and environmental and chemical analysis tools,
including instruments, reagents, consumables, and services.

•

Optoelectronics.

The Company provides a broad range of digital imaging, sensor and specialty lighting components used in biomedical, consumer products
and other specialty end markets.

•

Fluid Sciences.

The Company provides a variety of precision valves, seals, bellows and pneumatic joints for critical fluid control and containment
systems for highly demanding environments such as turbine engines and semiconductor fabrication facilities.

Sales and operating profit by segment for the three years ended January 2, 2005 are shown in the table below:

The Company’s
Security and Detection Systems business (formerly included in the Life and Analytical Sciences segment), Telecommunications Component, Entertainment Lighting, Electroformed Products, Ultraviolet Lighting and Computer-To-Plate businesses (all

Controls and Procedures

Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of January 2, 2005. The term “disclosure controls and procedures” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a
company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the
SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange
Act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls
and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and
procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of January 2, 2005, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were
effective at the reasonable assurance level.

Management’s Report on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting as of January 2, 2005. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework.

Based on this assessment, our management believes that, as of
January 2, 2005, our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria.

Our independent auditors have issued an audit report on our management’s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. This report
appears below.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of PerkinElmer, Inc.

Wellesley, Massachusetts

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that
PerkinElmer, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 2, 2005, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our
audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures
as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive
and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial
reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness
of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that the Company
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 2, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 2, 2005, based on the criteria established in

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.



We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended January 2, 2005 of the Company and our report dated March 10, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements
and financial statement schedule.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

No change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during the fiscal
quarter ended January 2, 2005 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Other Information
