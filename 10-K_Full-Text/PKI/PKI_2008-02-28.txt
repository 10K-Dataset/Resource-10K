Our Strategy

Our strategy is focused on providing innovative products, applications, and services that drive
productivity improvements in targeted high growth market segments and developing value-added applications and solutions to foster continued market development and expansion. For example, during 2007, we launched EcoAnalytix

™

, a global initiative to provide product, training, support and service offerings targeting food safety, water quality and biofuels development applications. To execute on our strategy and
drive higher revenue growth, we focus on broadening our product and service offerings through the acquisition of innovative technology and expenditures for research and development. Our strategy includes:

•

Accelerating innovation through both internal research and development and the pursuit of third-party collaborations and alliances;

•

Achieving significant growth in both of our segments through strategic acquisitions and licensing;

•

Strengthening our position within key markets, by expanding our product and service offerings and maintaining superior product quality;

•

Utilizing our share repurchase programs to help drive shareholder value; and

•

Attracting, retaining and developing talented and motivated employees.



Recent Developments

As part of our strategy to grow our core businesses, we have taken the following actions in 2007:

Acquisitions:

Newborn Metabolic Screening Business from Pediatrix Medical Group, Inc.

In December 2007, we entered into an
agreement to acquire the outstanding stock of Pediatrix Screening, Inc., which constitutes the newborn metabolic screening (“NMS”) business of Pediatrix Medical Group, Inc. The NMS business provides neonatal screening and consultative
services to hospitals, medical groups and various states. This acquisition is intended to expand our capabilities to supply state laboratories and other agencies with comprehensive newborn screening solutions. This transaction is expected to close
during the first quarter of 2008.

ViaCell, Inc.

In November 2007, our wholly owned subsidiary completed a tender offer for all of the outstanding shares of common stock of ViaCell, Inc. (“ViaCell”), at a price of $7.25 per share.
ViaCell specializes in the collection, testing, processing and preservation of umbilical cord blood stem cells. Through the tender offer, our wholly owned subsidiary acquired more than 90% of the outstanding shares of common stock of ViaCell. We
acquired the remaining outstanding shares of ViaCell by means of a merger of our wholly owned subsidiary with and into ViaCell, as a result of which ViaCell became our wholly owned subsidiary. The addition of ViaCell’s ViaCord

®

product offering for the preservation of umbilical cord blood, and its sales and marketing organization, is expected to facilitate the expansion of our neonatal and prenatal businesses.
Aggregate consideration for this transaction was approximately $295.8 million in cash, which excludes $31.8 million in acquired cash. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets has been allocated to goodwill,
none of which is tax deductible.

Following the ViaCell
acquisition, we committed to a preliminary plan of integration of certain ViaCell activities that included workforce reductions. As of December 30, 2007, we recorded $1.2 million of severance liabilities with a corresponding adjustment to
goodwill in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue No. 95-3,

“Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Business Combination”

(“EITF 95-3”). We had not finalized the
preliminary integration plan as of December 30, 2007, but we expect to complete the plan no later than one year from the date of acquisition.

Following the ViaCell acquisition, our Board of Directors (the “Board”) approved a plan
to sell the ViaCyte

SM

and Cellular Therapy Technology businesses that were acquired with ViaCell. The ViaCyte

SM

business focuses on the development of a proprietary media intended for the cryopreservation of human unfertilized oocytes. The Cellular Therapy Technology
business focuses on the development of therapeutic uses of unrestricted somatic stem cells derived from umbilical cord blood, including the areas of cancer, cardiac disease and diabetes. We have determined that both businesses do not
strategically fit with the other products offered by the Life and Analytical Sciences segment. We also determined that without investing capital into the operations of both businesses, we could not effectively compete in the marketplace with larger
companies which focus on the market for such products. We are actively marketing and are currently committed to a plan to sell both of these businesses. We have classified the results of the ViaCyte

SM

and Cellular Therapy Technology businesses as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements.

Remaining minority interest of PerkinElmer India Pvt. Ltd.

In June 2007, we acquired the remaining minority
interest in PerkinElmer India Pvt. Ltd. (“PKI India”), a direct sales, service and marketing operation targeting India’s life science and analytical instrumentation markets, from Labindia Instruments Pvt. Ltd. The acquisition
establishes PKI India as our wholly owned subsidiary. Consideration for this transaction was approximately $1.3 million in cash plus potential additional consideration of approximately $0.7 million, of which we paid $0.2 million during the fiscal
year 2007. We expect to pay the remaining $0.5 million in quarterly installments through the first quarter of 2008. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets has been allocated to goodwill, none of which is tax
deductible.

Improvision Ltd.

In March 2007, we
acquired the stock of Improvision Ltd. (“Improvision”), a leading provider of cellular imaging software and integrated hardware solutions used in life sciences research. We expect



that the addition of Improvision’s imaging and analysis software to our high content screening systems will provide customers with powerful imaging
solutions for analyzing cellular events, from real-time imaging of live cells to rapid high content screening of multiple samples. Consideration for this transaction was approximately $23.6 million in cash plus potential additional contingent
consideration, which we expect to be immaterial to us. During 2007, we paid $0.6 million for net working capital adjustments. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets has been allocated to goodwill, none of
which is tax deductible.

Euroscreen Products
S.A.

In January 2007, we acquired the stock of Euroscreen Products S.A. (“Euroscreen”), a developer of the AequoScreen™ cellular assay platform. The AequoScreen™ platform from Euroscreen is based on an innovative
luminescence technology that generates higher quality data, while reducing the number of false positives in G protein-coupled receptor (“GPCR”) screening applications. Consideration for this transaction was approximately $18.1 million in
cash. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets has been allocated to goodwill, none of which is tax deductible.

Evotec Technologies GmbH

. In January 2007, we acquired the stock of Evotec Technologies GmbH (“Evotec”). The acquisition is intended
to allow us to provide our customers in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and academic arenas with Evotec’s high content screening instruments and software. These analysis tools determine the composition of cells and cell structure, a critical
step in moving potential drug targets quickly through the discovery process. Consideration for this transaction was approximately $33.0 million in cash, which was paid in fiscal year 2006. During 2007, we received $1.2 million for net working
capital adjustments. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets has been allocated to goodwill, none of which is tax deductible.

The operations for each of these acquisitions completed during fiscal 2007 have been reported within the results of our Life
and Analytical Sciences segment from the acquisition date.

We
took the following actions in 2007 to further focus our core businesses:

Share Repurchase Program:

On
November 6, 2006, we announced that our Board authorized us to repurchase up to 10.0 million shares of our common stock under a stock repurchase program (the “Repurchase Program”). The Repurchase Program will expire on
October 25, 2010 unless this authorization is terminated earlier by our Board, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. During fiscal 2007, we repurchased in the open market approximately 8.1 million shares of our common stock at
an aggregate cost of $203.0 million, including commissions, under the Repurchase Program. The repurchased shares have been reflected as additional authorized but unissued shares, with the payments reflected in common stock and capital in excess of
par value.

Restructuring:

During fiscal 2007, we incurred $14.4 million in pre-tax restructuring and
lease charges. During the first and fourth quarters of 2007, our management approved separate plans for workforce reductions in several locations and partial closure of a facility. The purpose of the restructuring plans approved in the first and
fourth quarters of 2007 was principally to shift resources into geographic regions and product lines that are more consistent with our growth strategy. The pre-tax restructuring activity associated with these plans has been reported as restructuring
expenses as a component of operating expenses from continuing operations. We expect the impact of immediate and future cost savings from these restructuring activities on operating results and cash flows to be negligible, as we have incurred and
will incur offsetting costs.

Leadership Succession Plan:

We announced on July 26, 2007 that our Board had
approved a leadership succession plan. On July 25, 2007, our Board elected Robert F. Friel to the position of President and Chief Operating Officer of the Company, effective August 1, 2007. Mr. Friel had previously served as Vice
Chairman of the Company and President of our



Life and Analytical Sciences segment, and he remains a Director of the Company. On January 23, 2008, our Board elected Mr. Friel Chief Executive
Officer and appointed Gregory L. Summe Executive Chairman of the Board, effective February 1, 2008. As Executive Chairman of the Board, Mr. Summe will continue to work for the Company at a reduced schedule until the earlier of
April 21, 2009 or the date of our 2009 annual meeting of shareholders (the “2009 Meeting Date”). Our Board intends that Mr. Summe will remain a Director until the 2009 Meeting Date, at which time Mr. Summe will step down as
Executive Chairman and as a member of the Board.

Marketing

All of our businesses market their products and services directly through their own specialized sales forces. As of December 30, 2007, we employed
approximately 2,800 sales and service representatives operating in approximately 35 countries, and marketing products and services in more than 150 countries. In addition, in geographic regions where we do not have a sales and service presence, we
utilize distributors to sell our products.

Raw Materials and Supplies

Each of our businesses uses a wide variety of raw materials
and supplies that are generally available from alternate sources of supply and in adequate quantities from domestic and foreign sources. We generally have multi-year contracts, with no minimum purchase requirements, with certain suppliers. For
certain critical raw materials and supplies required for the production of some of our principal products, we have qualified only a limited or a single source of supply. We periodically purchase quantities of some of these critical raw materials in
excess of current requirements, in anticipation of future manufacturing needs. With sufficient lead times, we believe we would be able to qualify alternative suppliers for each of these raw materials. See further description in the applicable risk

array of unpatented proprietary technology and know-how. We also own numerous United States and foreign trademarks and trade names for a variety of our
product names, and have applications for the registration of trademarks and trade names pending in the United States and abroad. We believe that patents and other proprietary rights are important to the development of both of our reporting segments,
but we also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain the competitive position of both of our reporting segments. We do not believe that the loss of any one patent or
other proprietary right would have a material adverse effect on our overall business or on any of our reporting segments.

In some cases, we may participate in litigation or other proceedings to defend against or assert claims of infringement, to enforce our patents or our
licensors’ patents, to protect our trade secrets, know-how or other intellectual property rights, or to determine the scope and validity of our or third parties’ intellectual property rights. Litigation of this type could result in
substantial cost to us and diversion of our resources. An adverse outcome in any litigation or proceeding could subject us to significant liabilities or expenses, require us to cease using disputed intellectual property or cease the sale of a
product, or require us to license the disputed intellectual property from third parties. We are currently involved in several lawsuits involving claims of violation of intellectual property rights. See “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” for a
discussion of these matters.

Backlog

We believe that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business
prospects for either of our business segments due to the short lead time required on a majority of our sales. Therefore, we believe that backlog information is not material to an understanding of our business.

Competition

Due to the wide range of our products and services, we face many different types of competition and competitors. This
affects our ability to sell our products and services and the prices at which these products and services are sold. Our competitors range from large foreign and domestic organizations, which produce a comprehensive array of goods and services and
that may have greater financial and other resources, to small firms producing a limited number of goods or services for specialized market segments.

In our Life and Analytical Sciences segment, we compete on the basis of service level, price, technological innovation, product differentiation, product
availability, quality and reliability. Competitors range from multinational organizations with a wide range of products to specialized firms that in some cases have well-established market niches. We expect the proportion of large competitors in
this reporting segment to increase through the continued consolidation of competitors.

We do not believe any single competitor competes directly with our Optoelectronics segment across its full product range. However, we do compete with specialized manufacturing companies in the manufacturing and sale
of specialty flashtubes and ultra specialty lighting sources, photo detectors and photodiodes, and switched power supplies. Competition is based on price, technological innovation, operational efficiency, and product reliability and quality.

We believe we compete effectively in each of the areas in
which our businesses experience competition.

Research and Development

Research and development expenditures were approximately
$113.1 million during fiscal 2007, approximately $99.7 million during fiscal 2006, and approximately $87.4 million during fiscal 2005. The fiscal year 2007 included an in-process research and development (“IPR&D”) charge of $1.5
million related to the Evotec and Euroscreen acquisitions.



We directed our research and development efforts in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 primarily toward genetic
screening, BioDiscovery, and analytical sciences markets within our Life and Analytical Sciences segment, and medical imaging and photonics within our Optoelectronics segment, in order to help accelerate our growth initiatives. We expect our
research and development spending to increase on an absolute basis and in line with our growth in sales during fiscal 2008, and to continue to emphasize these same markets.

Environmental Matters

Our operations are subject to various foreign, federal, state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations. These requirements include those
governing emissions and discharges of hazardous substances, the remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater, the regulation of radioactive materials, and the health and safety of our employees.

We may have liability under the Comprehensive Environmental Response
Compensation and Liability Act and comparable state statutes that impose liability for investigation and remediation of contamination without regard to fault, in connection with materials that we or our former businesses sent to various third-party
sites. We have incurred, and expect to incur, costs pursuant to these statutes.

We are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at our current and former locations and, along with other companies, have been named a potentially responsible party (“PRP”)
for certain waste disposal sites. We accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period that our responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated. We have accrued $4.2 million as of December 30, 2007, which
represents our management’s estimate of the total cost of ultimate disposition of known environmental matters. This amount is not discounted and does not reflect the recovery of any amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements.
These cost estimates are subject to a number of variables, including the stage of the environmental investigations, the magnitude of the possible contamination, the nature of the potential remedies, possible joint and several liability, the time
period over which remediation may occur, and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations. For sites where we have been named a PRP, our management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other
significant named parties to contribute. We expect that the majority of such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to ten years. As assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site, these liabilities are
reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available. There have been no environmental problems to date that have had or are expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or
cash flows. While it is possible that a loss exceeding the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may be incurred, the potential exposure is not expected to be materially different from those amounts recorded.

In addition, we accrued $9.7 million during the second quarter of 2007 for a
fire that occurred within our Life and Analytical Sciences facility in Boston, Massachusetts in March 2005, representing our management’s estimate of the total cost for decommissioning the building, including environmental matters. We paid $3.9
million during fiscal year 2007 towards decommissioning the building. We anticipate that the remaining payments of $5.8 million will be completed by the end of fiscal year 2008.

We may become subject to new or unforeseen environmental costs or liabilities. Compliance with new or more stringent laws or
regulations, stricter interpretations of existing laws, or the discovery of new contamination could cause us to incur additional costs.

Employees

As of December 30, 2007, we employed approximately 8,700 employees. Several of our subsidiaries are parties to contracts with labor unions and
workers’ councils. As of December 30, 2007, we employed an aggregate of approximately 1,700 union and workers’ council employees. We consider our relations with employees to be satisfactory.



Financial Information About Reporting Segments

The assets and expenses for our corporate headquarters, such as legal, tax, accounting and finance, human resources,
property and insurance management, information technology, treasury and other management and compliance costs, have been included as “Corporate” below. We have a process to allocate and recharge expenses to the reportable segments when
such costs are administered or paid by the corporate headquarters based on the extent to which the segment benefited from the expenses. These amounts have been calculated in a consistent manner and are included in our calculations of segment results
to internally plan and assess the performance of each segment for all purposes, including determining the compensation of the business leaders for each of our operating segments.

The table below sets forth sales and operating income (loss) by reporting segment for the 2007, 2006 and 2005 fiscal years:

Discontinued
operations have not been included in the preceding table.

Additional information relating to our reporting segments for the 2007, 2006 and 2005 fiscal years is as follows:



Financial Information About Geographic Areas

Both of our reporting segments conduct business in, and derive substantial revenue from, various countries outside the
United States. During fiscal 2007, we had $1,127.8 million in sales from our international operations, representing approximately 63% of our total sales. During fiscal 2007, we derived approximately 76% of our international sales from our Life and
Analytical Sciences segment, and approximately 24% of our international sales from our Optoelectronics segment. We anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total sales in the future.

We are exposed to the risks associated with international
operations, including exchange rate fluctuations, regional and country-specific political and economic conditions, foreign receivables collection concerns, trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements, tax risks, staffing
and labor law concerns, intellectual property protection risks, and differing regulatory requirements. Geographic information is discussed in Note 23 to our consolidated financial statements.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors

The following important factors affect our business and operations generally or affect multiple segments of our business and operations:

If we do not introduce new products in a timely manner, we may lose market share and be unable to achieve revenue growth targets.

We sell many of our products in industries
characterized by rapid technological change, frequent new product and service introductions, and evolving customer needs and industry standards. Many of the businesses competing with us in these industries have significant financial and other
resources to invest in new technologies, substantial intellectual property portfolios, substantial experience in new product development, regulatory expertise, manufacturing capabilities, and the distribution channels to deliver products to
customers. Our products could become technologically obsolete over time, or we may invest in technology that does not lead to revenue growth, or continue to sell products for which the demand from our customers is declining, in which case we may
lose market share or not achieve our revenue growth targets. The success of our new product offerings will depend upon several factors, including our ability to:

•

accurately anticipate customer needs,

•

innovate and develop new technologies and applications,

•

successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner,

•

price our products competitively, and manufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes and on time, and

•

differentiate our offerings from our competitors’ offerings.

Many of our products are used by our customers to develop, test and manufacture their products. We must anticipate industry trends and
consistently develop new products to meet our customers’ expectations. In developing new products, we may be required to make significant investments before we can determine the commercial viability of the new product. If we fail to accurately
foresee our customers’ needs and future activities, we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant sales. We may also suffer a loss in market share and potential sales revenue if we are unable to
commercialize our technology in a timely and efficient manner.

In addition, some of our licensed technology is subject to contractual restrictions, which may limit our ability to develop or commercialize products for some applications.



We may not be able to successfully execute acquisitions or license technologies, integrate acquired
businesses or licensed technologies into our existing businesses, or make acquired businesses or licensed technologies profitable.

We have in the past, and may in the future, supplement our internal growth by acquiring businesses and licensing technologies that complement or augment
our existing product lines, such as Evotec Technologies GmbH and Euroscreen Products S.A., acquired in January 2007, Improvision Ltd., acquired in March 2007, the remaining minority interest of PerkinElmer India Pvt. Ltd., acquired in June 2007 and
ViaCell, Inc., acquired in November 2007. However, we may be unable to identify or complete promising acquisitions or license transactions for many reasons, including:

•

competition among buyers and licensees,

•

the high valuations of businesses and technologies,

•

the need for regulatory and other approval, and

•

our inability to raise capital to fund these acquisitions.

Some of the businesses we may seek to acquire may be unprofitable or marginally profitable. Accordingly, the earnings or
losses of acquired businesses may dilute our earnings. For these acquired businesses to achieve acceptable levels of profitability, we must improve their management, operations, products and market penetration. We may not be successful in this
regard and may encounter other difficulties in integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations, such as incompatible management, information or other systems, cultural differences or difficulties in predicting financial results. As a
result, our financial results may differ from our forecasts or the expectations of the investment community in a given quarter or over the long term.

To finance our acquisitions, we may have to raise additional funds, either through public or private financings. We may be unable to obtain such funds or
may be able to do so only on terms unacceptable to us. We may also incur expenses in evaluating possible acquisitions that we ultimately do not acquire, which expenses then may adversely impact our profitability.

If the markets into which we sell our products decline, or do not grow
as anticipated due to a decline in general economic conditions or uncertainties surrounding the approval of government or industrial funding proposals, we may see an adverse effect on the results of our business operations.

Our customers include pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies,
laboratories, academic and research institutions, public health authorities, private healthcare organizations, doctors and government agencies. Our quarterly sales and results of operations are highly dependent on the volume and timing of orders
received during the quarter. In addition, our revenues and earnings forecasts for future quarters are often based on the expected trends in our markets. However, the markets we serve do not always experience the trends that we may expect. Negative
fluctuations in our customers’ markets, general economic conditions or cuts in government funding would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and services. In addition, government funding is subject to the political process,
which is inherently fluid and unpredictable. Our revenues may be adversely affected if our customers delay or reduce purchases as a result of uncertainties surrounding the approval of government or industrial funding proposals. Such declines could
harm our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows and trading price of our common stock, and could limit our ability to sustain profitability.

We may not be successful in adequately protecting our intellectual property.

Patent and trade secret protection is important to us because developing new
products, processes and technologies gives us a competitive advantage, although it is time-consuming and expensive. We own many United States and foreign patents and intend to apply for additional patents. Patent applications we file, however,



may not result in issued patents or, if they do, the claims allowed in the patents may be narrower than what is needed to protect fully our products,
processes and technologies. Similarly, applications to register our trademarks may not be granted in all countries in which they are filed. For our intellectual property that is protected by keeping it secret, such as trade secrets and know-how, we
may not use adequate measures to protect this intellectual property.

Third parties may also challenge the validity of our issued patents, may circumvent or “design around” our patents and patent applications, or may claim that our products, processes or technologies infringe their patents. In
addition, third parties may assert that our product names infringe their trademarks. We may incur significant expense in legal proceedings to protect our intellectual property against infringement by third parties or to defend against claims of
infringement by third parties. Claims by third parties in pending or future lawsuits could result in awards of substantial damages against us or court orders that could effectively prevent us from manufacturing, using, importing or selling our
products in the United States or other countries.

If we
are unable to renew our licenses or otherwise lose our licensed rights, we may have to stop selling products or we may lose competitive advantage.

We may not be able to renew our existing licenses, or licenses we may obtain in the future, on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we lose the rights to
a patented or other proprietary technology, we may need to stop selling products incorporating that technology and possibly other products, redesign our products or lose a competitive advantage. Potential competitors could in-license technologies
that we fail to license and potentially erode our market share.

Our licenses typically subject us to various economic and commercialization obligations. If we fail to comply with these obligations, we could lose important rights under a license, such as the right to exclusivity in a market. In some
cases, we could lose all rights under the license. In addition, rights granted under the license could be lost for reasons out of our control. For example, the licensor could lose patent protection for a number of reasons, including invalidity of
the licensed patent, or a third party could obtain a patent that curtails our freedom to operate under one or more licenses.

If we do not compete effectively, our business will be harmed.

We encounter aggressive competition from numerous competitors in many areas of our business. We may not be able to compete
effectively with all of these competitors. To remain competitive, we must develop new products and periodically enhance our existing products. We anticipate that we may also have to adjust the prices of many of our products to stay competitive. In
addition, new competitors, technologies or market trends may emerge to threaten or reduce the value of entire product lines.

Our quarterly operating results could be subject to significant fluctuation, and we may not be able to adjust our operations to effectively address
changes we do not anticipate, which could increase the volatility of our stock price and potentially cause losses to our shareholders.

Given the nature of the markets in which we participate, we cannot reliably predict future sales and profitability. Changes in competitive, market and
economic conditions may require us to adjust our operations, and we may not be able to make those adjustments or make them quickly enough to adapt to changing conditions. A high proportion of our costs are fixed, due in part to our research and
development and manufacturing costs. Thus, small declines in sales could disproportionately affect our operating results in a quarter. Factors that may affect our quarterly operating results include:

•

demand for and market acceptance of our products,

•

competitive pressures resulting in lower selling prices,

•

adverse changes in the level of economic activity in regions in which we do business,



•

decline in general economic conditions or government funding,

•

adverse income tax audit settlements,

•

differing tax laws and changes in those laws, or changes in the countries in which we are subject to tax,

•

adverse changes in industries, such as pharmaceutical and biomedical,

•

changes in the portions of our sales represented by our various products and customers,

•

delays or problems in the introduction of new products,

•

our competitors’ announcement or introduction of new products, services or technological innovations,

•

increased costs of raw materials or supplies, and

•

changes in the volume or timing of product orders.

Disruptions in the supply of raw materials and supplies from our limited or single source suppliers could have an adverse effect on the results of
our business operations, and could damage our relationships with customers.

The production of our products requires a wide variety of raw materials and supplies that are generally available from alternate sources of supply. However, certain critical raw materials and supplies required for the
production of some of our principal products are available from limited or single sources of supply. We generally have multi-year contracts with no minimum purchase requirements with these suppliers, but those contracts may not fully protect us from
a failure by certain suppliers to supply critical materials or from the delays inherent in being required to change suppliers and, in some cases, validate new raw materials. Such raw materials and supplies usually could be obtained from alternative
sources with the potential for an increase in price, decline in quality or delay in delivery, but a prolonged inability to obtain certain raw materials or supplies is possible and could have an adverse effect on our business operations, and could
damage our relationships with customers.

If we are
unable to produce an adequate quantity of products to meet our customers’ demands, our revenue growth may be adversely affected.

We have an established global manufacturing base with facilities in multiple locations around the world. Each of these facilities faces risks to its
production capacity that may relate to natural disasters, labor relations or regulatory compliance. In addition, in any of these facilities, we may not manage the manufacturing or production processes at expected levels, we may fail to anticipate or
act on the need to increase the production capacity, or we may be unable to quickly resolve technical manufacturing issues that arise from time to time. Any of these risks could cause our revenue growth to be adversely affected.

The manufacture and sale of products may expose us to product liability
claims for which we could have substantial liability.

We face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims if our products or product candidates are alleged or found to have caused injury, damage or loss. We believe that our current liability insurance coverage is adequate
for our present clinical and commercial activities, however we may in the future be unable to obtain insurance with adequate levels of coverage for potential liability on acceptable terms or claims of this nature may be excluded from coverage under
the terms of any insurance policy that we can obtain. If we are unable to obtain such insurance or the amounts of any claims successfully brought against us substantially exceed our coverage, then our business could be adversely impacted.



If we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with the regulations of the United States Food and
Drug Administration and other governmental agencies, we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution, and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties.

Some of the products produced by our Life and Analytical Sciences segment
are subject to regulation by the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and similar international agencies. These regulations govern a wide variety of product activities, from design and development to labeling, manufacturing,
promotion, sales, resales and distribution. If we fail to comply with those regulations or those of similar international agencies, we may have to recall products, cease their manufacture and distribution, and may be subject to fines or criminal
prosecution. Other aspects of our operations are subject to regulation by different government agencies in the United States and other countries. If we fail to comply with those regulations, we could be subject to fines, penalties, criminal
prosecution or other sanctions.

Changes in governmental
regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses.

We compete in markets in which we or our customers must comply with federal, state, local and foreign regulations, such as environmental, health and safety, and food and drug regulations. We develop, configure and
market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations. Any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our costs of producing these products.

The healthcare industry is highly regulated and if we fail to comply
with its extensive system of laws and regulations, we could suffer fines and penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations which could have a significant adverse effect on the results of our business operations.

The healthcare industry, including our genetic screening
business, is subject to extensive and frequently changing international and United States federal, state and local laws and regulations. In addition, legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse, patient privacy violations and
misconduct involving government insurance programs provide federal enforcement personnel with substantial powers and remedies to pursue suspected violations. We believe that our business will continue to be subject to increasing regulation as the
federal government continues to strengthen its position on healthcare matters, the scope and effect of which we cannot predict. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could suffer civil and criminal damages, fines and
penalties, exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs, and the loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business, as well as incur liabilities from third-party claims, all of which
could have a significant adverse effect on our business.

Economic, political and other risks associated with foreign operations could adversely affect our international sales and profitability.

Because we sell our products worldwide, our businesses are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. Our sales originating
outside the United States represented the majority of our total sales in the fiscal year ended December 30, 2007. We anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total sales. In
addition, many of our manufacturing facilities, employees and suppliers are located outside the United States. Accordingly, our future results of operations could be harmed by a variety of factors, including:

•

changes in foreign currency exchange rates,

•

changes in a country’s or region’s political or economic conditions, particularly in developing or emerging markets,

•

longer payment cycles of foreign customers and timing of collections in foreign jurisdictions,

•

trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements,

•

differing tax laws and changes in those laws, or changes in the countries in which we are subject to tax,



•

adverse income tax audit settlements,

•

differing business practices associated with foreign operations,

•

difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations,

•

differing labor laws and changes in those laws,

•

differing protection of intellectual property and changes in that protection, and

•

differing regulatory requirements and changes in those requirements.

If we do not retain our key personnel, our ability to execute our business strategy will be limited.

Our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of
our executive officers and key management and technical personnel, particularly our experienced engineers, and on our ability to continue to attract, retain, and motivate qualified personnel. The competition for these employees is intense. The loss
of the services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. In addition, there could be a material adverse effect on us should the turnover rates for engineers and other key personnel increase
significantly or if we are unable to continue to attract qualified personnel. We do not maintain any key person life insurance policy on any of our officers or employees.

Our success also depends on our ability to execute our leadership succession plan. The inability to successfully transition these and other
key management roles could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.

Restrictions in our credit facilities may limit our activities.

Our amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility and our unsecured interim credit facility each contain, and future debt instruments to which we may
become subject may contain, restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit our company. Our amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility and our unsecured interim credit facility each include
restrictions on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to:

•

pay dividends on, redeem or repurchase our capital stock,

•

sell assets,

•

incur obligations that restrict their ability to make dividend or other payments to us,

•

guarantee or secure indebtedness,

•

enter into transactions with affiliates, and

•

consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.

We are also required to meet specified financial ratios under the terms of
our amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility. Our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance, which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors, including
factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates, changes in technology and changes in the level of competition.

Our failure to comply with any of these restrictions in our amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility may result in an event of default under
that facility, which could permit acceleration of the debt under that facility, and require us to prepay that debt before its scheduled due date.



Our results of
operations will be adversely affected if we fail to realize the full value of our intangible assets.

As of December 30, 2007, our total assets included $1.8 billion of net intangible assets. Net intangible assets consist principally of goodwill
associated with acquisitions and costs associated with securing patent rights, trademark rights and technology licenses, net of accumulated amortization. We test certain of these items—specifically all of those that are considered
“non-amortizing”—at least on an annual basis for potential impairment by comparing the carrying value to the fair market value of the reporting unit to which they are assigned. All of our amortizing intangible assets are evaluated for
impairment should discrete events occur that call into question the recoverability of the intangible.

Adverse changes in our business or the failure to grow our Life and Analytical Sciences segment may result in impairment of our intangible assets which
could adversely affect our results of operations.

Item 1B.

Unresolved Staff Comments

Not applicable.

Item 2.

Properties

As of December 30, 2007, our continuing operations occupied approximately 2,575,000 square feet in over 90 locations. We own approximately 600,000 square feet of this space, and lease the balance. We conduct our
operations in manufacturing and assembly plants, research laboratories, administrative offices and other facilities located in 8 states and 35 foreign countries.

Facilities outside of the United States account for approximately 1,443,000 square feet of our owned and leased property, or
approximately 56% of our total occupied space.

Our real
property leases are both short-term and long-term. We believe that our properties are well-maintained and are adequate for our present requirements.

The following table indicates, as of December 30, 2007, the approximate square footage of real property owned and leased attributable to the
continuing operations of both of our reporting segments:



Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

In papers dated October 23, 2002, Enzo Biochem, Inc. and Enzo Life Sciences, Inc. (collectively, “Enzo”) filed a complaint in the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Civil Action No. 02-8448, against Amersham plc, Amersham BioSciences, PerkinElmer, Inc., PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Inc., Sigma-Aldrich Corporation, Sigma Chemical Company, Inc.,
Molecular Probes, Inc., and Orchid BioSciences, Inc. The complaint alleges that we have breached our distributorship and settlement agreements with Enzo, infringed Enzo’s patents, engaged in unfair competition and fraud, and committed torts
against Enzo by, among other things, engaging in commercial development and exploitation of Enzo’s patented products and technology, separately and together with the other defendants. Enzo seeks injunctive and monetary relief. In 2003, the
court severed the lawsuit and ordered Enzo to serve individual complaints against the five defendants. We subsequently filed an answer and a counterclaim alleging that Enzo’s patents are invalid. In July 2006, the court issued a decision
regarding the construction of the claims in Enzo’s patents that effectively limited the coverage of certain of those claims and, we believe, excludes certain of our products from the coverage of Enzo’s patents. Summary judgment motions
were filed by the defendants in January 2007, and a hearing with oral argument on those motions took place in July 2007, but a decision on those motions has not been rendered, and a trial date has not been set.

On October 17,
2003, Amersham Biosciences Corp. filed a complaint, which was subsequently amended, in the United States District Court for New Jersey, Civil Action No. 03-4901, seeking injunctive and monetary relief against one of our subsidiaries and
alleging that our ViewLux

™

and certain of our Image FlashPlate

™

products infringe three of Amersham’s patents related to
high-throughput screening (the “NJ case”). On August 18, 2004, Amersham plc filed a complaint against two of our United Kingdom-based subsidiaries in the Patent Court of the English High Court of Justice, Case No. 04C02688,
alleging that our same products infringe one corresponding Amersham patent in the United Kingdom, which was granted in August 2004 (the “UK case”). On October 29, 2003, we filed a complaint, which was subsequently amended, seeking
injunctive and monetary relief against Amersham in the United States District Court for Massachusetts, Civil Action No. 03-12098, alleging that Amersham’s IN Cell Analyzer, and LEADseeker

™

Multimodality Imaging system and certain Cyclic AMP and IP3 assays infringe two of our patents related to high-throughput screening (the “MA case”). After a trial in the UK case in December 2005, the court
ruled in February 2006 that Amersham’s patent in question was invalid in the United Kingdom and awarded costs to us. Amersham initiated an appeal of the ruling in the UK case but withdrew that appeal in January 2007. In May 2006, the court in
the NJ case issued a decision regarding the construction of the claims in Amersham’s patents that adopted many of Amersham’s claim construction positions. The parties entered into a settlement agreement in November 2007 to resolve all of
the foregoing matters.

In 2002, PharmaStem Therapeutics, Inc.
(“PharmaStem”) filed suit against ViaCell, Inc., which is now our wholly owned subsidiary, and several other defendants in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, alleging infringement of United States Patents
No. 5,004,681 and No. 5,192,553, relating to certain aspects of the collection, cryopreservation and storage of hematopoietic stem cells and progenitor cells from umbilical cord blood (“PharmaStem I”). After several years of
proceedings at the District Court level, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit issued a decision in July 2007 that ViaCell did not infringe these two patents and that the two patents are invalid. PharmaStem filed a certiorari
petition in January 2008 seeking to have the United States Supreme Court review the appellate court’s decision as to the invalidity of the patents, but did not seek any further review of the non-infringement decision. PharmaStem had also filed
a second complaint against ViaCell and other defendants in July 2004 in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, alleging infringement of United States Patents No. 6,461,645 and 6,569,427, which also relate to certain
aspects of the collection, cryopreservation and storage of hematopoietic stem cells and progenitor cells from umbilical cord blood (“PharmaStem II”). We believe that the issues presented in PharmaStem II, which was subsequently
consolidated in the District of Delaware with similar cases brought by PharmaStem against other family cord blood banks, are substantially the same as the issues presented in PharmaStem I, and that ViaCell does not infringe the patents at issue in
the second case and that those patents are invalid for the same reasons as cited by the Court of Appeals in PharmaStem I. The Delaware court granted ViaCell’s motion in October 2005 to stay the proceedings in PharmaStem II pending the outcome
of PharmaStem I and a decision from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“U.S. PTO”) on certain patent re-examination issues.



Although the U.S. PTO had previously issued notice of its intent to allow the remaining claims of all of the patents, the U.S. PTO subsequently decided to
begin the process of re-examining each patent. ViaCell has informed the Delaware Court overseeing PharmaStem II of the status of the re-examinations and that the Federal Circuit had ruled in its favor in the PharmaStem I case. The Delaware Court has
yet to take any action in response to these notices.

We
believe we have meritorious defenses to these lawsuits and other proceedings, and we are contesting the actions vigorously in all of the above unresolved matters. We are currently unable, however, to reasonably estimate the amount of loss, if any,
that may result from the resolution of these matters, or to determine whether resolution of any of these matters will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.

We are also subject to various other claims, legal proceedings and
investigations covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities. Although, we have established accruals for potential losses that we believe are probable and reasonably estimable, in the opinion of our
management, based on its review of the information available at this time, the total cost of resolving these other contingencies at December 30, 2007 should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements included in

following table sets forth the high and low per share sale prices for our common stock on that exchange for each fiscal quarter in 2007 and 2006.

As of
February 26, 2008, we had approximately 7,278 holders of record of our common stock.

Stock Repurchase Program

On October 21, 2005 our Board reaffirmed our authority to repurchase up to 10.0 million shares of our common stock, which we publicly disclosed on November 14, 2005 (the “2005 Program”). During the first quarter of
2006, we repurchased 5,000,000 shares of our common stock in the open market under the 2005 Program at an aggregate cost of $116.4 million, including commissions. We did not repurchase any shares of our common stock in the second quarter of 2006.

Selected Financial Data

The following table sets forth selected historical financial information as of and for each of the fiscal years in the five-year period ended
December 30, 2007. We derived the selected historical financial information as of and for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended December 30, 2007 from our audited consolidated financial statements which are included
elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. We derived the selected historical financial information as of and for the fiscal years ended January 2, 2005 and December 28, 2003 from our audited consolidated financial statements which are
not included in this annual report on Form 10-K. As with our financial statements for the fiscal year ended January 1, 2006, we adjusted the information in the financial statements for the fiscal years ended January 2, 2005 and
December 28, 2003, where appropriate, to account for our discontinued operations.

Our historical financial information may not be indicative of our results of operations or financial position in the future.

You should read the following selected historical financial information together with our “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations” and our consolidated financial statements, including the related notes, included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.



(1)

We adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 123(R),

“Share-Based Payment

” (SFAS No. 123(R)”), on January 2,
2006. The total incremental pre-tax compensation related to stock options was $9.2 million in each of the fiscal years 2007 and 2006.

(2)

We incurred pre-tax restructuring and lease charges (reversals), net, of $14.4 million in fiscal year 2007, ($3.6) million in fiscal year 2006, $22.1 million in fiscal year 2005 and
($2.8) million in fiscal year 2003.

(3)

We settled an insurance claim resulting from a fire that occurred in one of our facilities in March 2005. As a result of that settlement, we recorded pre-tax gains of $15.3 million
in fiscal year 2007.

(4)

In fiscal year 2005, we incurred $54.9 million in fees associated with the extinguishment of our senior subordinated


/


% notes due 2013 offset by gains on the sales of investments of $5.8 million.

(5)

The fiscal year 2005 effective tax rate on continuing operations of 0.19% was largely due to a $27.5 million benefit related to the settlement of federal, state and foreign income
tax audits and an additional accrual of $15.5 million related to the homeland investment provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.

(6)

The fiscal year 2007 effective tax rate on continuing operations of 11.5% was largely due to a $18.6 million benefit related to the settlement of an income tax audit.

(7)

In fiscal year 2006, we sold substantially all of the assets of the Semiconductor business of our Fluid Sciences segment for approximately $26.5 million, subject to a net working
capital adjustment, plus potential additional contingent consideration. We recognized a pre-tax gain of $3.8 million, exclusive of additional contingent consideration.

(8)

In fiscal year 2005, we sold the Aerospace and Fluid Testing businesses of our Fluid Sciences segment for a net pre-tax gain of $280.9 million. Net pre-tax losses of $8.5 million
related to the sale of the Lithography Business and Fiber Optic Test Equipment Business, both included in our Optoelectronics segment, were partially offset by other pre-tax gains of $1.4 million that related to multiple discontinued operations.

(9)

In November 2007, we completed the tender offer for all of the outstanding shares of common stock of ViaCell. Aggregate consideration for this transaction was approximately $295.8
million in cash, which excludes $31.8 million in acquired cash. In connection with this acquisition, we entered into a $300.0 million unsecured interim credit facility to pay the purchase price and transactional expenses of this acquisition. This
interim credit facility matures on March 31, 2008, at which point all amounts outstanding are due in full. Prior to February 28, 2008, we exercised the option to increase the senior unsecured revolving credit facility to $608.8 million. We
anticipate using funds from the amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility to settle any outstanding amounts on the unsecured interim credit facility in March 2008, and have accordingly classified the $300.0 million of outstanding borrowings
on the unsecured interim credit facility as long-term debt.

(10)

In fiscal year 2006, we adopted Statement of SFAS No. 158,

“Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB
Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)”

(“SFAS No. 158”). The impact of adopting SFAS No. 158 was a reduction to accumulated other comprehensive income of $32.7 million, a reduction to other assets of $26.6 million,
an increase to current liabilities of $7.3 million, an increase to current assets of $0.7 million and a reduction to long-term liabilities of $0.4 million, with no impact to our consolidated statements of operations or consolidated statements of
cash flows.



(11)

In fiscal year 2007, we adopted FASB Interpretation (“FIN”) No. 48,

“Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes”

(“FIN No. 48”). The
impact of adopting FIN No. 48 was an increase to retained earnings of $3.6 million and a reduction to accrued liabilities of $3.6 million, with no impact to our consolidated statements of operations or statements of cash flows.

(12)

In fiscal year 2007, we repurchased in the open market approximately 8.1 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $203.0 million, including commissions. In
fiscal year 2006, we repurchased in the open market approximately 8.9 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $190.1 million, including commissions. The repurchased shares have been reflected as additional authorized but
unissued shares, with the payments reflected in common stock and capital in excess of par value. These repurchases were made pursuant to our stock repurchase programs announced in November 2006 and November 2005, respectively.

Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

This annual report on Form 10-K, including the following management’s discussion and analysis, contains
forward-looking information that you should read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements that we have included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. For this purpose, any
statements contained in this report that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. Words such as “believes,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “expects,” “will” and
similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from the plans, intentions or expectations we disclose in the forward-looking statements we make. We have included important factors
above under the heading “Risk Factors” in Item 1A above that we believe could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements we make. We are not obligated to publicly update any forward-looking
statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Overview

We are a leading provider of
technology, services and solutions to the diagnostics, detection and analysis and photonics markets. We design, manufacture, market and service components, systems and products in two reporting segments:

•

Life and Analytical Sciences.

We are a leading provider of analysis tools, including instruments, reagents, software, and consumables, to the analytical
sciences, genetic screening, BioDiscovery and laboratory services markets.

•

Optoelectronics.

We provide a broad range of medical imaging, optical sensor and specialty lighting components used in medical, consumer products and other
specialty end markets.

The health sciences
markets include all of the businesses in our Life and Analytical Sciences segment and the medical imaging business, as well as elements of the medical sensors and lighting businesses in our Optoelectronics segment. The photonics markets include the
remaining businesses in our Optoelectronics segment.

Accounting Period

Our fiscal year ends on the Sunday nearest
December 31. We report fiscal years under a 52/53 week format. Under this method, certain years will contain 53 weeks. The fiscal years ended December 30, 2007, December 31, 2006 and January 1, 2006 each included 52 weeks.



Consolidated Results of Continuing Operations

Sales

2007 Compared to 2006.

Sales for 2007 were $1,787.3 million, versus $1,546.4 million for 2006, an increase of $241.0 million, or 16%. Changes
in foreign exchange and acquisitions each contributed approximately 4% to the increase in revenue for 2007, as compared to 2006. The analysis in the remainder of this paragraph compares segment sales for 2007 as compared to 2006 and includes the
effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions. The total increase in sales reflects a $182.7 million, or 16%, increase in our Life and Analytical Sciences segment sales, due to increases in sales of instruments of $84.5 million,
service of $51.3 million, and consumables and reagents of $46.9 million. Our Optoelectronics segment sales grew $58.3 million, or 15%, primarily due to increases in our medical imaging products of $28.4 million, specialty lighting products of $24.8
million, and optical sensors of $4.8 million.

2006 Compared
to 2005.

Sales for 2006 were $1,546.4 million versus $1,473.8 million during 2005, an increase of $72.6 million, or 5%. Changes in foreign exchange and acquisitions each contributed approximately 1% to the increase in revenue for 2006, as
compared to 2005. The analysis in the remainder of this paragraph compares segment sales for 2006 as compared to 2005 and includes the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions. The total increase in sales includes a $63.5
million, or 6%, increase in our Life and Analytical Sciences segment sales, which grew from $1,081.1 million in 2005 to $1,144.6 million in 2006 primarily due to increases in service of $31.8 million, instruments of $29.8 million and consumables and
reagents of $1.9 million. Our Optoelectronics segment sales grew $9.1 million, or 2%, from $392.7 million in 2005 to $401.8 million in 2006 primarily due to sales of our medical imaging products increasing by $15.1 million, while sales within
our optical sensors and specialty lighting product lines decreased $6.0 million.

Cost of Sales

2007 Compared to 2006.

Cost of sales for 2007 was $1,062.6 million, versus $918.3 million for 2006, an increase of approximately $144.3 million, or 16%. As a percentage of sales, cost of sales increased to 59.5% in 2007 from
59.4% in 2006, resulting in a decrease in gross margin of 10 basis points to 40.5% in 2007 from 40.6% in 2006. Amortization of intangible assets increased due to the acquisitions completed in 2007 and 2006 and was $34.4 million for 2007 as
compared to $29.2 million for 2006. The amortization of purchase accounting adjustments to record the inventory from certain acquisitions completed in 2007 was approximately $2.5 million for 2007. Stock option expense was $1.2 million and $1.3
million for 2007 and 2006, respectively. The combined impact of net productivity and capacity improvements within both segments increased gross margin, which was partially offset by pressures in our laboratory services business as a result of
entering into several large new contracts requiring an increase in start-up investment in the first six months of 2007 and a one-time charge related to flash module contracts in our Optoelectronics segment.

2006 Compared to 2005.

Cost of sales for 2006 was $918.3 million,
versus $859.3 million for 2005, an increase of $59.0 million, or 7%. As a percentage of sales, cost of sales increased to 59.4% in 2006 from 58.3% in 2005, resulting in a decrease in gross margin of 110 basis points to 40.6% in 2006 from 41.7% in
2005. Amortization of intangible assets was $29.2 million in 2006 as compared to $27.8 million in 2005. With the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), cost of sales for 2006 also included stock option expense of $1.3 million. No stock option expense was
recorded in 2005. The remaining decrease in gross margin was primarily attributable to unfavorable product and geography mix of sales, pricing pressures and inflation, including commodity costs during 2006, partially offset by efficiencies gained
through increased production volume and successful execution of productivity initiatives.



Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

2007 Compared to 2006.

Selling, general and administrative
expenses for 2007 were $444.4 million as compared to $376.8 million for 2006, an increase of approximately $67.6 million, or 18%. As a percentage of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses were 24.9% in 2007, compared to 24.4% in
2006. Amortization of intangible assets was $7.9 million for 2007 as compared to $3.0 million for 2006. Stock option expense was $7.3 million and $7.2 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively. This increase was primarily the result of increased
headcount and employee-related expenses to support our sales initiatives, increased sales and marketing expenses to support recent acquisitions, business development expenses, amortization expense related to the acquisitions completed in 2007 and
2006, foreign exchange and stock option expense.

Compared to 2005.

Selling, general and administrative expenses for 2006 were $376.8 million, versus $365.5 million for 2005, an increase of $11.4 million, or 3%. As a percentage of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses
decreased 40 basis points to 24.4% in 2006 from 24.8% in 2005. Amortization of intangible assets was $3.0 million in 2006 as compared to $0.8 million in 2005. With the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), selling, general and administrative expenses
for 2006 also included $7.2 million of stock option expense, whereas no stock option expense was recorded in 2005. This decrease was the result of increased fixed cost leverage and cost controls, offset in part by increased investment in business
development activities, stock option expense and an increase in the number of sales employees in emerging markets and higher growth product lines.

Research and Development Expenses

2007 Compared to 2006.

Research and development expenses for 2007 were $111.6 million versus $99.7 million for 2006, an increase of $11.9
million, or 12%. As a percentage of sales, research and development expenses decreased to 6.2% in 2007 from 6.4% in 2006. Amortization of intangible assets was $1.7 million for 2007 as compared to $1.6 million for 2006. Research and development
expenses also included stock option expense of $0.6 million and $0.7 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively. We directed our research and development efforts similarly during 2007 and 2006, primarily toward genetic screening, BioDiscovery, and
analytical sciences markets within our Life and Analytical Sciences segment, and medical imaging and photonics within our Optoelectronics segment, in order to help accelerate our growth initiatives.

2006 Compared to 2005.

Research and development expenses for 2006
were $99.7 million versus $87.4 million in 2005, an increase of $12.3 million, or 14%. As a percentage of sales, research and development expenses increased to 6.4% in 2006 from 5.9% in 2005. Amortization of intangible assets was $1.6 million in
2006 as compared to $0.1 million in 2005. With the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), research and development expenses for 2006 also included $0.7 million of stock option expense, whereas no stock option expense was recorded in 2005. We directed
research and development efforts during 2006 and 2005 primarily toward genetic screening, BioDiscovery, and analytical sciences markets within our Life and Analytical Sciences segment, and medical imaging within our Optoelectronics segment in order
to help accelerate our growth initiatives.

In-process
Research and Development Charge

2007 Compared to
2006.

In-process research and development (“IPR&D”) charge for 2007 was $1.5 million, which related to the acquisitions of Evotec and Euroscreen. In determining the value of the in-process projects, we considered, among other
factors, the in-process projects’ stage of completion, the complexity of the work completed as of the acquisition date, the costs already incurred, the projected costs to complete, the contribution of core technologies and other acquired
assets, the expected introduction date, and the estimated useful life of the technology. We utilized the discounted cash flow method to value the IPR&D, using a discount rate equivalent to the relative risk of the asset, including the
uncertainty of technological feasibility and successful launch. This approach determines fair value by estimating the after-tax cash flows attributable to an in-process project over its useful life, and then discounting these after-tax cash flows
back to a present value. We believe that the estimated purchased research and development amounts so determined, represent the fair value of each project at the acquisition date, and the amount represents management’s best estimate of the
amount a third party would pay for the projects.



2006 Compared to 2005

. We did not take an IPR&D charge in either 2006 or 2005.

Gains on Settlement of Insurance Claim

2007 Compared to 2006.

During the second quarter of 2007 we
settled an insurance claim resulting from a fire that occurred within our Life and Analytical Sciences facility in Boston, Massachusetts in March 2005. As a result of that settlement, we recorded gains of $15.3 million during the second quarter of
2007. We received the final settlement payment of $21.5 million in June 2007, and had previously received during 2005 and 2006 a total of $35.0 million in advance payments towards costs incurred, and for building, inventory and equipment damages. Of
the $56.5 million in total settlement proceeds received by us, $25.6 million related to reimbursement of costs incurred; $23.7 million related to damages to the building, inventory and equipment; and $7.2 million related to business interruption
costs which were recorded as reductions to cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses.

During the second quarter of 2007, we accrued $9.7 million representing our management’s estimate of the total cost for decommissioning the building,
including environmental matters. We paid $3.9 million during fiscal year 2007 towards decommissioning the building, and anticipate that the remaining payments of $5.8 million will be completed by the end of fiscal year 2008.

Restructuring and Lease Charges (Reversals), Net

2007 Compared to 2006.

We have undertaken a series of
restructuring actions related to the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and the integration of our business units. Restructuring actions were recorded in accordance with SFAS No. 146, “

Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or
Disposal Activities”

(“SFAS No. 146”). Restructuring and lease charges (reversals), net, for 2007 were a $14.4 million charge versus a $3.6 million reversal for 2006.

The following table summarizes our restructuring accrual balances and related
activity by restructuring plan during 2007, 2006 and 2005:

restructuring plans approved in the first and fourth quarters of 2007, detailed below, was principally to shift resources into geographic regions and product lines that are more consistent with our growth strategy. The pre-tax restructuring activity
associated with these plans has been reported as restructuring expenses as a component of operating expenses from continuing operations. We expect the impact of immediate and future cost savings from these restructuring activities on operating
results and cash flows to be negligible, as we have incurred and will incur offsetting costs.

Q4 2007 Plan

During
the fourth quarter of 2007, our management approved a plan to shift resources into geographic regions and product lines that are more consistent with our growth strategy (the “Q4 2007 Plan”). As a result of the Q4 2007 Plan, we recognized
a $4.8 million pre-tax restructuring charge in our Life and Analytical Sciences segment related to a workforce reduction from these reorganization activities. We also recognized a $4.8 million pre-tax restructuring charge in our Optoelectronics
segment related to a workforce reduction and the partial closure of a facility, which was offset by the recognition of a $2.2 million deferred gain from the sales-leaseback of that facility during the fiscal year 2001.

As part of our Q4 2007 Plan, we reduced headcount by 90 employees. All
actions related to the Q4 2007 Plan were completed by December 30, 2007, and we anticipate that the remaining payments of $4.3 million for workforce reductions will be completed by the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2009, and the
remaining payments of $4.3 million for the partial facility closure will be paid through fiscal year 2022, in accordance with the terms of the lease. The lease payments will be offset by the recognition of the amortization of the deferred gain from
the sales-leaseback of that facility during the fiscal year 2001.

The following table summarizes the components of the Q4 2007 Plan activity recognized in 2007 by segment:

Q1 2007 Plan

During the first quarter of 2007, our management approved a plan to shift
resources into product lines that are more consistent with our growth strategy. As a result of this plan, we recognized a pre-tax restructuring charge of $4.4 million during the first quarter of 2007 (the “Q1 2007 Plan”). The actions
within the Q1 2007 Plan related to a workforce reduction resulting from reorganization activities within our Life and Analytical Sciences segment.

As part of our Q1 2007 Plan, we reduced headcount by 60 employees. All actions related to the Q1 2007 Plan were completed by March 30, 2007, and we
anticipate that the remaining payments of $1.1 million will be completed by the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008.



ViaCell Plan

Following the ViaCell acquisition, we committed to a preliminary plan of integration of certain ViaCell activities that included workforce reductions. As
of December 30, 2007, we recorded $1.2 million of severance liabilities with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue No. 95-3,

“Recognition of Liabilities in
Connection with a Purchase Business Combination”

(“EITF 95-3”). We had not finalized the preliminary integration plan as of December 30, 2007, but we expect to complete the plan no later than one year from the date of
acquisition. As part of our ViaCell Plan, we reduced headcount by five employees, and we anticipate that the payments of $1.2 million will be completed by the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008.

Previous
Restructuring and Integration Plans

The principal actions
of these restructuring plans were workforce reductions related to the integration of our Life Sciences and Analytical Instruments businesses, which is now our Life and Analytical Sciences segment, in order to reduce costs and achieve operational
efficiencies as well as workforce reductions in both the Life and Analytical Sciences and Optoelectronics segments by shifting resources into geographic regions and product lines that are more consistent with our growth strategy. During 2007, we
paid $0.2 million related to the 2001 to 2006 restructuring and integration plans and recorded a pre-tax restructuring reversal of $0.6 million relating to these plans, due to lower than expected employee separation costs associated with both the
Life and Analytical Sciences and Optoelectronics segments. As of December 30, 2007, we had approximately $2.0 million of remaining liabilities associated with these plans, primarily relating to remaining lease obligations related to closed
facilities in the Life and Analytical Sciences segment. The remaining terms of these leases vary in length and will be paid through fiscal year 2014. We anticipate that the remaining severance payments will be completed by the end of fiscal year
2008.

Lease Charges

To facilitate the sale of a business in 2001, we were required to guarantee
the obligations that the buyer of the business assumed related to the lease for the building in which the business operates. The lease obligations continue through March 2011. While we assigned our interest in the lease to the buyer at the time of
the sale of the business, in the event the buyer defaults under the lease, we are responsible for all remaining lease payments and certain other building related expenses. As an additional measure to facilitate the sale of the business, we obtained
a letter of credit as partial security for a loan to the buyer, which could have been drawn upon by the buyer’s lender in the event the buyer was delinquent in repayment of the loan. During the second quarter of 2007, the lessor of the building
began the process to evict the buyer as a result of unpaid lease payments and building expenses, and sought reimbursement from us. As a result of this action, we recorded a charge of $4.5 million related to payments for this lease obligation and the
potential drawdown of the letter of credit. During the third quarter of 2007, the buyer completed a recapitalization of the business with another lender. The proceeds of the recapitalization were used to pay off the remaining balance on the original
securitized loan, as well as to make certain payments to the landlord for back rent and other obligations arising under the lease. We were released from our obligation under the letter of credit on the original securitized loan. As a result of these
actions, we recorded a reversal of $1.4 million related to payments for this lease obligation and the release of the letter of credit in the third quarter of 2007. We are still responsible for the remaining accrual of $3.1 million, which relates to
the remaining lease and building obligations, reduced by estimated sublease rentals reasonably expected to be obtained for the property.

Impairment of Assets

2007 Compared to 2006.

Impairment of assets was zero in 2007 and $3.2 million in 2006. The 2006 impairment was recorded within the Life and
Analytical Sciences segment, which included a $2.8 million loss related to a manufacturing facility and a $0.4 million loss on impairment of a license agreement.



2006 Compared to 2005.

Impairment of assets was $3.2 million in 2006 and zero in 2005. The
2006 impairment was recorded within the Life and Analytical Sciences segment, which included a $2.8 million loss related to a manufacturing facility and a $0.4 million loss on impairment of a license agreement.

Gains on Dispositions

2007 Compared to 2006.

There were no dispositions in 2007 and
dispositions resulted in a net gain of $1.5 million in 2006. Gain on dispositions in 2006 included a $0.6 million gain from an insurance reimbursement due to fire damage in a certain manufacturing facility and a $0.9 million gain on disposal of
certain fixed assets.

2006 Compared to
2005.

Dispositions resulted in a net gain of $1.5 million in 2006 and in 2005. Gain on dispositions in 2006 included a $0.6 million gain from an insurance reimbursement due to fire damage in a certain manufacturing facility and a $0.9
million gain on disposal of fixed assets. Gain on dispositions in 2005 included a $2.0 million gain from an insurance reimbursement due to fire damage in certain manufacturing facilities offset by a $0.5 million loss on disposal of certain fixed
assets due to a facility upgrade.

Interest and Other
Expense, Net

Interest and other expense, net
consisted of the following:

2007 Compared to
2006.

Interest and other expense, net for 2007 was $16.9 million versus $2.7 million for 2006, an increase of $14.2 million. The increase in interest and other expense, net, in 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily due to the higher
outstanding debt balances, as well as lower outstanding cash balances. Interest income decreased $4.7 million due to lower overall cash balances, and interest expense increased $6.2 million due to higher outstanding debt balances. We also recognized
a net gain on dispositions of investments of $0.7 million associated with the dissolution of certain investments. Other expenses for 2007 and 2006 increased by $1.7 million, and consisted primarily of expenses related to foreign currency translation
and business development related costs. A more complete discussion of our liquidity is set forth below under the heading “Liquidity and Capital Resources.”

2006 Compared to 2005.

Interest and other expense, net
for 2006 was $2.7 million versus $74.3 million for 2005, a decrease of $71.6 million or 96%. The decrease in interest and other expense, net in 2006 as compared to 2005, was due primarily to the overall reduction in outstanding debt, lower borrowing
costs, an increase in outstanding cash balances and extinguishment of debt from 2005. Interest income increased $6.1 million due to higher cash balances and higher investment rates. In addition, interest expense decreased $18.1 million primarily due
to the repurchase of our senior subordinated 8


/


% notes due 2013, which we repurchased through a tender offer in the fourth
quarter of 2005, and the repayment of the remainder of our term loan. The decrease in interest expense resulting from the debt reduction in 2005 was partially offset by interest on $151.5 million in funds drawn under our previous senior unsecured
revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2006, which we entered into during the fourth quarter of 2005 and amended and restated in August 2007. We also recognized a net gain on dispositions of investments of $2.3 million associated with the
dissolution of certain investments. We incurred a nonrecurring charge of $54.9 million in 2005 to repay our senior subordinated 8


/


% notes due 2013. Other expenses in 2006 and 2005 consisted primarily of expense related to foreign currency translation.



Provision for Income Taxes

2007 Compared to 2006.

The 2007 provision for income taxes from continuing operations was $17.5 million, as
compared to a provision of $32.4 million for 2006. The effective tax rate from continuing operations was 11.5% for 2007 as compared to 21.5% for 2006. The lower effective tax rate in 2007 was primarily due to the favorable settlement of an income
tax audit partially offset by (i) the non-deductible IPR&D charge of $1.5 million recorded in 2007; (ii) the discrete accrual of interest expense as a result of the adoption of the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”) Interpretation (“FIN”) No. 48 in 2007; (iii) the accrual of U.S. taxes on the $15.3 million gains on the settlement of an insurance claim for 2007; and (iv) changes in our forecasted geographic
distribution of earnings.

2006 Compared to
2005.

The 2006 provision for income taxes from continuing operations was $32.4 million, versus a provision of $0.1 million in 2005. The 2006 effective tax rate from continuing operations was 21.5% as compared to the 2005 effective tax rate
of 0.2%. The lower effective tax rate in 2005 was primarily due to (i) a benefit from the settlement of income tax audits for prior years in 2005, offset by the tax cost of the domestic reinvestment plan repatriation calculated in accordance
with the homeland investment provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004; and (ii) the use in 2005 of federal, state, and foreign tax attributes (current year state and foreign net operating losses, federal current year research and
experimental credits, and state current year income tax credits) enabled by the sale of our Fluid Sciences segment.

In December 2006, the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 (the “Tax Act”) was enacted. The Tax Act retroactively restored the expired
research and experimental tax credit provisions of the law from December 31, 2006, and extended the credit through December 31, 2007. As a result of the Tax Act, we recorded a benefit for the research and experimental tax credit in 2006 in
the amount of $1.6 million.

Discontinued Operations

As part of our continuing efforts to focus on higher growth opportunities,
we have discontinued certain businesses. We have accounted for these businesses as discontinued operations in accordance with SFAS No. 144, “

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,

” and, accordingly,
have presented the results of operations and related cash flows as discontinued operations for all periods presented. The assets and liabilities of these businesses have been presented separately, and are reflected within the assets and liabilities
from discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006.

We recorded the following gains and losses, which have been reported as the gain (loss) on dispositions of discontinued operations during the three years
ended:



Following the ViaCell acquisition in November
2007, our Board approved a plan to sell the ViaCyte

SM

and Cellular Therapy Technology businesses that were acquired with ViaCell. The ViaCyte

SM

business focuses on the development of a proprietary media intended for the cryopreservation of human unfertilized oocytes. The Cellular Therapy
Technology business focuses on the development of therapeutic uses of unrestricted somatic stem cells derived from umbilical cord blood, including the areas of cancer, cardiac disease and diabetes. We have determined that both businesses do not
strategically fit with the other products offered by our Life and Analytical Sciences segment. We also determined that without investing capital into the operations of both businesses, we could not effectively compete in the marketplace with larger
companies who focus on the market for such products. We are actively marketing and are currently committed to a plan to sell both of these businesses. We have classified the results of the ViaCyte

SM

and Cellular Therapy Technology businesses as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements.

In September 2005, our Board approved a plan to divest our Fluid Sciences segment. The Fluid Sciences segment consisted of
three businesses—Aerospace, Fluid Testing and Semiconductor. In November 2005, we sold the Fluid Testing division for approximately $34.5 million, resulting in a net pre-tax gain of $30.3 million. In December 2005, we sold the Aerospace
business for approximately $333.0 million, resulting in a net pre-tax gain of $250.6 million. These gains were recognized during fiscal 2005 as gains on the dispositions of discontinued operations. We received total cash proceeds in these
transactions of approximately $360.0 million. During 2006, we finalized the net working capital adjustments associated with the sales of these businesses, settled a claim related to an employee benefit program, and ceased future benefit accruals to
a postretirement medical plan. In 2006, these actions resulted in the recognition of a gain of $0.5 million and a loss of $0.2 million relative to the Aerospace business and the Fluid Testing business, respectively. In February 2006, we sold
substantially all of the assets of our Semiconductor business for approximately $26.5 million, subject to a net working capital adjustment, plus potential additional contingent consideration. A pre-tax gain of $3.8 million, exclusive of additional
contingent consideration, was recognized in 2006. During 2007, we settled an additional commitment associated with a benefit program relating to the divestiture of the Fluid Sciences segment and recognized a pre-tax loss of $1.1 million.

During 2007, 2006 and 2005, we settled various commitments related to the
divestiture of other discontinued operations and recognized a pre-tax gain of $0.2 million in 2007, a pre-tax loss of $0.7 million in 2006 and a pre-tax gain of $1.4 million in 2005. During 2007 and 2006, we substantially completed the remediation
of an environmental matter within the Lithography business, resulting in recognition of pre-tax losses of $0.7 million in 2007 and $1.7 million in 2006. In addition, we received proceeds of $0.5 million upon the sale of the Lithography business and
recognized a pre-tax loss of $3.3 million during fiscal year 2005. Also in fiscal year 2005, the completion of the shutdown of the Fiber Optics Test Equipment business resulted in a pre-tax loss of $5.2 million related to lease and severance
costs and the reduction of fixed assets and inventory to net realizable value.

Summary operating results of the discontinued operations for the periods prior to disposition were as follows:



Acquisitions

Newborn Metabolic Screening Business from Pediatrix Medical Group, Inc.

In December 2007, we entered into an agreement to acquire the outstanding
stock of Pediatrix Screening, Inc., which constitutes the newborn metabolic screening (“NMS”) business of Pediatrix Medical Group, Inc. The NMS business provides neonatal screening and consultative services to hospitals, medical groups and
various states. This acquisition is intended to expand our capabilities to supply state laboratories and other agencies with comprehensive newborn screening solutions. This transaction is expected to close during the first quarter of 2008.

ViaCell, Inc.

In November 2007, our wholly owned subsidiary completed a tender offer for all of the outstanding shares of common stock of ViaCell, at a price of $7.25 per share. ViaCell specializes in the collection, testing,
processing and preservation of umbilical cord blood stem cells. Through the tender offer, our wholly owned subsidiary acquired more than 90% of the outstanding shares of common stock of ViaCell. We acquired the remaining outstanding shares of
ViaCell by means of a merger of our wholly owned subsidiary with and into ViaCell, as a result of which ViaCell became our wholly owned subsidiary. The addition of ViaCell’s ViaCord

®

product offering for the preservation of umbilical cord blood, and its sales and marketing organization, is expected to facilitate the expansion of our neonatal and prenatal businesses. Aggregate consideration for this transaction was approximately
$295.8 million in cash, which excludes $31.8 million in acquired cash. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets has been allocated to goodwill, none of which is tax deductible.

Following the ViaCell acquisition, we committed to a preliminary plan of
integration of certain ViaCell activities that included workforce reductions. As of December 30, 2007, we recorded $1.2 million of severance liabilities with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill in accordance with EITF Issue No. 95-3,

“Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Business Combination”

(“EITF 95-3”). We had not finalized the preliminary integration plan as of December 30, 2007, but we expect to complete the plan no later
than one year from the date of acquisition.

Following the ViaCell acquisition, our Board approved a plan to sell the ViaCyte

SM

and Cellular Therapy Technology businesses that were acquired with ViaCell. The ViaCyte

SM

business focuses on the development of a proprietary media intended for the cryopreservation of human unfertilized oocytes. The Cellular Therapy Technology business focuses on
the development of therapeutic uses of unrestricted somatic stem cells derived from umbilical cord blood, including the areas of cancer, cardiac disease and diabetes. We have determined that both businesses do not strategically fit with the other
products offered by the Life and Analytical Sciences segment. We also determined that without investing capital into the operations of both businesses, we could not effectively compete in the marketplace with larger companies which focus on the
market for such products. We are actively marketing and are currently committed to a plan to sell both of these businesses. We have classified the results of the ViaCyte

SM

and Cellular Therapy Technology businesses as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements.

Various Intangible Assets and Investments.

In 2007, we acquired various licenses, other intangible assets and investments for aggregate
consideration of approximately $8.8 million in cash. Included in this amount are a customer list for reagents for approximately $4.8 million, and a call option to purchase the assets and liabilities of a company for approximately $1.2 million, each
purchased during the fourth quarter of 2007. In addition, we entered into various long-term license agreements during 2007 for approximately $2.8 million. Purchased intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives based upon the
economic value. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details.

Remaining minority interest of PerkinElmer India Pvt. Ltd.

In June 2007, we acquired the remaining minority interest in PerkinElmer India Pvt.
Ltd. (“PKI India”), a direct sales, service and marketing operation targeting India’s life science and analytical instrumentation markets, from Labindia Instruments Pvt. Ltd. The acquisition establishes PKI India as our wholly owned
subsidiary. Consideration for this transaction was approximately $1.3 million in cash plus potential additional consideration of approximately $0.7 million, of which we paid $0.2 million during the fiscal year 2007. We expect to pay the remaining
$0.5 million in quarterly installments through the first quarter of 2008. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets has been allocated to goodwill, none of which is tax deductible.



Improvision Ltd.

In March 2007, we acquired the stock of Improvision Ltd.
(“Improvision”), a leading provider of cellular imaging software and integrated hardware solutions used in life sciences research. We expect that the addition of Improvision’s imaging and analysis software to our high content
screening systems will provide customers with powerful imaging solutions for analyzing cellular events, from real-time imaging of live cells to rapid high content screening of multiple samples. Consideration for this transaction was approximately
$23.6 million in cash plus potential additional contingent consideration, which we expect to be immaterial to us. During 2007, we paid $0.6 million for net working capital adjustments. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the
acquired net assets has been allocated to goodwill, none of which is tax deductible.

Euroscreen Products S.A.

In January 2007, we acquired the stock of Euroscreen Products
S.A. (“Euroscreen”), a developer of the AequoScreen

™

cellular assay platform. The AequoScreen

™

platform from
Euroscreen is based on an innovative luminescence technology that generates higher quality data, while reducing the number of false positives in G protein-coupled receptor (“GPCR”) screening applications. Consideration for this transaction
was approximately $18.1 million in cash. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets has been allocated to goodwill, none of which is tax deductible.

Evotec Technologies GmbH

. In January 2007, we acquired the stock of Evotec Technologies GmbH
(“Evotec”). The acquisition is intended to allow us to provide our customers in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and academic arenas with Evotec’s high content screening instruments and software. These analysis tools determine the

. In December 2006, we acquired specified assets and assumed specified liabilities of the Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (“DMA”) product line from Triton Technology Ltd. The DMA products offer a thermal analysis tool that is used
by scientists in the polymers, pharmaceuticals and food industries for diverse applications ranging from simple quality control to advanced research. Consideration for this transaction was approximately $2.3 million in cash at the closing, plus
additional cash payments of approximately $1.6 million that were paid during the first six months of 2007. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets has been allocated to goodwill, all of which is tax
deductible.

Avalon Instruments Limited.

In
September 2006, we acquired the stock of Avalon Instruments Limited (“Avalon”). The acquisition of Avalon expands and complements our molecular spectroscopy product portfolio by adding a family of innovative bench-top dispersive Raman
spectrometers. Raman spectroscopy identifies and characterizes the composition of both organic and inorganic materials in a wide range of applications. Consideration for this transaction was approximately $5.3 million in cash plus potential
additional contingent consideration, which we expect to be immaterial to us. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets has been allocated to goodwill, none of which is tax deductible.

J.N. Macri
Technologies LLC and NTD Laboratories, Inc.

In July 2006, we acquired specified assets and assumed specified liabilities of J.N. Macri Technologies LLC (“Macri”) and acquired the stock of NTD Laboratories, Inc.
(“NTD”). We acquired Macri’s global patents related to free beta Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (“free Beta hCG”). Free Beta hCG is a peptide hormone produced in the early stage of pregnancy that is widely recognized as an
important biomarker for first-trimester prenatal risk assessment. NTD is a laboratory specializing in prenatal risk assessment and offers laboratory-developed and validated testing under the brand name UltraScreen

®

, of which free Beta hCG is an important component. Aggregate consideration for these transactions was approximately $56.65 million in cash. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired
net assets has been allocated to goodwill. None of the goodwill related to the NTD acquisition is tax deductible and all of the goodwill related to the Macri acquisition is tax deductible.



Clinical & Analytical Service Solutions Ltd.

In June 2006, we acquired the stock of
Clinical & Analytical Service Solutions Ltd. (“C&A”), a scientific equipment asset and managed maintenance company serving the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and healthcare markets. Consideration for the transaction was
approximately $16.0 million in cash plus potential additional contingent consideration, which we expect to be immaterial to us. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets has been allocated to goodwill, none
of which is tax deductible.

Spectral Genomics,
Inc.

In April 2006, we acquired specified assets and assumed specified liabilities of Spectral Genomics, Inc. (“Spectral”), a leader in molecular karyotyping technology used to evaluate chromosomal abnormalities. Consideration for
the transaction was approximately $14.0 million in cash plus potential additional contingent consideration, which we expect to be immaterial to us. We will make royalty payments based on future sales to license additional intellectual property
rights from a third party. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets has been allocated to goodwill, all of which is tax deductible.

Agilix Corporation.

In February 2006, we acquired specified assets of Agilix Corporation (“Agilix”) for approximately
$8.7 million in cash. Assets acquired primarily relate to Agilix’s core technology which centers around labeling technology using isobaric mass tags that allow for the simultaneous quantification of molecules, such as proteins, from
multiple samples. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets has been allocated to goodwill, all of which is tax deductible.

The operations for each of these acquisitions completed during 2007 and 2006 are reported within the results of our Life and
Analytical Sciences segment from the acquisition date. The acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. Allocation of the purchase price for the acquisitions was based on estimates of the fair value of the net assets
acquired, and is subject to adjustment upon finalization of the purchase price allocation. The fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on management’s estimates and assumptions, as well
as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. The excess purchase price over those assigned values was recorded as goodwill. In accordance with SFAS No. 142,

“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,”

goodwill will be reviewed at least annually for impairment. Purchased intangibles with finite lives will be amortized on a straight-line basis over their respective estimated useful lives.

IPR&D charges represent incomplete acquired research and
development projects that have not reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future use as of the acquisition date. Technological feasibility is established when an enterprise has completed all planning, designing, coding, and
testing activities that are necessary to establish that a product can be produced to meet its design specifications including functions, features, and technical performance requirements. On the date of the acquisitions of Evotec and Euroscreen,
there were multiple IPR&D efforts underway at each company for certain current and future product lines. In determining the value of in-process projects, we consider, among other factors, the in-process projects’ stage of completion, the
complexity of the work completed as of the acquisition date, the costs already incurred, the projected costs to complete, the contribution of core technologies and other acquired assets, the expected introduction date, and the estimated useful life
of the technology. For these acquisitions, we utilized the discounted cash flow method to value the IPR&D, using a discount rate equivalent to the relative risk of the asset, including the uncertainty of technological feasibility and successful
launch. This approach determines fair value by estimating the after-tax cash flows attributable to an in-process project over its useful life, and then discounting these after-tax cash flows back to a present value. For the acquisitions of Evotec
and Euroscreen, we estimated the value of the IPR&D to be $0.2 million and $1.3 million, respectively. We believe that the estimated purchased research and development amounts so determined, represent the fair value at the date of the
acquisitions, and the amount represents management’s best estimate of the amount a third party would pay in the aggregate for the projects. The fair value of acquired in-process research and development costs was expensed as of the acquisition
date as the projects underway at Evotec and Euroscreen had not reached technological feasibility and were determined to have no alternative future use.



In connection with purchase price and related allocations, we estimate the fair value of deferred revenue
assumed in connection with these acquisitions. The estimated fair value of deferred revenue is determined by the legal performance obligation at the date of acquisition, and is generally based on the nature of the activities to be performed and the
related costs to be incurred after consummation. The fair value of an assumed liability related to deferred revenue is estimated based on the current market cost of fulfilling the obligation, plus a normal profit margin thereon. The estimated costs
to fulfill the deferred revenue are based on the historical direct costs related to providing the services. We do not include any costs associated with selling efforts, research and development, or the related fulfillment margins on these costs. In
most acquisitions, profit associated with selling effort is excluded because the acquired entities would have concluded the selling effort on the support contracts prior to the acquisition date. The estimated research and development costs are not
included in the fair value determination, as these costs are not deemed to represent a legal obligation at the time of acquisition. The sum of the costs and operating income approximates, in theory, the amount that we would be required to pay a
third party to assume the obligation. As a result of purchase accounting, we recognized the deferred revenue related to the ViaCell acquisition at fair value, and did not recognize $18.1 million of deferred revenue that would have been
otherwise recorded in future periods. We would have recorded higher storage revenues in fiscal 2007 in the amount of $1.0 million, as well as significantly higher amounts in future periods, related to these contracts. ViaCell customers have
historically renewed these contracts, although there can be no assurance that they will continue to do so in the future.

As of December 30, 2007, the purchase price allocations for the Agilix, Spectral, C&A, Macri, NTD, Avalon, the DMA product line, Evotec,
Euroscreen, Improvision and PKI India acquisitions have been finalized. As of December 30, 2007, the purchase price and related allocations for the ViaCell acquisition were preliminary, and may be revised as a result of adjustments made to the
purchase price, as well as additional information regarding liabilities assumed, including contingent liabilities, deferred taxes, employee severance and facility closure costs, and revisions of preliminary estimates of fair values made at the date
of purchase. We are not aware of any information that indicates the final purchase price allocation will differ materially from the preliminary estimates, and we expect to complete any outstanding asset valuations no later than one year from the
date of acquisition.

Contingencies, Including Tax Matters

We are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial
actions at our current and former locations and, along with other companies, have been named a potentially responsible party (“PRP”) for certain waste disposal sites. We accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period that our
responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated. We have accrued $4.2 million as of December 30, 2007, which represents our management’s estimate of the total cost of ultimate disposition of known environmental
matters. This amount is not discounted and does not reflect the recovery of any amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements. These cost estimates are subject to a number of variables, including the stage of the environmental
investigations, the magnitude of the possible contamination, the nature of the potential remedies, possible joint and several liability, the time period over which remediation may occur, and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations. For
sites where we have been named a PRP, our management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute. We expect that the majority of such accrued amounts could be
paid out over a period of up to ten years. As assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site, these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available. There have been no
environmental problems to date that have had or are expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. While it is possible that a loss exceeding the amounts recorded in the consolidated
financial statements may be incurred, the potential exposure is not expected to be materially different from those amounts recorded.

In papers dated October 23, 2002, Enzo Biochem, Inc. and Enzo Life Sciences, Inc. (collectively, “Enzo”) filed a complaint in the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Civil Action No. 02-8448, against Amersham plc, Amersham BioSciences, PerkinElmer, Inc., PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Inc.,



Sigma-Aldrich Corporation, Sigma Chemical Company, Inc., Molecular Probes, Inc., and Orchid BioSciences, Inc. The complaint alleges that we have breached our
distributorship and settlement agreements with Enzo, infringed Enzo’s patents, engaged in unfair competition and fraud, and committed torts against Enzo by, among other things, engaging in commercial development and exploitation of Enzo’s
patented products and technology, separately and together with the other defendants. Enzo seeks injunctive and monetary relief. In 2003, the court severed the lawsuit and ordered Enzo to serve individual complaints against the five defendants. We
subsequently filed an answer and a counterclaim alleging that Enzo’s patents are invalid. In July 2006, the court issued a decision regarding the construction of the claims in Enzo’s patents that effectively limited the coverage of certain
of those claims and, we believe, excludes certain of our products from the coverage of Enzo’s patents. Summary judgment motions were filed by the defendants in January 2007, and a hearing with oral argument on those motions took place in July
2007, but a decision on those motions has not been rendered, and a trial date has not been set.

On October 17, 2003, Amersham Biosciences Corp. filed a complaint, which was subsequently
amended, in the United States District Court for New Jersey, Civil Action No. 03-4901, seeking injunctive and monetary relief against one of our subsidiaries and alleging that our ViewLux

™

and certain of our Image FlashPlate

™

products infringe three of Amersham’s patents related to high-throughput screening (the “NJ case”). On August 18, 2004,
Amersham plc filed a complaint against two of our United Kingdom-based subsidiaries in the Patent Court of the English High Court of Justice, Case No. 04C02688, alleging that our same products infringe one corresponding Amersham patent in the
United Kingdom, which was granted in August 2004 (the “UK case”). On October 29, 2003, we filed a complaint, which was subsequently amended, seeking injunctive and monetary relief against Amersham in the United States District Court
for Massachusetts, Civil Action No. 03-12098, alleging that Amersham’s IN Cell Analyzer, and LEADseeker

™

Multimodality Imaging system and certain Cyclic AMP and IP3 assays
infringe two of our patents related to high-throughput screening (the “MA case”). After a trial in the UK case in December 2005, the court ruled in February 2006 that Amersham’s patent in question was invalid in the United Kingdom and
awarded costs to us. Amersham initiated an appeal of the ruling in the UK case but withdrew that appeal in January 2007. In May 2006, the court in the NJ case issued a decision regarding the construction of the claims in Amersham’s patents that
adopted many of Amersham’s claim construction positions. The parties entered into a settlement agreement in November 2007 to resolve all of the foregoing matters.

In 2002, PharmaStem Therapeutics, Inc. (“PharmaStem”) filed suit against ViaCell, Inc., which is now our wholly owned subsidiary,
and several other defendants in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, alleging infringement of United States Patents No. 5,004,681 and No. 5,192,553, relating to certain aspects of the collection, cryopreservation
and storage of hematopoietic stem cells and progenitor cells from umbilical cord blood (“PharmaStem I”). After several years of proceedings at the District Court level, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit issued a
decision in July 2007 that ViaCell did not infringe these two patents and that the two patents are invalid. PharmaStem filed a certiorari petition in January 2008 seeking to have the United States Supreme Court review the appellate court’s
decision as to the invalidity of the patents, but did not seek any further review of the non-infringement decision. PharmaStem had also filed a second complaint against ViaCell and other defendants in July 2004 in the United States District Court
for the District of Massachusetts, alleging infringement of United States Patents No. 6,461,645 and 6,569,427, which also relate to certain aspects of the collection, cryopreservation and storage of hematopoietic stem cells and progenitor cells
from umbilical cord blood (“PharmaStem II”). We believe that the issues presented in PharmaStem II, which was subsequently consolidated in the District of Delaware with similar cases brought by PharmaStem against other family cord blood
banks, are substantially the same as the issues presented in PharmaStem I, and that ViaCell does not infringe the patents at issue in the second case and that those patents are invalid for the same reasons as cited by the Court of Appeals in
PharmaStem I. The Delaware court granted ViaCell’s motion in October 2005 to stay the proceedings in PharmaStem II pending the outcome of PharmaStem I and a decision from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“U.S. PTO”) on
certain patent re-examination issues. Although the U.S. PTO had previously issued notice of its intent to allow the remaining claims of all of the patents, the U.S. PTO subsequently decided to begin the process of re-examining each patent. ViaCell
has informed the Delaware Court overseeing PharmaStem II of the status of the re-examinations and that the Federal Circuit had ruled in its favor in the PharmaStem I case. The Delaware Court has yet to take any action in response to these notices.



We believe we have meritorious defenses to these lawsuits and other proceedings, and we are contesting
the actions vigorously in all of the above unresolved matters. We are currently unable, however, to reasonably estimate the amount of loss, if any, that may result from the resolution of these matters, or to determine whether resolution of any of
these matters will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.

During 2005, the Internal Revenue Service concluded its audit of federal income taxes for the years 1999 through 2002. There was a single open issue
related to this audit which we favorably resolved during the fourth quarter of 2007. We are under regular examination by tax authorities in the United States and other countries (such as China, Indonesia, Philippines and the United Kingdom) in which
we have significant business operations. The tax years under examination vary by jurisdiction. We regularly review our tax positions in each significant taxing jurisdiction in the process of evaluating its unrecognized tax benefits as required by
FIN No. 48. Adjustments are made to our unrecognized tax benefits when: (i) facts and circumstances regarding a tax position change, causing a change in management’s judgment regarding that tax position; (ii) a tax position is
ultimately settled with a tax authority; and/or (iii) the statute of limitations expires regarding a tax position.

We are also subject to various other claims, legal proceedings and investigations covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of
our business activities. Although, we have established accruals for potential losses that we believe are probable and reasonably estimable, in the opinion of our management, based on its review of the information available at this time, the total
cost of resolving these other contingencies at December 30, 2007 should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K. Each of these matters is subject to uncertainties,
and it is possible that some of these matters may be resolved unfavorably to us.

Reporting Segment Results of Continuing Operations

Life
and Analytical Sciences

2007 Compared to
2006.

Sales for 2007 were $1,327.2 million, versus $1,144.6 million for 2006, an increase of $182.7 million, or 16%, which includes an approximate 5% increase from acquisitions and an approximate 4% increase in sales attributable to
favorable changes in foreign exchange rates. The following analysis in the remainder of this paragraph compares selected sales by market and product type for 2007, as compared to 2006, and includes the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations
and acquisitions. Our laboratory service sales increased by $51.3 million, sales to genetic screening customers increased by $49.1 million, sales to BioDiscovery customers increased by $41.6 million, and sales to analytical sciences customers
increased by $40.7 million. Sales by type of product included increases in instruments of $84.5 million, service of $51.3 million, and consumables and reagents of $46.9 million.

Operating income for 2007 was $128.8 million, as compared to $115.4 million for 2006, an increase of $13.4 million, or 12%.
Amortization of intangible assets increased due to the acquisitions completed in 2007 and 2006 and was $41.4 million for 2007, as compared to $31.3 million for 2006. Restructuring and lease charges were $8.7 million for 2007 as a result of our Q1
2007 and Q4 2007 Plans, as compared to reversals of $1.7 million in 2006. Amortization of purchase accounting adjustments to record the inventory and IPR&D from certain acquisitions completed in 2007 were $2.5 million and $1.5 million,
respectively, for 2007. Stock option expense was $3.4 million and $3.2 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively. Gains on the settlement of the insurance claim for the March 2005 fire in our Boston, Massachusetts facility were $15.3 million for 2007.
Increased sales volume and higher net productivity increased operating income, partially offset by pressures in our laboratory services business as a result of entering into several large new contracts requiring an increase in start-up investment in
the first six months of 2007.

2006 Compared to
2005.

Sales for 2006 were $1,144.6 million, versus $1,081.1 million in 2005, an increase of $63.5 million, or 6%. Changes in foreign exchange and acquisitions each contributed approximately 1% to the



increase in revenue for 2006, as compared to 2005. The following analysis in the remainder of this paragraph compares selected sales by market and product
type for 2006, as compared to 2005, and includes the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions. Our laboratory service sales increased by $31.8 million, sales to genetic screening customers increased by $24.8 million, and sales
to analytical sciences customers increased by $16.7 million, while sales to BioDiscovery customers decreased by $9.9 million. Sales by type of product included increases in service of $31.8 million, instruments of $29.8 million, and consumables and
reagents of $1.9 million.

Operating income for 2006 was $115.4
million, versus $110.2 million for 2005, an increase of $5.2 million, or 5%. Amortization of intangible assets increased due to the acquisitions completed in 2006 and was $31.3 million for 2006, as compared to $26.2 million for 2005. Operating
income for 2006 includes stock option expense of $3.2 million, whereas no stock option expense was recorded in 2005. Restructuring reversals were $1.7 million for 2006 as compared to a charge of $12.9 million for 2005. Increased sales volume and
successful execution of productivity initiatives also increased operating income, which were more than offset by unfavorable product and geography mix of sales, pricing pressures, and inflation, including commodity costs during 2006.

Optoelectronics

2007 Compared to 2006.

Sales for 2007 were $460.1 million, versus $401.8 million for 2006, an increase of $58.3
million, or 15%, which includes an approximate 3% increase in sales attributable to favorable changes in foreign exchange rates. The analysis in the remainder of this paragraph compares selected sales by product type for 2007, as compared to 2006,
and includes the effect of foreign exchange fluctuations. The increase in sales was a result of an increase of $28.4 million in our medical imaging products due to the performance of our amorphous silicon business, an increase in our specialty
lighting products of $24.8 million primarily due to the performance of photoflash products, specifically in the mobile phone camera modules, and an increase in optical sensors of $4.8 million.

Operating income for 2007 was $76.5 million, versus $70.0 million for 2006,
an increase of $6.5 million, or 9%. Restructuring and lease charges, net of reversals, were $5.7 million for 2007, as a result of our Q4 2007 restructuring plan and lease costs associated with the sale of a business from 2001. Restructuring
reversals were $1.9 million for 2006. Amortization of intangible assets was $2.7 million and $2.5 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively. Stock option expense was $1.4 million and $1.6 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively. Increased sales volume
and capacity and productivity improvements made within the amorphous silicon business also increased operating income, which was partially offset by a one-time charge related to flash module investments.

2006 Compared to
2005.

Sales for 2006 were $401.8 million, versus $392.7 million for 2005, an increase of $9.1 million, or 2%. Changes in foreign exchange rates had minimal impact on the increase in revenue for 2006, as compared to 2005. The analysis in the
remainder of this paragraph compares selected sales by product type for 2006, as compared to 2005, and includes the effect of foreign exchange fluctuations and acquisitions. Sales of our medical imaging products increased by $15.1 million while
sales within our optical sensors and specialty lighting product lines decreased $6.0 million due to a decrease in Cermax

®

video and specific military platforms.

Operating income for 2006 was $70.0 million, versus $58.4 million for 2005,
an increase of $11.6 million, or 20%. Amortization of intangible assets was $2.5 million for 2006 and $2.6 million for 2005. Operating income for 2006 includes stock option expense of $1.6 million, whereas no stock option expense was recorded in
2005. Restructuring reversals were $1.9 million for 2006 as compared to a charge of $9.2 million for 2005. In addition, 2005 included a $0.2 million charge for in-process research and development related to the acquisition of the capital stock of
Elcos AG, a leading European designer and manufacturer of custom light emitting diode (“LED”) solutions for biomedical and industrial applications. Successful execution of productivity initiatives also increased operating income, which was
partially offset by unfavorable product mix, pricing pressures and inflation including commodity costs during 2006, as well as capacity issues within the amorphous silicon business.



Liquidity and Capital Resources

We require cash to pay our operating expenses, make
capital expenditures, service our debt and other long-term liabilities, repurchase shares of our common stock and pay dividends on our common stock. Our principal sources of funds are from our operations and the capital markets, particularly the
debt markets. In the near term, we anticipate that our operations will generate sufficient cash to fund our operating expenses, capital expenditures, interest payments on our debt and dividends on our common stock. In the long-term, we expect to use
internally generated funds and external sources to satisfy our debt and other long-term liabilities.

Principal factors that could affect the availability of our internally generated funds include:

•

deterioration of sales due to weakness in markets in which we sell our products and services, and

•

changes in our working capital requirements.

Principal factors that could affect our ability to obtain cash from external sources include:

•

financial covenants contained in the financial instruments controlling our borrowings that limit our total borrowing capacity,

•

increases in interest rates applicable to our outstanding variable rate debt,

•

a ratings downgrade that would limit our ability to borrow under our accounts receivable facility and our overall access to the corporate debt market,

•

volatility in the markets for corporate debt,

•

a decrease in the market price for our common stock, and

•

volatility in the public equity markets.

Cash Flows

Fiscal Year 2007

Operating Activities.

Net cash provided by continuing operations was $207.1 million in 2007, compared to net cash provided by continuing operations
of $127.0 million in 2006, an increase of $80.1 million, driven primarily by the $1.3 million of divestiture tax refunds that occurred in 2007 as compared to the $60.3 million of taxes paid on divestitures in 2006. The increase in cash provided by
operating activities in 2007 was also driven by income from continuing operations of $133.8 million, depreciation and amortization of $78.0 million and restructuring and lease charges of $14.4 million. These amounts were partially offset by $15.3
million from the settlement of an insurance claim and a net increase in working capital of $5.0 million. Contributing to the net increase in working capital in 2007, excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations, was an increase in
accounts receivable of $29.7 million, offset by an increase in accounts payable of $24.4 million, and a decrease in inventory of $0.3 million. In both the Life and Analytical Sciences and Optoelectronics segments the timing of strong revenue
performance in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007 increased the accounts receivable balance, which was offset by the timing of accounts payable disbursements in the same quarter. There was no incremental use of our accounts receivable
securitization facility in 2007, which totaled $45.0 million at both December 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006. Changes in accrued expenses, other assets and liabilities and other items, net, totaled $0.1 million in 2007, and primarily
related to timing of payments for tax, restructuring, and salary and benefits.

Investing Activities.

Net cash used in continuing operations investing activities was $350.1 million in 2007, compared to $140.0 million of cash used in continuing operations investing activities in 2006.
Included in 2007 were payments of $1.0 million related to business development costs. In addition, we used $312.7 million of net cash for acquisitions and used $3.2 million in related transaction costs, earn-out payments, acquired licenses and other
costs in connection with these and other transactions. Capital expenditures in 2007 were $47.0 million,



mainly in the areas of tooling and other capital equipment purchases, in addition to the improvements in our amorphous silicon facility within our
Optoelectronics segment. These cash outflows were partially offset by $10.8 million received from the settlement of an insurance claim, $1.6 million from the surrender of life insurance policies, and $1.4 million from the sale of investments.

Financing Activities.

Net cash provided by continuing
operations financing activities was $148.9 million in 2007, compared to $313.5 million of cash used in continuing operations financing activities in 2006. In 2007, we repurchased in the open market approximately 8.1 million shares of our common
stock at a total cost of $203.0 million, including commissions. This compares to repurchases in 2006 of $190.1 million. We also paid $4.2 million to settle forward interest rate contracts, with notional amounts totaling $300.0 million and a weighted
average interest rate of 4.25%, and $0.8 million for debt issuance costs. These uses of cash were offset in part by $32.8 million of proceeds from common stock option exercises and the related tax benefit. Debt borrowings from our amended senior
unsecured revolving credit facility and interim unsecured credit facility in 2007 totaled $271.5 million and $300.0 million, respectively, offset by debt reductions to our amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility of $212.4 million and
other credit facilities of $1.3 million. This compares to debt reductions in 2006 of $110.7 million. In addition, we paid $33.7 million in dividends in 2007.

Fiscal Year 2006

Operating Activities.

Net cash generated by continuing operations operating activities was $127.0 million in 2006, compared to net cash generated
by continuing operations operating activities of $192.9 million in 2005. Principal contributors to the generation of cash from operating activities during 2006 were net income from continuing operations of $118.3 million, and depreciation and
amortization of $69.2 million. These amounts were offset in part by taxes paid on divestitures of $60.3 million, net gain from dispositions of property, plant and equipment of $1.5 million, net gain from settlement of investments of $2.3 million,
and a net increase in working capital of $9.4 million. Contributing to the net increase in working capital in 2006, excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations, was an increase in inventory of $11.1 million and a decrease in accounts
payable of $1.7 million, offset in part by a decrease in accounts receivable of $3.3 million. Strong performance in accounts receivable collections in the Life and Analytical Sciences segment was partially offset by increased accounts payable
disbursements in both the Life and Analytical Sciences and Optoelectronics segments. The increase in inventory was primarily the result of expanding the amount of inventory held at service locations within the Life and Analytical Sciences segment.
There was no incremental use of our accounts receivable securitization facility during 2006, which totaled $45.0 million at both December 31, 2006 and January 1, 2006. Changes in accrued expenses, other assets and liabilities, and other
items totaled $13.0 million during 2006, and primarily relates to timing of payments for tax, restructuring, and salary and benefits.

Investing Activities.

Net cash used in continuing operations investing activities was $140.0 million in 2006, compared to $333.3 million of cash
provided by continuing operations investing activities in 2005. Included in 2006 was $25.0 million of net proceeds received from the sale of our Semiconductor business unit and $6.6 million of net proceeds from the sale of investments. This was
offset by approximately $129.0 million of net cash used for acquisitions. In addition, we incurred $12.1 million of business development transaction costs, earn-out payments and other costs in connection with these and previous transactions. Capital
expenditures in 2006 were $44.5 million, mainly in the areas of tooling and other capital equipment purchases, in addition to facility improvements. These cash outflows were partially offset by $5.3 million from the advance and settlement of an
insurance claim, $4.9 million received from the sale of property, plant and equipment, and $3.8 million from the settlement of life insurance policies.

Financing Activities.

Net cash used in continuing operations financing activities was $313.5 million in 2006, compared to $217.6 million in 2005,
an increase of $95.9 million, or 44%. In 2006, we repurchased in the open market 8.9 million shares of our common stock at a total cost of $190.1 million, including commissions. Debt reductions during 2006 totaled $110.7 million, compared
to reductions in 2005 of $374.7 million. These uses of cash were offset by proceeds from common stock option exercises of $21.5 million and the related tax benefit of $2.2 million. In addition, we paid $35.5 million in dividends during 2006.



Current Borrowing Arrangements

Amended Senior Unsecured Credit Facility.

On August 13, 2007, we entered into an amended and restated
senior unsecured revolving credit facility. The agreement for the facility provides for a $500.0 million committed unsecured revolving credit facility through August 13, 2012, and amends and restates in its entirety the senior credit agreement
dated as of October 31, 2005. The agreement contains an option to increase the facility up to $650.0 million. Letters of credit in the aggregate amount of approximately $15.0 million were issued under our previous facility, which are treated as
issued under our amended facility. We use the amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes, which may include working capital, refinancing existing indebtedness, capital expenditures, share repurchases,
acquisitions and strategic alliances. The interest rates under the amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility are based on the Eurocurrency rate at the time of borrowing plus a margin or the base rate from time to time. The base rate is the
higher of (1) the corporate base rate announced from time to time by Bank of America, N.A. and (2) the Federal Funds rate plus 50 basis points. We may allocate all or a portion of its indebtedness under the amended senior unsecured
revolving credit facility to interest based upon the Eurocurrency rate plus a margin or the base rate. The Eurocurrency margin as of December 30, 2007 was 40 basis points. The weighted average Eurocurrency interest rate as of December 30,
2007 was 4.86%, resulting in a weighted average effective Eurocurrency rate, including the margin, of 5.26%. We had drawn down approximately $216.0 million of borrowings in U.S. Dollars under the facility as of December 30, 2007, with interest
based on the above described Eurocurrency rate. The agreement for the facility contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants and events of default customary for financings of this type and those contained in our previous senior revolving
credit agreement. The financial covenants in our amended and restated senior unsecured revolving credit facility include debt-to-capital ratios and a contingent maximum total leverage ratio, applicable if our credit rating is down-graded below
investment grade. The financial covenants in our previous senior revolving credit agreement included interest coverage and debt-to-EBITDA ratios. At all times during 2007, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants.

Prior to February 28, 2008, we exercised the option to increase the
amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility to $608.8 million. We had borrowed approximately $216.0 million in U.S. Dollars under the facility as of February 28, 2008, with interest based on the above described Eurocurrency rate.

Unsecured Interim Credit Facility.

On November 14,
2007, we entered into a $300.0 million unsecured interim credit facility. We entered into this unsecured interim credit facility in order to pay the purchase price and transactional expenses of the ViaCell acquisition. This interim credit facility
matures on March 31, 2008, at which point all amounts outstanding are due in full. The interest rates for this interim credit facility are based on either the Eurocurrency rate at the time of borrowing plus a margin, or on the base rate as in
effect from time to time. The base rate is the higher of (1) the corporate base rate announced from time to time by Bank of America, N.A. and (2) the Federal Funds rate plus 50 basis points. We may allocate all or a portion of its
indebtedness under this interim credit facility to interest based upon either the Eurocurrency rate plus a margin or the base rate. The Eurocurrency margin for this interim credit facility as of December 30, 2007 was 62.5 basis points. The
applicable Eurocurrency margin will increase by 12.5 basis points from and after January 1, 2008 for all outstanding borrowings. The weighted average Eurocurrency interest rate as of December 30, 2007 was 5.03%, resulting in a weighted
average effective Eurocurrency rate, including the margin, of 5.65%. We had drawn down approximately $300.0 million of borrowings in U.S. Dollars under the facility as of December 30, 2007, with interest based on the above described
Eurocurrency rate. The agreement for this facility contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants and events of default customary for financings of this type, and are consistent with those contained in the agreement for our amended unsecured
revolving credit facility, which is described above.

We
anticipate using the amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility to settle any outstanding amounts on the unsecured interim credit facility in March 2008, and have accordingly classified the $300.0 million of outstanding borrowings on the
unsecured interim credit facility as long-term debt.



Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Receivables Securitization Facility.

During 2001, we established a wholly owned consolidated subsidiary to maintain a
receivables purchase agreement with a third party financial institution. Under this arrangement, we sold, on a revolving basis, certain of our accounts receivable balances to the consolidated subsidiary which simultaneously sold an undivided
percentage ownership interest in designated pools of receivables to a third party financial institution. As collections reduce the balance of sold accounts receivable, new receivables are sold. Our consolidated subsidiary retains the risk of credit
loss on the receivables. Accordingly, the full amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts has been provided for on our balance sheet. The amount of receivables sold and outstanding with the third party financial institution may not exceed $65.0
million. Under the terms of this arrangement, our consolidated subsidiary retains collection and administrative responsibilities for the balances. The amount of receivables sold to the consolidated subsidiary was $79.0 million as of
December 30, 2007 and $67.8 million as of December 31, 2006. At each of December 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006, an undivided interest of $45.0 million in the receivables had been sold to the third party financial institution
under this arrangement. The remaining interest in receivables of $34.0 million and $22.8 million that were sold to and held by the consolidated subsidiary were included in accounts receivable in the consolidated financial statements at
December 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively.

The agreement requires the third party financial institution to be paid interest during the period from the date the receivable is sold to its maturity date. At December 30, 2007, the effective interest rate was LIBOR plus
approximately 80 basis points. The servicing fees received constitute adequate compensation for services performed. No servicing asset or liability is therefore recorded. The agreement also includes conditions that require us to maintain a senior
unsecured credit rating of BB or above, as defined by Standard & Poor’s Rating Services, and Ba2 or above, as defined by Moody’s Investors Service. At December 30, 2007, we had a senior unsecured credit rating of BBB, with a
stable outlook from Standard & Poor’s Rating Services, and of Baa3, with a stable outlook from Moody’s Investors Service. In January 2008, our consolidated subsidiary entered into an agreement to extend the term of the accounts
receivable securitization facility to January 23, 2009.

Dividends

Our Board declared regular quarterly cash dividends of seven
cents per share in each quarter of 2007 and 2006, resulting in an annual dividend rate of 28 cents per share.

Contractual Obligations

The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 30, 2007:

*

The credit facility borrowings carry variable interest rates; the amounts do not contemplate interest obligations.

**

The FIN No. 48 amount includes accrued interest, net of tax benefits, and penalties. We have excluded $36.2 million, including accrued interest, net of
tax benefits, and penalties, from the amount related to our



uncertain tax positions as we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of related future payments.

***

The credit facility borrowings carry variable interest rates; the amounts do not contemplate interest obligations. Prior to February 28, 2008, we exercised the option to increase
the senior unsecured revolving credit facility to $608.8 million. We anticipate using funds from the amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility to settle any outstanding amounts on the unsecured interim credit facility in March 2008, and
have accordingly classified the $300.0 million of outstanding borrowings on the unsecured interim credit facility as long-term debt.

Capital Expenditures

During 2008, we expect to invest an amount for capital expenditures similar to that in 2007, primarily to introduce new products, to improve our operating
processes, to shift the production capacity to lower cost locations, to increase capacity in the amorphous silicon business, and to develop information technology. We expect to use our available cash and internally generated funds to fund these
expenditures.

Other Potential Liquidity Considerations

On November 6, 2006, we announced that our Board authorized us to
repurchase up to 10.0 million shares of our common stock under a stock repurchase program (the “Repurchase Program”). The Repurchase Program will expire on October 25, 2010 unless this authorization is terminated earlier by our
Board, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. During 2007, we repurchased in the open market approximately 8.1 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $203.0 million, including commissions, under the Repurchase
Program.

During 2006, we repurchased in the open market
8.9 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $190.1 million, including commissions. These repurchases were made pursuant to our stock repurchase program announced in November 2005.

The repurchased shares have been reflected as additional authorized but
unissued shares, with the payments reflected in common stock and capital in excess of par value. Any repurchased shares will be available for use in connection with corporate programs. If we continue to repurchase shares, the repurchase program will
be funded using our existing financial resources, including cash and cash equivalents, and our existing amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility.

In connection with the settlement of an insurance claim resulting from a fire that occurred within our Life and Analytical Sciences facility in Boston,
Massachusetts in March 2005, we accrued $9.7 million during the second quarter of 2007, representing our management’s estimate of the total cost for decommissioning the building, including environmental matters. We paid $3.9 million during
fiscal year 2007 towards decommissioning the building. We anticipate that the remaining payments of $5.8 million will be completed by the end of fiscal year 2008.

Our businesses are not materially affected by conditions in the global financial markets and economic conditions generally.
However, increasing or high interest rates and/or widening credit spreads, especially if such changes are rapid, may create a less favorable environment for certain of our businesses, and may affect the fair value of financial instruments that we
issue or hold. For example, beginning in the second half of 2007, difficulties in the mortgage and broader credit markets in the United States and elsewhere resulted in a relatively sudden and substantial decrease in the availability of credit and a
corresponding increase in funding costs. Credit spreads widened significantly, affecting volatility and liquidity in the debt and equity markets. These conditions have persisted through the end of 2007 and we cannot predict how long these conditions
will exist or how our businesses may be affected. Increases in interest rates or credit spreads, as well as limitations on the availability of credit, can affect our ability to borrow on a secured or unsecured basis, which may adversely affect our



liquidity and results of operations. In difficult credit markets, we may be forced to fund our operations at a higher cost, or we may be unable to raise as
much funding as we need to support our business activities. This could cause us to curtail our business activities and could increase our cost of funding, both of which could reduce our profitability.

Effects of Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncement

In June 2006, the FASB issued FIN No. 48,

“Accounting for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes.”

FIN No. 48 was issued to clarify the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements by prescribing a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial
statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. FIN No. 48 also provides guidance on derecognition of tax benefits, classification on the balance sheet, interest and penalties, accounting
in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. We classify interest and penalties as a component of income tax expense.

As a result of the adoption of FIN No. 48 on January 1, 2007, we adjusted the carrying value of our uncertain tax positions and reduced our
accrued liabilities by $3.6 million, which was accounted for as an increase to retained earnings as of January 1, 2007. As of the adoption date, we had gross tax effected unrecognized tax benefits of $48.5 million, of which $36.0 million,
if recognized, would affect the continuing operations effective tax rate. The remaining amount, if recognized, would affect goodwill and discontinued operations. However, upon the adoption of SFAS No. 141(R), changes in deferred tax asset valuation
allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally will effect income tax expense, including those associated with acquisitions that closed prior to the effective date of SFAS No. 141(R). We had accrued interest, net of tax
benefits, and penalties related to the unrecognized tax benefits of $7.3 million, which is not included in the unrecognized tax benefits of $48.5 million.

Effects of Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,

“Fair Value Measurements”

(“SFAS No. 157”).
SFAS No. 157 clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability, and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to
develop those assumptions. Under the standard, fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy. We will be required to adopt SFAS No. 157 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008. We are currently
evaluating the requirements of SFAS No. 157 and have not yet determined the impact, if any, of its adoption on our consolidated financial statements.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,

“The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities”

(“SFAS No. 159”). SFAS No. 159 provides entities with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value, with the objective to reduce both the complexity in accounting for financial instruments, and the
volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently. We will be required to adopt SFAS No. 159 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008. We have evaluated the requirements of SFAS No. 159 and have determined
the impact of its adoption on our consolidated financial statements to be immaterial.

In March 2007, the FASB ratified EITF Issue No. 06-10,

“Accounting for Collateral Assignment Split-Dollar Life Insurance Agreements”

(“EITF No. 06-10”). EITF No. 06-10
provides guidance for determining a liability for the post-retirement benefit obligation as well as recognition and measurement of the associated asset on the basis of the terms of the collateral assignment agreement. We will be required to adopt
EITF No. 06-10 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008. We are currently evaluating the requirements of EITF No. 06-10 and have not yet determined the impact, if any, of its adoption on our consolidated financial statements.

In June 2007, the FASB ratified EITF Issue No. 07-3,

“Accounting for Nonrefundable Advance Payments for Goods or Services Received for Use in Future Research and Development Activities”

(“EITF No. 07-3”). EITF No. 07-3 requires that nonrefundable advance payments
for goods or services that will be used or rendered



for future research and development activities be deferred, capitalized and recognized as an expense as the goods are delivered or the related services are
performed. We will be required to adopt EITF No. 07-3, on a prospective basis, in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008. We are currently evaluating the requirements of EITF No. 07-3 and have not yet determined the impact, if any, of its
adoption on our consolidated financial statements.

In December
2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007),

“Business Combinations”

(“SFAS No. 141(R)”). SFAS No. 141(R) establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its
financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree, and the goodwill acquired. SFAS No. 141(R) also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the
nature and financial effects of the business combination. We will be required to adopt SFAS No. 141(R) in the first quarter of fiscal year 2009. We are currently evaluating the requirements of SFAS No. 141(R) and have not yet determined
the impact of its adoption on our consolidated financial statements.

Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories, intangible assets, income taxes, restructuring, pensions and other postretirement benefits, contingencies and litigation. We base our
estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not
readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated
financial statements.

Revenue recognition.

We
record product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. For products that include installation, if the installation
meets the criteria to be considered a separate element, we recognize product revenue upon delivery, and we delay recognition of installation revenue until the installation is complete. For sales that include customer-specified acceptance criteria,
we recognize revenue only after the acceptance criteria have been met. We defer revenue from services and recognize it over the contractual period, or as we render services and the customer accepts them. When arrangements include multiple elements,
we use objective evidence of fair value to allocate revenue to the elements and recognize revenue when the criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element, all in accordance with EITF Issue No. 00-21, “

Revenue Arrangements
with Multiple Deliverables.”

Because the majority of our sales relate to specific manufactured products or units rather than long-term customized projects, we generally do not experience significant changes in original estimates. Further,
we have not experienced any significant refunds or promotional allowances that require significant estimation.

Warranty Costs

. We provide for estimated warranty costs for products at the time of their sale. Warranty liabilities are based on estimated
future repair costs using historical labor and material incurred in the warranty period.



Allowances for doubtful accounts.

We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated
losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. We generally compute our allowance for doubtful accounts by (1) applying specific percentage reserves on accounts that are past due and deemed uncollectible; and
(2) specifically reserving for customers known to be in financial difficulty. Therefore, if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate beyond our estimates, we may have to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts. This
would reduce our earnings.

Inventory valuation.

We
initially value inventory at actual cost to purchase and/or manufacture. We periodically review these values to ascertain that market value of the inventory continues to exceed its recorded cost. Generally, reductions in value of inventory below
cost are caused by our maintenance of stocks of products in excess of demand, or technological obsolescence of the inventory. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand and, when necessary, record provisions for excess and obsolete inventory
based on either our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements, or historical trailing usage of the product. If our sales do not materialize as planned or at historic levels, we may have to increase our reserve for excess and
obsolete inventory. This would reduce our earnings. If actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated, inventory previously written down may be sold, resulting in lower costs of sales and higher income from operations than expected in
that period.

Business Combinations.

The allocation
of purchase price for business combinations requires estimates and judgment as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business, and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets, in determining the estimated
fair value for purchase price allocation purposes. The fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on management’s estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by
management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. If the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these estimates, the amounts recorded in the financial statements could result in a
possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill, or require acceleration of the amortization expense of finite-lived intangible assets.

Value of long-lived assets, including intangibles.

We carry a variety of long-lived assets on our balance sheet including property and
equipment, investments, identifiable intangible assets, and goodwill. We periodically review the carrying value of all of these assets based, in part, upon current estimated market values and our projections of anticipated future cash flows. We
undertake this review (1) on an annual basis for assets such as goodwill and non-amortizing intangible assets and (2) on a periodic basis for other long-lived assets when facts and circumstances suggest that cash flows emanating from those
assets may be diminished. Any impairment charge that we record reduces our earnings. The impairment test consists of a two-step process. The first step is the comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if
the carrying value exceeds the fair value. The second step measures the amount of an impairment loss, and is only performed if the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value of the reporting unit. We perform the annual impairment assessment on
the later of January 1 or the first day of each fiscal year. This same impairment test will be performed at other times during the course of the year should an event occur which suggests that the recoverability of goodwill should be
reconsidered. Non-amortizing intangibles are also subject to an annual impairment test. The impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of an intangible asset
exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess is recognized

.

In addition, we currently evaluate the remaining useful life of our non-amortizing intangible assets at least annually to determine whether events or
circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life. If events or circumstances indicate that the useful lives of non-amortizing intangible assets are no longer indefinite, the assets will be tested for impairment in accordance with SFAS
No. 142. These intangible assets will then be amortized prospectively over their estimated remaining useful life and accounted for in the same manner as other intangible assets that are subject to amortization. We completed the annual
impairment test using a measurement date of December 31, 2007 and January 1, 2007, and concluded based on the first step of the process that there was no goodwill impairment. While we believe that our estimates of current value are
reasonable, different assumptions regarding items such as future cash flows and the volatility inherent in markets which we serve could affect our evaluations and result in impairment charges against the carrying value of those assets.



Employee compensation and benefits.

Retirement and postretirement benefit plans are a
significant cost of doing business, and represent obligations that will be ultimately settled far in the future, and therefore are subject to estimation. Retirement and postretirement benefit plan expenses are allocated to cost of sales, research
and development, and selling, general and administrative expenses, in our consolidated statement of operations. We incurred expenses of $12.5 million in 2007, $10.2 million in 2006 and $11.9 million in 2005 for our retirement and postretirement
plans. We expect expenses of approximately $8.2 million in 2008 for our retirement and postretirement plans. Pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employee’s approximate service period based
on the terms of the plans and the investment and funding decisions made. We are required to make assumptions regarding such variables as the expected long-term rate of return on assets and the discount rate applied, to determine service cost and
interest cost, in order to arrive at pension income or expense for the year. As of December 30, 2007, we estimated the expected long-term rate of return of assets in our pension portfolios in the United States was 8.5% and was 7.6% for all
plans outside the United States. We have analyzed the rates of return on assets used and determined that these rates are reasonable based on the plans’ historical performance relative to the overall markets in the countries where we invest the
assets, as well as our current expectations for long-term rates of returns for our pension assets. Our management will continue to assess the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumptions for each plan based on relevant market
conditions, and will make adjustments to the assumptions as appropriate. Discount rate assumptions have been, and continue to be, based on the prevailing market long-term interest rates at the measurement date. If any of our assumptions were to
change, our pension plan expenses would also change. A one-quarter percent increase in the discount rate would decrease our net periodic benefit cost by $0.6 million for 2008 in the United States and by $0.5 million for 2008 for all plans outside
the United States. A one percent decrease in the estimated return on plan assets would increase our pre-tax pension expense by $2.4 million for 2008 in the United States and by $1.1 million for 2008 for all plans outside the United States. We
have reduced the volatility in our healthcare costs provided to our retirees by adopting a defined dollar plan feature in fiscal 2001. Under the defined dollar plan feature, our total annual liability for healthcare costs to any one retiree is
limited to a fixed dollar amount, regardless of the nature or cost of the healthcare needs of that retiree. Our maximum future liability, therefore, cannot be increased by future changes in the cost of healthcare.

Restructuring activities.

Our financial statements detail
specific charges relating to restructuring activities as well as the actual spending that has occurred against the resulting accruals in accordance with SFAS No. 146,

“Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal
Activities.”

Our pre-tax restructuring charges are estimates based on our preliminary assessments of (1) severance benefits to be granted to employees, based on known benefit formulas and identified job grades, (2) costs to
abandon certain facilities based on known lease costs of sub-rental income and (3) asset impairments as discussed above under “Value of long-lived assets, including intangibles.” Because these accruals are estimates, they are subject
to change as a result of deviations from initial restructuring plans or subsequent information that may come to our attention. For example, actual severance costs may be less than anticipated if employees voluntarily leave prior to the time at which
they would be entitled to severance, or if anticipated legal hurdles in foreign jurisdictions prove to be less onerous than expected. In addition, unanticipated successes or difficulties in terminating leases and other contractual obligations may
lead to changes in estimates. When such changes in estimates occur, they are reflected in our financial statements on the income statement line entitled “restructuring and lease charges (reversals), net.”

Gains or losses on dispositions.

When we record the disposition
of an asset or discontinuance of an operation, we make an estimate relative to the amount we expect to realize on the sale or disposition. This estimate is based on a variety of factors, including current interest in the market, alternative markets
for the assets, and other relevant factors. If anticipated proceeds are less than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation, we record a loss. If anticipated proceeds are greater than the current carrying amount of the asset or
operation, we recognize a gain net of expected contingencies when the transaction has been consummated. Accordingly, we may realize amounts different than were first estimated. During the year ended December 30, 2007, we did not recognize any
gains or losses from disposition of fixed assets. We recorded $1.2 million in losses from the disposition of discontinued operations. Any such changes decrease or increase current earnings, and are recorded either against the “gains on
disposition” or “discontinued operations” line items appearing in our income statement.



Income taxes.

Our business operations are global in nature, and we are subject to taxes in
numerous jurisdictions. Tax laws and tax rates vary substantially in these jurisdictions, and are subject to change given the political and economic climate in those countries. We report and pay income tax based on operational results and applicable
law. Our tax provision contemplates tax rates currently in effect to determine both our current and deferred tax provisions. Any significant fluctuation in rates or changes in tax laws could cause our estimates of taxes we anticipate either paying
or recovering in the future to change. Such changes could lead to either increases or decreases in our effective tax rate.

Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related tax assets and liabilities. In the
ordinary course of our business, there are operational decisions, transactions, facts and circumstances, and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is not certain. Furthermore, our tax positions are periodically subject to challenge
by taxing authorities throughout the world. Every quarter we review our tax positions in each significant taxing jurisdiction in the process of evaluating our unrecognized tax benefits as required by FIN No. 48. Adjustments are made to our
unrecognized tax benefits when: (i) facts and circumstances regarding a tax position change, causing a change in our judgment regarding that tax position; (ii) a tax position is ultimately settled with a tax authority; and/or
(iii) the statute of limitations expires regarding a tax position. Any significant impact as a result of changes in underlying facts, law, tax rates, tax audit, or review could lead to adjustments to our income tax expense, our effective tax
rate, or our cash flow.

Additionally, in accordance with SFAS
No. 109, we have established valuation allowances against a variety of deferred tax assets, including net operating loss carryforwards, foreign tax credits, other income tax credits and certain pension accruals. Valuation allowances take into
consideration our ability to use these deferred tax assets and reduce the value of such items to the amount that is deemed more likely than not to be recoverable. Improvements or other changes in our operations, domestically and internationally,
could increase our ability to utilize these tax attributes in the future. The release of valuation allowances in periods when these tax attributes become realizable would reduce our effective tax rate.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Financial Instruments

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash investments, marketable
securities and accounts receivable. We believe we had no significant concentrations of credit risk as of December 30, 2007.

In the ordinary course of business, we enter into foreign exchange contracts for periods consistent with our committed exposures to mitigate the effect of
foreign currency movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Transactions covered by hedge contracts include intercompany and third-party receivables and payables. The contracts are primarily in European and Asian currencies, have
maturities that do not exceed 12 months, have no cash requirements until maturity, and are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet. Credit risk and market risk are insignificant as the foreign exchange instruments are contracted
with major banking institutions. Unrealized gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts are recognized immediately in earnings for hedges designated as fair value and, for hedges designated as cash flow, the related unrealized gains or losses
are deferred as a component of other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. Deferred gains and losses are recognized in income in the period in which the underlying anticipated transaction occurs and impacts earnings.
Principal hedged currencies include the British Pound (GBP), Canadian Dollar (CAD), Euro (EUR), Japanese Yen (JPY), and Singapore Dollar (SGD). We held forward foreign exchange contracts with U.S. equivalent notional amounts totaling $105.2 million
at December 30, 2007 and $174.8 million as of December 31, 2006, and the approximate fair value of these foreign currency derivative contracts was insignificant. The gains and losses realized on foreign currency derivative contracts are
not material. The duration of these contracts entered into in 2007 was generally 30 days.



In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2007, we entered into forward interest rate contracts, with
notional amounts totaling $300.0 million, a weighted average interest rate of 4.25%, and a future dated settlement to coincide with our highly probable debt issuance in 2008. These contracts are intended to hedge movements in interest rates prior to
our highly probable debt issuance in 2008. We had accumulated net derivative losses of $5.3 million, net of taxes, in other comprehensive income as of December 30, 2007, related to these cash flow hedges. The net derivative losses will be
reclassified into net earnings when the hedged exposure affects net earnings. No cash flow hedges were discontinued and no ineffectiveness was recognized during 2007.

We do not enter into derivatives for trading or other speculative purposes, nor do we use leveraged financial instruments.

Market Risk

Market Risk.

We are exposed to market risk, including changes in
interest rates and currency exchange rates. To manage the volatility relating to these exposures, we enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted market exposures.

Foreign Exchange Risk.

The potential change in foreign currency
exchange rates offers a substantial risk to us, as approximately 63% of our business is conducted outside of the United States, generally in foreign currencies. Our risk management strategy currently uses forward contracts to mitigate certain
balance sheet foreign currency transaction exposures. The intent is to offset gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures, with gains and losses resulting from the forward contracts that hedge these exposures. Moreover, we are able to
partially mitigate the impact that fluctuations in currencies have on our net income as a result of our manufacturing facilities located in countries outside the United States, material sourcing and other spending which occur in countries outside
the United States, resulting in a natural hedge.

Although we
attempt to manage our foreign currency exchange risk through the above activities, when the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies in which we transact business, generally sales and net income will be positively but not proportionately
impacted.

Foreign Currency Risk—Value-at-Risk
Disclosure

. We utilize a Value-at-Risk model to determine the potential earning/fair value exposures presented by our foreign currency related financial instruments. As discussed above, we seek to minimize this exposure through our hedging
program. Our Value-at-Risk computation is based on the Monte Carlo simulation, utilizing a 95% confidence interval and a holding period of 30 days. As of December 30, 2007, this computation estimated that there is a 5% chance that the market
value of the underlying exposures and the corresponding derivative instruments either increase or decrease due to foreign currency fluctuations by more than $0.1 million. This Value-At-Risk measure is consistent with our financial statement
disclosures relative to our foreign currency hedging program. Specifically, during each of the four quarters ended in fiscal 2007, the Value-At-Risk ranged between zero and $0.2 million, with an average of approximately $0.1 million.

Interest Rate Risk.

As described above, our debt portfolio
includes variable rate instruments. Fluctuations in interest rates can therefore have a direct impact on both our short-term cash flows, as they relate to interest, and our earnings. To manage the volatility relating to these exposures, we enter
into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted interest rate exposures.



Interest Rate Risk—Sensitivity

. As of December 30, 2007, our debt portfolio
consisted of $516.0 million of variable rate debt. In addition, our cash and cash equivalents, for which we receive interest at variable rates, were $203.3 million at December 30, 2007. Our current earnings exposure for changes in interest
rates can be summarized as follows:

(1)
Changes in interest rates can cause interest charges on our variable rate debt, consisting of $516.0 million of revolving and interim debt facilities, to fluctuate. An increase of 10%, or approximately 55 basis points, in current interest rates
would cause an additional pre-tax charge to our earnings of $2.8 million for fiscal year 2008.

(2) Changes in interest rates can cause our cash flows relative to interest payments on variable rate debt to fluctuate. As described
above, an increase of 10%, or approximately 55 basis points, in current interest rates would cause our cash outflows to increase by $2.8 million for fiscal year 2008.

(3) Changes in interest rates can cause our cash flows relative to interest received to fluctuate.



Item 8.

Financial Statements and Supplemental Data




REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of PerkinElmer, Inc.

Waltham, Massachusetts

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of PerkinElmer,
Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 30, 2007. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15. These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial
statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of PerkinElmer, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 30, 2007, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic
consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, on January 1, 2007 the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”) Interpretation (“FIN”) No. 48,

“Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes”

(“FIN No. 48”). Also, as discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2006 the Company
adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 123(R),

“Share-Based Payment”

and SFAS No. 158

“Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an
amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)”

.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2007, based
on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 28, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion on the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1:

Nature of Operations and Accounting Policies

Nature of Operations:

PerkinElmer, Inc. is a global high technology company which designs, manufactures, markets and
services components, systems and products within two reporting segments: Life and Analytical Sciences and Optoelectronics.

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of PerkinElmer, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”). All material intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Investments in business entities in which the Company does not have control, but has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies, are accounted
for by the equity method.

The Company’s fiscal year ends
on the Sunday nearest December 31. The Company reports fiscal years under a 52/53 week format. Under this method, certain years will contain 53 weeks. The fiscal years ended December 30, 2007, December 31, 2006 and January 1,
2006 included 52 weeks.

Accounting Policies and
Estimates:

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect
the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and
on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.

Revenue
Recognition:

The Company’s product sales are recorded when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably
assured. For products that include installation, and if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element, product revenue is recognized upon delivery, and installation revenue is recognized when the installation is complete.
For sales that include customer-specified acceptance criteria, revenue is recognized after the acceptance criteria have been met. Certain of the Company’s products require specialized installation. Revenue for these products is deferred until
installation is completed. Revenue from services is deferred and recognized over the contractual period, or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer. When arrangements include multiple elements, the Company uses objective evidence of
fair value to allocate revenue to the elements, and recognizes revenue when the criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element, in accordance with EITF Issue No. 00-21, “

Revenue Arrangements with Multiple
Deliverables.”

:    The Company provides for estimated warranty costs for products at the time of their sale. Warranty liabilities are based on estimated future repair costs using historical labor and material costs incurred in the
warranty period.

Shipping and Handling
Costs:

The Company reports shipping and handling costs in both sales and the related costs as cost of goods sold to the extent they are billed to customers. In all other instances, they are reflected as a component of cost
of goods sold.

Inventories

:    Inventories, which include material, labor and manufacturing overhead, are valued at the lower of cost or market. Substantially all inventories are accounted for using the first-in, first-out
(“FIFO”) method of determining inventory costs. Inventory quantities on-hand are regularly reviewed, and where necessary, provisions for excess and obsolete inventory are recorded based primarily on the Company’s estimated forecast of
product demand and production requirements.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Income Taxes:

The Company uses the asset and liability method of
accounting for income taxes. Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets
and liabilities and their respective tax bases. This method also requires the recognition of future tax benefits such as net operating loss carryforwards, to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. A valuation allowance is established for any deferred tax asset for
which realization is not more likely than not. Pursuant to Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 23, “

Accounting for Income Taxes—Special Areas”

(“APB Opinion No. 23”), and related
interpretations with respect to corporate earnings permanently reinvested offshore, the Company does not accrue tax for the repatriation of its foreign earnings that it considers to be permanently reinvested outside the United States.

The Company provides reserves for potential payments of tax to various tax
authorities related to uncertain tax positions and other issues. Prior to January 1, 2007, these reserves were recorded when management determined that it was probable that a loss would be incurred related to these matters and the amount of
such loss was reasonably determinable. As of January 1, 2007 the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation (“FIN”) No. 48,

“Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes”

(“FIN No. 48”). As a result, reserves are based on a determination of whether and how much of a tax benefit taken by the Company in its tax filings or positions is more likely than not to be realized following resolution of any
potential contingencies present related to the tax benefit. Potential interest and penalties associated with such uncertain tax positions is recorded as a component of income tax expense. See Note 6, below, for additional details.

Property, Plant and Equipment:

The Company
depreciates plant and equipment using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which generally fall within the following ranges: buildings—10 to 40 years; leasehold improvements—estimated useful life or remaining term of
lease, whichever is shorter; machinery and equipment—3 to 7 years. Certain tooling costs are capitalized and amortized over a 3-year life, while repairs and maintenance costs are expensed.

Asset Retirement Obligations

:    The Company
records obligations associated with its lease obligations, the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset-retirement costs in accordance with SFAS No. 143, “

Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations,”

and FIN No. 47, “

Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations

,

an interpretation of SFAS No. 143”

. The Company reviews legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived
assets that result from contractual obligations or the acquisition, construction, development and/or normal use of the assets. If it is determined that a legal obligation exists, regardless of whether the obligation is conditional on a future event,
the fair value of the liability for an asset retirement obligation is recognized in the period in which it is incurred, if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the
associated asset, and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset. The difference between the gross expected future cash flow and its present value is accreted over the life of the related lease as an operating expense.

Pension Plans:

The
Company’s funding policy provides that payments to the United States (U.S.) pension trusts shall at least be equal to the minimum funding requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. Non-U.S. plans are accrued for, but
generally not fully funded, and benefits are paid from operating funds. In future reporting periods, the difference between actual amounts and estimates based on actuarial assumptions will be recognized in “other comprehensive income” in
the period in which they occur.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158,

“Employers’ Accounting for Defined
Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)”

(“SFAS No. 158”). SFAS No. 158 requires companies to recognize a net liability or asset and an
offsetting adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income to report the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Additionally, SFAS No. 158 requires companies to measure plan assets and
obligations at their year-end balance sheet date. SFAS No. 158 requires prospective application and was effective for the Company as of the end of fiscal year 2006.

The impact of adopting SFAS No. 158 was a reduction to accumulated other comprehensive income of $32.7 million, a
reduction to other assets of $26.6 million, an increase to current liabilities of $7.3 million, an increase to current assets of $0.7 million and a reduction to long-term liabilities of $0.4 million, with no impact to the Company’s consolidated
statements of operations or statements of cash flows. There was also no impact from the adoption of SFAS No. 158 on the Company’s compliance with the financial covenants contained in its previous senior revolving credit agreement,
described in more detail in Note 14, below.

Translation of
Foreign Currencies:

For foreign operations, asset and liability accounts are translated at current exchange rates; income and expenses are translated using weighted average exchange rates for the reporting period.
Resulting translation adjustments, as well as gains and losses from certain intercompany transactions, are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income, a separate component of stockholders’ equity.

Intangible Assets:

The Company’s
intangible assets consist of (1) goodwill, which is not being amortized; (2) indefinite lived intangibles, which consist of certain trademarks and trade names that are not subject to amortization; and (3) amortizing intangibles, which
consist of patents and purchased technologies, which are being amortized over their useful lives. All intangible assets are subject to impairment tests on an annual or periodic basis.

Goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing using the guidance and criteria described in SFAS No. 142,

“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.”

The impairment test consists of a two-step process. The first step is the comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if the carrying value exceeds
the fair value. The second step measures the amount of an impairment loss, and is only performed if the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value of the reporting unit. This annual impairment assessment is performed by the Company on the later
of January 1 or the first day of each fiscal year. This same impairment test will be performed at other times during the course of the year, should an event occur which suggests that the recoverability of goodwill should be reconsidered.
Non-amortizing intangibles are also subject to an annual impairment test. The impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair
value, an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess is recognized

.

Amortizing intangibles are evaluated for impairment using the methodology set forth in SFAS No. 144, “

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets”

. Recoverability of these assets is assessed only when events have occurred that may give rise to an impairment. When a potential impairment has been identified, forecasted undiscounted net cash flows of the operations to
which the asset relates are compared to the current carrying value of the long-lived assets present in that operation. If such cash flows are less than such carrying amounts, long-lived assets, including such intangibles, are written down to their
respective fair values. See Note 13, below, for additional details.

Stock-Based Compensation:

The Company has three stock-based compensation plans from which it makes grants, which are described more fully in Note 20. Effective January 2, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS
No. 123(R),

“Share-Based Payment

” (“SFAS No. 123(R)”), which requires compensation costs related to stock-based transactions, including employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based
on fair value. SFAS No. 123(R) revises SFAS No. 123, as amended,

“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation”



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

(“SFAS No. 123”), and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25,

“Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

” (“APB Opinion
No. 25”). Prior to January 2, 2006, the Company applied the intrinsic value based method prescribed in APB Opinion No. 25, as permitted by SFAS No. 123, in accounting for employee stock-based compensation. The Company
generally did not recognize compensation expense in connection with the grant of stock options because the options granted had an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant.

In transitioning from APB Opinion No. 25 to SFAS No. 123(R), the
Company applied the modified prospective method. Accordingly, periods prior to adoption have not been restated and are not directly comparable to periods after adoption. Under the modified prospective method, compensation cost recognized in periods
after adoption includes (i) compensation cost for all stock-based payments granted prior to, but not yet vested as of January 2, 2006, based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS
No. 123, less estimated forfeitures, and (ii) compensation cost for all stock-based payments granted subsequent to January 1, 2006, based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS
No. 123(R), less estimated forfeitures.

The FASB Staff
Position (“FSP”) No. 123R-3,

“Transition Election Related to Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment Awards”

required an entity to follow either the transition guidance for the additional-paid-in-capital
pool as prescribed in SFAS No. 123(R) or the alternative transition method described in FSP No. 123R-3. The Company adopted the alternative transition method provided in the FSP No. 123R-3 for calculating the tax effects of
stock-based compensation under SFAS No. 123(R).

Prior to
the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), the Company presented all excess tax benefits related to stock compensation as cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. SFAS No. 123(R) requires the cash flows
resulting from these tax benefits to be classified as cash flows from financing activities. Tax benefits are recognized related to the cost for share-based payments to the extent the equity instrument would ordinarily result in a future tax
deduction under existing law. Tax expense will be recognized to write off excess deferred tax assets when the tax deduction upon settlement of a vested option is less than the cumulative compensation expense recorded in the statement of operations
for that option, to the extent not offset by prior tax credits for settlements where the tax deduction was greater than the expense recognized based on the fair value at date of grant.

Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), unearned compensation was recorded in a contra-equity account and established
at the date restricted stock was granted representing the amount of unrecognized restricted stock expense. Under the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), the recognition of unearned compensation at the date restricted stock is granted is no longer
allowed. Therefore, in the first quarter of 2006, the unrecognized restricted stock that had been in “Unearned compensation” in the consolidated balance sheet as of January 1, 2006 was reclassified to “Capital in excess of par
value.”

Marketable Securities and
Investments:

Marketable Securities and Investments, whether debt or equity, are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 115, “

Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities.”

The
cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. If securities are classified as available for sale, the Company records these investments at their fair values with unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss). Under the cost method of accounting, equity investments in private companies are carried at cost and are adjusted for other-than-temporary declines in fair value, additional investments or distributions.

Cash Flows:

For purposes of the Consolidated
Statements of Cash Flows, the Company considers all highly liquid unrestricted instruments with a purchased maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value due to the
short maturities of these instruments.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Environmental Matters:

The Company accrues for costs associated with
the remediation of environmental pollution when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the Company’s proportionate share of the amount can be reasonably estimated. The recorded liabilities have not been discounted.

Research and Development:

Research and
development costs are expensed as incurred. The fair value of acquired in-process research and development costs is expensed as of the acquisition date if the related projects have not reached technological feasibility and were determined to have no
alternative future use.

Restructuring
charges:

Restructuring actions are recorded in accordance with SFAS No. 146, “

Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities

” (“SFAS No. 146”). In recent fiscal years, the
Company has undertaken a series of restructuring actions related to the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and the integration of its business units. In connection with these initiatives, the Company has recorded restructuring charges, as more
fully described in Note 3. Generally, costs associated with an exit or disposal activity are recognized when the liability is incurred. Costs related to employee separation arrangements requiring future service beyond a specified minimum retention
period are recognized over the service period.

Comprehensive Income (Loss):

Comprehensive income (loss) is defined as net income or loss and other changes in stockholders’ equity from transactions and other events from sources other than stockholders.
Comprehensive income (loss) is reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity and Comprehensive Income.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging:

The Company follows SFAS No. 133, “

Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities,”

as amended and interpreted, which requires that all derivatives be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives would be accounted for
depending on the use of the derivative instrument and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting.

For a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the derivative’s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income
(“OCI”) and subsequently reclassified into net earnings when the hedged exposure affects net earnings. Cash flow hedges related to anticipated transactions are designated and documented at the inception of each hedge by matching the terms
of the contract to the underlying transaction. The Company classifies the cash flows from hedging transactions in the same categories as the cash flows from the respective hedged items. Once established, cash flow hedges are generally not removed
until maturity unless an anticipated transaction is no longer likely to occur. Discontinued or dedesignated cash flow hedges are immediately settled with counterparties, and the related accumulated derivative gains or losses are recognized into net
earnings on the consolidated financial statements. Forward contract effectiveness for cash flow hedges is calculated by comparing the fair value of the contract to the change in value of the anticipated transaction using forward rates on a monthly
basis. The Company also has entered into foreign currency forward contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes. These contracts are recorded at fair value, with the changes in fair value recognized into net
earnings on the consolidated financial statements.

Recent
Issued Accounting Pronouncements:

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,

“Fair Value Measurements”

(“SFAS No. 157”). SFAS No. 157 clarifies the principle that
fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability, and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions. Under the standard, fair value
measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy. The Company will be required to adopt SFAS No. 157 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008. The Company is currently evaluating the requirements of SFAS
No. 157 and has not yet determined the impact, if any, of its adoption on its consolidated financial statements.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,

“The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities”

(“SFAS No. 159”). SFAS No. 159 provides entities with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value, with the objective to reduce both the complexity in accounting for



financial instruments, and the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently. The Company will be required to adopt
SFAS No. 159 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008. The Company has evaluated the requirements of SFAS No. 159 and has determined the impact of its adoption on its consolidated financial statements to be immaterial.

In March 2007, the FASB ratified Emerging Issues Task Force
(“EITF”) Issue No. 06-10,

“Accounting for Collateral Assignment Split-Dollar Life Insurance Agreements”

(“EITF No. 06-10”). EITF No. 06-10 provides guidance for determining a liability for the
post-retirement benefit obligation as well as recognition and measurement of the associated asset on the basis of the terms of the collateral assignment agreement. The Company will be required to adopt EITF No. 06-10 in the first quarter of
fiscal year 2008. The Company is currently evaluating the requirements of EITF No. 06-10 and has not yet determined the impact, if any, of its adoption on its consolidated financial statements.

In June 2007, the FASB ratified EITF Issue No. 07-3,

“Accounting
for Nonrefundable Advance Payments for Goods or Services Received for Use in Future Research and Development Activities”

(“EITF No. 07-3”). EITF No. 07-3 requires that nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services
that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities be deferred, capitalized and recognized as an expense as the goods are delivered or the related services are performed. The Company will be required to adopt EITF
No. 07-3, on a prospective basis, in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008. The Company is currently evaluating the requirements of EITF No. 07-3 and has not yet determined the impact, if any, of its adoption on its consolidated financial
statements.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS
No. 141 (revised 2007),

“Business Combinations”

(“SFAS No. 141(R)”). SFAS No. 141(R) establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the
identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree, and the goodwill acquired. SFAS No. 141(R) also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects
of the business combination. The Company will be required to adopt SFAS No. 141(R) in the first quarter of fiscal year 2009. The Company is currently evaluating the requirements of SFAS No. 141(R) and has not yet determined the impact of
its adoption on its consolidated financial statements.

In
December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, “

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements—an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51”

(“SFAS No. 160”). SFAS No. 160
establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent, the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest, changes in a
parent’s ownership interest, and the valuation of retained noncontrolling equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. SFAS No. 160 also establishes disclosure requirements that clearly identify and distinguish between the
interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners. The Company will be required to adopt SFAS No. 160 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2009. The Company is currently evaluating the requirements of SFAS No. 160 and
has not yet determined the impact, if any, of its adoption on its consolidated financial statements.

Note 2:

Acquisitions

Acquisition of Newborn Metabolic Screening Business from Pediatrix Medical Group, Inc.

In December 2007, the Company entered
into an agreement to acquire the outstanding stock of Pediatrix Screening, Inc., which constitutes the newborn metabolic screening (“NMS”) business of Pediatrix Medical Group, Inc. The NMS business provides neonatal screening and
consultative services to hospitals, medical groups and various states. This acquisition is intended to expand the Company’s capabilities to supply state laboratories and other agencies with comprehensive newborn screening solutions. This
transaction is expected to close during the first quarter of 2008.

Acquisition of ViaCell, Inc.

In November 2007, the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary completed a tender offer for all of the outstanding shares of common stock of ViaCell, Inc. (“ViaCell”), at a
price of $7.25 per share. ViaCell specializes in the collection, testing, processing and preservation of umbilical cord blood stem



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

cells. Through the tender offer, the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary acquired more than 90% of the outstanding shares of common stock of ViaCell. The
Company acquired the remaining outstanding shares of ViaCell by means of a merger of its wholly owned subsidiary with and into ViaCell, as a result of which ViaCell became the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary. The addition of ViaCell’s
ViaCord

®

product offering for the preservation of umbilical cord blood, and its sales and marketing organization, is expected to facilitate the expansion of the Company’s neonatal and
prenatal businesses. Aggregate consideration for this transaction was approximately $295.8 million in cash, which excludes $31.8 million in acquired cash. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets has been
allocated to goodwill, none of which is tax deductible.

Following the ViaCell acquisition, the Company committed to a preliminary plan of integration of certain ViaCell activities that included workforce reductions. As of December 30, 2007, the Company recorded $1.2 million of severance
liabilities with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue No. 95-3,

“Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Business

Combination”

(“EITF 95-3”). The Company had not finalized the preliminary integration plan as of December 30, 2007, but expects to complete the plan no later than one year from the date of acquisition. The following table is a summary of these
liabilities:

Following the ViaCell acquisition, the Company’s Board approved a plan to sell the ViaCyte

SM

and Cellular
Therapy Technology businesses that were acquired with ViaCell. The ViaCyte

SM

business focuses on the development of a proprietary media intended for
the cryopreservation of human unfertilized oocytes. The Cellular Therapy Technology business focuses on the development of therapeutic uses of unrestricted somatic stem cells derived from umbilical cord blood, including the areas of cancer,
cardiac disease and diabetes. The Company has determined that both businesses do not strategically fit with the other products offered by the Life and Analytical Sciences segment. The Company also determined that without investing capital into the
operations of both businesses, it could not effectively compete in the marketplace with larger companies which focus on the market for such products. The Company is actively marketing and is currently committed to a plan to sell both of these
businesses. The Company has classified the results of the ViaCyte

SM

and Cellular Therapy Technology businesses as discontinued operations in
the accompanying financial statements. Summary operating results of the discontinued operations were as follows:

Acquisition of
Various Intangible Assets and Investments.

In 2007, the Company acquired various licenses, other intangible assets and investments for aggregate consideration of approximately $8.8 million in

cash. Included in this amount are a customer list for reagents for approximately $4.8 million, and a call option to purchase the assets and
liabilities of a company for approximately $1.2 million, each purchased during the fourth quarter of 2007. In addition, the Company entered into various long-term license agreements during 2007 for

approximately $2.8 million. Purchased
intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives based upon the economic value. See Note 13, below, for additional details.

Acquisition of remaining minority interest of PerkinElmer India Pvt. Ltd.

In June 2007, the Company acquired the remaining
minority interest in PerkinElmer India Pvt. Ltd. (“PKI India”), a direct sales, service and marketing operation targeting India’s life science and analytical instrumentation markets, from Labindia Instruments Pvt. Ltd. The acquisition
establishes PKI India as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Consideration for this transaction was approximately $1.3 million in cash plus potential additional consideration of approximately $0.7 million, of which the Company paid $0.2
million during the fiscal year 2007. The Company expects to pay the remaining $0.5 million in quarterly installments through the first quarter of 2008. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets has been
allocated to goodwill, none of which is tax deductible.

Acquisition of Improvision Ltd.

In March 2007, the Company acquired the stock of Improvision Ltd. (“Improvision”), a leading provider of cellular imaging software and integrated hardware solutions
used in life sciences research. The Company expects that the addition of Improvision’s imaging and analysis software to the Company’s high content screening systems will provide customers with powerful imaging solutions for analyzing
cellular events, from real-time imaging of live cells to rapid high content screening of multiple samples. Consideration for this transaction was approximately $23.6 million in cash plus potential additional contingent consideration, which
management expects to be immaterial to the Company. During 2007, the Company paid $0.6 million for net working capital adjustments. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets has been allocated to goodwill, none
of which is tax deductible.

Acquisition of Euroscreen Products S.A.

In January 2007, the Company acquired the stock of Euroscreen Products S.A. (“Euroscreen”), a developer of the AequoScreen

™

cellular assay platform. The AequoScreen

higher quality data, while reducing the number of false positives in G protein-coupled receptor (“GPCR”) screening applications. Consideration for this transaction was approximately $18.1 million in cash. The excess of the purchase price
over the fair value of the acquired net assets has been allocated to goodwill, none of which is tax deductible.

Acquisition of Evotec Technologies GmbH.

In January 2007, the Company acquired the stock of Evotec Technologies GmbH
(“Evotec”). The acquisition is intended to allow the Company to provide its customers in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and academic arenas with Evotec’s high content screening instruments and software. These analysis tools
determine the composition of cells and cell structure, a critical step in moving potential drug targets quickly through the discovery process. Consideration for this transaction was approximately $33.0 million in cash, which was paid in fiscal year
2006. During 2007, the Company received $1.2 million for net working capital adjustments. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets has been allocated to goodwill, none of which is tax deductible.

Acquisition of Dynamic Mechanical Analysis Product Line from Triton

Acquisition of Avalon Instruments Limited.

In September 2006, the
Company acquired the stock of Avalon Instruments Limited (“Avalon”). The acquisition of Avalon expands and complements the Company’s molecular spectroscopy product portfolio by adding a family of innovative bench-top dispersive Raman
spectrometers. Raman spectroscopy identifies and characterizes the composition of both organic and inorganic materials in a wide range of applications. Consideration for this transaction was approximately $5.3 million in cash plus potential
additional contingent consideration, which management expects to be immaterial to the Company. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets has been allocated to goodwill, none of which is tax deductible.

Acquisition of J.N. Macri Technologies LLC and NTD Laboratories, Inc.

In July 2006, the Company acquired specified assets and assumed specified liabilities of J.N. Macri Technologies LLC
(“Macri”) and acquired the stock of NTD Laboratories, Inc. (“NTD”). The Company acquired Macri’s global patents related to free beta Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (“free Beta hCG”). Free Beta hCG is a peptide
hormone produced in the early stage of pregnancy that is widely recognized as an important biomarker for first-trimester prenatal risk assessment. NTD is a laboratory specializing in prenatal risk assessment and offers laboratory-developed and
validated testing under the brand name UltraScreen

®

, of which free Beta hCG is an important component. Aggregate consideration for these transactions was approximately $56.65 million
in cash. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets has been allocated to goodwill. None of the goodwill related to the NTD acquisition is tax deductible and all of the goodwill related to the Macri acquisition
is tax deductible.

Acquisition of Clinical &
Analytical Service Solutions Ltd.

In June 2006, the Company acquired the stock of Clinical & Analytical Service Solutions Ltd. (“C&A”), a scientific equipment asset and managed maintenance company
serving the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and healthcare markets. Consideration for the transaction was approximately $16.0 million in cash plus potential additional contingent consideration, which management expects to be immaterial to the
Company. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets has been allocated to goodwill, none of which is tax deductible.

Acquisition of Spectral Genomics, Inc.

In April 2006, the Company acquired specified assets and assumed specified
liabilities of Spectral Genomics, Inc. (“Spectral”), a leader in molecular karyotyping technology used to evaluate chromosomal abnormalities. Consideration for the transaction was approximately $14.0 million in cash plus potential
additional contingent consideration, which management expects to be immaterial to the Company. The Company will make royalty payments based on future sales to license additional intellectual property rights from a third party. The excess of the
purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets has been allocated to goodwill, all of which is tax deductible.

Acquisition of Agilix Corporation.

In February 2006, the Company acquired specified assets of Agilix Corporation
(“Agilix”) for approximately $8.7 million in cash. Assets acquired primarily relate to Agilix’s core technology which centers around labeling technology using isobaric mass tags that allow for the simultaneous quantification of
molecules, such as proteins, from multiple samples. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets has been allocated to goodwill, all of which is tax deductible.

The operations for each of these acquisitions completed during 2007 and 2006
are reported within the results of the Company’s Life and Analytical Sciences segment from the acquisition date. The acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. Allocation of the purchase price for the acquisitions
was based on estimates of the fair value of the net assets acquired, and is subject to adjustment upon finalization of the purchase price allocation. The fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are
based on management’s estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. The excess purchase price over those assigned values was
recorded as goodwill. In accordance with SFAS No. 142,

“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,”

goodwill will be reviewed at least annually for impairment. Purchased



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

intangibles with finite lives will be amortized on a straight-line basis over their respective estimated useful lives, described in more detail in
Note 13.

In-process research and development
(“IPR&D”) charges represent incomplete acquired research and development projects that have not reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future use as of the acquisition date. Technological feasibility is established
when an enterprise has completed all planning, designing, coding, and testing activities that are necessary to establish that a product can be produced to meet its design specifications including functions, features, and technical performance
requirements. On the date of the acquisitions of Evotec and Euroscreen there were multiple IPR&D efforts underway at each company for certain current and future product lines. In determining the value of in-process projects, the Company
considers, among other factors, the in-process projects’ stage of completion, the complexity of the work completed as of the acquisition date, the costs already incurred, the projected costs to complete, the contribution of core technologies
and other acquired assets, the expected introduction date, and the estimated useful life of the technology. For these acquisitions, the Company utilized the discounted cash flow method to value the IPR&D, using a discount rate equivalent to the
relative risk of the asset, including the uncertainty of technological feasibility and successful launch. This approach determines fair value by estimating the after-tax cash flows attributable to an in-process project over its useful life, and then
discounting these after-tax cash flows back to a present value. For the acquisitions of Evotec and Euroscreen, the Company estimated the value of the IPR&D to be $0.2 million and $1.3 million, respectively. The Company believes that the
estimated purchased research and development amounts so determined, represent the fair value at the date of the acquisitions, and the amount represents management’s best estimate of the amount a third party would pay in the aggregate for the
projects. The fair value of acquired in-process research and development costs was expensed as of the acquisition date as the projects underway at Evotec and Euroscreen had not reached technological feasibility and were determined to have no
alternative future use.

In connection with purchase price and
related allocations, the Company estimates the fair value of deferred revenue assumed in connection with these acquisitions. The estimated fair value of deferred revenue is determined by the legal performance obligation at the date of acquisition,
and is generally based on the nature of the activities to be performed and the related costs to be incurred after consummation. The fair value of an assumed liability related to deferred revenue is estimated based on the current market cost of
fulfilling the obligation, plus a normal profit margin thereon. The estimated costs to fulfill the deferred revenue are based on the historical direct costs related to providing the services. The Company does not include any costs associated with
selling efforts, research and development, or the related fulfillment margins on these costs. In most acquisitions, profit associated with selling effort is excluded because the acquired entities would have concluded the selling effort on the
support contracts prior to the acquisition date. The estimated research and development costs are not included in the fair value determination, as these costs are not deemed to represent a legal obligation at the time of acquisition. The sum of the
costs and operating income approximates, in theory, the amount that the Company would be required to pay a third party to assume the obligation. As a result of purchase accounting, the Company recognized the deferred revenue related to the ViaCell
acquisition at fair value, and did not recognize $18.1 million of deferred revenue that would have been otherwise recorded in future periods.

As of December 30, 2007, the purchase price allocations for the Agilix, Spectral, C&A, Macri, NTD, Avalon, the DMA product line, Evotec,
Euroscreen, Improvision and PKI India acquisitions have been finalized. As of December 30, 2007, the purchase price and related allocations for the ViaCell acquisition were preliminary, and may be revised as a result of adjustments made to the
purchase price, as well as additional information regarding liabilities assumed, including contingent liabilities, deferred taxes, employee severance and facility closure costs, and revisions of preliminary estimates of fair values made at the date
of purchase. The Company is not aware of any information that indicates the final purchase price allocation will differ materially from the preliminary estimates, and the Company expects to complete any outstanding asset valuations no later than one
year from the date of acquisition.

Restructuring Charges

The Company has undertaken a series of restructuring actions related to the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and the integration of its business
units. Restructuring actions were recorded in accordance with SFAS No. 146, “

Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities”

(“SFAS No. 146”).

A description of the restructuring plans and the activity recorded are as
follows:

The purpose of the restructuring plans approved in
the first and fourth quarters of 2007, detailed below, was principally to shift resources into geographic regions and product lines that are more consistent with the Company’s growth strategy. The pre-tax restructuring activity associated with
these plans has been reported as restructuring expenses as a component of operating expenses from continuing operations. The Company expects the impact of immediate and future cost savings from these restructuring activities on operating results and
cash flows to be negligible, as the Company has incurred and will incur offsetting costs.

Q4 2007 Plan

During the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company’s management approved a plan to shift resources into geographic regions and product lines that are more consistent with the Company’s growth strategy (the “Q4 2007 Plan”).
As a result of the Q4 2007 Plan, the Company recognized a $4.8 million pre-tax restructuring charge in the Life and Analytical Sciences segment related to a workforce reduction from reorganization activities. The Company also recognized a $4.8
million pre-tax restructuring charge in the Optoelectronics segment related to a workforce reduction and the partial closure of a facility, which was offset by the recognition of a $2.2 million deferred gain from the sales-leaseback of that facility
during the fiscal year 2001. All actions related to the Q4 2007 Plan were completed by December 30, 2007.

The following table summarizes the components of the Q4 2007 Plan recognized by segment:

The following table summarizes the Q4 2007 Plan activity for 2007:

All actions related to
the Q4 2007 Plan have been completed and the Company anticipates that the remaining payments of $4.3 million for workforce reductions will be completed by the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2009, and the remaining payments of $4.3 million
for the partial facility closure will be paid through fiscal year 2022, in accordance with the terms of the lease.

Q1 2007 Plan

During the first quarter of 2007, the Company’s management approved a plan to shift resources into product lines that
are more consistent with the Company’s growth strategy. As a result of this plan, the Company recognized a pre-tax restructuring charge of $4.4 million during the first quarter of 2007 (the “Q1 2007 Plan”). The actions within the Q1
2007 Plan related to a workforce reduction resulting from reorganization activities within the Life and Analytical Sciences segment. All actions related to the Q1 2007 Plan were completed by March 30, 2007.

The following table summarizes the Q1 2007 Plan activity:

All actions related to
the Q1 2007 Plan have been completed, and the Company anticipates that the remaining payments of $1.1 million will be completed by the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008.

ViaCell Plan

Following the ViaCell acquisition, the Company committed to a preliminary plan of integration of certain ViaCell activities that included workforce
reductions. As of December 30, 2007, the Company recorded $1.2 million of severance liabilities with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue No. 95-3,

“Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Business Combination”

(“EITF 95-3”). The Company had not finalized the preliminary integration plan as of December 30, 2007, but expects to complete the plan
no later than one year from the date of acquisition. The Company anticipates that the payments of $1.2 million will be completed by the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008.

The following table summarizes the components of the ViaCell Plan activity:

Previous
Restructuring and Integration Plans

The principal
actions of these restructuring plans were workforce reductions related to the integration of the Company’s Life Sciences and Analytical Instruments businesses, which is now the Company’s Life and Analytical Sciences segment, in order to
reduce costs and achieve operational efficiencies as well as workforce



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

reductions in both the Life and Analytical Sciences and Optoelectronics segments by shifting resources into geographic regions and product lines that are
more consistent with the Company’s growth strategy. During 2007, the Company paid $0.2 million related to these plans and recorded a pre-tax restructuring reversal of $0.6 million relating to these plans, due to lower than expected employee
separation costs associated with both the Life and Analytical Sciences and Optoelectronics segments. As of December 30, 2007, the Company had approximately $2.0 million of remaining liabilities associated with 2001 to 2006 restructuring and
integration plans, primarily relating to remaining lease obligations related to closed facilities in the Life and Analytical Sciences segment. The remaining terms of these leases vary in length and will be paid through fiscal year 2014. The Company
anticipates that the remaining severance payments will be completed by the end of fiscal year 2008.

Lease Charges

To facilitate the sale of a business in 2001, the Company was required to guarantee the obligations that the buyer of the business assumed related to the
lease for the building in which the business operates. The lease obligations continue through March 2011. While the Company assigned its interest in the lease to the buyer at the time of the sale of the business, in the event the buyer defaults
under the lease, the Company is responsible for all remaining lease payments and certain other building related expenses. As an additional measure to facilitate the sale of the business, the Company obtained a letter of credit as partial security
for a loan to the buyer, which could have been drawn upon by the buyer’s lender in the event the buyer was delinquent in repayment of the loan. During the second quarter of 2007, the lessor of the building began the process to evict the buyer
as a result of unpaid lease payments and building expenses, and sought reimbursement from the Company. As a result of this action, the Company recorded a charge of $4.5 million related to payments for this lease obligation and the potential drawdown
of the letter of credit. During the third quarter of 2007, the buyer completed a recapitalization of the business with another lender. The proceeds of the recapitalization were used to pay off the remaining balance on the original securitized loan,
as well as to make certain payments to the landlord for back rent and other obligations arising under the lease. The Company was released from its obligation under the letter of credit on the original securitized loan. As a result of these actions,
the Company recorded a reversal of $1.4 million related to payments for this lease obligation and the release of the letter of credit in the third quarter of 2007. The Company is still responsible for the remaining accrual of $3.1 million, which
relates to the remaining lease and building obligations, reduced by estimated sublease rentals reasonably expected to be obtained for the property.

Note 4:

Impairment of Assets

The Company recorded a charge of $3.2 million for the impairment of assets during 2006 within the Life and Analytical Sciences segment. This impairment
included a $2.8 million loss related to a manufacturing facility, and a $0.4 million loss on impairment of a license agreement.

Income Taxes

The Company adopted FIN No. 48 effective January 1, 2007. As a result of the adoption of FIN No. 48, the Company adjusted the carrying
value of its uncertain tax positions and reduced its accrued liabilities by $3.6 million, which was accounted for as an increase to retained earnings as of January 1, 2007. As of the adoption date, the Company had gross tax effected
unrecognized tax benefits of $48.5 million, of which $36.0 million, if recognized, would affect the continuing operations effective tax rate. The remaining amount, if recognized, would affect goodwill and discontinued operations. However, upon the
adoption of SFAS No. 141(R), changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally will effect income tax expense, including those associated with acquisitions that closed prior to the
effective date of SFAS No. 141(R). The Company had accrued interest, net of tax benefits, and penalties related to the unrecognized tax benefits of $7.3 million, which is not included in the unrecognized tax benefits of $48.5 million.

The Company regularly reviews its tax positions in each significant taxing
jurisdiction in the process of evaluating its unrecognized tax benefits as required by FIN No. 48. Adjustments are made to the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits when: (i) facts and circumstances regarding a tax position change,
causing a change in management’s judgment regarding that tax position; (ii) a tax position is effectively settled with a tax authority; and/or (iii) the statute of limitations expires regarding a tax position.

The tabular reconciliation of the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits
is as follows:

In accordance with FIN
No. 48, the Company will continue to classify interest and penalties as a component of income tax expense. At December 30, 2007, the Company had accrued approximately $5.0 million and $7.8 million in interest and penalties, respectively.
During 2007, the Company recognized approximately $2.1 million and $3.4 million in interest and penalties, respectively, in its total tax provision. At December 30, 2007, the Company had gross tax effected unrecognized tax benefits of $48.6
million, of which $34.2 million, if recognized, would affect the continuing operations effective tax rate. The remaining amount, if recognized, would affect goodwill and discontinued operations. However, upon the adoption of SFAS No. 141(R), changes
in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally will effect income tax expense, including those associated with acquisitions that closed prior to the effective date of SFAS No. 141(R).

At December 30, 2007, the Company had $25.0 million of
FIN No. 48 accrued tax liabilities, including accrued interest, net of tax benefits, and penalties, which should be resolved within the next year as a result of the completion of audits that, depending on the ultimate resolution, could affect
the continuing operations effective tax rate; however, the Company cannot quantify an estimated range at this time. The Company is subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax of multiple state and foreign jurisdictions. The Company
has

jurisdictions.

The tax effects of temporary differences and attributes that gave rise to deferred income tax assets and liabilities as of December 30, 2007 and
December 31, 2006 were as follows:

At December 30,
2007, the Company had state net operating loss carryforwards of $229.6 million, foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $167.9 million, state tax credit carryforwards of $3.6 million and foreign tax credit carryforwards of $13.4
million—subject to expiration in years ranging from 2008 to 2026, and without expiration for certain foreign net operating loss carryforwards and certain state credit carryforwards. At December 30, 2007, the Company also had U.S. federal
net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $112.5 million and federal credit carryforwards of approximately $3.6 million as a result of acquisitions made during 2006 and 2007. The utilization of these losses and credits is subject to annual
limitations based on



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. These losses and credits will expire in 2008 through 2026. Valuation allowances generally
take into consideration limitations imposed upon the use of the tax attributes and reduce the value of such items to the likely net realizable amount. Based on the judgment of the Company, and consistent with prior years, full valuation allowances
have been established against these tax attributes with the exception of the acquired federal net operating loss carryforwards, certain foreign net operating loss carryforwards and the federal research and experimental tax credit carryforwards that
have been determined to be more likely than not to be realized. The tax benefit of the reversal of the valuation allowance associated with the Company’s research and experimental credits was reported as part of the gain on disposal of
discontinued operations in 2005. Included in the foreign tax credit carryforwards and corresponding valuation allowance of $13.4 million are $8.3 million of credits which, if utilized, will result in a credit to equity rather than a reduction of the
income tax provision.

Current deferred tax assets of $45.9
million and $32.1 million were included in other current assets at December 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively. Long-term deferred tax assets of $7.2 million and $3.0 million were included in other assets at December 30,
2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively. Long-term deferred tax liabilities of $67.6 million and $82.8 million were included in other long-term liabilities at December 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively. Additionally, $10.8
million of net deferred tax liabilities are recorded through other comprehensive income, primarily as a result of the adoption of FASB Statement No. 158 in 2006.

The Company generally considers all earnings generated outside of the United States to be permanently reinvested offshore.
Pursuant to APB Opinion No. 23 and related interpretations with respect to corporate earnings permanently reinvested offshore, the Company therefore does not accrue U.S. tax for the repatriation of its foreign earnings it considers to be
permanently reinvested outside the United States. However, the Company regularly reviews its global cash needs and may repatriate foreign earnings when necessary, and when these earnings can be distributed in cash and in a tax efficient manner. As
of December 30, 2007, the amount of foreign earnings for which no U.S. tax cost has been provided was approximately $342.0 million. The U.S. tax cost has not been determined due to the fact that it is not practicable to do so at this time.

During 2005, the Internal Revenue Service concluded its audit
of federal income taxes for the years 1999 through 2002. There was a single open issue related to this audit which the Company favorably resolved during the fourth quarter of 2007. The Company is also under regular examination by tax authorities in
the United States and other countries (such as China, Indonesia, Philippines and the United Kingdom) in which the Company has significant business operations. The tax years under examination vary by jurisdiction.

Note 7:

Discontinued Operations

As part of its continuing efforts to focus on higher growth opportunities, the Company has discontinued certain businesses. The Company has accounted for
these businesses as discontinued operations in accordance with SFAS No. 144, “

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,

” and, accordingly, has presented the results of operations and related cash flows as
discontinued operations for all periods presented. The assets and liabilities of these businesses have been presented separately, and are reflected within the assets and liabilities from discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets as of December 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006.

Following the ViaCell acquisition in November 2007, the Company’s Board approved a plan to sell the ViaCyte

SM

and Cellular Therapy Technology businesses that were acquired with ViaCell. The ViaCyte

SM

business focuses on the development of a proprietary
media intended for the cryopreservation of human unfertilized oocytes. The Cellular Therapy Technology business focuses on the development of therapeutic uses of unrestricted somatic stem cells derived from umbilical cord blood, including the
areas of cancer, cardiac disease and diabetes. The Company has determined that both businesses do not strategically fit with the other products offered by the Life and Analytical Sciences segment. The Company also determined that without investing
capital into the operations of both businesses, it could not effectively compete in the marketplace with larger companies who focus on the market for such products. The Company is actively marketing and is currently committed to a plan to sell both
of these businesses. The Company has classified the results of the ViaCyte

SM

and Cellular Therapy Technology businesses as discontinued
operations in the accompanying financial statements.

In
September 2005, the Company’s Board approved a plan to divest its Fluid Sciences segment. The Fluid Sciences segment consisted of three businesses—Aerospace, Fluid Testing and Semiconductor. In November 2005, the Company sold the Fluid
Testing division for approximately $34.5 million, resulting in a net pre-tax gain of $30.3 million. In December 2005, the Company sold the Aerospace business for approximately $333.0 million, resulting in a net pre-tax gain of $250.6 million. These
gains were recognized during fiscal 2005 as gains on the dispositions of discontinued operations. The Company received total cash proceeds in these transactions of approximately $360.0 million. During 2006, the Company finalized the net working
capital adjustments associated with the sales of these businesses, settled a claim related to an employee benefit program, and ceased future benefit accruals to a postretirement medical plan. In 2006, these actions resulted in the recognition of a
gain of $0.5 million and a loss of $0.2 million relative to the Aerospace business and the Fluid Testing business, respectively. In February 2006, the Company sold substantially all of the assets of its Semiconductor business for approximately $26.5
million, subject to a net working capital adjustment, plus potential additional contingent consideration. A pre-tax gain of $3.8 million, exclusive of additional contingent consideration, was recognized in 2006. During 2007, the Company settled an
additional commitment associated with a benefit program relating to the divestiture of the Fluid Sciences segment and recognized a pre-tax loss of $1.1 million.

During 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company settled various commitments related to the divestiture of other discontinued operations and recognized a
pre-tax gain of $0.2 million in 2007, a pre-tax loss of $0.7 million in 2006, and a pre-tax gain of $1.4 million in 2005. During 2007 and 2006, the Company substantially completed

the remediation of an environmental matter within the Lithography business, resulting in recognition of pre-tax losses of $0.7 million in 2007 and $1.7
million in 2006. In addition, the Company received proceeds of $0.5 million upon the sale of the Lithography business, and recognized a pre-tax loss of $3.3 million during fiscal 2005. Also in fiscal year 2005, the completion of the shutdown of the
Fiber Optics Test Equipment business resulted in a pre-tax loss of $5.2 million related to lease and severance costs and the reduction of fixed assets and inventory to net realizable value.

Summary operating results of the discontinued operations for the periods
prior to disposition were as follows:

Earnings per Share

Basic earnings per share was computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period less restricted
unvested shares. Diluted earnings per share was computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding plus all potentially dilutive common stock equivalents, primarily shares issuable upon the exercise of stock
options using the treasury stock method. The following table reconciles the number of shares utilized in the earnings per share calculations:

Antidilutive
securities include outstanding stock options with exercise prices and average unrecognized compensation cost in excess of the average fair market value of common stock for the related period. Antidilutive options were excluded from the calculation

Accounts Receivable

Accounts receivable were net of reserves for doubtful accounts of $16.2 million and $12.2 million as of December 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006,
respectively.

During 2001, the Company established a wholly
owned consolidated subsidiary to maintain a receivables purchase agreement with a third party financial institution. Under this arrangement, the Company sold, on a revolving basis, certain of the Company’s accounts receivable balances to the
consolidated subsidiary which simultaneously sold an undivided percentage ownership interest in designated pools of receivables to a third-party financial institution. As collections reduce the balance of sold accounts receivable, new receivables
are sold. The Company’s consolidated subsidiary retains the risk of credit loss on the receivables. Accordingly, the full amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts has been provided for on the Company’s balance sheet. The amount of
receivables sold and outstanding with the third party financial institution may not exceed $65.0 million. Under the terms of this arrangement, the Company’s consolidated subsidiary retains collection and administrative responsibilities for the
balances. The amount of receivables sold to the consolidated subsidiary was $79.0 million as of December 30, 2007 and $67.8 million as of December 31, 2006. At each of December 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006, an undivided
interest of $45.0 million in the receivables had been sold to the third party financial institution under this arrangement. The remaining interest in receivables of $34.0 million and $22.8 million that were sold to and held by the consolidated
subsidiary were included in accounts receivable in the consolidated financial statements at December 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively.

The agreement requires the third-party financial institution to be paid interest during the period from the date the receivable is sold to its maturity
date. At December 30, 2007, the effective interest rate was LIBOR plus approximately 80 basis points. The servicing fees received constitute adequate compensation for services performed. No servicing asset or liability is therefore recorded.
The agreement also includes conditions that require the Company to maintain a senior unsecured credit rating of BB or above, as defined by Standard & Poor’s Rating Services, and Ba2 or above, as defined by Moody’s Investors
Service. At December 30, 2007, the Company had a senior unsecured credit rating of BBB, with a stable outlook from Standard & Poor’s Rating Services, and of Baa3, with a stable outlook from Moody’s Investors Service. In
January 2008, the Company’s consolidated subsidiary entered into an agreement to extend the term of the accounts receivable securitization facility to January 23, 2009.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

Goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing using the guidance and criteria described in SFAS No. 142,

“Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets.”

The impairment test consists of a two-step process. The first step is the comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if the carrying value exceeds the fair value. The second step measures
the amount of an impairment loss, and is only performed if the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value of the reporting unit. The annual impairment assessment is performed by the Company on the later of January 1 or the first day of each
fiscal year. This same impairment test will be performed at other times during the course of the year should an event occur which suggests that the recoverability of goodwill should be reconsidered. The Company completed the annual impairment test
using a measurement date of December 31, 2007 and January 1, 2007, and concluded based on the first step of the process that there was no goodwill impairment.

Amended Senior Unsecured Credit Facility.

On August 13, 2007, the Company entered into an amended and restated senior unsecured revolving credit facility. The agreement for the
facility provides for a $500.0 million committed unsecured revolving credit facility through August 13, 2012, and amends and restates in its entirety the senior credit agreement dated as of October 31, 2005. The agreement contains an
option to increase the facility up to $650.0 million. Letters of credit in the aggregate amount of approximately $15.0 million were issued under the previous facility, which are treated as issued under the amended facility. The Company uses the
amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes, which may include working capital, refinancing existing indebtedness, capital expenditures, share repurchases, acquisitions and strategic alliances. The interest
rates under the amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility are based on the Eurocurrency rate at the time of borrowing plus a margin or the base rate from time to time. The base rate is the higher of (1) the corporate base rate
announced from time to time by Bank of America, N.A. and (2) the Federal Funds rate plus 50 basis points. The Company may allocate all or a portion of its indebtedness under the amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility to interest
based upon the Eurocurrency rate plus a margin or the base rate. The Eurocurrency margin as of December 30, 2007 was 40 basis points. The weighted average Eurocurrency interest rate as of December 30, 2007 was 4.86%, resulting in a
weighted average effective Eurocurrency rate, including the margin, of 5.26%. The Company had drawn down approximately $216.0 million of borrowings in U.S. Dollars under the facility as of December 30, 2007, with interest based on the above
described Eurocurrency rate. The agreement for the facility contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants and events of default customary for financings of this type and those contained in the Company’s previous senior revolving credit
agreement. The financial covenants in its amended and restated senior unsecured revolving credit facility include debt-to-capital ratios and a contingent maximum total leverage ratio, applicable if the Company’s credit rating is down-graded
below investment grade. The financial covenants in its previous senior revolving credit agreement included interest coverage and debt-to-EBITDA ratios. At all times during 2007, the Company was in compliance with all applicable covenants.

Prior to February 28, 2008, the Company exercised the
option to increase the amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility to $608.8 million. The Company had borrowed approximately $216.0 million in U.S. Dollars under the facility as of February 28, 2008, with interest based on the above
described Eurocurrency rate.

On November 14, 2007, the Company entered into a $300.0 million unsecured interim credit facility. The Company entered into this unsecured interim credit facility in order to pay the purchase price and transactional expenses of
the ViaCell acquisition. This interim credit facility matures on March 31, 2008, at which point all amounts outstanding are due in full. The interest rates for this interim credit facility are based on either the Eurocurrency rate at the time
of borrowing plus a margin, or on the base rate as in effect from time to time. The base rate is the higher of (1) the corporate base rate announced from time to time by Bank of America, N.A. and (2) the Federal Funds rate plus 50 basis
points. The Company may allocate all or a portion of its indebtedness under this interim credit facility to interest based upon either the Eurocurrency rate plus a margin or the base rate. The Eurocurrency margin for this interim credit facility as
of December 30, 2007 was 62.5 basis points. The applicable Eurocurrency margin will increase by 12.5 basis points from and after January 1, 2008 for all outstanding borrowings. The weighted average Eurocurrency interest rate as of
December 30, 2007 was 5.03%, resulting in a weighted average effective Eurocurrency rate, including the margin, of 5.65%. The Company had drawn down approximately $300.0 million of borrowings in U.S. Dollars under the facility as of
December 30, 2007, with interest based on the above described Eurocurrency rate. The agreement for this facility contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants and events of default customary for financings of this type, and are
consistent with those contained in the agreement for the Company’s amended unsecured revolving credit facility, which is described above.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company anticipates using the amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility to settle any
outstanding amounts on the unsecured interim credit facility in March 2008, and have accordingly classified the $300.0 million of outstanding borrowings on the unsecured interim credit facility as long-term debt.

The following table summarizes the maturities of the Company’s
indebtedness at December 30, 2007:

*

Prior to February 28, 2008, the Company exercised the option to increase the senior unsecured revolving credit facility to $608.8 million. The Company anticipates using funds from
the amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility, including the option exercised during the first quarter of 2008 to increase the facility to $608.8 million, to settle any outstanding amounts on the unsecured interim credit facility in March
2008, and have accordingly classified the $300.0 million of outstanding borrowings on the unsecured interim credit facility as long-term debt.

Note 16:

Employee Benefit Plans

The Company adopted the balance sheet recognition requirements of SFAS No. 158 on December 31, 2006, which required the Company to recognize a
net liability or asset and an offsetting adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income to report the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. The incremental effect of adopting SFAS No. 158 on
individual line items in the consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2006 is shown below:

Savings
Plan:

The Company has a savings plan for the benefit of qualified United States (U.S.) employees. Under this plan, for Life and Analytical Sciences and corporate employees, the Company contributes an amount equal to the
lesser of 100% of the employee’s voluntary contribution or 5.0% of the employee’s annual compensation up to applicable Internal Revenue Service limits. For Optoelectronics employees, the Company contributes an amount equal to the lesser of
55% of the amount of the employee’s voluntary contribution or 3.3% of the employee’s annual compensation up to applicable Internal Revenue Service limits. Savings plan expense was $7.8 million in 2007, $7.6 million in 2006 and $8.3 million
in 2005.

Pension Plans:

The
Company has a defined benefit pension plan covering some U.S. employees and non-U.S. pension plans for some non-U.S. employees. The principal U.S. defined benefit pension plan was closed to new hires effective January 31, 2001, and benefits for
those employed by the Company’s former Life Sciences businesses within the Company’s Life and Analytical Sciences segment were frozen as of that date. Plan benefits were frozen as of March 2003 for those employed by the Company’s
former Analytical Instruments business within its Life and Analytical Sciences segment and corporate employees. The plans provide benefits that are based on an employee’s years of service and compensation near retirement. During 2007, the
Company merged a de minimus U.S. plan into the principal U.S. defined benefit pension plan, and accordingly the disclosure for 2007 and 2006, below, has been updated to include the benefit obligations and plan assets of this de minimus U.S. plan.

Net periodic pension cost included the following components:

The following table sets forth the changes in the funded status of the principal U.S. pension plan
and the principal non-U.S. pension plans and the amounts recognized in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets as of December 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company also sponsors a supplemental executive retirement plan to provide senior management with
benefits in excess of normal pension benefits. Effective July 31, 2000, this plan was closed to new entrants. At December 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006, the projected benefit obligations were $19.2 million and $19.7 million,
respectively. Assets with a fair value of $0.2 million and $0.7 million, segregated in a trust (which is included in marketable securities and investments on the consolidated balance sheets), were available to meet this obligation as of
December 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively. Pension expense for this plan was approximately $1.9 million in 2007, $2.0 million in 2006 and $1.8 million in 2005.

Assets of the defined benefit pension plans are primarily equity and debt securities. Asset allocation at December 30,
2007 and December 31, 2006, and target asset allocations for fiscal 2008, are as follows:

The Company maintains
target allocation percentages among various asset classes based on investment policies established for the pension plans which are designed to maximize the total rate of return (income and appreciation) after inflation within the limits of prudent
risk taking, while providing for adequate near-term liquidity for benefit payments. The Company’s expected returns on assets assumptions are derived from management’s estimates, as well as other information compiled by management,
including studies that utilize customary procedures and techniques. The studies include a review of anticipated future long-term performance of individual asset classes and consideration of the appropriate asset allocation strategy given the
anticipated requirements of the plans to determine the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested to provide for the pension plans benefits. While the study gives appropriate consideration to recent fund performance and historical
returns, the assumption is primarily a long-term, prospective rate.

The Company does not expect to make any contributions to the U.S. pension plan during fiscal 2008. With respect to non-U.S. plans, the Company expects to contribute approximately $12.2 million in 2008.

The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as
appropriate, are expected to be paid as follows:



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The estimated amount that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income into net
periodic benefit cost in 2008 is as follows:

Postretirement
Medical Plans:

The Company provides healthcare benefits for eligible retired U.S. employees under a comprehensive major medical plan or under health maintenance organizations where available. The majority of the
Company’s U.S. employees become eligible for retiree health benefits if they retire directly from the Company and have at least ten years of service. Generally, the major medical plan pays stated percentages of covered expenses after a
deductible is met and takes into consideration payments by other group coverage and by Medicare. The plan requires retiree contributions under most circumstances and has provisions for cost-sharing charges. Effective January 1, 2000, this plan
was closed to new hires. For employees retiring after 1991, the Company has capped its medical premium contribution based on employees’ years of service. The Company funds the amount allowable under a 401(h) provision in the Company’s
defined benefit pension plan. Assets of the plan are primarily equity and debt securities.

Net periodic postretirement medical benefit credit included the following components:

*

The Company ceased future benefit accruals to its existing postretirement medical plan as part of the divesture of its Fluid Sciences segment, which was completed in February 2006.
In connection with this action, the Company recorded curtailment gains of approximately $1.8 million during fiscal year 2006 to discontinued operations.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company maintains a Master Trust for plan assets related to the U.S. defined benefit plans and
the U.S. postretirement medical plan. Accordingly, investment policies, target asset allocations and actual asset allocations are the same as those disclosed for the U.S. defined benefit plans.

The Company does not expect to make any contributions to the postretirement
medical plan during 2008.

The following benefit payments,
which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid as follows:

The estimated amount
that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic benefit cost in 2008 is as follows:

Deferred
Compensation Plans:

During 1998, the Company implemented a nonqualified deferred compensation plan that provides benefits payable to officers and certain key employees or their designated beneficiaries at specified future
dates, or upon retirement or death. Benefit payments under the plan are funded by contributions from participants, and for certain participants, contributions are funded by the Company. The obligations related to the deferred compensation plan
totaled $3.1 million and $5.4 million at December 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively.

Note 17:

Settlement of Insurance Claim

During the second quarter of 2007, the Company settled an insurance claim resulting from a fire that occurred within its Life and Analytical Sciences
facility in Boston, Massachusetts in March 2005. As a result of that settlement, the Company recorded gains of $15.3 million during the second quarter of 2007. The Company received the final settlement payment of $21.5 million in June 2007, and had
previously received during 2005 and 2006 a total of $35.0 million in advance payments towards costs incurred and for building, inventory and equipment damages. Of the $56.5 million in total settlement proceeds received by the Company, $25.6 million
related to reimbursement of costs incurred; $23.7 million related to damages to the building, inventory and equipment; and $7.2 million related to business interruption costs which were recorded as reductions to cost of sales and selling, general
and administrative expenses.

During the second quarter of
2007, the Company accrued $9.7 million representing its management’s estimate of the total cost for decommissioning the building, including environmental matters. The Company paid $3.9 million during fiscal year 2007 towards decommissioning the
building, and anticipates that the remaining payments of $5.8 million will be completed by the end of fiscal year 2008.

Note 18:

Contingencies

The Company is conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at current and former locations of the Company and, along with
other companies, has been named a potentially responsible party (“PRP”) for certain waste disposal sites. The Company accrues for environmental issues in the accounting period that the Company’s responsibility is established and when
the cost can be reasonably estimated. The Company has accrued $4.2 million as of December 30, 2007, which represents management’s estimate of the total cost of ultimate disposition of known environmental matters. Such amount is not
discounted and does not reflect the recovery of any amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements. These cost estimates are subject to a number of variables, including the stage of the environmental investigations, the magnitude of the
possible contamination, the nature of the potential remedies, possible joint and several liability, the time period over which remediation may occur, and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations. For sites where the Company has been
named a PRP, management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute. The Company expects that the majority of such accrued amounts could be paid out over a
period of up to ten years. As assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site, these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available. There have been no environmental problems to
date that have had or are expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. While it is possible that a loss exceeding the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial
statements may be incurred, the potential exposure is not expected to be materially different from those amounts recorded.

In papers dated October 23, 2002, Enzo Biochem, Inc. and Enzo Life Sciences, Inc. (collectively, “Enzo”) filed a complaint in the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Civil Action No. 02-8448, against Amersham plc, Amersham BioSciences, PerkinElmer, Inc., PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Inc., Sigma-Aldrich Corporation, Sigma Chemical Company, Inc.,
Molecular Probes, Inc., and Orchid BioSciences, Inc. The complaint alleges that the Company has breached its distributorship and settlement agreements with Enzo, infringed Enzo’s patents, engaged in unfair competition and fraud, and committed
torts against Enzo by, among other things, engaging in commercial development and exploitation of Enzo’s patented products and technology, separately and together with the other defendants. Enzo seeks injunctive and monetary relief. In 2003,
the court severed the lawsuit and ordered Enzo to serve individual complaints against the five defendants. The Company subsequently filed an answer and a counterclaim alleging that Enzo’s patents are invalid. In July 2006, the court issued a
decision regarding the construction of the claims in Enzo’s patents that effectively limited the coverage of certain of those claims and, the Company believes, excludes certain of the Company’s products from the coverage of Enzo’s
patents. Summary judgment motions were filed by the defendants in January 2007, and a hearing with oral argument on those motions took place in July 2007, but a decision on those motions has not been rendered, and a trial date has not been set.

On
October 17, 2003, Amersham Biosciences Corp. filed a complaint, which was subsequently amended, in the United States District Court for New Jersey, Civil Action No. 03-4901, seeking injunctive and monetary relief against a subsidiary of
the Company and alleging that the Company’s ViewLux

™

and certain of its Image FlashPlate

™

products infringe three of
Amersham’s patents related to high-throughput screening (the “NJ case”). On August 18, 2004, Amersham plc filed a complaint against two of the Company’s United Kingdom-based subsidiaries in the Patent Court of the English
High Court of Justice, Case No. 04C02688, alleging that the Company’s same products infringe one corresponding Amersham patent in the United Kingdom, which was granted in August 2004 (the “UK case”). On October 29, 2003, the
Company filed a complaint, which was subsequently amended, seeking injunctive and monetary relief against Amersham in the United States District Court for Massachusetts, Civil Action No. 03-12098, alleging that Amersham’s IN Cell Analyzer,
and LEADseeker

™

Multimodality Imaging system and certain Cyclic AMP and IP3 assays infringe two of the Company’s patents related to high-throughput screening (the “MA
case”). After a trial in the UK case in December 2005, the court ruled in February 2006 that Amersham’s patent in question was invalid in the United



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Kingdom and awarded costs to the Company. Amersham initiated an appeal of the ruling in the UK case but withdrew that appeal in January 2007. In May 2006,
the court in the NJ case issued a decision regarding the construction of the claims in Amersham’s patents that adopted many of Amersham’s claim construction positions. The parties entered into a settlement agreement in November 2007 to
resolve all of the foregoing matters.

In 2002, PharmaStem
Therapeutics, Inc. (“PharmaStem”) filed suit against ViaCell, Inc., which is now a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and several other defendants in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, alleging infringement
of United States Patents No. 5,004,681 and No. 5,192,553, relating to certain aspects of the collection, cryopreservation and storage of hematopoietic stem cells and progenitor cells from umbilical cord blood (“PharmaStem I”).
After several years of proceedings at the District Court level, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit issued a decision in July 2007 that ViaCell did not infringe these two patents and that the two patents are invalid.
PharmaStem filed a certiorari petition in January 2008 seeking to have the United States Supreme Court review the appellate court’s decision as to the invalidity of the patents, but did not seek any further review of the non-infringement
decision. PharmaStem had also filed a second complaint against ViaCell and other defendants in July 2004 in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, alleging infringement of United States Patents No. 6,461,645 and
6,569,427, which also relate to certain aspects of the collection, cryopreservation and storage of hematopoietic stem cells and progenitor cells from umbilical cord blood (“PharmaStem II”). The Company believes that the issues presented in
PharmaStem II, which was subsequently consolidated in the District of Delaware with similar cases brought by PharmaStem against other family cord blood banks, are substantially the same as the issues presented in PharmaStem I, and that ViaCell does
not infringe the patents at issue in the second case and that those patents are invalid for the same reasons as cited by the Court of Appeals in PharmaStem I. The Delaware court granted ViaCell’s motion in October 2005 to stay the proceedings
in PharmaStem II pending the outcome of PharmaStem I and a decision from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“U.S. PTO”) on certain patent re-examination issues. Although the U.S. PTO had previously issued notice of its intent
to allow the remaining claims of all of the patents, the U.S. PTO subsequently decided to begin the process of re-examining each patent. ViaCell has informed the Delaware Court overseeing PharmaStem II of the status of the re-examinations and that
the Federal Circuit had ruled in its favor in the PharmaStem I case. The Delaware Court has yet to take any action in response to these notices.

The Company believes it has meritorious defenses to these lawsuits and other proceedings, and it is contesting the actions vigorously in all of the above
unresolved matters. The Company is currently unable, however, to reasonably estimate the amount of loss, if any, that may result from the resolution of these matters, or to determine whether resolution of any of these matters will have a material
adverse impact on its consolidated financial statements.

The
Company is also subject to various other claims, legal proceedings and investigations covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of its business activities. Although, the Company has established accruals for potential losses
that it believes are probable and reasonably estimable, in the opinion of the Company’s management, based on its review of the information available at this time, the total cost of resolving these other contingencies at December 30, 2007,
should not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Each of these matters is subject to uncertainties, and it is possible that some of these matters may be resolved unfavorably to the Company.

Warranty Reserves

The Company provides warranty protection for certain products for periods usually ranging from one to three years beyond the date of sale. The majority of
costs associated with warranty obligations include the

results, supplemented by management’s expectations of future costs. Warranty reserves are included in “Accrued expenses” on the consolidated balance sheets. A summary of warranty reserve activity for the years ended December 30,
2007, December 31, 2006 and January 1, 2006 is as follows:

Stockholders’ Equity

Stock-Based Compensation:

The Company adopted SFAS No. 123(R),

“Share-Based Payment”

(“SFAS No. 123(R)”) on January 2, 2006. Prior to
January 2, 2006, the Company accounted for stock-based compensation plans in accordance with the provisions of APB Opinion No. 25, as permitted by SFAS No. 123. Under APB Opinion No. 25, the Company was generally not required to
recognize compensation expense for the cost of stock options, when such options had an exercise price equal to the market price at the date of grant, or shares issued under the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan. If the fair value
based method as prescribed by SFAS No. 123 had been applied by the Company, the effect on net income and earnings per share for 2005 would have been as follows:



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

As of December 30, 2007, the Company had three stock-based compensation plans. Under the 2005
Incentive Plan, 5.4 million shares of the Company’s common stock were made available for stock option grants, restricted stock awards and performance units. Under the 2001 Incentive Plan, 8.8 million shares of the Company’s
common stock were made available for stock option grants, restricted stock awards and performance units. Under the Life Sciences Plan, 2.3 million shares of the Company’s common stock were made available for stock option grants.

For fiscal years 2007 and 2006, the Company recorded
incremental pre-tax compensation related to the stock options of $9.2 million in each fiscal year. The total pre-tax stock-based compensation expense for the cost of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance units and
stock grants was $22.2 million in 2007 and $18.0 million for 2006. The total income tax benefit recognized in the consolidated statements of operations for stock-based compensation was $8.0 million in 2007 and $6.3 million in 2006. Stock-based
compensation costs capitalized as part of inventory were approximately $0.1 million and $0.2 million as of December 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively.

Stock Options:

The Company has granted options to purchase common shares at prices equal to the market price
of the common shares on the date the option is granted. Conditions of vesting are determined at the time of grant. Options are generally exercisable in equal annual installments over a period of three years, and will generally expire seven years
after the date of grant. Options assumed as part of business combination transactions retain all the rights, terms and conditions of the respective plans under which they were originally issued.

The fair value of each option grant is estimated using the Black-Scholes
option pricing model. The fair value is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally the vesting period. Use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with
respect to selected model inputs. Expected volatility was calculated primarily based on the historical volatility of the Company’s stock. The average expected life was based on the contractual term of the option and historic exercise
experience. The risk-free interest rate is based on United States Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life assumed at the date of grant. Forfeitures are estimated based on voluntary termination behavior, as well
as an analysis of actual option forfeitures. The Company’s weighted-average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model are as follows:



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The following table summarizes stock option activity for the three years ended December 30,
2007:

The weighted-average
grant-date fair values of options granted during 2007, 2006 and 2005 were $7.45, $6.83 and $8.36, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during 2007, 2006 and 2005 were $25.3 million, $16.2 million and $13.7 million,
respectively. Cash received from option exercises for 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $32.4 million, $21.5 million and $19.4 million, respectively. The related tax benefit classified as a financing cash inflow was $0.4 million for 2007 and $2.2 million for
2006. The related tax benefit classified as an operating cash inflow was $5.3 million for 2005.

The aggregate intrinsic value for stock options outstanding at December 30, 2007 was $50.7 million with a weighted-average remaining contractual term
of 3.6 years. The aggregate intrinsic value for stock options exercisable at December 30, 2007 was $38.6 million with a weighted-average remaining contractual term of 2.9 years. At December 30, 2007, there are 9.6 million stock
options that are vested and expected to vest, in the future, with an aggregate intrinsic value of $43.4 million and a weighted-average remaining contractual term of 3.6 years.

There was $10.6 million of total unrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to nonvested stock
options granted as of December 30, 2007. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.9 fiscal years, and will be adjusted for any future changes in estimated forfeitures.

The following table summarizes total compensation expense recognized related
to the stock options, which is a function of current and prior year awards and net of estimated forfeitures, included in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations during the years ended:



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The following table summarizes information about stock options outstanding at December 30, 2007:

Restricted Stock
Awards:

The Company has awarded shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units that contain time-based vesting provisions and shares of restricted stock that contain performance-based vesting provisions to certain
employees at no cost to them, which cannot be sold, assigned, transferred or pledged during the restriction period. These awards were granted under the Company’s 2005 Incentive Plan and 2001 Incentive Plan. All restrictions on the awards will
lapse upon certain situations including death or disability of the employee and a change in control of the Company. Recipients of the restricted stock have the right to vote such shares and receive dividends.

Restricted Stock Awards (Time-based Vesting)

—Grants of restricted
stock and restricted stock units that vest through the passage of time, assuming continued employment. The fair value of the award at the time of the grant is expensed on a straight line basis primarily in selling, general and administrative
expenses over the vesting period, which is generally three years.

Restricted Stock Awards (Performance-based Vesting)

—Grants of restricted stock that vest based on certain specified performance criteria, assuming employment at the time the performance criteria are met. The fair value of the
shares is expensed over the period of performance primarily in selling, general and administrative expenses, once achievement of criteria is deemed probable.

The following table summarizes the restricted stock activity for the three years ended December 30, 2007:



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The weighted-average grant-date fair value of restricted stock awards granted was $23.90 per share in
2007, $22.32 per share in 2006 and $20.76 per share in 2005. The fair value of restricted stock awards vested was $5.0 million in 2007, $3.4 million in 2006 and $8.3 million in 2005. The total compensation recognized related to the restricted stock
awards, which is a function of current and prior year awards, was approximately $4.9 million in 2007, $4.4 million in 2006 and $5.2 million in 2005.

As of December 30, 2007, there was $6.1 million of total unrecognized compensation cost, net of forfeitures, related to nonvested restricted stock
awards. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.6 fiscal years.

Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), unearned compensation was recorded in a contra-equity account and established at the date restricted stock
was granted, representing the amount of unrecognized restricted stock expense that is reduced as expense is recognized. Under the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), the recognition of unearned compensation at the date restricted stock is granted is
no longer required. Therefore, in the first quarter of 2006, the $6.4 million of unrecognized restricted stock that had been in “Unearned compensation” in the consolidated balance sheet as of January 1, 2006 was reclassified to
“Capital in excess of par value.”

Performance
Units:

The Company’s performance unit program provides a cash award based on the achievement of specific performance criteria. A target number of units are granted at the beginning of a three- year performance period.
The number of units earned at the end of the performance period is determined by multiplying the number of units granted by a performance factor ranging from 0% to 200%. Awards are determined by multiplying the number of units earned by the stock
price at the end of the performance period, and are paid in cash. The compensation expense associated with these units is recognized over the period that the performance targets are expected to be achieved. The Company granted 209,326 performance
units, 208,328 performance units and 247,197 performance units during 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The weighted-average grant-date fair values of performance units granted during 2007, 2006 and 2005 were $23.48, $22.74 and $21.02,
respectively. The total compensation related to these performance units, which is a function of current and prior year awards, was approximately $7.4 million, $4.0 million and $6.2 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. As of
December 30, 2007, there were 615,321 performance units outstanding subject to forfeiture.

Stock Awards:

The Company’s stock award program provides non-employee Directors an annual award of the number of shares
of the Company’s common stock which has an aggregate fair market value of $100,000 on the date of the award for awards granted in 2007. Annual awards granted in 2006 and 2005 were equal to an aggregate fair market value of $60,000. The stock
award is prorated for non-employee directors who serve for only a portion of the year. The shares are granted following the annual shareholders meeting, on the third business day after the Company’s first quarter earnings release. Directors may
defer the receipt of shares into the Company’s deferred compensation plan. The compensation expense associated with these stock awards is recognized when the stock award is granted. During 2007, 2006 and 2005, each non-employee Director was
awarded 4,114 shares, 2,770 shares and 3,014 shares, respectively. The weighted-average grant-date fair value of stock awards granted during 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $24.31, $21.67 and $19.72, respectively. The total compensation expense recognized
related to these stock awards was approximately $0.7 million, $0.5 million and $0.5 million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan:

In April 1999, the Company’s stockholders approved the 1998 Employee Stock Purchase Plan,
whereby participating employees had the right to purchase common stock at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the closing price on the first day or the last day of the six-month offering period. In April 2005, the Compensation and Benefits
Committee of the Company’s Board voted to amend the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, effective July 1, 2005, whereby participating employees have the right to purchase common stock at a price equal to 95% of the closing price on the last day
of each six-month offering period. The number of shares which an employee may purchase, subject to certain aggregate limits, is determined by the employee’s

voluntary contribution, which may not exceed 10% of the employee’s base compensation. During 2007, the Company issued 0.04 million shares under
this plan at a weighted-average price of $24.73 per share. During 2006, the Company issued 0.1 million shares under this plan at a weighted-average price of $20.43 per share. During 2005, the Company issued 0.3 million shares under this
plan at a weighted-average price of $17.52 per share. At December 30, 2007 there remains available for sale to employees an aggregate of 1.7 million shares of the Company’s stock out of the 5.0 million shares authorized by
shareholders.

Comprehensive Income:

The components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of
tax were as follows:

The tax effects on the
components of other comprehensive income (loss) are minimal due to the Company’s position under APB Opinion No. 23. The components of other comprehensive income (loss) were as follows:

Stock Repurchase Program:

On November 6, 2006, the Company announced that the Board authorized
the Company to repurchase up to 10.0 million shares of the common stock under a stock repurchase program (the “Repurchase Program”). The Repurchase Program will expire on October 25, 2010 unless this authorization is terminated
earlier by the Board, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. During 2007, the Company repurchased in the open market approximately 8.1 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $203.0 million, including commissions,
under the Repurchase Program. The repurchased shares have been reflected as additional authorized but unissued shares, with the payments reflected in common stock and capital in excess of par value.

During 2006, the Company repurchased in the open market 8.9 million
shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $190.1 million, including commissions. These repurchases were made pursuant to the stock repurchase program announced in November 2005. The repurchased shares have been reflected as additional
authorized but unissued shares, with the payments reflected in common stock and capital in excess of par value.

Note 21:

Financial Instruments

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash investments, marketable
securities and accounts receivable. The Company believes it had no significant concentrations of credit risk as of December 30, 2007.

In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into foreign exchange contracts for periods consistent with its committed exposures to mitigate the
effect of foreign currency movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Transactions covered by hedge contracts include intercompany and third-party receivables and payables. The contracts are primarily in European and Asian
currencies, have maturities that do not exceed 12 months, have no cash requirements until maturity, and are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet. Credit risk and market risk are insignificant as the foreign exchange instruments
are contracted with major banking institutions. Unrealized gains and losses on the Company’s foreign currency contracts are recognized immediately in earnings for hedges designated as fair value and, for hedges designated as cash flow, the
related unrealized gains or losses are deferred as a component of other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. Deferred gains and losses are recognized in income in the period in which the underlying anticipated
transaction occurs and impacts earnings. Principal hedged currencies include the British Pound (GBP), Canadian Dollar (CAD), Euro (EUR), Japanese Yen (JPY), and Singapore Dollar (SGD). The Company held forward foreign exchange contracts with U.S.
equivalent notional amounts totaling $105.2 million at December 30, 2007 and $174.8 million as of December 31, 2006, and the approximate fair value of these foreign currency derivative contracts was insignificant. The gains and losses
realized on foreign currency derivative contracts are not material. The duration of these contracts entered into in 2007 was generally 30 days.

In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company entered into forward interest rate contracts, with notional amounts totaling $300.0 million, a
weighted average interest rate of 4.25%, and a future dated settlement to coincide with the Company’s highly probable debt issuance in 2008. These contracts are intended to hedge movements in interest rates prior to the Company’s highly
probable debt issuance in 2008. The Company had accumulated net derivative losses of $5.3 million, net of taxes, in other comprehensive income as of December 30, 2007, related to these cash flow hedges. The net derivative losses will be
reclassified into net earnings when the hedged exposure affects net earnings. No cash flow hedges were discontinued and no ineffectiveness was recognized during 2007.

The Company does not enter into derivatives for trading or other speculative purposes, nor does the Company use leveraged
financial instruments.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The Company estimates the fair value of financial instruments based on interest rates available to the Company and by
comparison to quoted market prices. The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value due to the short-term maturities of these assets and liabilities.

The fair values of marketable securities included in investments have been
determined using available quoted market prices for such securities. The fair value and carrying value of the Company’s investments are disclosed in Note 12 above.

The Company’s $500.0 million amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility, and a $300.0 million unsecured interim credit
facility, had outstanding balances as of December 30, 2007 of $216.0 million and $300.0 million, respectively. The Company’s previous $350.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility had an outstanding balance as of
December 31, 2006 of $151.5 million. The interest rate on the Company’s amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility, previous senior secured credit facility, and unsecured interim credit facility are reset at least monthly to
correspond to variable rates that reflect currently available terms and conditions for similar debt. Consequently, the carrying value of the current year and prior year credit facilities approximate fair value.

Note 22:

Leases

The Company leases certain property and equipment under operating leases. Rental expense charged to continuing operations for fiscal years 2007, 2006 and
2005 amounted to $36.1 million, $37.7 million and $30.6 million, respectively. Minimum rental commitments under noncancelable operating leases are as follows: $38.3 million in 2008, $28.6 million in 2009, $20.7 million in 2010, $15.8 million in
2011, $15.2 million in 2012 and $119.8 million in 2013 and thereafter.

Note 23:

Industry Segment and Geographic Area Information

The Company follows SFAS No. 131, “

Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information

.” SFAS No. 131
establishes standards for the way public business enterprises report information about operating segments in annual financial statements and in interim reports to shareholders. The method for determining what information to report is based on the
way that management organizes the segments within the Company for making operating decisions and assessing financial performance. The Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on sales and operating income. Intersegment sales
and transfers are not significant. Based on the guidance in SFAS No. 131, the Company has two operating segments for financial reporting purposes. The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in Note 1. The
operating segments and their principal products and services are:

•

Life and Analytical Sciences.

The Company is a leading provider of analysis tools, including instruments, reagents, software, and
consumables, to the analytical sciences, genetic screening, and BioDiscovery and laboratory markets.

•

Optoelectronics.

The Company provides a broad range of medical imaging, optical sensor and specialty lighting components used in
medical, consumer products and other specialty end markets.

The assets and expenses for the Company’s corporate headquarters, such as legal, tax, accounting and finance, human resources, property and insurance management, information technology, treasury and other
management and compliance costs, have been included as “Corporate” below. The Company has a process to allocate and recharge expenses to the reportable segments when such costs are administered or paid by the



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

corporate headquarters based on the extent to which the segment benefited from the expenses. These amounts have been calculated in a consistent manner and
are included in the Company’s calculations of segment results to internally plan and assess the performance of each segment for all purposes, including determining the compensation of the business leaders for each of the Company’s
operating segments.

Sales and operating income by segment for
the three years ended December 30, 2007, excluding discontinued operations, are shown in the table below:

Controls and Procedures

Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 30, 2007. The term “disclosure controls and procedures” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
“Exchange Act”), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports that it files or submits



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s
rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and
procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and
procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 30, 2007, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were
effective at the reasonable assurance level.

Management’s Report on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or
under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the company’s board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and includes those policies and procedures that:

•

Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;

•

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and

•

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 30, 2007. In making this assessment, our
management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework.

Based on this assessment, our management believes that, as of December 30, 2007, our internal control over financial reporting was
effective based on those criteria.

Our registered public
accounting firm has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting. This report appears below.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of PerkinElmer, Inc.

Waltham, Massachusetts

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of PerkinElmer, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 30,
2007, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar
functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override
of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to
the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 30, 2007, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended December 30, 2007 of the Company and our report dated February 28, 2008 expressed an
unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedule and includes an explanatory paragraph relating to the Company’s adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation (“FIN”) No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes”
