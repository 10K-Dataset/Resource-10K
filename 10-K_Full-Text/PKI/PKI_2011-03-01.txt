product and service offerings through the acquisition of innovative technology and expenditures for research and development. Our strategy includes:

•

Achieving significant growth in both of our core business segments, Human Health and Environmental Health, through strategic acquisitions and
licensing;

•

Accelerating innovation through both internal research and development and third-party collaborations and alliances;

•

Strengthening our position within key markets, by expanding our product and service offerings and maintaining superior product quality;

•

Utilizing our share repurchase programs to help drive shareholder value; and

•

Attracting, retaining and developing talented and motivated employees.

Recent Developments

As part of our strategy to grow our core businesses, we have recently acquired the following businesses:

Business Combinations and Asset Purchases:

Acquisition of chemagen Biopolymer-Technologie
AG.

In February 2011, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of chemagen Biopolymer-Technologie AG (“chemagen”). chemagen manufactures and sells nucleic acid sample preparation systems and reagents utilizing M-PVA magnetic bead
technology. We expect this acquisition to enhance our genetic screening business by expanding our product offerings to diagnostics, academic and industrial end markets. We paid the shareholders of chemagen approximately $35.0 million in cash at the
closing for the stock of chemagen, plus potential additional consideration of up to $20.3 million. The purchase price is also subject to potential adjustments for chemagen’s indebtedness, working capital as of the closing date, and
indemnification obligations of chemagen’s equity holders. We expect to report the operations for this acquisition within the results of our Human Health segment from the acquisition date.



Acquisition of VisEn Medical Inc.

In July 2010, we acquired all of the
outstanding stock of VisEn Medical Inc. (“VisEn”). VisEn is an

in vivo

molecular imaging technology company. We expect this acquisition to enhance our cellular imaging business by expanding our technologies and capabilities into
preclinical research undertaken in academic institutes and pharmaceutical companies. We paid the equity holders of VisEn $23.0 million in cash for the stock of VisEn, of which $18.2 million was paid at closing and an additional amount of $4.8
million is held in an escrow account to secure potential adjustments for VisEn’s indebtedness, working capital as of the closing date, and indemnification obligations of VisEn’s equity holders. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year
2010, we finalized the purchase price and related allocation resulting in an increase in deferred tax assets, included in long-term liabilities, of $8.5 million and a decrease in goodwill of $8.5 million. We have reported the operations for this
acquisition within the results of our Human Health segment from the acquisition date.

Acquisition of Signature Genomic Laboratories, LLC.

In May 2010, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of SGL Newco, Inc., the parent company of Signature Genomic Laboratories, LLC
(“Signature Genomic”). Signature Genomic is a provider of diagnostic cytogenetic testing of chromosome abnormalities in individuals with unexplained physical and developmental disabilities. We expect this acquisition to expand our existing
genetic testing business and expand our position in early detection of disease, specifically in the molecular diagnostics market. We paid the equity holders of Signature Genomic $90.0 million in cash, of which $77.5 million was paid at closing and
an additional amount of $12.5 million is held in an escrow account to secure certain adjustments for Signature Genomic’s indebtedness, working capital as of the closing date, and indemnification obligations of Signature Genomic’s equity
holders. We have reported the operations for this acquisition within the results of our Human Health segment from the acquisition date.

Acquisition of Remaining Interest in the Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry Joint Venture.

In May 2010, we acquired
the remaining fifty percent equity interest in our joint venture (the “ICPMS Joint Venture”) with the company previously known as MDS, Inc. for the development and manufacturing of our Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry
(“ICPMS”) product line and other related tangible assets from DH Technologies Development Pte Ltd., a subsidiary of Danaher Corporation (“Danaher”). We expect this acquisition will help support the continued success of the
premier ICPMS product line by allowing us to direct development with a dedicated and consistent approach. The fair value of the acquisition was $67.7 million, including cash consideration of $35.0 million, non-cash consideration of $2.6 million for
certain non-exclusive rights to intangible assets we own, and $30.4 million representing the fair value of our fifty percent equity interest in the ICPMS Joint Venture held prior to the acquisition. We recognized a pre-tax gain of $25.6 million from
the re-measurement to fair value of our previously held equity interest in the ICPMS Joint Venture. This pre-tax gain is reported in interest and other (income) expense, net, for fiscal year 2010. We have reported the operations for this acquisition
within the results of our Environmental Health segment from the acquisition date.

We recently took the following additional actions to further strengthen our core businesses:

Restructuring:

During fiscal year 2010, we incurred a $12.6 million pre-tax restructuring charge in the Human Health segment related to a workforce
reduction from reorganization activities and the closure of excess facility space. We also recognized an $11.6 million pre-tax restructuring charge in the Environmental Health segment related to a workforce reduction from reorganization activities
and the closure of excess facility space. Our management approved these plans principally to shift resources to higher growth geographic regions and end markets and to reduce resources in response to the continued economic downturn and its impact on
demand in certain other end markets. The restructuring costs for the closure of excess facility space were offset by the recognition of a $3.0 million gain that had been deferred from a previous sales-leaseback transaction on this facility. We also
recorded a pre-tax restructuring reversal of $2.3 million relating to our previous restructuring plans due to lower than expected costs associated with workforce reductions in Europe within both the Human Health and Environmental Health segments.
The pre-tax restructuring activity associated with these plans has been reported as restructuring



expenses and is included as a component of operating expenses from continuing operations. We expect the impact of immediate cost savings from these restructuring plans on operating results and
cash flows to approximately offset the increased spending in higher growth regions and the decline in revenue from certain products, respectively. We expect the impact of future cost savings from these restructuring activities on operating results
and cash flows to be negligible, as we will incur offsetting costs.

Discontinued Operations:

Divestiture of Illumination and Detection Solutions Business.

In November 2010, we sold our Illumination and Detection
Solutions (“IDS”) business, which was included in our Environmental Health segment, for approximately $500.0 million, $482.0 million net of payments for acquired cash balances, subject to an adjustment for working capital as of the closing
date. We expect the divestiture of our IDS business to reduce the complexity of our product offerings and organizational structure, and to provide capital to reinvest in other Human Health and Environmental Health end markets. The buyer acquired our
IDS business through the purchase of all outstanding stock of certain of our subsidiaries located in Germany, Canada, China, Indonesia, the Philippines, the United Kingdom and the United States as well as the purchase of related assets and the
assumption of liabilities held by us and certain of our subsidiaries located in Singapore and Germany. We recognized a pre-tax gain of $315.3 million, inclusive of the net working capital adjustment, in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010 as a
result of the sale of our IDS business. The gain was recognized as a gain on the disposition of discontinued operations.

Divestiture of Photoflash Business.

In June 2010, we sold our Photoflash business for approximately $13.5 million, including a
net working capital adjustment, plus potential additional consideration. We recognized a pre-tax gain of $4.4 million, inclusive of the net working capital adjustment, in fiscal year 2010 as a result of the sale. The gain was recognized as a gain on
the disposition of discontinued operations.

As
part of our ongoing business strategy, we also took the following action:

Share Repurchase Program:

On October 23, 2008, we announced that our Board of Directors (our “Board”) authorized us to repurchase up to 10.0 million shares of common stock under a stock repurchase program (the
“Repurchase Program”). On August 31, 2010, we announced that our Board had authorized us to repurchase an additional 5.0 million shares of common stock under the Repurchase Program. The Repurchase Program will expire on
October 22, 2012 unless terminated earlier by our Board, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. During fiscal year 2008, we repurchased approximately 1.0 million shares of common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of
$18.0 million, including commissions, under the Repurchase Program. During fiscal year 2009, we repurchased approximately 1.0 million shares of common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of $14.2 million, including commissions, under
the Repurchase Program. During fiscal year 2010, we repurchased approximately 3.0 million shares of common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of $71.5 million, including commissions, under the Repurchase Program. As of
January 2, 2011, approximately 10.0 million shares of our common stock remained available for repurchase from the 15.0 million shares authorized by our Board under the Repurchase Program. From January 3, 2011 through
February 24, 2011, we repurchased approximately 3.0 million shares of common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of $80.6 million, including commissions, under the Repurchase Program.

Business Segments and Products

We report our business in two segments: Human Health and
Environmental Health. We performed our annual impairment testing on January 4, 2010, the annual impairment date for our reporting units, and based on the first step of the impairment process (the comparison of the fair value to the carrying
value of the reporting unit to determine if the carrying value exceeds the fair value), we concluded that there was no goodwill impairment.

minimum purchase requirements, with certain of our suppliers. For certain critical raw materials, key components and supplies required for the production of some of our principal products, we have qualified only a limited or a single source of
supply. We periodically purchase quantities of some of these critical raw materials in excess of current requirements, in anticipation of future manufacturing needs. With sufficient lead times, we believe we would be able to qualify alternative
suppliers for each of these raw materials and key components. See the applicable risk factor in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for an additional description of this issue.

Intellectual Property

We own numerous United States and foreign patents and have
patent applications pending in the United States and abroad. We also license intellectual property rights to and from third parties, some of which bear



royalties and are terminable in specified circumstances. In addition to our patent portfolio, we possess a wide array of unpatented proprietary technology and know-how. We also own numerous
United States and foreign trademarks and trade names for a variety of our product names, and have applications for the registration of trademarks and trade names pending in the United States and abroad. We believe that patents and other proprietary
rights are important to the development of both of our reporting segments, but we also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain the competitive position of both of
our reporting segments. We do not believe that the loss of any one patent or other proprietary right would have a material adverse effect on our overall business or on any of our reporting segments.

In some cases, we may participate in litigation or other
proceedings to defend against or assert claims of infringement, to enforce our patents or our licensors’ patents, to protect our trade secrets, know-how or other intellectual property rights, or to determine the scope and validity of our or
third parties’ intellectual property rights. Litigation of this type could result in substantial cost to us and diversion of our resources. An adverse outcome in any litigation or proceeding could subject us to significant liabilities or
expenses, require us to cease using disputed intellectual property or cease the sale of a product, or require us to license the disputed intellectual property from third parties. We are currently involved in several lawsuits involving claims of
violation of intellectual property rights. See “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” for a discussion of these matters.

Backlog

We believe that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects for either of our business segments due to the short
lead time required on a majority of our sales. Therefore, we believe that backlog information is not material to an understanding of our business.

Competition

Due to the wide range of our products and services, we face many different types of competition and competitors. This affects our ability
to sell our products and services and the prices at which these products and services are sold. Our competitors range from large foreign and domestic organizations, which produce a comprehensive array of goods and services and that may have greater
financial and other resources than we do, to small firms producing a limited number of goods or services for specialized market segments.

We compete on the basis of service level, price, technological innovation, operational efficiency, product differentiation, product
availability, quality and reliability. Competitors range from multinational organizations with a wide range of products to specialized firms that in some cases have well-established market niches. We expect the proportion of large competitors to
increase through the continued consolidation of competitors.

We believe we compete effectively in each of the areas in which our businesses experience competition.

Research and Development

Research and development expenditures were approximately $95.4 million during fiscal year 2010, approximately $90.8 million during fiscal
year 2009, and approximately $93.0 million during fiscal year 2008.

We directed our research and development efforts in fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008 primarily toward the diagnostics and research markets within our Human Health segment, and the environmental and
safety, industrial and laboratory services markets within our Environmental Health segment, in order to help accelerate our growth initiatives. We expect to continue our strong investments in research and development to drive growth during fiscal
year 2011, and to continue to emphasize the diagnostics and research markets within our Human Health segment, and the environmental and safety, industrial and laboratory services markets within our Environmental Health segment.



Environmental Matters

Our operations are subject to various foreign, federal,
state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations. These requirements include those governing uses, emissions and discharges of hazardous substances, the remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater, the regulation of radioactive
materials, and the health and safety of our employees.

We may have liability under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act and comparable state statutes that impose liability for investigation and remediation of contamination
without regard to fault, in connection with materials that we or our former businesses sent to various third-party sites. We have incurred, and expect to incur, costs pursuant to these statutes.

We are conducting a number of environmental investigations
and remedial actions at our current and former locations and, along with other companies, have been named a potentially responsible party (“PRP”) for certain waste disposal sites. We accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period
that our responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated. We have accrued $6.0 million as of January 2, 2011, which represents our management’s estimate of the total cost of ultimate disposition of known
environmental matters. This amount is not discounted and does not reflect the recovery of any amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements. These cost estimates are subject to a number of variables, including the stage of the
environmental investigations, the magnitude of the possible contamination, the nature of the potential remedies, possible joint and several liability, the time period over which remediation may occur, and the possible effects of changing laws and
regulations. For sites where we have been named a PRP, our management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute. We expect that the majority of such accrued
amounts could be paid out over a period of up to ten years. As assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site, these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available. There have
been no environmental problems to date that have had, or are expected to have, a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. While it is possible that a loss exceeding the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial
statements may be incurred, the potential exposure is not expected to be materially different from those amounts recorded.

In addition, during the second quarter of fiscal year 2007, we settled an insurance claim resulting from a fire that occurred at our
facility in Boston, Massachusetts in March 2005. We accrued $9.7 million representing our management’s estimate of the total cost for decommissioning the building, including environmental matters, which was damaged in the fire. We paid $2.5
million during fiscal year 2009, $1.6 million during fiscal year 2008 and $3.9 million during fiscal year 2007 towards decommissioning the building. We sold the building on April 27, 2010. Net proceeds from the sale were $11.0 million, and we
recorded a pre-tax gain of $3.4 million in operating income.

We may become subject to new or unforeseen environmental costs or liabilities. Compliance with new or more stringent laws or regulations, stricter interpretations of existing laws, or the discovery of new
contamination could cause us to incur additional costs.

Employees

As of January 2, 2011, we employed approximately 6,200 employees in our continuing operations, compared to employing approximately
8,200 employees in our continuing operations one year earlier. The primary reason for the decrease in the number of our employees is due to the sale of our IDS business, which was partially offset by investments in higher growth geographic regions.
Several of our subsidiaries are parties to contracts with labor unions and workers’ councils. As of January 2, 2011, we employed an aggregate of approximately 800 union and workers’ council employees. We consider our relations with
employees to be satisfactory.



Financial Information About Reporting Segments

The expenses for our corporate headquarters, such as legal,
tax, audit, human resources, information technology, and other management and compliance costs, have been included as “Corporate” below. We have a process to allocate and recharge expenses to the reportable segments when such costs are
administered or paid by the corporate headquarters based on the extent to which the segment benefited from the expenses. These amounts have been calculated in a consistent manner and are included in our calculations of segment results to internally
plan and assess the performance of each segment for all purposes, including determining the compensation of the business leaders for each of our operating segments.

The table below sets forth sales and operating income (loss)
by reporting segment for fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008:

Discontinued operations have not
been included in the preceding table.

Additional
information relating to our reporting segments for fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008 is as follows:



Financial Information About Geographic Areas

Both of our reporting segments conduct
business in, and derive substantial revenue from, various countries outside the United States. During fiscal year 2010, we had $1,034.4 million in sales from our international operations, representing approximately 61% of our total sales. During
fiscal year 2010, we derived approximately 43% of our international sales from our Human Health segment, and approximately 57% of our international sales from our Environmental Health segment. We anticipate that sales from international operations
will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total sales in the future.

We are exposed to the risks associated with international operations, including exchange rate fluctuations, regional and country-specific political and economic conditions, foreign receivables collection
concerns, trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements, tax risks, staffing and labor law concerns, intellectual property protection risks, and differing regulatory requirements. Additional geographic information is
discussed in Note 22 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors

The following important factors affect our business and operations generally or affect multiple segments of our business and operations
and are not materially different from those factors reported in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended October 3, 2010:

If the markets into which we sell our products decline or do not grow as anticipated due to a decline in general economic
conditions, or there are uncertainties surrounding the approval of government or industrial funding proposals, or there are unfavorable changes in government regulations, we may see an adverse effect on the results of our business operations.

Our customers include pharmaceutical and
biotechnology companies, laboratories, academic and research institutions, public health authorities, private healthcare organizations, doctors and government agencies. Our quarterly sales and results of operations are highly dependent on the volume
and timing of orders received during the quarter. In addition, our revenues and earnings forecasts for future quarters are often based on the expected trends in our markets. However, the markets we serve do not always experience the trends that we
may expect. Negative fluctuations in our customers’ markets, the inability of our customers to secure credit or funding, restrictions in capital expenditures, general economic conditions, cuts in government funding or unfavorable changes in
government regulations would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and services. In addition, government funding is subject to economic conditions and the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable. Our revenues
may be adversely affected if our customers delay or reduce purchases as a result of uncertainties surrounding the approval of government or industrial funding proposals. Such declines could harm our consolidated financial position, results of
operations, cash flows and trading price of our common stock, and could limit our ability to sustain profitability.



Our growth is subject to global economic, political and other risks.

We have operations in many parts of the
world. The health of the global economy has a significant impact on our business. The global economy, which experienced a significant downturn throughout 2008 and 2009, including the effects of the credit market crisis and the resulting impact on
the finance and banking industries, volatile currency exchange rates and energy costs, inflation concerns, decreased consumer confidence, reduced corporate profits and capital expenditures, and liquidity concerns, began showing signs of gradual
improvement in 2010. However, while some economic indicators improved, the overall rate of global recovery experienced during the course of 2010 has been uneven and the recovery is still uncertain. There can be no assurance that any of the recent
economic improvements will be sustainable, or that we will not experience any adverse effects that may be material to our consolidated cash flows, results of operations, financial position, or our ability to access capital. Our business is also
affected by local economic environments, including inflation, recession, financial liquidity and currency volatility or devaluation. Political changes, some of which may be disruptive, could interfere with our supply chain, our customers and all of
our activities in a particular location. In addition, our global manufacturing facilities face risks to their production capacity that may relate to natural disasters, labor relations or regulatory compliance. While certain of these risks can be
hedged in a limited way using financial instruments and some are insurable, such attempts to mitigate these risks are costly and not always successful. In addition, our ability to engage in such mitigation has decreased or become even more costly as
a result of recent market developments.

If
we do not introduce new products in a timely manner, we may lose market share and be unable to achieve revenue growth targets.

We sell many of our products in industries characterized by rapid technological change, frequent new product and service introductions,
and evolving customer needs and industry standards. Many of the businesses competing with us in these industries have significant financial and other resources to invest in new technologies, substantial intellectual property portfolios, substantial
experience in new product development, regulatory expertise, manufacturing capabilities, and established distribution channels to deliver products to customers. Our products could become technologically obsolete over time, or we may invest in
technology that does not lead to revenue growth or continue to sell products for which the demand from our customers is declining, in which case we may lose market share or not achieve our revenue growth targets. The success of our new product
offerings will depend upon several factors, including our ability to:

•

accurately anticipate customer needs,

•

innovate and develop new technologies and applications,

•

successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner,

•

price our products competitively, and manufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes and on time, and

•

differentiate our offerings from our competitors’ offerings.

Many of our products are used by our customers to develop, test and manufacture their products. We must
anticipate industry trends and consistently develop new products to meet our customers’ expectations. In developing new products, we may be required to make significant investments before we can determine the commercial viability of the new
product. If we fail to accurately foresee our customers’ needs and future activities, we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant sales. We may also suffer a loss in market share and potential
sales revenue if we are unable to commercialize our technology in a timely and efficient manner.

In addition, some of our licensed technology is subject to contractual restrictions, which may limit our ability to develop or commercialize products for some applications.



We may not be able to successfully execute acquisitions or license technologies,
integrate acquired businesses or licensed technologies into our existing businesses, make acquired businesses or licensed technologies profitable, or successfully divest businesses.

We have in the past supplemented, and may in the future supplement, our internal growth by acquiring businesses
and licensing technologies that complement or augment our existing product lines, such as our acquisitions of chemagen, VisEn and Signature Genomic, and our purchase of the remaining interest in the ICPMS Joint Venture. However, we may be unable to
identify or complete promising acquisitions or license transactions for many reasons, including:

•

competition among buyers and licensees,

•

the high valuations of businesses and technologies,

•

the need for regulatory and other approval, and

•

our inability to raise capital to fund these acquisitions.

Some of the businesses we acquire may be unprofitable or
marginally profitable. Accordingly, the earnings or losses of acquired businesses may dilute our earnings. For these acquired businesses to achieve acceptable levels of profitability, we would have to improve their management, operations, products
and market penetration. We may not be successful in this regard and may encounter other difficulties in integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations, such as incompatible management, information or other systems, cultural
differences, unforeseen regulatory requirements, previously undisclosed liabilities or difficulties in predicting financial results. Additionally, if we are not successful in selling businesses we seek to divest, the activity of such businesses may
dilute our earnings and we may not be able to achieve the expected benefits of such divestitures. As a result, our financial results may differ from our forecasts or the expectations of the investment community in a given quarter or over the long
term.

To finance our acquisitions, we may have to
raise additional funds, either through public or private financings. We may be unable to obtain such funds or may be able to do so only on terms unacceptable to us. We may also incur expenses related to completing acquisitions or licensing
technologies, or in evaluating potential acquisitions or technologies, which expenses may adversely impact our profitability.

We may not be successful in adequately protecting our intellectual property.

Patent and trade secret protection is important to us
because developing new products, processes and technologies gives us a competitive advantage, although it is time-consuming and expensive. We own many United States and foreign patents and intend to apply for additional patents. Patent applications
we file, however, may not result in issued patents or, if they do, the claims allowed in the patents may be narrower than what is needed to protect fully our products, processes and technologies. Similarly, applications to register our trademarks
may not be granted in all countries in which they are filed. For our intellectual property that is protected by keeping it secret, such as trade secrets and know-how, we may not use adequate measures to protect this intellectual property.

Third parties may also challenge the validity of
our issued patents, may circumvent or “design around” our patents and patent applications, or may claim that our products, processes or technologies infringe their patents. In addition, third parties may assert that our product names
infringe their trademarks. We may incur significant expense in legal proceedings to protect our intellectual property against infringement by third parties or to defend against claims of infringement by third parties. Claims by third parties in
pending or future lawsuits could result in awards of substantial damages against us or court orders that could effectively prevent us from manufacturing, using, importing or selling our products in the United States or other countries.



If we are unable to renew our licenses or otherwise lose our licensed rights, we may
have to stop selling products or we may lose competitive advantage.

We may not be able to renew our existing licenses, or licenses we may obtain in the future, on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we lose the rights to a patented or other proprietary technology, we
may need to stop selling products incorporating that technology and possibly other products, redesign our products or lose a competitive advantage. Potential competitors could in-license technologies that we fail to license and potentially erode our
market share.

Our licenses typically subject us
to various economic and commercialization obligations. If we fail to comply with these obligations, we could lose important rights under a license, such as the right to exclusivity in a market. In some cases, we could lose all rights under the
license. In addition, rights granted under the license could be lost for reasons out of our control. For example, the licensor could lose patent protection for a number of reasons, including invalidity of the licensed patent, or a third-party could
obtain a patent that curtails our freedom to operate under one or more licenses.

If we do not compete effectively, our business will be harmed.

We encounter aggressive competition from numerous competitors in many areas of our business. We may not be able to compete effectively
with all of these competitors. To remain competitive, we must develop new products and periodically enhance our existing products. We anticipate that we may also have to adjust the prices of many of our products to stay competitive. In addition, new
competitors, technologies or market trends may emerge to threaten or reduce the value of entire product lines.

Our quarterly operating results could be subject to significant fluctuation, and we may not be able to adjust our operations to
effectively address changes we do not anticipate, which could increase the volatility of our stock price and potentially cause losses to our shareholders.

Given the nature of the markets in which we participate, we
cannot reliably predict future sales and profitability. Changes in competitive, market and economic conditions may require us to adjust our operations, and we may not be able to make those adjustments or make them quickly enough to adapt to changing
conditions. A high proportion of our costs are fixed, due in part to our research and development and manufacturing costs. As a result, small declines in sales could disproportionately affect our operating results in a quarter. Factors that may
affect our quarterly operating results include:

•

demand for and market acceptance of our products,

•

competitive pressures resulting in lower selling prices,

•

changes in the level of economic activity in regions in which we do business,

•

changes in general economic conditions or government funding,

•

settlements of income tax audits,

•

differing tax laws and changes in those laws, or changes in the countries in which we are subject to tax,

•

fluctuations in our effective tax rate,

•

changes in industries, such as pharmaceutical and biomedical,

•

changes in the portions of our sales represented by our various products and customers,

•

our ability to introduce new products,

•

our competitors’ announcement or introduction of new products, services or technological innovations,

•

costs of raw materials, energy or supplies,



•

our ability to execute ongoing productivity initiatives,

•

changes in the volume or timing of product orders, and

•

changes in assumptions used to determine contingent consideration in acquisitions.

A significant disruption in third-party package
delivery and import/export services, or significant increases in prices for those services, could interfere with our ability to ship products, increase our costs and lower our profitability.

We ship a significant portion of our products to our
customers through independent package delivery and import/export companies, including UPS and Federal Express in the United States, TNT, UPS and DHL in Europe and UPS in Asia. We also ship our products through other carriers, including national
trucking firms, overnight carrier services and the United States Postal Service. If one or more of the package delivery or import/export providers experiences a significant disruption in services or institutes a significant price increase, the
delivery of our products could be prevented or delayed. Such events could cause us to incur increased shipping costs that could not be passed on to our customers, negatively impacting our profitability and our relationships with certain of our
customers.

Disruptions in the supply of raw
materials, certain key components and other goods from our limited or single source suppliers could have an adverse effect on the results of our business operations, and could damage our relationships with customers.

The production of our products requires a wide variety of
raw materials, key components and other goods that are generally available from alternate sources of supply. However, certain critical raw materials, key components and other goods required for the production and sale of some of our principal
products are available from limited or single sources of supply. We generally have multi-year contracts with no minimum purchase requirements with these suppliers, but those contracts may not fully protect us from a failure by certain suppliers to
supply critical materials or from the delays inherent in being required to change suppliers and, in some cases, validate new raw materials. Such raw materials, key components and other goods could usually be obtained from alternative sources with
the potential for an increase in price, decline in quality or delay in delivery. A prolonged inability to obtain certain raw materials, key components or other goods is possible and could have an adverse effect on our business operations, and could
damage our relationships with customers.

The manufacture and sale of products and services may expose us to product liability claims for which we could have substantial
liability.

We face an inherent business
risk of exposure to product liability claims if our products, services or product candidates are alleged or found to have caused injury, damage or loss. We may in the future be unable to obtain insurance with adequate levels of coverage for
potential liability on acceptable terms or claims of this nature may be excluded from coverage under the terms of any insurance policy that we can obtain. If we are unable to obtain such insurance or the amounts of any claims successfully brought
against us substantially exceed our coverage, then our business could be adversely impacted.

If we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with the regulations of the United States Food and Drug Administration and other governmental agencies, we may be forced to recall products and cease
their manufacture and distribution, and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties.

Our operations are subject to regulation by different state and federal government agencies in the United States and other countries. If
we fail to comply with those regulations, we could be subject to fines, penalties, criminal prosecution or other sanctions. Some of the products produced by our Human Health segment are subject to regulation by the United States Food and Drug
Administration and similar foreign and domestic agencies. These regulations govern a wide variety of product activities, from design and development to labeling,



manufacturing, promotion, sales, resales and distribution. If we fail to comply with those regulations or those of similar foreign and domestic agencies, we may have to recall products, cease
their manufacture and distribution, and may be subject to fines or criminal prosecution.

Changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses.

We compete in markets in which we or our customers must comply with federal, state, local and foreign regulations, such as environmental,
health and safety, and food and drug regulations. We develop, configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations. Any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our
costs of producing these products.

The
healthcare industry is highly regulated and if we fail to comply with its extensive system of laws and regulations, we could suffer fines and penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations which could have a significant
adverse effect on the results of our business operations.

The healthcare industry, including the genetic screening market, is subject to extensive and frequently changing international and United States federal, state and local laws and regulations. In addition,
legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse, patient privacy violations and misconduct involving government insurance programs provide federal enforcement personnel with substantial powers and remedies to pursue suspected
violations. We believe that our business will continue to be subject to increasing regulation as the federal government continues to strengthen its position on healthcare matters, the scope and effect of which we cannot predict. If we fail to comply
with applicable laws and regulations, we could suffer civil and criminal damages, fines and penalties, exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs, and the loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations necessary to
operate our business, as well as incur liabilities from third-party claims, all of which could have a significant adverse effect on our business.

Economic, political and other risks associated with foreign operations could adversely affect our international sales and
profitability.

Because we sell our
products worldwide, our businesses are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. Our sales originating outside the United States represented the majority of our total sales in the fiscal year ended January 2, 2011. We
anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total sales. In addition, many of our manufacturing facilities, employees and suppliers are located outside the United States. Accordingly,
our future results of operations could be harmed by a variety of factors, including:

•

changes in foreign currency exchange rates,

•

changes in a country’s or region’s political or economic conditions, particularly in developing or emerging markets,

•

longer payment cycles of foreign customers and timing of collections in foreign jurisdictions,

•

trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements,

•

differing tax laws and changes in those laws, or changes in the countries in which we are subject to tax,

•

adverse income tax audit settlements or loss of previously negotiated tax incentives,

•

differing business practices associated with foreign operations,

•

difficulty in transferring cash between international operations and the United States,

•

difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations,

•

differing labor laws and changes in those laws,

•

differing protection of intellectual property and changes in that protection,



•

increasing global enforcement of anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, and

•

differing regulatory requirements and changes in those requirements.

If we do not retain our key personnel, our ability to execute our business strategy will be limited.

Our success depends to a significant
extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and key management and technical personnel, particularly our experienced engineers, and on our ability to continue to attract, retain, and motivate qualified personnel. The competition for
these employees is intense. The loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. In addition, there could be a material adverse effect on us should the turnover rates for
engineers and other key personnel increase significantly or if we are unable to continue to attract qualified personnel. We do not maintain any key person life insurance policies on any of our officers or employees.

Our success also depends on our ability to execute leadership
succession plans. The inability to successfully transition key management roles could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.

If we experience a significant disruption in our information technology systems or if we fail to implement new systems and software
successfully, our business could be adversely affected.

We rely on several centralized information systems throughout our company to keep financial records, process orders, manage inventory, process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions.
If we were to experience a prolonged system disruption in the information technology systems that involve our interactions with customers and suppliers, it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs, which
could adversely affect our business.

Restrictions in our credit facility and outstanding debt instruments may limit our activities.

Our amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility and
our 6% senior unsecured notes contain, and future debt instruments to which we may become subject may contain, restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit our company. These debt instruments
include restrictions on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to:

•

pay dividends on, redeem or repurchase our capital stock,

•

sell assets,

•

incur obligations that restrict their ability to make dividend or other payments to us,

•

guarantee or secure indebtedness,

•

enter into transactions with affiliates, and

•

consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.

We are also required to meet
specified financial ratios under the terms of our debt instruments. Our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance, which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors,
including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates, changes in technology and changes in the level of competition.

Our failure to comply with any of these restrictions in our amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility and our 6% senior unsecured
notes may result in an event of default under either or both of these debt instruments, which could permit acceleration of the debt under either or both debt instruments, and require us to prepay that debt before its scheduled due date.



Our results of operations will be adversely affected if we fail to realize the full
value of our intangible assets.

As of
January 2, 2011, our total assets included $1.9 billion of net intangible assets. Net intangible assets consist principally of goodwill associated with acquisitions and costs associated with securing patent rights, trademark rights, core
technology and technology licenses, net of accumulated amortization. We test certain of these items—specifically all of those that are considered “non-amortizing”—at least on an annual basis for potential impairment by comparing
the carrying value to the fair market value of the reporting unit to which they are assigned. All of our amortizing intangible assets are evaluated for impairment should discrete events occur that call into question the recoverability of the
intangible assets.

Adverse changes in our
business, adverse changes in the assumptions used to determine the fair value of our reporting units, or the failure to grow our Human Health and Environmental Health segments may result in impairment of our intangible assets, which could adversely
affect our results of operations.

Our share
price will fluctuate.

Over the last
several quarters, stock markets in general and our common stock in particular have experienced significant price and volume volatility. Both the market price and the daily trading volume of our common stock may continue to be subject to significant
fluctuations due not only to general stock market conditions but also to a change in sentiment in the market regarding our operations and business prospects. In addition to the risk factors discussed above, the price and volume volatility of our
common stock may be affected by:

•

operating results that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors,

•

the financial performance of the major end markets that we target,

•

the operating and securities price performance of companies that investors consider to be comparable to us,

•

announcements of strategic developments, acquisitions and other material events by us or our competitors, and

•

changes in global financial markets and global economies and general market conditions, such as interest or foreign exchange rates, commodity and
equity prices and the value of financial assets.

Dividends on our common stock could be reduced or eliminated in the future.

On October 27, 2010, we announced that our Board had declared a quarterly dividend of $0.07 per share for the fourth quarter of
fiscal year 2010, which was paid in February 2011. On January 24, 2011, we announced that our Board had declared a quarterly dividend of $0.07 per share for the first quarter of fiscal year 2011 that is payable in May 2011. In the future, our
Board may reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in order to fund investments for growth, repurchase shares or conserve capital resources.

Properties

As of January 2, 2011, our continuing operations occupied approximately 2,076,000 square feet in over 90 locations. We own approximately 549,000 square feet of this space, and lease the balance. We
conduct our operations in manufacturing and assembly plants, research laboratories, administrative offices and other facilities located in 9 states and 31 foreign countries.

Facilities outside of the United States account for
approximately 1,239,000 square feet of our owned and leased property, or approximately 60% of our total occupied space.



Our real property leases are both short-term and long-term. We believe that our properties
are well-maintained and are adequate for our present requirements.

The following table indicates, as of January 2, 2011, the approximate square footage of real property owned and leased attributable to the continuing operations of both of our reporting segments:

Legal Proceedings

Enzo Biochem, Inc. and Enzo Life Sciences, Inc.
(collectively, “Enzo”) filed a complaint dated October 23, 2002 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Civil Action No. 02-8448, against Amersham plc, Amersham BioSciences, PerkinElmer, Inc.,
PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Inc., Sigma-Aldrich Corporation, Sigma Chemical Company, Inc., Molecular Probes, Inc., and Orchid BioSciences, Inc. (the “New York Case”). The complaint alleges that we have breached our distributorship and
settlement agreements with Enzo, infringed Enzo’s patents, engaged in unfair competition and fraud, and committed torts against Enzo by, among other things, engaging in commercial development and exploitation of Enzo’s patented products
and technology, separately and together with the other defendants. Enzo seeks injunctive and monetary relief. In 2003, the court severed the lawsuit and ordered Enzo to serve individual complaints against the five defendants. We subsequently filed
an answer and a counterclaim alleging that Enzo’s patents are invalid. In July 2006, the court issued a decision regarding the construction of the claims in Enzo’s patents that effectively limited the coverage of certain of those claims
and, we believe, excludes certain of our products from the coverage of Enzo’s patents. Summary judgment motions were filed by the defendants in January 2007, and a hearing with oral argument on those motions took place in July 2007. In January
2009, the case was assigned to a new district court judge and in March 2009, the new judge denied the pending summary judgment motions without prejudice and ordered a stay of the case until the federal appellate court decides Enzo’s appeal of
the judgment of the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut in Enzo Biochem vs. Applera Corp. and Tropix, Inc. (the “Connecticut Case”), which involves a number of the same patents and which could materially affect the
scope of Enzo’s case against us. On March 26, 2010, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (“CAFC”) affirmed-in-part and reversed-in-part the judgment in the Connecticut Case. Pending further disposition of
the Connecticut Case, the New York Case against us and other defendants remains stayed.

We believe we have meritorious defenses to the matter described above, and we are contesting the action vigorously. While this matter is subject to uncertainty, in the opinion of our management, based on
its review of the information available at this time, the resolution of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.

We are also subject to various other claims, legal
proceedings and investigations covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities. Although we have established accruals for potential losses that we believe are probable and reasonably estimable, in the
opinion of our management, based on its review of the information available at this time, the total cost of resolving these other contingencies at January 2, 2011 should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial
statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K. However, each of these matters is subject to uncertainties, and it is possible that some of these matters may be resolved unfavorably to us.

Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

Market Price of Common Stock

Our common stock is listed and traded on the New York Stock
Exchange. The following table sets forth the high and low per share closing sale prices for our common stock on that exchange for each quarter in fiscal years 2010 and 2009.

As of February 24, 2011, we had approximately 6,434 holders of record of our common stock.

Stock Repurchase Program

The following table provides information with respect to the
shares of common stock repurchased by us for the periods indicated.

(1)

On October 23, 2008, we announced that our Board authorized us to repurchase up to 10.0 million shares of common stock under a stock repurchase program (the
“Repurchase Program”). On August 31, 2010, we announced that our Board had authorized us to repurchase an additional 5.0 million shares of common stock under the Repurchase Program. The Repurchase Program will expire on
October 22, 2012 unless terminated earlier by our Board, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010, we repurchased approximately 3.0 million shares of common stock in the open market at
an aggregate cost of $71.5 million, including commissions, under the Repurchase Program. As of January 2, 2011, approximately 10.0 million shares of our common stock remained available for repurchase from the 15.0 million shares
authorized by our Board under the Repurchase Program. From January 3, 2011 through February 24, 2011, we repurchased approximately 3.0 million shares of common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of $80.6 million, including
commissions, under the Repurchase Program. The repurchased shares have been reflected as additional authorized but unissued shares, with the payments reflected in common stock and capital in excess of par value.

(2)

Our Board has authorized us to repurchase shares of common stock to satisfy minimum statutory tax withholding obligations in connection with the
vesting of restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit



awards granted pursuant to our equity incentive plans. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010, we repurchased 10,979 shares of common stock for this purpose. The repurchased shares have
been reflected as additional authorized but unissued shares, with the payments reflected in common stock and capital in excess of par value.

Dividends

Selected Financial Data

The following table sets forth
selected historical financial information as of and for each of the fiscal years in the five-year period ended January 2, 2011. We derived the selected historical financial information as of and for each of the fiscal years in the three-year
period ended January 2, 2011 from our audited consolidated financial statements which are included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. We derived the selected historical financial information as of and for the fiscal years ended
December 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006 from our audited consolidated financial statements which are not included in this annual report on Form 10-K. As with our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended January 3,
2010 and December 28, 2008, we adjusted the information in the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006, where appropriate, to account for our discontinued operations.

Our historical financial information may not be
indicative of our future results of operations or financial position.

The following selected historical financial information should be read together with our “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and our
consolidated financial statements, including the related notes, included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.



(1)

We adopted the authoritative guidance for stock compensation on January 2, 2006. The total incremental pre-tax compensation expense recorded in continuing
operations related to stock options was $6.2 million in fiscal year 2010, $7.9 million in fiscal year 2009, $9.2 million in fiscal year 2008, $8.5 million in fiscal year 2007 and $8.2 million in fiscal year 2006.

(2)

We incurred pre-tax restructuring and lease charges (reversals), net, of $19.0 million in fiscal year 2010, $18.0 million in fiscal year 2009, $6.7 million in fiscal
year 2008, $13.9 million in fiscal year 2007, and ($2.0) million in fiscal year 2006.

(3)

We settled an insurance claim resulting from a fire that occurred in one of our facilities in March 2005. As a result of that settlement, we recorded pre-tax gains of
$15.3 million in fiscal year 2007. We sold the building on April 27, 2010. Net proceeds from the sale were $11.0 million, and we recorded a pre-tax gain of $3.4 million in operating income.

(4)

In fiscal year 2007, we entered into forward interest rate contracts with notional amounts totaling $300.0 million and a weighted average interest rate of 4.25%. These
contracts were intended to hedge movements in interest rates prior to our expected debt issuance. During fiscal year 2008, we settled forward interest rate contracts with notional amounts totaling $150.0 million upon the issuance of our 6% senior
unsecured notes, and recognized $8.4 million, net of taxes of $5.4 million, of accumulated derivative losses in other comprehensive (loss) income. We also discontinued forward interest rate contracts with notional amounts totaling $150.0
million during fiscal year 2008. The discontinued cash flow hedges were immediately settled with counterparties, and the $17.5 million loss was recognized as interest and other (income) expense, net.

(5)

In May 2010, we acquired the remaining fifty percent equity interest in the ICPMS Joint Venture. The fair value of the acquisition was $67.7 million, including cash
consideration of $35.0 million, non-cash consideration of $2.6 million for certain non-exclusive rights to intangible assets we own, and $30.4 million representing the fair value of our fifty percent equity interest in the ICPMS Joint Venture held
prior to the acquisition. We recognized a pre-tax gain of $25.6 million from the re-measurement to fair value of our previously held equity interest in the ICPMS Joint Venture. This pre-tax gain is reported in interest and other (income) expense,
net, for fiscal year 2010.

(6)

In fiscal year 2008, interest expense was $23.7 million due to higher outstanding debt balances with the issuance of our 6% senior unsecured notes that primarily
related to the purchase of ViaCell, Inc.(“ViaCell”), which was partially offset by lower interest rates on our amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility.

(7)

The fiscal year 2010 effective tax rate on continuing operations of 16.1% was largely due to the favorable impact related to the gain on the previously held equity
interest in the ICPMS Joint Venture.

(8)

The fiscal year 2008 effective tax rate on continuing operations of 12.3% was largely due to a $15.6 million benefit related to the settlement of various income tax
audits.

(9)

The fiscal year 2007 effective tax rate on continuing operations of 13.2% was largely due to a $18.6 million benefit related to the settlement of an income tax audit.

(10)

In November 2010, we sold our IDS business for approximately $500.0 million, $482.0 million net of payments for acquired cash balances, subject to an adjustment for
working capital as of the closing date. We recognized a pre-tax gain of $315.3 million, inclusive of the net working capital adjustment, in fiscal year 2010 as a result of the sale of our IDS business. The gain was recognized as a gain on the
disposition of discontinued operations.



(11)

In fiscal year 2008, our Board approved separate plans to shut down our ViaCyte

SM

and Cellular Therapy Technology businesses, and our Cellular Screening Fluorescence and Luminescence
workstations, Analytical Proteomics Instruments and Proteomics and Genomics Instruments businesses. We recognized a pre-tax loss of $12.8 million related to lease and severance costs and the reduction of fixed assets and inventory to net realizable
value.

(12)

In fiscal year 2006, we sold substantially all of the assets of the Semiconductor business of our historic Fluid Sciences segment for approximately $25.7 million,
including a net working capital adjustment, plus potential additional contingent consideration. We recognized a pre-tax gain of $3.8 million, exclusive of additional contingent consideration.

(13)

In fiscal year 2007, we completed the tender offer for all of the outstanding shares of common stock of ViaCell. Aggregate consideration for this transaction was
approximately $295.8 million in cash, which excludes $31.8 million in acquired cash. In connection with this acquisition, we entered into a $300.0 million unsecured interim credit facility to pay the purchase price and transactional expenses of this
acquisition. This unsecured interim credit facility matured on March 31, 2008, at which point we paid in full the outstanding balance. The source of funds for the repayment was comprised of our on-hand cash and cash equivalents, and borrowings
under our amended and restated senior unsecured revolving credit facility. We classified the $300.0 million of outstanding borrowings on the unsecured interim credit facility as long-term debt in fiscal year 2007.

(14)

In May 2008, we issued and sold seven-year senior notes at a rate of 6% with a face value of $150.0 million and received $150.0 million in gross proceeds
from the issuance. The debt, which matures in May 2015, is unsecured.

(15)

In June 2009, our consolidated subsidiary exercised the right to terminate the receivables purchase agreement with a third-party financial institution releasing
both parties of their rights, liabilities and obligations under this agreement. We had an undivided interest in the receivables that had been sold to the third-party financial institution under this agreement of $40.0 million as of December 28,
2008 and $45.0 million as of each December 30, 2007, and December 31, 2006.

(16)

In fiscal year 2006, we adopted the authoritative guidance on the balance sheet recognition requirements for employee benefit plans. The impact of this adoption was a
reduction to accumulated other comprehensive loss of $32.7 million, a reduction to other assets of $26.6 million, an increase to current liabilities of $7.3 million, an increase to current assets of $0.7 million and a reduction to long-term
liabilities of $0.4 million, with no impact to our consolidated statements of operations or consolidated statements of cash flows.

(17)

In fiscal year 2007, we adopted the authoritative guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. The impact of this adoption was an increase to retained
earnings of $3.6 million and a reduction to accrued liabilities of $3.6 million, with no impact to our consolidated statements of operations or consolidated statements of cash flows.

(18)

In fiscal year 2010, we repurchased in the open market approximately 3.0 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $71.5 million, including
commissions. In fiscal year 2009, we repurchased in the open market approximately 1.0 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $14.2 million, including commissions. In fiscal year 2008, we repurchased in the open market
approximately 3.0 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $75.5 million, including commissions. In fiscal year 2007, we repurchased in the open market approximately 8.1 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate
cost of $203.0 million, including commissions. In fiscal year 2006, we repurchased in the open market approximately 8.9 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $190.1 million, including commissions. The repurchased shares
have been reflected as additional authorized but unissued shares, with the payments reflected in common stock and capital in excess of par value. These repurchases were made pursuant to our stock repurchase programs announced in October 2008,
modified in August 2010, and in November 2006.



Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

This annual report on Form 10-K, including the following management’s discussion and analysis, contains forward-looking information that you should read in conjunction with the consolidated
financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements that we have included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. For this purpose, any statements contained in this report that are not statements of historical fact may be
deemed to be forward-looking statements. Words such as “believes,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “expects,” “will” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Our actual
results may differ materially from the plans, intentions or expectations we disclose in the forward-looking statements we make. We have included important factors above under the heading “Risk Factors” in Item 1A above that we believe
could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements we make. We are not obligated to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Accounting Period

Our fiscal year ends on the Sunday nearest December 31.
We report fiscal years under a 52/53 week format. Under this method, certain years will contain 53 weeks. The fiscal year ended January 2, 2011 included 52 weeks. The fiscal years ended January 3, 2010 and December 28, 2008 included
53 weeks and 52 weeks, respectively. The fiscal year ended January 1, 2012 will include 52 weeks.

Overview of Fiscal Year 2010

During fiscal year 2010, we continued to see positive signs of recovery from the global economic contraction across
most of our end markets and geographies, in addition to good performance from investments in our ongoing technology and sales and marketing initiatives. Our overall sales in fiscal year 2010 increased $153.6 million, or 10%, as compared to fiscal
year 2009, reflecting an increase of $64.7 million, or 9%, in our Human Health segment sales and an increase of $88.9 million, or 11%, in our Environmental Health segment sales. The increase in our Human Health segment sales during fiscal year 2010
was due primarily to increased demand for our medical imaging products with the expansion of panel usage for diagnostic, oncology and non-medical applications and the easing of capital budget constraints in major hospitals in the diagnostics market,
as well as increased growth in the academic sector for both instruments and reagents in the research market. These increases were partially offset by the impact of lower birth rates in the United States and tight inventory management in state and
national labs for neonatal screening in the diagnostics market, as well as continued constrained capital spending within our pharmaceutical customers in the research market, particularly in the area of high throughput screening. Customer
consolidations in the pharmaceutical market also had an unfavorable impact on our research business. The increase in our Environmental Health segment sales during fiscal year 2010 was due primarily to the increase in our OneSource

®

multivendor service offering, which we expanded in markets beyond our traditional customer base and services, as
well as growth in our environmental, food and consumer safety and testing products. We also experienced continued growth in traditional chemical markets with the reduction of constraints on capital purchases to rebuild capacity as a result of the
cyclical recovery and increased demand after the extended period of delayed capital investment.

In our Human Health segment, we experienced strong growth in sales in the diagnostics market related to increased demand for our medical imaging products and continued growth in our prenatal offerings
within the genetic screening business during fiscal year 2010 as compared to fiscal year 2009. The increased demand for our medical imaging products resulted from improved market conditions that lessened the constraints on medical providers’
capital budgets, allowing us to increase our customer base, as well as expanding into non-medical applications. The performance within our genetic screening business was driven by continued expansion of prenatal screening platforms, with broad-based
growth experienced across all major geographies, particularly in China with continued expansion of our newborn screening business through our acquisition of Sym-Bio LifeScience Co., Ltd. (“Sym-Bio”) in fiscal year 2009. In the research
market, demand for our reagents and



instrumentation was encouraging in the academic sector. We saw strong demand for our high-end Opera

®

cellular imaging systems, EnSpire™ plate readers and proprietary Alpha detection reagents, which are all specifically developed to address the growing needs of
the academic sector. We are refocusing resources to meet our pharmaceutical customer’s evolving needs. As these customers shift their spending on downstream technologies in pre-clinical research, we are well positioned with our in-vivo imaging
offering, available through our newly acquired VisEn business. As the rising cost of healthcare continues to be one of the critical issues facing our customers, we anticipate that even with continued pressure on lab budgets and credit availability,
the benefits of providing earlier detection of disease, which can result in savings of long-term health care costs as well as creating better outcomes for patients, are increasingly valued and we expect to see continued growth in these markets.

In our Environmental Health
segment, our laboratory services business enables our customers to drive efficiencies, increase production time and reduce maintenance costs, all of which continue to be critical for our customers. During fiscal year 2010, we continued to grow by
adding new customers to our OneSource

®

multivendor service offering, which we expanded in markets beyond our
traditional customer base and services. Sales of environmental, food and consumer safety and testing products grew in fiscal year 2010 due to the continued global need for robust contaminant identification solutions, particularly for trace metals
analysis in water. This trend drove the demand for our inorganic analysis solutions such as our Optima 7000 and our recently launched NexION

®

mass spectrometer. We also continued to experience strong demand for quality and safety assurance testing equipment in food and pharmaceuticals throughout the global
supply chain. In addition, we continued to see signs of recovery in our traditional chemical markets with the reduction of constraints on capital purchases to rebuild capacity as a result of the cyclical recovery and increased demand after an
extended period of delayed capital investments. We believe that the need for increased inspection, testing and tracking of contaminants will continue to drive increased demand for our products.

Our consolidated gross margins decreased approximately 60
basis points in fiscal year 2010 as compared to fiscal year 2009 due to changes in product mix, with growth in sales of lower gross margin product offerings, partially offset by productivity improvements and cost containment initiatives. Our
consolidated operating margin improved approximately 120 basis points in fiscal year 2010 as compared to fiscal year 2009, primarily the result of increased sales volume and cost containment initiatives, partially offset by restructuring activities,
increased pension expenses, initial costs on key growth initiatives and the early stage dilution from our recent acquisitions, specifically Signature Genomic and VisEn.

We believe we are well positioned to continue to take
advantage of the improved spending trends in our end markets and to promote our efficiencies in markets where current conditions may increase demand for certain services. Overall, we believe that our strategic focus on Human Health and Environmental
Health coupled with our breadth of end markets, deep portfolio of technologies and applications, leading market positions, global scale and financial strength will provide us with a strong foundation for continued growth.

Consolidated Results of Continuing Operations

Sales

2010 Compared to 2009.

Sales for fiscal year
2010 were $1,704.3 million, as compared to $1,550.8 million for fiscal year 2009, an increase of $153.6 million, or 10%, which includes an approximate 2% increase in sales attributable to acquisitions and no net impact from changes in foreign
exchange rates. The analysis in the remainder of this paragraph compares segment sales for fiscal year 2010 as compared to fiscal year 2009 and includes the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions. The total increase in sales
reflects a $64.7 million, or 9%, increase in our Human Health segment sales, due to an increase in diagnostics market sales of $54.5 million and an increase in research market sales of $10.2 million. Our Environmental Health segment sales increased
$88.9 million, or 11%, due to increases in environmental and safety and industrial markets sales of $47.5 million, and an increase in laboratory services market sales of $41.4 million.



2009 Compared to 2008.

Sales for fiscal year 2009 were $1,550.8 million, as
compared to $1,659.7 million for fiscal year 2008, a decrease of $108.9 million, or 7%, which includes an approximate 3% decrease in sales attributable to unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates and an approximate 1% increase from
acquisitions. The analysis in the remainder of this paragraph compares segment sales for fiscal year 2009 as compared to fiscal year 2008 and includes the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions. The total decrease in sales
reflects a $37.0 million, or 5%, decrease in our Human Health segment sales, due to a decrease in diagnostics market sales of $22.8 million and a decrease in research market sales of $14.2 million. Our Environmental Health segment sales decreased
$71.9 million, or 8%, due to decreases in environmental and safety and industrial markets sales of $81.7 million, partially offset by an increase in laboratory services market sales of $9.8 million.

Cost of Sales

2010 Compared to 2009.

Cost of sales for fiscal
year 2010 was $945.7 million, as compared to $851.8 million for fiscal year 2009, an increase of approximately $93.9 million, or 11%. As a percentage of sales, cost of sales increased to 55.5% in fiscal year 2010 from 54.9% in fiscal year 2009,
resulting in a decrease in gross margin of approximately 60 basis points to 44.5% in fiscal year 2010 from 45.1% in fiscal year 2009. Amortization of intangible assets increased and was $42.5 million for fiscal year 2010, as compared to $36.3
million for fiscal year 2009. Stock option expense decreased and was $0.6 million for fiscal year 2010, as compared to $1.2 million for fiscal year 2009. The amortization of purchase accounting adjustments to record the inventory from certain
acquisitions completed in fiscal year 2009 added an expense of approximately $1.1 million for fiscal year 2009. The decrease in gross margin was primarily the result of changes in product mix, with growth in sales in fiscal year 2010 primarily of
lower gross margin product offerings, partially offset by increased sales volume, productivity improvements and cost containment initiatives.

2009 Compared to 2008.

Cost of sales for fiscal year 2009 was $851.8 million, as compared to $926.0 million for fiscal year
2008, a decrease of approximately $74.2 million, or 8%. As a percentage of sales, cost of sales decreased to 54.9% in fiscal year 2009 from 55.8% in fiscal year 2008, resulting in an increase in gross margin of approximately 90 basis points to 45.1%
in fiscal year 2009 from 44.2% in fiscal year 2008. Amortization of intangible assets increased and was $36.3 million for fiscal year 2009, as compared to $35.7 million for fiscal year 2008. Stock option expense decreased and was $1.2 million
for fiscal year 2009, as compared to $1.4 million for fiscal year 2008. The amortization of purchase accounting adjustments to record the inventory from certain acquisitions completed in fiscal year 2009 added an expense of approximately $1.1
million for fiscal year 2009. The increase in gross margin was primarily the result of the combined favorable impact of changes in product mix, especially growth in sales of higher gross margin product offerings, productivity improvements and cost
containment initiatives, partially offset by lower demand.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

2010 Compared to 2009.

Selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal year 2010 were $490.7 million, as compared
to $468.3 million for fiscal year 2009, an increase of approximately $22.4 million, or 5%. As a percentage of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses were 28.8% in fiscal year 2010, compared to 30.2% in fiscal year 2009.
Amortization of intangible assets increased and was $16.6 million for fiscal year 2010, as compared to $15.8 million for fiscal year 2009. Stock option expense decreased and was $5.1 million for fiscal year 2010, as compared to $6.3 million for
fiscal year 2009. The gain on the sale of a facility in Boston, Massachusetts that was damaged in a fire in March 2005 was $3.4 million for fiscal year 2010. Purchase accounting adjustments for contingent consideration and other acquisition costs
related to certain acquisitions added an expense of $2.8 million for fiscal year 2010 and $1.7 million for fiscal year 2009. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily the result of increased sales and marketing
expenses, particularly in emerging territories, increased pension expense and foreign exchange, partially offset by cost containment initiatives.



2009 Compared to 2008.

Selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal
year 2009 were $468.3 million, as compared to $486.4 million for fiscal year 2008, a decrease of approximately $18.1 million, or 4%. As a percentage of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses were 30.2% in fiscal year 2009,
compared to 29.3% in fiscal year 2008. Amortization of intangible assets increased and was $15.8 million for fiscal year 2009, as compared to $15.0 million for fiscal year 2008. Stock option expense decreased and was $6.3 million for fiscal year
2009, as compared to $7.3 million for fiscal year 2008. Purchase accounting adjustments for contingent consideration and other acquisition costs related to certain acquisitions completed in fiscal year 2009 added an expense of approximately $1.7
million for fiscal year 2009. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily the result of cost containment initiatives, partially offset by increased sales and marketing expenses, particularly in emerging territories,
increased pension expenses and foreign exchange.

Research and Development Expenses

2010 Compared to 2009.

Research and development expenses for fiscal year 2010 were $95.4 million, as compared to $90.8 million
for fiscal year 2009, an increase of $4.6 million, or 5%. As a percentage of sales, research and development expenses decreased to 5.6% in fiscal year 2010, as compared to 5.9% in fiscal year 2009. Amortization of intangible assets decreased and was
$1.6 million for fiscal year 2010, as compared to $2.0 million for fiscal year 2009. Research and development expenses also included stock option expense of $0.4 million for each of the fiscal years 2010 and 2009. We directed research and
development efforts similarly during fiscal years 2010 and 2009, primarily toward the diagnostics and research markets within our Human Health segment, and the environmental and safety, and laboratory service and support markets within our
Environmental Health segment, in order to help accelerate our growth initiatives.

2009 Compared to 2008.

Research and development expenses for fiscal year 2009 were $90.8 million, as compared to $93.0 million for fiscal year 2008, a decrease of $2.3 million, or 2%. As a
percentage of sales, research and development expenses increased to 5.9% in fiscal year 2009, as compared to 5.6% in fiscal year 2008. Amortization of intangible assets decreased and was $2.0 million for fiscal year 2009, as compared to $2.1 million
for fiscal year 2008. Research and development expenses also included stock option expense of $0.4 million for each of the fiscal years 2009 and 2008. We directed research and development efforts similarly during fiscal years 2009 and 2008,
primarily toward the diagnostics and research markets within our Human Health segment, and the environmental and safety, and laboratory service and support markets within our Environmental Health segment, in order to help accelerate our growth
initiatives.

Restructuring and Lease
Charges, Net

We have undertaken a series
of restructuring actions related to the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, alignment with our growth strategy and the integration of our business units. Restructuring and lease charges, net, for fiscal year 2010 were a $19.0 million charge, as
compared to an $18.0 million charge for fiscal year 2009 and a $6.7 million charge for fiscal year 2008.



The following table summarizes our restructuring accrual balances and related activity by
restructuring plan during fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008:

The restructuring plan for the
fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010 was intended principally to shift resources to higher growth geographic regions and end markets. The restructuring plans for the second quarter of fiscal year 2010 and the third quarter of fiscal year 2009 were
intended principally to reduce resources in response to the continued economic downturn and its impact on demand in certain end markets and to shift resources to higher growth geographic regions and end markets. The restructuring plan for the first
quarter of fiscal year 2009 was intended principally to reduce resources in response to the economic downturn and its impact on demand in certain end markets. The activities associated with these plans have been reported as restructuring expenses
and are included as a component of operating expenses from continuing operations. We expect the impact of immediate cost savings from these restructuring plans on operating results and cash flows to approximately offset the increased spending in
higher growth regions and the decline in revenue from certain products, respectively. We expect the impact of future cost savings from these restructuring activities on operating results and cash flows to be negligible, as we will incur offsetting
costs.

Q4 2010 Plan

During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010, our
management approved a plan to shift resources to higher growth geographic regions and end markets (our “Q4 2010 Plan”). As a result of our Q4 2010 Plan, we recognized a $5.6 million pre-tax restructuring charge in our Human Health segment
related to a workforce reduction from reorganization activities and the closure of excess facility space. We also recognized a $7.6 million pre-tax restructuring charge in our Environmental Health segment related to a workforce reduction from
reorganization activities and the closure of excess facility space. The restructuring costs for the closure of excess facility space was offset by the recognition of a $2.8 million gain that had been deferred from a previous sales-leaseback
transaction on this facility.

As part of our Q4
2010 Plan, we reduced headcount by 113 employees. All notifications and actions related to our Q4 2010 Plan were completed by January 2, 2011. All employee relationships have been severed and we anticipate that the remaining severance payments
of $7.9 million for workforce reductions will be completed by the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012. We also anticipate that the remaining payments of $4.1 million for the closure of excess facility space will be paid through fiscal year
2022, in accordance with the terms of the applicable leases.



The following table summarizes the components of our Q4 2010 Plan activity recognized by
segment:

Q2 2010 Plan

During the second quarter of fiscal year 2010, our
management approved a plan to reduce resources in response to the continued economic downturn and its impact on demand in certain end markets and to shift resources to higher growth geographic regions and end markets (our “Q2 2010 Plan”).
As a result of our Q2 2010 Plan, we recognized a $7.0 million pre-tax restructuring charge in our Human Health segment related to a workforce reduction from reorganization activities and the closure of excess facility space. The restructuring costs
for the closure of excess facility space was offset by the recognition of a $0.1 million gain that had been deferred from a previous sales-leaseback transaction on this facility. We also recognized a $3.9 million pre-tax restructuring charge in our
Environmental Health segment related to a workforce reduction from reorganization activities.

As part of our Q2 2010 Plan, we reduced headcount by 115 employees. All notifications and actions related to our Q2 2010 Plan were completed by July 4, 2010. All employee relationships have been
severed and we anticipate that the remaining severance payments of $2.2 million for workforce reductions will be completed by the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011. We also anticipate that the remaining payments of $2.1 million for the
closure of excess facility space will be paid through fiscal year 2022, in accordance with the terms of the applicable lease.

The following table summarizes the components of our Q2 2010 Plan activity recognized by segment:

Q3 2009 Plan

During the third quarter of fiscal year 2009, our management
approved a plan to reduce resources in anticipation of the economic downturn and its impact on demand in certain end markets and to shift resources to higher growth geographic regions and end markets (our “Q3 2009 Plan”). As a result of
our Q3 2009 Plan, we recognized a $4.3 million pre-tax restructuring charge in our Human Health segment related to a workforce reduction from reorganization activities and the closure of an excess facility. We also recognized a $6.3 million pre-tax
restructuring charge in our Environmental Health segment related to a workforce reduction from reorganization activities. During fiscal year 2010, we recorded a pre-tax restructuring reversal of $0.5 million relating to our Q3 2009 Plan due to lower
than expected costs associated with the workforce reductions in Europe within both of our Human Health and Environmental Health segments.



As part of our Q3 2009 Plan, we reduced headcount by 131 employees. All notifications and
actions related to our Q3 2009 Plan were completed by October 4, 2009. All employee relationships have been severed and we anticipate that the remaining severance payments of $2.0 million for workforce reductions will be completed by the end of
the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011. We also anticipate that the remaining payments of $0.1 million for the closure of the excess facility will be paid through fiscal year 2011, in accordance with the terms of the applicable lease.

The following table summarizes the components of our Q3 2009
Plan activity recognized by segment:

Q1 2009 Plan

During the first quarter of fiscal year 2009, our management
approved a plan to reduce resources in anticipation of the economic downturn and its impact on demand in certain end markets (our “Q1 2009 Plan”). As a result of our Q1 2009 Plan, we recognized a $4.8 million pre-tax restructuring charge
in our Human Health segment related to a workforce reduction from reorganization activities and the closure of an excess facility. We also recognized a $2.4 million pre-tax restructuring charge in our Environmental Health segment related to a
workforce reduction from reorganization activities and the closure of an excess facility. During fiscal year 2010, we recorded a pre-tax restructuring reversal of $1.2 million relating to our Q1 2009 Plan due to lower than expected costs associated
with the workforce reductions in Europe within both of our Human Health and Environmental Health segments.

As part of our Q1 2009 Plan, we reduced headcount by 106 employees. All notifications and actions related to our Q1 2009 Plan were
completed by April 5, 2009. All employee relationships have been severed and we anticipate that the remaining severance payments of $0.4 million for workforce reductions will be completed by the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011. We
also anticipate that the remaining payments of $0.2 million for the closure of the excess facility will be paid through fiscal year 2012, in accordance with the terms of the applicable lease.

The following table summarizes the components of our Q1 2009 Plan activity recognized by segment:

Previous Restructuring and Integration
Plans

The principal actions of the
restructuring and integration plans from fiscal years 2001 through 2008 were workforce reductions related to the integration of our businesses in order to reduce costs and achieve operational efficiencies as well as workforce reductions in both our
Human Health and Environmental Health segments by shifting resources into geographic regions and product lines that are more consistent with our growth strategy. During fiscal year 2010, we paid $1.5 million related to these plans, recorded a
reversal of $0.9 million related to lower than expected costs associated with workforce reductions in Europe within both the Human Health and Environmental Health segments, and recorded a charge of $0.4 million to reduce the estimated sublease
rental



payments reasonably expected to be obtained for an excess facility in Europe within our Environmental Health segment. As of January 2, 2011, we had approximately $3.7 million of remaining
liabilities associated with these restructuring and integration plans, primarily for residual lease obligations related to closed facilities in both our Human Health and Environmental Health segments. Payments for these leases, the terms of which
vary in length, will be made through fiscal year 2022.

Lease Charges

To facilitate the sale of a business in fiscal year 2001, we were required to guarantee the lease obligations that the buyer assumed
related to the lease for the building in which the business operated. The lease obligations continue through March 2011. While we assigned our interest in the lease to the buyer at the time of the sale of the business, the buyer subsequently
defaulted under the lease, and the lessor sought reimbursement from us. We recorded a charge of $2.7 million in fiscal year 2007 related to payments for this lease obligation. The buyer filed for bankruptcy protection during the third quarter of
fiscal year 2008 and was delinquent in making both its lease payments and payments for certain building expenses. The buyer ceased operations in the third quarter of fiscal year 2009 and vacated the property. We recorded an additional charge of $0.9
million during the third quarter of fiscal year 2009 related to waste removal and restoration costs, and reduced the estimated sublease rental payments reasonably expected to be obtained for the property. We also recorded an additional charge of
$0.1 million during the second quarter of fiscal year 2010 to further reduce the estimated sublease rental payments reasonably expected to be obtained for the property. We were required to make payments for these obligations of $1.7 million during
fiscal year 2010, $1.1 million during fiscal year 2009, and $0.4 million during fiscal year 2008. The remaining balance of this accrual as of January 2, 2011 was $0.5 million.

Interest and Other (Income) Expense, Net

Interest and other (income) expense,
net, consisted of the following:

2010 Compared to
2009.

Interest and other (income) expense, net for fiscal year 2010 was income of $8.4 million, as compared to an expense of $15.8 million for fiscal year 2009, an increase of $24.2 million. The increase in interest and other (income)
expense, net, in fiscal year 2010 as compared to fiscal year 2009 was primarily due to the pre-tax gain of $25.6 million related to the required re-measurement to fair value of our previously held equity interest in the ICPMS Joint Venture. Interest
expense decreased by $0.1 million and interest income decreased by $0.2 million in fiscal year 2010 as compared to fiscal year 2009, primarily due to lower interest rates. Other expenses for fiscal year 2010 as compared to fiscal year 2009 increased
by $1.3 million, which consisted primarily of expenses related to foreign currency transactions and foreign currency translation. A more complete discussion of our liquidity is set forth below under the heading “Liquidity and Capital
Resources.”

2009 Compared to
2008.

Interest and other (income) expense, net for fiscal year 2009 was an expense of $15.8 million, as compared to an expense of $44.0 million for fiscal year 2008, a decrease of $28.3 million. The decrease in interest and other (income)
expense, net, in fiscal year 2009 as compared to fiscal year 2008 was primarily due to the discontinuance and settlement of forward interest rate contracts with a $17.5 million loss that



was recognized into interest expense during fiscal year 2008, as well as lower interest rates on outstanding debt balances, partially offset by the increase in the mix of our fixed rate versus
variable rate debt. Interest income decreased $3.0 million as a result of lower interest rates on lower cash balances. Other expenses for fiscal year 2009 as compared to fiscal year 2008 decreased by $7.3 million, and consisted primarily of expenses
related to foreign currency transactions and foreign currency translation.

Provision for Income Taxes

2010 Compared to 2009.

The fiscal year 2010 provision for income taxes on continuing operations was $26.1 million, as compared to a provision of $31.8 million for fiscal year 2009. The
effective tax rate on continuing operations was 16.1% for fiscal year 2010 as compared to 30.0% for fiscal year 2009. The lower effective tax rate in fiscal year 2010 was primarily due to (i) the favorable impact related to the gain on the
previously held equity interest in the ICPMS Joint Venture, and (ii) the favorable settlement of several income tax audits worldwide during fiscal year 2010. See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on
Form 10-K for further discussion of these settlements.

2009 Compared to 2008.

The fiscal year 2009 provision for income taxes on continuing operations was $31.8 million, as compared to a provision of $12.7 million for fiscal year 2008. The
effective tax rate on continuing operations was 30.0% for fiscal year 2009 as compared to 12.3% for fiscal year 2008. The higher effective tax rate in fiscal year 2009 was primarily due to an increase in the expected mix of profits from higher tax
rate jurisdictions in fiscal year 2009 as compared to fiscal year 2008 and reflects the favorable settlement of several income tax audits worldwide in fiscal year 2008. See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual
report on Form 10-K for further discussion of these settlements.

Discontinued Operations

As part of our continuing efforts to focus on higher growth opportunities, we have discontinued certain businesses. We have accounted for
these businesses as discontinued operations and, accordingly, have presented the results of operations and related cash flows as discontinued operations for all periods presented. The assets and liabilities of these businesses have been presented
separately, and are reflected within the assets and liabilities from discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of January 2, 2011 and January 3, 2010.

We recorded the following pre-tax gains and losses, which
have been reported as a gain (loss) on disposition of discontinued operations during the three fiscal years ended:

In November 2010, we sold our
Illumination and Detection Solutions (“IDS”) business, which was included in our Environmental Health segment, for approximately $500.0 million, $482.0 million net of payments for acquired cash balances, subject to an adjustment for
working capital as of the closing date. We expect the divestiture of our IDS business to reduce the complexity of our product offerings and organizational structure,



and to provide capital to reinvest in other Human Health and Environmental Health end markets. The buyer acquired our IDS business through the purchase of all outstanding stock of certain of our
subsidiaries located in Germany, Canada, China, Indonesia, the Philippines, the United Kingdom and the United States as well as the purchase of related assets and the assumption of liabilities held by us and certain of our subsidiaries located in
Singapore and Germany. We recognized a pre-tax gain of $315.3 million, inclusive of the net working capital adjustment, in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010 as a result of the sale of our IDS business. The gain was recognized as a gain on the
disposition of discontinued operations.

As part
of our strategic business alignment into our Human Health and Environmental Health segments, completed at the beginning of fiscal year 2009, and our continuing efforts to focus on higher growth opportunities, in December 2008, our management
approved separate plans to divest our Photonics and Photoflash businesses. The distressed economic conditions during fiscal year 2009 adversely impacted our plan to market and sell the Photonics and Photoflash businesses. We implemented a number of
actions during fiscal year 2009 to respond to these changing circumstances and continued to actively market these businesses. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009, we determined that we could not effectively market and sell the Photonics
business given the changed circumstances and, after careful consideration, we decided to cease our plan to actively market and sell the Photonics business on a standalone basis. The Photonics business was included with the set of businesses which
were sold as our IDS business, as described above. In June 2010, we sold the Photoflash business for approximately $13.5 million, including a net working capital adjustment, plus potential additional contingent consideration. We recognized a pre-tax
gain of $4.4 million, inclusive of the net working capital adjustment, in the second quarter of fiscal year 2010 as a result of the sale. The gain was recognized as a gain on the disposition of discontinued operations.

In addition, during December 2008, our management approved
the shut down of certain instrument businesses within our Human Health segment, including the Cellular Screening Fluorescence and Luminescence workstations, Analytical Proteomics Instruments and Proteomics and Genomics Instruments, which resulted in
a pre-tax gain of $0.1 million, a pre-tax gain of $0.4 million and a pre-tax loss of $4.8 million related to lease and severance costs and the reduction of fixed assets and inventory to net realizable value during fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008,
respectively.

In November
2007, we acquired ViaCell, which specializes in the collection, testing, processing and preservation of umbilical cord blood stem cells. Following the ViaCell acquisition, our Board of Directors (our “Board”) approved a plan to sell the
ViaCyte

SM

and Cellular Therapy Technology businesses
that were acquired with ViaCell. We determined that both businesses did not strategically fit with the other products offered by our Human Health segment. We also determined that without investing capital into the operations of both businesses, we
could not effectively compete with larger companies that focus on the market for such products. After careful consideration, we decided in the second quarter of fiscal year 2008 to shut down the ViaCyte

SM

and Cellular Therapy Technology businesses. We recorded a
pre-tax loss of $8.0 million for severance and facility closure costs during fiscal year 2008 and recorded additional pre-tax losses of $0.1 million and $1.3 million related to facility closure costs during fiscal years 2010 and 2009, respectively.

During fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, we
settled various commitments related to the divestiture of other discontinued operations and recognized a pre-tax loss of $1.8 million in fiscal year 2010, a pre-tax loss of $2.1 million in fiscal year 2009 and a pre-tax loss of $0.4 million in
fiscal year 2008. During fiscal year 2009, we reached a settlement with the landlord of a closed facility and recognized a pre-tax loss of $1.4 million.



Summary pre-tax operating results of the discontinued operations for the periods prior to
disposition were as follows:

We recognized a tax provision of
$94.0 million on discontinued operations in fiscal year 2010, a tax provision of $4.6 million on discontinued operations in fiscal year 2009 and a tax benefit of $2.1 million in fiscal year 2008 on discontinued operations. The recognition of $94.0
million income tax expense in fiscal year 2010 includes $16.0 million of income tax expense associated with unremitted earnings of directly-owned foreign subsidiaries that no longer qualify as permanently reinvested once the subsidiary is held for
sale, and $65.8 million of income tax expense for additional unremitted earnings from foreign subsidiaries associated with the sale of our IDS and Photoflash businesses that do not require the same level of capital as previously required, and
therefore we plan to repatriate $250.0 million of cash and have provided for the taxes on the related previously unremitted earnings. The benefit from income taxes of $2.1 million recorded in discontinued operations in fiscal year 2008 includes $8.5
million of income tax benefits related to the favorable settlement of several income tax audits worldwide during the third quarter of fiscal year 2008. See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K
for further discussion of these settlements.

Business
Combinations and Asset Purchases

Acquisition of chemagen Biopolymer-Technologie AG.

In February 2011, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of chemagen
Biopolymer-Technologie AG (“chemagen”). chemagen manufactures and sells nucleic acid sample preparation systems and reagents utilizing M-PVA magnetic bead technology. We expect this acquisition to enhance our genetic screening business by
expanding our product offerings to diagnostics, academic and industrial end markets. We paid the shareholders of chemagen approximately $35.0 million in cash at the closing for the stock of chemagen, plus potential additional consideration of up to
$20.3 million. The purchase price is also subject to potential adjustments for chemagen’s indebtedness, working capital as of the closing date, and indemnification obligations of chemagen’s equity holders. The excess of the purchase price
over the fair value of the acquired net assets represents cost and revenue synergies specific to us as well as non-capitalizable intangible assets, such as the employee workforce acquired, and will be allocated to goodwill, none of which will be tax
deductible. We expect to report the operations for this acquisition within the results of our Human Health segment from the acquisition date.

Acquisition of VisEn Medical Inc.

In July 2010, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of VisEn Medical Inc.
(“VisEn”). VisEn is an

in vivo

molecular imaging technology company. We expect this acquisition to enhance our cellular imaging business by expanding our technologies and capabilities into preclinical research undertaken in academic
institutes and pharmaceutical companies. We paid the equity holders of VisEn $23.0 million in cash for the stock of VisEn, of which $18.2 million was paid at closing and an additional amount of $4.8 million is held in an escrow account to secure
potential adjustments for VisEn’s indebtedness, working capital as of the closing date, and indemnification obligations of VisEn’s equity holders. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010, we finalized the purchase price and related
allocation resulting in an increase in deferred tax assets, included in long-term liabilities, of $8.5 million and a decrease in goodwill of $8.5 million. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets represents
cost and revenue synergies specific to us as well as non-capitalizable intangible assets, such as the employee workforce acquired, and has been allocated to goodwill, none of which is tax deductible. We have reported the operations for this
acquisition within the results of our Human Health segment from the acquisition date.



Acquisition of Signature Genomic Laboratories, LLC.

In May 2010, we
acquired all of the outstanding stock of SGL Newco, Inc., the parent company of Signature Genomic Laboratories, LLC (“Signature Genomic”). Signature Genomic is a provider of diagnostic cytogenetic testing of chromosome abnormalities in
individuals with unexplained physical and developmental disabilities. We expect this acquisition to expand our existing genetic testing business and expand our position in early detection of disease, specifically in the molecular diagnostics market.
We paid the equity holders of Signature Genomic $90.0 million in cash, of which $77.5 million was paid at closing and an additional amount of $12.5 million is held in an escrow account to secure certain adjustments for Signature Genomic’s
indebtedness, working capital as of the closing date, and indemnification obligations of Signature Genomic’s equity holders. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets represents cost and revenue synergies
specific to us as well as non-capitalizable intangible assets, such as the employee workforce acquired, and has been allocated to goodwill, none of which is tax deductible. We have reported the operations for this acquisition within the results of
our Human Health segment from the acquisition date.

Acquisition of Remaining Interest in the Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry Joint Venture.

In May 2010, we acquired
the remaining fifty percent equity interest in our joint venture (the “ICPMS Joint Venture”) with the company previously known as MDS, Inc. for the development and manufacturing of our Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry
(“ICPMS”) product line and other related tangible assets from DH Technologies Development Pte Ltd., a subsidiary of Danaher Corporation (“Danaher”). We expect this acquisition will help support the continued success of the
premier ICPMS product line by allowing us to direct development with a dedicated and consistent approach. The fair value of the acquisition was $67.7 million, including cash consideration of $35.0 million, non-cash consideration of $2.6 million for
certain non-exclusive rights to intangible assets owned by us, and $30.4 million representing the fair value of our fifty percent equity interest in the ICPMS Joint Venture held prior to the acquisition. We recognized a pre-tax gain of $25.6 million
from the re-measurement to fair value of our previously held equity interest in the ICPMS Joint Venture. This pre-tax gain is reported in interest and other (income) expense, net, for fiscal year 2010. The excess of the purchase price over the fair
value of the acquired net assets represents cost and revenue synergies specific to us as well as non-capitalizable intangible assets, and has been allocated to goodwill, none of which is tax deductible. We have reported the operations for this
acquisition within the results of our Environmental Health segment from the acquisition date.

Purchase of Intangible Assets from GE Healthcare.

In September 2009, we purchased the core technology and patents of GE Healthcare’s 3H and 14C Catalog Radiochemicals, Scintillation
Proximity Assay (“SPA”) reagents and Cytostar-T plate portfolios for aggregate consideration of $12.0 million in cash. The Catalog Radiochemical products are used for a variety of research applications, including screening of
potential drug candidates through binding assays. The SPA bead-based light-emitting assay and Cytostar-T plate technologies are offerings that enable the automation of High Throughput Screening (“HTS”) processes to help drug discovery
researchers determine if potential new drug compounds are effective against their intended disease targets. We expect that incorporation of these technologies will strengthen our G-protein-coupled receptor and Kinase research product lines and
complement our HTS and research reagent solutions. The core technology and patents that we purchased do not meet the definition of a business, as the purchased assets were not accompanied by any associated processes. As a result, purchased
intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. We have reported the amortization of these intangible assets within the results of our Human Health segment from the purchase date. We periodically review the carrying value of these
assets based, in part, upon current estimated market values and our projections of anticipated future cash flows.

Acquisition of Sym-Bio LifeScience Co., Ltd.

In August 2009, we acquired the outstanding equity interests of Sym-Bio
LifeScience Co., Ltd. (“Sym-Bio”). Sym-Bio is a major supplier of diagnostics instruments and related reagents, particularly in the area of infectious diseases, to hospitals in China. We expect this acquisition to expand our access to the
hospital market segment in China, offering a larger base from which to expand our prenatal and newborn screening business in the country and providing us with a significant diagnostics manufacturing and research and development base within China.
The excess of the purchase price over the fair



value of the acquired net assets represents cost and revenue synergies specific to us as well as non-capitalizable intangible assets, such as the employee workforce acquired. We paid the
shareholders of Sym-Bio approximately $51.2 million in cash for this acquisition plus an additional amount of $12.5 million held in an escrow account for contingencies, of which $7.3 million is for potential additional contingent consideration
with a fair value of $6.9 million at the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets has been allocated to goodwill, none of which is tax deductible. We have reported the operations for this
acquisition within the results of our Human Health segment from the acquisition date.

Acquisition of Analytica of Branford, Inc.

In May 2009, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of Analytica of Branford, Inc. (“Analytica”). Analytica is a leading developer of
mass spectrometry and ion source technology. This acquisition allows us to offer our customers access to critical technologies such as time-of-flight and quadrupole mass spectrometers and new ion sources that provide more complete information as
well as better throughput. We also gained significant intellectual property in the field of mass spectrometry and ion source technology. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets represents cost and revenue
synergies specific to us as well as non-capitalizable intangible assets, such as the employee workforce acquired. We paid the shareholders of Analytica approximately $21.7 million in cash for this acquisition. During the first quarter of fiscal
year 2010, we agreed to pay approximately $1.1 million to the shareholders of Analytica as additional purchase price for the election to treat the acquisition as a deemed asset sale. Based on the effect of this election, at the acquisition date we
have retrospectively adjusted the fiscal year 2009 comparative information. The adjustment resulted in a decrease in deferred tax liability, included in long-term liabilities, of $6.3 million, an increase in accrued expenses of $1.1 million and an
increase in other current assets of $0.2 million, offset by a decrease in goodwill of $5.4 million. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets has been allocated to goodwill, all of which is tax deductible. We
have reported the operations for this acquisition within the results of our Environmental Health segment from the acquisition date.

Allocations of the purchase price for acquisitions are based on estimates of the fair value of the net assets acquired and are subject to
adjustment upon finalization of the purchase price allocation. The accounting for business combinations requires estimates and judgments as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business, and the allocation of those cash flows to
identifiable intangible assets, in determining the estimated fair values for assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including contingent consideration,
are based on management’s estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. Contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the
acquisition date with changes in the fair value after the acquisition date affecting earnings to the extent it is to be settled in cash. If the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these fair values, the amounts recorded in
the financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill, or require acceleration of the amortization expense of finite-lived intangible assets. We do not consider these acquisitions to be material to our
results of operations and is therefore not presenting pro forma financial information of operations. We have also determined that the presentation of the results of operations for each of these acquisitions, from the date of acquisition, is
impracticable due to the integration of the operations upon acquisition. See Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional details.

As of January 2, 2011, the purchase price and related
allocation for the acquisitions completed in fiscal years 2010 and 2009 were final. For acquisitions completed subsequent to fiscal year 2008, during the measurement period, we will adjust assets or liabilities if new information is obtained about
facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have resulted in the recognition of those assets and liabilities as of that date. Adjustments to the initial allocation of the purchase price during the
measurement period require the revision of comparative prior period financial information when reissued in subsequent financial statements. The effect of measurement period adjustments to the allocation of the purchase price would be as if the
adjustments had been completed on the acquisition date. The effects of measurement period adjustments may cause changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income or expense recognized in prior periods. All changes that do not qualify as
measurement period adjustments are included in current period earnings.



Contingencies, Including Tax Matters

We are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at our current and former
locations and, along with other companies, have been named a potentially responsible party (“PRP”) for certain waste disposal sites. We accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period that our responsibility is established and
when the cost can be reasonably estimated. We have accrued $6.0 million as of January 2, 2011, which represents our management’s estimate of the total cost of ultimate disposition of known environmental matters. This amount is not
discounted and does not reflect the recovery of any amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements. These cost estimates are subject to a number of variables, including the stage of the environmental investigations, the magnitude of the
possible contamination, the nature of the potential remedies, possible joint and several liability, the time period over which remediation may occur, and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations. For sites where we have been named a
PRP, our management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute. We expect that the majority of such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to
ten years. As assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site, these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available. There have been no environmental problems to date that have
had, or are expected to have, a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. While it is possible that a loss exceeding the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may be incurred, the potential exposure is not
expected to be materially different from those amounts recorded.

Enzo Biochem, Inc. and Enzo Life Sciences, Inc. (collectively, “Enzo”) filed a complaint dated October 23, 2002 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York,
Civil Action No. 02-8448, against Amersham plc, Amersham BioSciences, PerkinElmer, Inc., PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Inc., Sigma-Aldrich Corporation, Sigma Chemical Company, Inc., Molecular Probes, Inc., and Orchid BioSciences, Inc. (the
“New York Case”). The complaint alleges that we have breached our distributorship and settlement agreements with Enzo, infringed Enzo’s patents, engaged in unfair competition and fraud, and committed torts against Enzo by, among other
things, engaging in commercial development and exploitation of Enzo’s patented products and technology, separately and together with the other defendants. Enzo seeks injunctive and monetary relief. In 2003, the court severed the lawsuit and
ordered Enzo to serve individual complaints against the five defendants. We subsequently filed an answer and a counterclaim alleging that Enzo’s patents are invalid. In July 2006, the court issued a decision regarding the construction of the
claims in Enzo’s patents that effectively limited the coverage of certain of those claims and, we believe, excludes certain of our products from the coverage of Enzo’s patents. Summary judgment motions were filed by the defendants in
January 2007, and a hearing with oral argument on those motions took place in July 2007. In January 2009, the case was assigned to a new district court judge and in March 2009, the new judge denied the pending summary judgment motions without
prejudice and ordered a stay of the case until the federal appellate court decides Enzo’s appeal of the judgment of the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut in Enzo Biochem vs. Applera Corp. and Tropix, Inc. (the
“Connecticut Case”), which involves a number of the same patents and which could materially affect the scope of Enzo’s case against us. On March 26, 2010, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
(“CAFC”) affirmed-in-part and reversed-in-part the judgment in the Connecticut Case. Pending further disposition of the Connecticut Case, the New York Case against us and other defendants remains stayed.

We believe we have meritorious defenses to the matter
described above, and we are contesting the action vigorously. While this matter is subject to uncertainty, in the opinion of our management, based on its review of the information available at this time, the resolution of this matter will not have a
material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.

We re-measured several of our uncertain tax positions related to fiscal years 2006 through 2009 during fiscal years 2010 and 2009 based on
new information arising from events during the year that affected positions for those years. We also effectively settled several income tax audits worldwide. The re-measurements and closure of audits included uncertain tax positions in Hong Kong,
the United Kingdom, Australia, the Philippines, and the federal and certain state governments within the United States. The net effect of these re-measurements and closure of audits, statute of limitations lapses, provision to return adjustments,
interest expense accruals, as



well as other discrete items, resulted in the recognition of $11.9 million of income tax benefits in continuing operations during fiscal year 2010 and $1.7 million of income tax benefits in
continuing operations during fiscal year 2009. During fiscal year 2008, we effectively settled several income tax audits worldwide, including in Canada, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States covering various years ranging from
1998 through 2005. The closing of these audits resulted in the recognition of $15.6 million of income tax benefits in continuing operations and $8.5 million of income tax benefits in discontinued operations. Tax years ranging from 2000 through
2010 remain open to examination by various tax jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations, such as Singapore, Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States. The tax years under examination vary by jurisdiction. We
regularly review our tax positions in each significant taxing jurisdiction in the process of evaluating our unrecognized tax benefits. We make adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits when: (i) facts and circumstances regarding a tax
position change, causing a change in management’s judgment regarding that tax position; (ii) a tax position is effectively settled with a tax authority; and/or (iii) the statute of limitations expires regarding a tax position.

We are also subject to various other claims,
legal proceedings and investigations covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities. Although we have established accruals for potential losses that we believe are probable and reasonably estimable, in
the opinion of our management, based on its review of the information available at this time, the total cost of resolving these other contingencies at January 2, 2011 should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial
statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K. However, each of these matters is subject to uncertainties, and it is possible that some of these matters may be resolved unfavorably to us.

Reporting Segment Results of Continuing Operations

Human Health

2010 Compared to 2009.

Sales for fiscal year
2010 were $796.3 million, as compared to $731.6 million for fiscal year 2009, an increase of $64.7 million, or 9%, which includes an approximate 3% increase in sales attributable to acquisitions and no net impact from changes in foreign exchange
rates. The analysis in the remainder of this paragraph compares selected sales by product type for fiscal year 2010, as compared to fiscal year 2009, and includes the effect of foreign exchange fluctuations and acquisitions. The increase in sales in
our Human Health segment was primarily a result of an increase in diagnostics market sales of $54.5 million and an increase in research market sales of $10.2 million. This increase in our Human Health segment sales during fiscal year 2010 was due
primarily to the increased demand for our medical imaging products in the diagnostics market, as well as increased growth in the academic sector for both instruments and reagents in the research market. The demand for our medical imaging products
resulted from improved market conditions that eased the constraints on medical providers’ capital budgets allowing us to increase our customer base, including expanding into non-medical applications. These increases were partially offset by
tight inventory management in state and national labs for neonatal screening in the diagnostics market, as well as customer consolidations in the pharmaceutical market and by the continued constrained capital spending within our pharmaceutical
customers in the research market.

Operating
income from continuing operations for fiscal year 2010 was $96.5 million, as compared to $80.6 million for fiscal year 2009, an increase of $15.9 million, or 20%. Amortization of intangible assets was $46.7 million and $41.3 million for fiscal year
2010 and fiscal year 2009, respectively. Restructuring and lease charges were $10.4 million for fiscal year 2010 as a result of our Q2 2010 and Q4 2010 Plans, as compared to $9.2 million for fiscal year 2009 as a result of our Q1 2009 and Q3 2009
Plans. The gain on the sale of a facility in Boston, Massachusetts that was damaged in a fire in March 2005 was $3.4 million for fiscal year 2010. Purchase accounting adjustments for contingent consideration and other acquisition costs related to
certain acquisitions added an expense of $1.3 million for each of the fiscal years 2010 and 2009. The amortization of purchase accounting adjustments to record the inventory from certain acquisitions completed in fiscal year 2009 was $1.1 million.
Increased sales volume and cost containment initiatives increased operating income for fiscal year 2010,



which was partially offset by changes in product mix with growth in sales in fiscal year 2010 primarily of lower gross margin product offerings, increased sales and marketing expenses,
particularly in emerging territories, increased pension expenses and foreign exchange.

2009 Compared to 2008.

Sales for fiscal year 2009 were $731.6 million, as compared to $768.7 million for fiscal year 2008, a decrease of $37.0 million, or 5%, which includes an approximate 3%
decrease in sales attributable to unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates, partially offset by an approximate 1% increase from acquisitions. The analysis in the remainder of this paragraph compares selected sales by product type for fiscal
year 2009, as compared to fiscal year 2008, and includes the effect of foreign exchange fluctuations and acquisitions. The decrease in sales in our Human Health segment reflects a decrease in diagnostics market sales of $22.8 million and a decrease
in research market sales of $14.2 million. This decline in our Human Health segment sales during fiscal year 2009 was due primarily to the decreased demand for our medical imaging products in the diagnostics market, which has resulted from
constraints on medical providers’ capital budgets and a lack of financing availability, as well as government stimulus related order delays in the research market, as many of our customers were redirecting their budgets in hopes of obtaining
grants for larger instrument purchases.

Operating
income from continuing operations for fiscal year 2009 was $80.6 million, as compared to $79.7 million for fiscal year 2008, an increase of $0.8 million, or 1%. Amortization of intangible assets was $41.3 million and $40.7 million for fiscal year
2009 and fiscal year 2008, respectively. Restructuring and lease charges were $9.2 million for fiscal year 2009 as a result of our Q1 2009 and Q3 2009 Plans. Restructuring and lease charges were $3.7 million for fiscal year 2008 as a result of
our Q3 2008 Plan. Purchase accounting adjustments for other acquisition costs related to certain acquisitions completed in fiscal year 2009 added an expense of approximately $1.3 million. The amortization of purchase accounting adjustments to record
the inventory from certain acquisitions completed in fiscal year 2009 added an expense of approximately $1.2 million for fiscal year 2009. The favorable impact of changes in product mix, especially growth in sales of higher gross margin products,
productivity improvements and cost containment initiatives increased operating income, which was partially offset by lower demand, increased sales and marketing expenses, particularly in emerging territories, increased pension expenses and foreign
exchange.

Environmental Health

2010 Compared to 2009.

Sales
for fiscal year 2010 were $908.0 million, as compared to $819.1 million for fiscal year 2009, an increase of $88.9 million, or 11%, which includes no net impact in sales attributable to changes in foreign exchange rates or acquisitions. The analysis
in the remainder of this paragraph compares selected sales by product type for fiscal year 2010, as compared to fiscal year 2009, and includes the effect of foreign exchange fluctuations and acquisitions. The increase in sales in our Environmental
Health segment was primarily a result of increases in environmental and safety and industrial markets sales of $47.5 million, and an increase in laboratory services market sales of $41.4 million. This increase in our Environmental Health segment
sales during fiscal year 2010 was due primarily to the increase in our OneSource

®

multivendor service offering,
which we expanded in markets beyond our traditional customer base and services, as well as growth in our environmental, food and consumer safety and testing products. We also experienced continued growth in traditional chemical markets with the
reduction of constraints on capital purchases to rebuild capacity as a result of the cyclical recovery and increased demand after the extended period of delayed capital investment.

Operating income from continuing operations for fiscal year
2010 was $92.3 million, as compared to $75.5 million for fiscal year 2009, an increase of $16.8 million, or 22%. Amortization of intangible assets was $14.0 million and $12.8 million for fiscal year 2010 and fiscal year 2009, respectively.
Restructuring and lease charges were $8.5 million for fiscal year 2010 as a result of our Q2 2010 and Q4 2010 Plans, as compared to $8.8 million for fiscal year 2009 as a result of our Q1 2009 and Q3 2009 Plans. Purchase accounting adjustments for
contingent consideration and other acquisition costs related to certain acquisitions added an expense of $1.5 million for fiscal year 2010, as compared to an expense of $0.3 million for fiscal year 2009. Increased sales volume and cost containment
initiatives increased operating income for fiscal year 2010, which was partially



offset by changes in product mix with growth in sales in fiscal year 2010 primarily of lower gross margin product offerings, increased sales and marketing expenses, particularly in emerging
territories, increased pension expenses and foreign exchange.

2009 Compared to 2008.

Sales for fiscal year 2009 were $819.1 million, as compared to $891.0 million for fiscal year 2008, a decrease of $71.9 million, or 8%, which includes an approximate 3%
decrease in sales attributable to unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates, partially offset by an approximate 1% increase from acquisitions. The analysis in the remainder of this paragraph compares selected sales by product type for fiscal
year 2009, as compared to fiscal year 2008, and includes the effect of foreign exchange fluctuations and acquisitions. The decrease in sales in our Environmental Health segment reflects decreases in environmental and safety and industrial markets
sales of $81.7 million, partially offset by an increase in laboratory services market sales of $9.8 million. This decline in our Environmental Health segment sales during fiscal year 2009 was due primarily to private and public testing labs and
traditional chemical and semiconductor markets reducing capital purchases in response to tight capital budgets and difficulty accessing credit markets, partially offset by an increase in sales in laboratory services and consumer safety and food
testing products.

Operating income from
continuing operations for fiscal year 2009 was $75.5 million, as compared to $106.2 million for fiscal year 2008, a decrease of $30.6 million, or 29%. Amortization of intangible assets was $12.8 million and $11.8 million for fiscal year 2009 and
fiscal year 2008, respectively. Restructuring and lease charges were $8.8 million for fiscal year 2009 as a result of our Q1 2009 and Q3 2009 Plans. Restructuring and lease charges were $2.5 million for fiscal year 2008 as a result of our Q3
2008 Plan. Purchase accounting adjustments for other acquisition costs related to certain acquisitions completed in fiscal year 2009 added an expense of approximately $0.3 million. The combined unfavorable impact of decreased sales volume, increased
sales and marketing expenses, particularly in emerging territories, increased pension expenses and foreign exchange decreased operating income for fiscal year 2009, which was partially offset by productivity improvements and cost containment
initiatives.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

We require cash to pay our operating expenses, make capital
expenditures, make strategic acquisitions, service our debt and other long-term liabilities, repurchase shares of our common stock and pay dividends on our common stock. Our principal sources of funds are from our operations and the capital markets,
particularly the debt markets. We anticipate that our internal operations will generate sufficient cash to fund our operating expenses, capital expenditures, smaller acquisitions, interest payments on our debt and dividends on our common stock.
However, we expect to use external sources to satisfy the balance of our debt when due, any larger acquisitions and other long-term liabilities.

Principal factors that could affect the availability of our internally generated funds include:

•

deterioration of sales due to weakness in markets in which we sell our products and services, and

•

changes in our working capital requirements.

Principal factors that could affect our ability to obtain cash from external sources include:

•

financial covenants contained in the financial instruments controlling our borrowings that limit our total borrowing capacity,

•

increases in interest rates applicable to our outstanding variable rate debt,

•

a ratings downgrade that would limit our ability to borrow under our amended and restated senior unsecured revolving credit facility and our overall
access to the corporate debt market,

•

increases in interest rates or credit spreads, as well as limitations on the availability of credit, that affect our ability to borrow under future
potential facilities on a secured or unsecured basis,

•

a decrease in the market price for our common stock, and

•

volatility in the public debt and equity markets.



Cash Flows

Fiscal Year 2010

Operating Activities.

Net cash provided by continuing
operations was $167.2 million for fiscal year 2010, as compared to net cash provided by continuing operations of $127.8 million for fiscal year 2009, an increase of $39.4 million. The increase in cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year
2010 was a result of income from continuing operations of $135.9 million, depreciation and amortization of $89.2 million and restructuring and lease charges, net of $19.0 million. These amounts were partially offset by pre-tax gains of $28.9 million
related to the required re-measurement to fair value of our previously held equity interest in the ICPMS Joint Venture and asset dispositions, and a net increase in working capital of $32.9 million. Contributing to the net increase in working
capital for fiscal year 2010, excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations, was an increase in inventory of $22.6 million and an increase in accounts receivable of $38.1 million, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable of
$27.8 million. The increase in inventory overall was primarily a result of new products within our Environmental Health and Human Health segments to improve responsiveness to customer requirements. The increase in accounts receivable was a result of
higher sales volume during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010. The increase in accounts payable was primarily a result of the timing of disbursements during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010. Changes in accrued expenses, other assets and
liabilities and other items, net, decreased cash provided by operating activities by $15.0 million for fiscal year 2010, and primarily related to the timing of payments for tax, restructuring, and salary and benefits, and included the voluntarily
contribution made during the third quarter of fiscal year 2010 of $30.0 million to our defined benefit pension plan in the United States for the 2009 plan year.

Investing Activities.

Net cash used in continuing operations investing activities was $174.1 million for fiscal year 2010, as
compared to $126.0 million of net cash used in continuing operations investing activities for fiscal year 2009. For fiscal year 2010, we used $145.6 million of net cash for acquisitions and core technology purchases and $4.8 million for earn-out
payments, acquired licenses and other costs in connection with these and other transactions. In addition, as part of the ICPMS Joint Venture, we gave Danaher non-cash consideration of $2.6 million for certain non-exclusive rights to intangible
assets we own. Capital expenditures for fiscal year 2010 were $33.6 million, primarily in the areas of tooling and other capital equipment purchases. Restricted cash balances increased for fiscal year 2010 by $1.1 million. These cash outflows were
partially offset by $11.0 million received during the second quarter of fiscal year 2010 from the sale of a facility in Boston, Massachusetts that was damaged in a fire in March 2005.

Financing Activities.

Net cash used in continuing operations financing activities was $215.5 million for
fiscal year 2010, as compared to $4.0 million of net cash provided by continuing operations financing activities for fiscal year 2009. For fiscal year 2010, we repurchased approximately 3.0 million shares of our common stock, including 46,572
shares of our common stock to satisfy minimum statutory tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards, for a total cost of $72.8 million, including commissions. This compares to repurchases of approximately
1.0 million shares of our common stock, including 28,890 shares of our common stock to satisfy minimum statutory tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards, for fiscal year 2009, for a total cost of
$14.6 million, including commissions. This use of cash was offset by proceeds from common stock option exercises of $31.4 million, including the related excess tax benefit, for fiscal year 2010. This compares to the proceeds from common stock option
exercises of $6.5 million, including the related excess tax benefit, for fiscal year 2009. During fiscal year 2010, debt borrowings from our amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility totaled $368.0 million, which was offset by debt
reductions of $508.8 million. This compares to debt borrowings from our amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility of $406.5 million, which was offset by debt reductions of $361.5 million during fiscal year 2009. We paid $33.0 million and
$32.7 million in dividends during fiscal years 2010 and 2009, respectively. In addition, we settled $0.1 million in contingent consideration recorded at the acquisition date for acquisitions completed subsequent to fiscal year 2008 during fiscal
year 2010.



Fiscal Year 2009

Operating Activities.

Net cash provided by continuing operations was $127.8 million for fiscal year
2009, as compared to net cash provided by continuing operations of $170.8 million for fiscal year 2008, a decrease of $42.9 million. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2009 was a result of income from continuing
operations of $74.3 million, depreciation and amortization of $80.8 million and restructuring and lease charges, net of $18.0 million. These amounts were partially offset by a net increase in working capital of $45.3 million. Contributing to the net
increase in working capital in fiscal year 2009, excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations, was an increase in accounts receivable of $30.4 million, which included the repayment and termination of our accounts receivable
securitization facility for $40.0 million, a decrease in accounts payable of $10.4 million and an increase in inventory of $4.5 million. The increase in inventory was primarily the result of lower sales volume and expanding the amount of inventory
held at sales locations within our Environmental Health and Human Health segments to improve responsiveness to customer requirements. The decrease in accounts payable was a result of the timing of disbursements during the fourth quarter of fiscal
year 2009. The increase in accounts receivable was a result of the repayment and termination of our accounts receivable securitization facility for $40.0 million, partially offset by lower sales volume and strong performance in accounts receivable
collections during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009. Changes in accrued expenses, other assets and liabilities and other items, net, totaled $0.1 million in fiscal year 2009, and primarily related to tax audit settlements and the timing of
payments for tax, restructuring, and salary and benefits.

Investing Activities.

Net cash used in continuing operations investing activities was $126.0 million for fiscal year 2009, compared to $119.5 million of cash used in continuing operations investing
activities for fiscal year 2008. For fiscal year 2009, we used $93.6 million of net cash for acquisitions and core technology purchases and used $8.3 million for earn-out payments, acquired licenses, related transaction costs for acquisitions
completed prior to fiscal year 2009 and other costs in connection with these and other transactions. Capital expenditures for fiscal year 2009 were $25.5 million, primarily in the areas of tooling and other capital equipment purchases. These cash
outflows were partially offset by $1.4 million related to the release of restricted cash balances.

Financing Activities.

Net cash provided by continuing operations financing activities was $4.0 million for fiscal year 2009, as compared to $101.1 million of cash used in continuing operations
financing activities for fiscal year 2008. In fiscal year 2009, we repurchased approximately 1.0 million shares of our common stock, including 28,890 shares to satisfy minimum statutory tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting
of restricted stock awards, for a total cost of $14.6 million, including commissions. This compares to repurchases of approximately 3.0 million shares of our common stock, including 37,521 shares to satisfy minimum statutory tax withholding
obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards, for fiscal year 2008, for a total cost of $75.5 million, including commissions. This use of cash was offset by proceeds from common stock option exercises of $6.5 million,
including the related excess tax benefit, for fiscal year 2009. This compares to the proceeds from common stock option exercises of $44.1 million, including the related excess tax benefit, for fiscal year 2008. During fiscal year 2009, debt
borrowings from our amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility totaled $406.5 million, which was offset by debt reductions of $361.5 million. This compares to debt borrowings from our amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility of
$476.0 million and proceeds of $150.0 million from the issuance of our seven-year senior unsecured notes at a rate of 6%, which were offset by debt reductions of $633.0 million during fiscal year 2008. In fiscal year 2008, we also paid $27.1
million to settle forward interest rate contracts with notional amounts totaling $300.0 million at a weighted average interest rate of 4.25% and $2.0 million for debt issuance costs. We paid $32.7 million and $33.1 million in dividends during fiscal
years 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Current Borrowing
Arrangements

Amended Senior Unsecured
Revolving Credit Facility.

On August 13, 2007, we entered into an amended and restated senior unsecured revolving credit facility which provides for a $650.0 million facility through August 13, 2012. Letters of credit in the
aggregate amount of approximately $14.0 million are treated as issued under this amended facility. We use the amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility for general corporate



purposes, which may include working capital, refinancing existing indebtedness, capital expenditures, share repurchases, acquisitions and strategic alliances. The interest rates under the amended
senior unsecured revolving credit facility are based on the Eurocurrency rate at the time of borrowing plus a margin, or the base rate from time to time. The base rate is the higher of (i) the corporate base rate announced from time to time by
Bank of America, N.A. and (ii) the Federal Funds rate plus 50 basis points. We may allocate all or a portion of our indebtedness under the amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility to interest based upon the Eurocurrency rate plus a
margin, or the base rate. The Eurocurrency margin as of January 2, 2011 was 40 basis points. The weighted average Eurocurrency interest rate as of January 2, 2011 was 0.26%, resulting in a weighted average effective Eurocurrency rate,
including the margin, of 0.66%. We had drawn down $274.0 million of borrowings in U.S. Dollars under the facility as of January 2, 2011, with interest based on the above described Eurocurrency rate. The agreement for the facility contains
affirmative, negative and financial covenants and events of default customary for financings of this type, which are consistent with those financial covenants contained in our previous senior revolving credit agreement. The financial covenants in
our amended and restated senior unsecured revolving credit facility include debt-to-capital ratios and a contingent maximum total leverage ratio, applicable if our credit rating is down-graded below investment grade. We were in compliance with all
applicable covenants as of January 2, 2011.

6% Senior Unsecured Notes.

On May 30, 2008, we issued and sold seven-year senior notes at a rate of 6% with a face value
of $150.0 million and received $150.0 million in gross proceeds from the issuance. The debt, which matures in May 2015, is unsecured. Interest on the 6% senior notes is payable semi-annually on May 30th and November 30th. We
may redeem some or all of our 6% senior notes at any time in an amount not less than 10% of the original aggregate principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, plus the applicable make-whole amount. The financial covenants in our
6% senior notes include debt-to-capital ratios which, if our credit rating is down-graded below investment grade, would be replaced by a contingent maximum total leverage ratio. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants as of
January 2, 2011.

We entered into forward
interest rate contracts in October 2007, with notional amounts totaling $300.0 million and a weighted average interest rate of 4.25%, that were intended to hedge movements in interest rates prior to our expected debt issuance. In May 2008, we
settled forward interest rate contracts with notional amounts totaling $150.0 million upon the issuance of our 6% senior unsecured notes, and recognized $8.4 million, net of taxes of $5.4 million, of accumulated derivative losses in other
comprehensive (loss) income. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008, we concluded that the remaining portion of the expected debt issuance, with a notional amount totaling $150.0 million, was no longer probable. As a result of the debt
issuance no longer being probable, we discontinued and settled the forward interest rate contracts with notional amounts totaling $150.0 million and recognized a loss of $17.5 million in interest and other (income) expense, net.

As of January 2, 2011, the balance remaining in
accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the effective cash flow hedges was $5.3 million, net of taxes of $3.4 million. The derivative losses are being amortized into interest expense when the hedged exposure affects interest expense. We
amortized $2.0 million into interest expense during each of the fiscal years 2010 and 2009, and $1.2 million during fiscal year 2008.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Receivables Securitization Facility.

During fiscal year 2001, we established a wholly owned consolidated subsidiary to maintain a
receivables purchase agreement with a third-party financial institution. Under this arrangement, we sold, on a revolving basis, certain of our accounts receivable balances to the consolidated subsidiary which simultaneously sold an undivided
percentage ownership interest in designated pools of receivables to a third-party financial institution. As collections reduced the balance of sold accounts receivable, new receivables were sold. Our consolidated subsidiary retained the risk of
credit loss on the receivables. Accordingly, the full amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts had been provided for on our balance sheets. The amount of receivables sold and outstanding with the third-party financial institution was not to
exceed $65.0 million, reduced to $50.0 million in March 2009. Under the terms of this agreement, our consolidated subsidiary



retained collection and administrative responsibilities for the balances. The agreement required the third-party financial institution to be paid interest during the period from the date the
receivable was sold to its maturity date. The servicing fees received constituted adequate compensation for services performed. No servicing asset or liability was therefore recorded.

In March 2009, our consolidated subsidiary entered into an agreement to extend the term of the accounts
receivable securitization facility to December 30, 2009. On June 30, 2009, our consolidated subsidiary exercised the right to terminate the receivables purchase agreement with a third-party financial institution, releasing both parties of
their rights, liabilities and obligations under this agreement.

Dividends

Our Board declared regular quarterly cash dividends of $0.07 per share in each quarter of fiscal years 2010 and 2009, resulting in an
annual dividend rate of $0.28 per share. On January 24, 2011, we announced that our Board had declared a quarterly dividend of $0.07 per share for the first quarter of fiscal year 2011 that is payable in May 2011. In the future, our Board may
reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in order to fund investments for growth, repurchase shares or conserve capital resources.

Contractual Obligations

The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at January 2, 2011 for continuing and discontinued operations:

(1)

The credit facility borrowings carry variable interest rates; the amounts included in this table do not contemplate interest obligations.

(2)

For the purposes of this table, the obligation has been calculated without interest obligations.

(3)

The amount includes accrued interest, net of tax benefits, and penalties. We have excluded $44.0 million, including accrued interest, net of tax benefits, and
penalties, from the amount related to our uncertain tax positions as we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of related future payments.

Capital Expenditures

During fiscal year 2011, we expect to invest an amount for capital expenditures similar to that in fiscal year 2010, primarily to
introduce new products, to improve our operating processes, to shift the production capacity to lower cost locations, and to develop information technology. We expect to use our available cash and internally generated funds to fund these
expenditures.



Other Potential Liquidity Considerations

At January 2, 2011, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $420.1 million and an amended senior
unsecured revolving credit facility with $362.0 million available for additional borrowing. Most of our cash is denominated in foreign currencies. Almost all of the amounts held outside of the U.S. are available for repatriation, subject to relevant
tax consequences. We utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed. With the exception of $250.0 million related to the sale of our IDS business, we
expect accumulated non-U.S. cash balances will remain outside of the U.S. and that we will meet U.S. liquidity needs through future cash flows, use of U.S. cash balances, external borrowings, or some combination of these sources.

On October 23, 2008, we announced that our Board
authorized us to repurchase up to 10.0 million shares of common stock under a stock repurchase program (the “Repurchase Program”). On August 31, 2010, we announced that our Board had authorized us to repurchase an additional
5.0 million shares of common stock under the Repurchase Program. The Repurchase Program will expire on October 22, 2012 unless terminated earlier by our Board, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. During fiscal year 2008, we
repurchased approximately 1.0 million shares of common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of $18.0 million, including commissions, under the Repurchase Program. During fiscal year 2009, we repurchased approximately 1.0 million
shares of common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of $14.2 million, including commissions, under the Repurchase Program. During fiscal year 2010, we repurchased approximately 3.0 million shares of common stock in the open market at
an aggregate cost of $71.5 million, including commissions, under the Repurchase Program. As of January 2, 2011, approximately 10.0 million shares of our common stock remained available for repurchase from the 15.0 million shares
authorized by our Board under the Repurchase Program. From January 3, 2011 through February 24, 2011, we repurchased approximately 3.0 million shares of common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of $80.6 million, including
commissions, under the Repurchase Program.

Our
Board has authorized us to repurchase shares of common stock to satisfy minimum statutory tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit awards granted pursuant to our equity incentive
plans. During fiscal year 2008, we repurchased 37,521 shares of common stock. During fiscal year 2009, we repurchased 28,890 shares of common stock. During fiscal year 2010, we repurchased 57,551 shares of common stock for this purpose.

The repurchased shares have been reflected as additional
authorized but unissued shares, with the payments reflected in common stock and capital in excess of par value. Any repurchased shares will be available for use in connection with corporate programs. If we continue to repurchase shares, the
repurchase program will be funded using our existing financial resources, including cash and cash equivalents, and our existing amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility.

In November 2010, we sold our IDS business for approximately
$500.0 million, $482.0 million net of payments for acquired cash balances, subject to an adjustment for working capital as of the closing date. The divestiture of our IDS business is expected to reduce the complexity of our product offerings and
organizational structure, and to provide capital to reinvest in other Human Health and Environmental Health end markets. The buyer acquired our IDS business through the purchase of all outstanding stock of certain of our subsidiaries located in
Germany, Canada, China, Indonesia, the Philippines, the United Kingdom and the United States, as well as the purchase of related assets and the assumption of liabilities held by us and certain of our subsidiaries located in Singapore and Germany. We
recognized a pre-tax gain of $315.3 million, inclusive of the net working capital adjustment, in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010 as a result of the sale of our IDS business. The gain was recognized as a gain on the disposition of discontinued
operations.

As a result of the sale of the IDS
and Photoflash businesses, we concluded that the remaining operations within those foreign subsidiaries previously containing IDS and Photoflash operations did not require the same



level of capital as previously required, and therefore we plan to repatriate $250.0 million of cash and have provided for the taxes on the related previously unremitted earnings. Taxes have not
been provided for unremitted earnings that we continue to consider permanently reinvested, which is based on our future operational and capital requirements.The impact of this tax provision in fiscal year 2010 was an increase to our tax provision of
$65.8 million in discontinued operations. We expect to utilize existing tax attributes to repatriate these earnings and expect the taxes to be paid to repatriate these earnings will be minimal.

In November 2009, the Worker, Homeownership, and
Business Assistance Act of 2009 was enacted and allowed businesses with net operating losses for 2008 or 2009 to carry back those losses for up to five years. We had anticipated carrying back losses of up to $80.0 million at the end of fiscal 2009
and classified certain deferred taxes anticipated to be monetized with the filing of the 2009 tax return as a tax receivable. Subsequently, we decided not to implement all of the tax deferral strategies previously anticipated, and carried back
losses of $43.6 million from fiscal year 2009 to fiscal year 2005. As a result, the tax attributes that related to tax deferral strategies not implemented have reduced our deferred tax liability balances, with a corresponding reduction in income tax
receivable. We received a federal income tax refund of $8.9 million in January 2011 and generated general business tax credit carryforwards of $6.4 million.

In connection with the settlement of an insurance claim resulting from a fire that occurred at our facility in Boston, Massachusetts in
March 2005, we accrued $9.7 million during the second quarter of fiscal year 2007, representing our management’s estimate of the total cost for decommissioning the building, including environmental matters, which was damaged in the fire. We
paid $2.5 million during fiscal year 2009, $1.6 million during fiscal year 2008 and $3.9 million during fiscal year 2007 towards decommissioning the building. We sold the building on April 27, 2010. Net proceeds from the sale were $11.0
million, and we recorded a pre-tax gain of $3.4 million in operating income.

Distressed global financial markets could adversely impact general economic conditions by reducing liquidity and credit availability, creating increased volatility in security prices, widening credit
spreads and decreasing valuations of certain investments. The widening of credit spreads may create a less favorable environment for certain of our businesses and may affect the fair value of financial instruments that we issue or hold. Increases in
credit spreads, as well as limitations on the availability of credit at rates we consider to be reasonable, could affect our ability to borrow under future potential facilities on a secured or unsecured basis, which may adversely affect our
liquidity and results of operations. In difficult global financial markets, we may be forced to fund our operations at a higher cost, or we may be unable to raise as much funding as we need to support our business activities.

Our pension plans have not experienced any material impact on
liquidity or counterparty exposure due to the volatility in the credit markets. As a result of significant losses experienced in global equity markets during fiscal year 2008, although our pension funds had modest gains for fiscal year 2009 and
fiscal year 2010, we experienced increased pension costs in fiscal year 2010. We could potentially experience increased costs in additional future periods for all pension plans. We may be required to fund our pension plans with contributions of up
to $11.0 million by the end of fiscal year 2011, and we could potentially have to make additional funding payments in future periods for all pension plans. During fiscal year 2010, we made a voluntary contribution of $30.0 million for the 2009 plan
year to our defined benefit pension plan in the United States, to realize the benefit received from favorable tax provisions included in the Worker, Homeownership, and Business Assistance Act of 2009, as described above. During fiscal year 2010, we
also made contributions of $15.2 million for the 2009 plan year to our defined benefit pension plans outside the United States.

Effects of Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued
by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) and are adopted by us as of the specified effective dates. Unless otherwise discussed below, we believe that the impact of recently issued and adopted pronouncements will not have a
material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows or do not apply to our operations.



In October 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance on multiple-deliverable revenue
arrangements. This guidance establishes the accounting and reporting guidance for arrangements including multiple revenue-generating activities. This guidance provides amendments to the criteria for separating and measuring deliverables and
allocating arrangement consideration to one or more units of accounting. The amendments in this guidance also establish a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable. Significantly enhanced disclosures are also
required to provide information about a vendor’s multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements, including information about the nature and terms of significant deliverables, and a vendor’s performance within those arrangements. Once adopted,
the amendments will also require a company to provide information about the significant judgments made and changes to those judgments and about the way the application of the relative selling-price method affects the timing or amount of revenue
recognition. We will be required to adopt this authoritative guidance on multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements in the first quarter of fiscal year 2011. We are evaluating the requirements of this guidance and have not yet determined the impact
of its adoption on our condensed consolidated financial statements.

In October 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance on certain revenue arrangements that include software elements. This guidance changes the accounting model for revenue arrangements that include
both tangible products and software elements that are “essential to the functionality” of the product and excludes these products from current software revenue guidance. The new guidance will include factors to help companies determine
what software elements are considered “essential to the functionality” of the product. Once adopted, the amendments will subject software-enabled products to other revenue guidance and disclosure requirements, such as guidance surrounding
revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables. We will be required to adopt this authoritative guidance on certain revenue arrangements that include software elements in the first quarter of fiscal year 2011. We are evaluating the requirements of
this guidance and have not yet determined the impact of its adoption on our condensed consolidated financial statements.

In March 2010, the FASB issued authoritative guidance on the milestone method of revenue recognition. Once adopted, this guidance will
allow the milestone method as an acceptable revenue recognition methodology when an arrangement includes substantive milestones. This guidance provides a definition of a substantive milestone that should be applied regardless of whether the
arrangement includes single or multiple deliverables or units of accounting. The scope of the applicability of this definition is limited to transactions involving milestones relating to research and development deliverables. This guidance also
includes enhanced disclosure requirements about each arrangement, individual milestones and related contingent consideration, information about substantive milestones and factors considered in the determination of whether this methodology is
appropriate. Early application and retrospective application are permitted. We will be required to adopt this authoritative guidance on the milestone method of revenue recognition in the first quarter of fiscal year 2011. We expect the adoption of
this guidance will not have a significant impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.

Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of
assets, liabilities, sales and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories, intangible assets, income taxes, restructuring,
pensions and other postretirement benefits, contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis
for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

We believe the following critical accounting policies affect
our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements.



Revenue recognition.

We record product sales when persuasive evidence of an
arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. For products that include installation, if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element,
we recognize product revenue upon delivery, and we delay recognition of installation revenue until the installation is complete. For sales that include customer-specified acceptance criteria, we recognize revenue only after the acceptance criteria
have been met. We defer revenue from services and recognize it over the contractual period, or as we render services and the customer accepts them. When arrangements include multiple elements, we use objective evidence of fair value to allocate
revenue to the elements and recognize revenue when the criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element. Because the majority of our sales relate to specific manufactured products or units rather than long-term customized projects, we
generally do not experience significant changes in original estimates. Further, we have not experienced any significant refunds or promotional allowances that require significant estimation.

Warranty costs

. We provide for estimated warranty costs for products at the time of their sale.
Warranty liabilities are based on estimated future repair costs using historical labor and material incurred in the warranty period.

Allowances for doubtful accounts.

We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the
inability of our customers to make required payments. We generally compute our allowance for doubtful accounts by (i) applying specific percentage reserves on accounts that are past due and deemed uncollectible; and (ii) specifically
reserving for customers known to be in financial difficulty. Therefore, if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate beyond our estimates, we may have to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts. This would reduce our
earnings.

Inventory valuation.

We
initially value inventory at actual cost to purchase and/or manufacture. We periodically review these values to ascertain that market value of the inventory continues to exceed its recorded cost. Generally, reductions in value of inventory below
cost are caused by our maintenance of stocks of products in excess of demand, or technological obsolescence of the inventory. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand and, when necessary, record provisions for excess and obsolete inventory
based on either our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements, or historical trailing usage of the product. If our sales do not materialize as planned or at historic levels, we may have to increase our reserve for excess and
obsolete inventory. This would reduce our earnings. If actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated, inventory previously written down may be sold, resulting in lower costs of sales and higher income from operations than expected in
that period.

Business
combinations.

Business combinations are accounted for at fair value. Acquisition costs are generally expensed as incurred and recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses; previously held equity interests are valued at fair
value upon the acquisition of a controlling interest; in-process research and development (“IPR&D”) is recorded at fair value as an indefinite-lived intangible asset at the acquisition date; restructuring costs associated with a
business combination are generally expensed subsequent to the acquisition date; and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally affect income tax expense. All changes that do
not qualify as measurement period adjustments are included in current period earnings. The accounting for business combinations requires estimates and judgment as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business, and the allocation of
those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets, in determining the estimated fair value for assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including
contingent consideration, are based on management’s estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. If the actual results differ
from the estimates and judgments used in these estimates, the amounts recorded in the financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill, or require acceleration of the amortization expense of
finite-lived intangible assets.



Value of long-lived assets, including intangibles.

We carry a variety of
long-lived assets on our consolidated balance sheets including property and equipment, investments, identifiable intangible assets, and goodwill. We periodically review the carrying value of all of these assets based, in part, upon current estimated
market values and our projections of anticipated future cash flows. We undertake this review (i) on an annual basis for assets such as goodwill and non-amortizing intangible assets and (ii) on a periodic basis for other long-lived assets
when facts and circumstances suggest that cash flows related to those assets may be diminished. Any impairment charge that we record reduces our earnings. The goodwill impairment test consists of a two-step process. The first step is the comparison
of the fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if the carrying value exceeds the fair value. The second step measures the amount of an impairment loss, and is only performed if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of
the reporting unit. We perform the annual impairment assessment on the later of January 1 or the first day of each fiscal year. This same impairment test will be performed at other times during the course of the year should an event occur which
suggests that the recoverability of goodwill should be reconsidered. Non-amortizing intangibles are also subject to an annual impairment test. The impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying
amount. If the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess is recognized

.

In addition, we currently evaluate the remaining useful life of our non-amortizing intangible
assets at least annually to determine whether events or circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life. If events or circumstances indicate that the useful lives of non-amortizing intangible assets are no longer indefinite, the assets
will be tested for impairment. These intangible assets will then be amortized prospectively over their estimated remaining useful life and accounted for in the same manner as other intangible assets that are subject to amortization. Through fiscal
year 2010, we assessed the annual impairment testing using the analytical sciences and laboratory services, genetic screening, bio-discovery and medical imaging reporting units. We completed the annual impairment test using a measurement date of
January 4, 2010 and January 1, 2009, and concluded based on the first step of the process that there was no goodwill impairment. While we believe that our estimates of current value are reasonable, different assumptions regarding items
such as future cash flows and the volatility inherent in markets which we serve could affect our evaluations and result in impairment charges against the carrying value of those assets.

Employee compensation and benefits.

Retirement and postretirement benefit plans are a significant
cost of doing business, and represent obligations that will be ultimately settled far in the future, and therefore are subject to estimation. Retirement and postretirement benefit plan expenses are allocated to cost of sales, research and
development, and selling, general and administrative expenses, in our consolidated statements of operations. We incurred expenses of $14.6 million in fiscal year 2010, $13.0 million in fiscal year 2009 and $8.3 million in fiscal year 2008 for our
retirement and postretirement plans. We expect expenses of approximately $13.8 million in fiscal year 2011 for our retirement and postretirement plans. Pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the
employee’s approximate service period based on the terms of the plans and the investment and funding decisions made. We are required to make assumptions regarding such variables as the expected long-term rate of return on assets and the
discount rate applied, to determine service cost and interest cost, in order to arrive at pension income or expense for the year.

As of January 2, 2011, we estimated the expected long-term rate of return on assets in our pension portfolios in the United States
was 8.1% and was 6.7% for all plans outside the United States. We have analyzed the rates of return on assets used and determined that these rates are reasonable based on the plans’ historical performance relative to the overall markets in the
countries where we invest the assets, as well as our current expectations for long-term rates of returns for our pension assets. Our management will continue to assess the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumptions for each plan
based on relevant market conditions, and will make adjustments to the assumptions as appropriate. Discount rate assumptions have been, and continue to be, based on the prevailing market long-term interest rates at the measurement date. If any of our
assumptions were to change, our pension plan expenses would also change. A one-quarter percent increase in the discount rate would decrease our net periodic benefit cost by $0.5 million for fiscal year 2011 in the United States and by $0.6 million
for fiscal year 2011 for all plans outside the United States. A one percent decrease in the estimated return on plan assets would increase our pre-tax pension expense by $2.3 million for fiscal year 2011 in the United



States and by $0.9 million for fiscal year 2011 for all plans outside the United States. We have reduced the volatility in our healthcare costs provided to our retirees by adopting a defined
dollar plan feature in fiscal year 2001. Under the defined dollar plan feature, our total annual liability for healthcare costs to any one retiree is limited to a fixed dollar amount, regardless of the nature or cost of the healthcare needs of that
retiree. Our maximum future liability, therefore, cannot be increased by future changes in the cost of healthcare.

Restructuring activities.

Our consolidated financial statements detail specific charges relating to restructuring activities
as well as the actual spending that has occurred against the resulting accruals. Our pre-tax restructuring charges are estimates based on our preliminary assessments of (i) severance benefits to be granted to employees, based on known benefit
formulas and identified job grades, (ii) costs to abandon certain facilities based on known lease costs of sub-rental income and (iii) asset impairments as discussed above under “Value of long-lived assets, including
intangibles.” Because these accruals are estimates, they are subject to change as a result of deviations from initial restructuring plans or subsequent information that may come to our attention. For example, actual severance costs may be less
than anticipated if employees voluntarily leave prior to the time at which they would be entitled to severance, or if anticipated legal hurdles in foreign jurisdictions prove to be less onerous than expected. In addition, unanticipated successes or
difficulties in terminating leases and other contractual obligations may lead to changes in estimates. When such changes in estimates occur, they are reflected in our consolidated financial statements on our consolidated statement of operations line
entitled “restructuring and lease charges (reversals), net.”

Gains or losses on dispositions.

When we record the disposition of an asset or discontinuance of an operation, we make an estimate relative to the amount we expect to realize on the sale or
disposition. This estimate is based on a variety of factors, including current interest in the market, alternative markets for the assets, and other relevant factors. If anticipated proceeds are less than the current carrying amount of the asset or
operation, we record a loss. If anticipated proceeds are greater than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation, we recognize a gain net of expected contingencies when the transaction has been consummated. Accordingly, we may realize
amounts different than were first estimated. During the fiscal year ended January 2, 2011, we recorded $3.4 million in pre-tax gains from disposition of fixed assets. We recorded $317.9 million in pre-tax gains from the disposition of
discontinued operations. Any such changes decrease or increase current earnings, and are recorded either against the “gains on disposition” or “discontinued operations” line items appearing in our consolidated statement of
operations.

Income taxes.

Our
business operations are global in nature, and we are subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Tax laws and tax rates vary substantially in these jurisdictions, and are subject to change given the political and economic climate in those countries.
We report and pay income tax based on operational results and applicable law. Our tax provision contemplates tax rates currently in effect to determine both our current and deferred tax provisions. Any significant fluctuation in rates or changes in
tax laws could cause our estimates of taxes we anticipate either paying or recovering in the future to change. Such changes could lead to either increases or decreases in our effective tax rate.

Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide
provision for income taxes and recording the related tax assets and liabilities. In the ordinary course of our business, there are operational decisions, transactions, facts and circumstances, and calculations for which the ultimate tax
determination is not certain. Furthermore, our tax positions are periodically subject to challenge by taxing authorities throughout the world. Every quarter we review our tax positions in each significant taxing jurisdiction in the process of
evaluating our unrecognized tax benefits. Adjustments are made to our unrecognized tax benefits when: (i) facts and circumstances regarding a tax position change, causing a change in our judgment regarding that tax position; (ii) a tax
position is effectively settled with a tax authority; and/or (iii) the statute of limitations expires regarding a tax position. Any significant impact as a result of changes in underlying facts, law, tax rates, tax audit, or review could lead
to adjustments to our income tax expense, our effective tax rate, or our cash flow.

Additionally, we have established valuation allowances against a variety of deferred tax assets, including net operating loss carryforwards, foreign tax credits, other income tax credits and certain
pension accruals. Valuation



allowances take into consideration our ability to use these deferred tax assets and reduce the value of such items to the amount that is deemed more likely than not to be recoverable.
Improvements or other changes in our operations, domestically and internationally, could increase our ability to utilize these tax attributes in the future. The release of valuation allowances in periods when these tax attributes become realizable
would reduce our effective tax rate.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market
Risk

Financial Instruments

Financial instruments that potentially
subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash investments, marketable securities and accounts receivable. We believe we had no significant concentrations of credit risk as of January 2, 2011.

We use derivative instruments as part of our risk management
strategy only, and include derivatives utilized as economic hedges that are not designated as hedging instruments. By nature, all financial instruments involve market and credit risks. We enter into derivative instruments with major investment grade
financial institutions and have policies to monitor the credit risk of those counterparties. We do not enter into derivative contracts for trading or other speculative purposes, nor do we use leveraged financial instruments. Approximately 61% of our
business is conducted outside of the United States, generally in foreign currencies. Therefore, the fluctuations in foreign currency can increase the costs of financing, investing and operating the business.

In the ordinary course of business, we may enter into foreign
exchange contracts for periods consistent with our committed exposures to mitigate the effect of foreign currency movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Transactions covered by hedge contracts include intercompany and
third-party receivables and payables. The contracts are primarily denominated in European and Asian currencies, have maturities that do not exceed 12 months, have no cash requirements until maturity, and are recorded at fair value on the
consolidated balance sheets. Unrealized gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts are recognized immediately in earnings for hedges designated as fair value and, for hedges designated as cash flow, the related unrealized gains or losses are
deferred as a component of other comprehensive (loss) income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Deferred gains and losses are recognized in income in the period in which the underlying anticipated transaction occurs and impacts
earnings. We did not have any outstanding cash flow hedges during fiscal year 2010.

Principal hedged currencies include the British Pound (GBP), Canadian Dollar (CAD), Euro (EUR), Japanese Yen (JPY), and Singapore Dollar (SGD). We held forward foreign exchange contracts with U.S.
equivalent notional amounts totaling $107.3 million at January 2, 2011 and $168.5 million at January 3, 2010, and the approximate fair value of these foreign currency derivative contracts was insignificant. The duration of these contracts
was generally 30 days or less during fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008.

We entered into forward interest rate contracts in October 2007, with notional amounts totaling $300.0 million and a weighted average interest rate of 4.25%, that were intended to hedge movements in
interest rates prior to our expected debt issuance. In May 2008, we settled forward interest rate contracts with notional amounts totaling $150.0 million upon the issuance of our 6% senior unsecured notes, and recognized $8.4 million, net of taxes
of $5.4 million, of accumulated derivative losses in other comprehensive (loss) income. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008, we concluded that the remaining portion of the expected debt issuance, with a notional amount totaling $150.0
million, was no longer probable. As a result of the debt issuance no longer being probable, we discontinued and settled the forward interest rate contracts with notional amounts totaling $150.0 million and recognized a loss of $17.5 million in
interest and other (income) expense, net.



As of January 2, 2011, the balance remaining in accumulated other comprehensive loss
related to the effective cash flow hedges was $5.3 million, net of taxes of $3.4 million. The derivative losses are being amortized into interest expense when the hedged exposure affects interest expense. We amortized $2.0 million into interest
expense during each of the fiscal years 2010 and 2009, and $1.2 million during fiscal year 2008.

Market Risk

Market Risk.

We are exposed to market risk, including changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates. To manage the volatility relating to these exposures, we enter into various
derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted market exposures.

Foreign Exchange Risk.

The potential change in foreign currency exchange rates offers a substantial risk to us, as
approximately 61% of our business is conducted outside of the United States, generally in foreign currencies. Our risk management strategy currently uses forward contracts to mitigate certain balance sheet foreign currency transaction exposures. The
intent of these economic hedges is to offset gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures, with gains and losses resulting from the forward contracts that hedge these exposures. Moreover, we are able to partially mitigate the impact that
fluctuations in currencies have on our net income as a result of our manufacturing facilities located in countries outside the United States, material sourcing and other spending which occur in countries outside the United States, resulting in
natural hedges.

Although we attempt to manage our
foreign currency exchange risk through the above activities, when the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies in which we transact business, generally sales and net income will be positively but not proportionately impacted.

Foreign Currency Risk—Value-at-Risk
Disclosure

. We utilize a Value-at-Risk model to determine the potential earning/fair value exposures presented by our foreign currency related financial instruments. As discussed above, we seek to minimize this exposure through our hedging
program. Our Value-at-Risk computation is based on the Monte Carlo simulation, utilizing a 95% confidence interval and a holding period of 30 days. As of January 2, 2011, this computation estimated that there is a 5% chance that the market
value of the underlying exposures and the corresponding derivative instruments either increase or decrease due to foreign currency fluctuations by more than $0.3 million. This Value-At-Risk measure is consistent with our financial statement
disclosures relative to our foreign currency hedging program. Specifically, during each of the four quarters ended in fiscal year 2010, the Value-At-Risk ranged between $0.2 million and $0.4 million, with an average of approximately $0.3 million.

Interest Rate Risk.

As described
above, our debt portfolio includes variable rate instruments. Fluctuations in interest rates can therefore have a direct impact on both our short-term cash flows, as they relate to interest, and our earnings. To manage the volatility relating to
these exposures, we periodically enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted interest rate exposures.

We entered into forward interest rate contracts in October
2007, with notional amounts totaling $300.0 million and a weighted average interest rate of 4.25%, that were intended to hedge movements in interest rates prior to our expected debt issuance. In May 2008, we settled forward interest rate contracts
with notional amounts totaling $150.0 million upon the issuance of our 6% senior unsecured notes, and recognized $8.4 million, net of taxes of $5.4 million, of accumulated derivative losses in other comprehensive (loss) income. During the
fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008, we concluded that the remaining portion of the expected debt issuance, with a notional amount totaling $150.0 million, was no longer probable. As a result of the debt issuance no longer being probable, we
discontinued and settled the forward interest rate contracts with notional amounts totaling $150.0 million and recognized a loss of $17.5 million in interest and other (income) expense, net.

As of January 2, 2011, the balance remaining in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the
effective cash flow hedges was $5.3 million, net of taxes of $3.4 million. The derivative losses are being



amortized into interest expense when the hedged exposure affects interest expense. We amortized $2.0 million into interest expense during each of the fiscal years 2010 and 2009, and $1.2 million
during fiscal year 2008.

Interest Rate
Risk—Sensitivity

. As of January 2, 2011, our debt portfolio consisted of $274.0 million of variable rate debt. In addition, our cash and cash equivalents, for which we receive interest at variable rates, were $420.1 million at
January 2, 2011. Our current earnings exposure for changes in interest rates can be summarized as follows:

(i) Changes in interest rates can cause interest charges on our variable rate debt, consisting of $274.0 million of
revolving debt facilities, to fluctuate. An increase of 10%, or approximately 7 basis points, in current interest rates would cause an additional pre-tax charge to our earnings of $0.2 million for fiscal year 2011.

(ii) Changes in interest rates can cause our
cash flows relative to interest payments on variable rate debt to fluctuate. As described above, an increase of 10%, or approximately 7 basis points, in current interest rates would cause our cash outflows to increase by $0.2 million for fiscal year
2011.

(iii) Changes in interest
rates can cause our interest income and cash flows to fluctuate.

Financial Statements and
Supplemental Data




REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors
and Stockholders of PerkinElmer, Inc.

Waltham, Massachusetts

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets
of PerkinElmer, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of January 2, 2011 and January 3, 2010, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended January 2, 2011. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15. These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the
Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such
consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of PerkinElmer, Inc. and subsidiaries as of January 2, 2011 and January 3, 2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended January 2, 2011, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation
to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the method of accounting for business combinations on
December 29, 2008.

We have also audited, in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of January 2, 2011, based on the criteria established in

Internal
Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 1, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1:

Nature of Operations and Accounting Policies

Nature of Operations:

PerkinElmer, Inc. is a leading provider of technology, services and solutions to the
diagnostics, research, environmental and safety, industrial and laboratory services markets. Through its technologies, applications and services critical issues are addressed that help to improve the health and safety of people and their
environment. The results are reported within two reporting segments: Human Health and Environmental Health.

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of PerkinElmer, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”). All
intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Investments in business entities in which the Company does not have control, but has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies,
are accounted for by the equity method.

The
Company has two operating segments; Human Health and Environmental Health. The Company’s Human Health segment concentrates on developing diagnostics, tools and applications to help detect diseases earlier and more accurately and to accelerate
the discovery and development of critical new therapies. Within the Human Health segment, the Company serves both the diagnostics and research markets. The Company’s Environmental Health segment provides technologies and applications to
facilitate the creation of safer food and consumer products, more secure surroundings and efficient energy resources. The Environmental Health segment serves the environmental and safety, industrial and laboratory services markets.

The Company’s fiscal year ends on the Sunday nearest
December 31. The Company reports fiscal years under a 52/53 week format. Under this method, certain years will contain 53 weeks. The fiscal year ended January 2, 2011 included 52 weeks. The fiscal years ended January 3, 2010 and
December 28, 2008 included 53 weeks and 52 weeks, respectively. The fiscal year ending January 1, 2012 will include 52 weeks.

The Company has evaluated subsequent events from January 2, 2011 through the date of the issuance of these consolidated financial
statements and has determined that no material subsequent events have occurred that would affect the information presented in these consolidated financial statements or to require additional disclosure.

Reclassifications:

Certain
reclassifications were made to prior year amounts to conform to the current period presentation. None of the reclassifications affected the Company’s net income in any period.

Accounting Policies and
Estimates:

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with United States (“U.S.”) Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) requires the Company to make estimates and
judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates. The Company bases its estimates on
historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily
apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

Revenue Recognition:

The Company’s product sales are recorded when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price to the buyer is fixed
or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. For products that include installation, and if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element, product revenue is recognized upon delivery, and installation revenue
is recognized when the installation is complete. For sales that include customer-specified acceptance criteria, revenue is recognized after the acceptance criteria have been met. Certain of the Company’s products require specialized
installation. Revenue for these products is deferred until installation is completed. Revenue from



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

services is deferred and recognized over the contractual period, or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer. When arrangements include multiple elements, the Company uses objective
evidence of fair value to allocate revenue to the elements, and recognizes revenue when the criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element, in accordance with authoritative guidance on multiple-element arrangements.

The Company sells products and accessories predominantly
through its direct sales force. As a result, the use of distributors is generally limited to geographic regions where the Company has no direct sales force. The Company does not offer product return or exchange rights (other than those relating to
defective goods under warranty) or price protection allowances to its customers, including its distributors. Payment terms granted to distributors are the same as those granted to end-user customers and payments are not dependent upon the
distributors’ receipt of payment from their end-user customers. Sales incentives related to distributor sales are also the same as those for end-user customers.

Warranty Costs

:    The Company
provides for estimated warranty costs for products at the time of their sale. Warranty liabilities are based on estimated future repair costs using historical labor and material costs incurred in the warranty period.

Shipping and Handling
Costs:

The Company reports shipping and handling costs in both sales and the related costs as cost of goods sold to the extent they are billed to customers. In all other instances, they are reflected as a component of cost
of goods sold.

Inventories

:    Inventories, which include material, labor and manufacturing overhead, are valued at the lower
of cost or market. Inventories are accounted for using the first-in, first-out method of determining inventory costs. Inventory quantities on-hand are regularly reviewed, and where necessary, provisions for excess and obsolete inventory are recorded
based primarily on the Company’s estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements.

Income Taxes:

The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the
asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases. This method also requires the recognition of future tax benefits such as net operating loss carryforwards, to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted
tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the fiscal years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. A valuation allowance is established for any deferred tax asset for which realization is not more likely
than not. With respect to corporate earnings expected to be permanently reinvested offshore, the Company does not accrue tax for the repatriation of such foreign earnings.

The Company provides reserves for potential payments of tax
to various tax authorities related to uncertain tax positions and other issues. These reserves are based on a determination of whether and how much of a tax benefit taken by the Company in its tax filings or positions is more likely than not to be
realized following resolution of any potential contingencies present related to the tax benefit. Potential interest and penalties associated with such uncertain tax positions is recorded as a component of income tax expense. See Note 6, below, for
additional details.

Property, Plant and
Equipment:

The Company depreciates plant and equipment using the straight-line method over its estimated useful lives, which generally fall within the following ranges: buildings—10 to 40 years; leasehold
improvements—estimated useful life or remaining term of lease, whichever is shorter; machinery and equipment—3 to 7 years. Certain tooling costs are capitalized and amortized over a 3-year life, while repairs and maintenance costs are
expensed.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Asset Retirement Obligations

:    The Company records
obligations associated with its lease obligations, the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset-retirement costs in accordance with authoritative guidance on asset retirement obligations

. The Company reviews
legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from contractual obligations or the acquisition, construction, development and/or normal use of the assets. If it is determined that a legal obligation exists,
regardless of whether the obligation is conditional on a future event, the fair value of the liability for an asset retirement obligation is recognized in the period in which it is incurred, if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The
fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset, and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset. The difference between the gross expected future cash flow and its present value is
accreted over the life of the related lease as an operating expense.

Pension Plans:

The Company’s funding policy provides that payments to the U.S. pension trusts shall at least be equal to the minimum funding requirements of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. Non-U.S. plans are accrued for, but generally not fully funded, and benefits are paid from operating funds. The difference between actual amounts and estimates based on actuarial assumptions will be recognized
in other comprehensive (loss) income in the period in which they occur. The Company recognizes a net liability or asset and an offsetting adjustment, net of taxes, to accumulated other comprehensive loss to report the funded status of defined
benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans, and measures plan assets and obligations at their year-end balance sheet date.

Translation of Foreign Currencies:

For foreign operations, asset and liability accounts are translated at
current exchange rates; income and expenses are translated using weighted average exchange rates for the reporting period. Resulting translation adjustments, as well as translation gains and losses from certain intercompany transactions, are
reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss, a separate component of stockholders’ equity. Gains and losses arising from transactions and translation of period-end balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are
included in earnings.

Business
Combinations:

Business combinations are accounted for at fair value. Acquisition costs are generally expensed as incurred and recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses; previously held equity interests are
valued at fair value upon the acquisition of a controlling interest; in-process research and development (“IPR&D”) is recorded at fair value as an intangible asset at the acquisition date; restructuring costs associated with a business
combination are generally expensed subsequent to the acquisition date; and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally affect income tax expense. These changes are effective on
a prospective basis for all of the Company’s business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after December 28, 2008, with the exception of the accounting for valuation allowances on deferred taxes and acquired tax
contingencies. Adjustments for valuation allowances on deferred taxes and acquired tax contingencies associated with acquisitions that closed prior to December 28, 2008 would also apply the revised accounting. The accounting for business
combinations requires estimates and judgment as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business, and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets, in determining the estimated fair value for assets and
liabilities acquired. The fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including contingent consideration, are based on management’s estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by
management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. If the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these estimates, the amounts recorded in the financial statements could result in a
possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill, or require acceleration of the amortization expense of finite-lived intangible assets.

Intangible Assets:

The Company’s intangible assets consist of (i) goodwill, which is not being
amortized; (ii) indefinite lived intangibles, which consist of certain trademarks and trade names that are not subject to



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

amortization; and (iii) amortizing intangibles, which consist of patents and purchased technologies, which are being amortized over their useful lives. All intangible assets are subject to
impairment tests on an annual or periodic basis.

The process of testing goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of the applicable reporting units. The test
consists of a two-step process. The first step is the comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if the carrying value exceeds the fair value. The second step measures the amount of an impairment loss, and
is only performed if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit. This annual impairment assessment is performed by the Company on the later of January 1 or the first day of each fiscal year. This same impairment test will
be performed at other times during the course of the year, should an event occur which suggests that the recoverability of goodwill should be reconsidered. Non-amortizing intangibles are also subject to an annual impairment test. The impairment test
consists of a comparison of the fair value of the non-amortizing intangible asset with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a non-amortizing intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess is
recognized

.

In addition, the Company evaluates the remaining useful life of its non-amortizing intangible assets at least annually to determine whether events or circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life. If events or
circumstances indicate that the useful lives of non-amortizing intangible assets are no longer indefinite, the assets will be tested for impairment. These intangible assets will then be amortized prospectively over their estimated remaining useful
life and accounted for in the same manner as other intangible assets that are subject to amortization. Recoverability of amortizing intangible assets is assessed only when events have occurred that may give rise to an impairment. When a potential
impairment has been identified, forecasted undiscounted net cash flows of the operations to which the asset relates are compared to the current carrying value of the long-lived assets present in that operation. If such cash flows are less than such
carrying amounts, long-lived assets, including such intangibles, are written down to their respective fair values. See Note 12, below, for additional details.

Stock-Based Compensation:

The Company accounts for stock-based compensation expense based on estimated grant
date fair value, generally using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The fair value is recognized, net of estimated forfeitures, as expense in the consolidated financial statements over the requisite service period. The determination of fair
value and the timing of expense using option pricing models such as the Black-Scholes model require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected forfeiture rate, life of the option and the expected price volatility of the
underlying stock. The Company estimates the expected forfeiture and expected life assumptions based on historical experience. In determining the Company’s expected stock price volatility assumption, the Company reviews both
the historical and implied volatility of the Company’s common stock, with implied volatility based on the implied volatility of publicly traded options on the Company’s common stock. The Company elected to use the practical transition
option to calculate its historical pool of windfall tax benefits. The practical transition option allows the use of a simplified method to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid-in capital pool, which is available to absorb
shortfalls when actual tax deductions are less than the related book share-based compensation cost recognized. Beginning in fiscal year 2009, the Company has one stock-based compensation plan from which it makes grants, which is described more fully
in Note 18, below.

Marketable Securities and
Investments:

The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. If securities are classified as available for sale, the Company records these investments at their fair values with unrealized gains
and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Under the cost method of accounting, equity investments in private companies are carried at cost and are adjusted for other-than-temporary declines in fair value, additional investments or
distributions.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Cash Flows:

For purposes of the Consolidated Statements of
Cash Flows, the Company considers all highly liquid unrestricted instruments with a purchased maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value due to the short
maturities of these instruments.

Environmental
Matters:

The Company accrues for costs associated with the remediation of environmental pollution when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the Company’s proportionate share of the amount can be
reasonably estimated. The recorded liabilities have not been discounted.

Research and Development:

Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. The fair value of acquired IPR&D costs is recorded at fair value as an intangible asset
at the acquisition date and amortized once the product is ready for sale.

Restructuring Charges:

In recent fiscal years, the Company has undertaken a series of restructuring actions related to the alignment with the Company’s growth strategy,
the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and the integration of its business units. In connection with these initiatives, the Company has recorded restructuring charges, as more fully described in Note 4, below. Generally, costs associated with an
exit or disposal activity are recognized when the liability is incurred. Costs related to employee separation arrangements requiring future service beyond a specified minimum retention period are recognized over the service period.

Comprehensive (Loss)
Income:

Comprehensive (loss) income is defined as net income or loss and other changes in stockholders’ equity from transactions and other events from sources other than stockholders. Comprehensive (loss) income is
reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity and Comprehensive Income.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging:

Derivatives are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. Gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those
derivatives would be accounted for depending on the use of the derivative instrument and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting.

For a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the derivative’s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of other
comprehensive (loss) income and subsequently amortized into net earnings when the hedged exposure affects net earnings. Cash flow hedges related to anticipated transactions are designated and documented at the inception of each hedge by matching the
terms of the contract to the underlying transaction. The Company classifies the cash flows from hedging transactions in the same categories as the cash flows from the respective hedged items. Once established, cash flow hedges are generally recorded
in other comprehensive (loss) income, unless an anticipated transaction is no longer likely to occur, and subsequently amortized into net earnings when the hedged exposure affects net earnings. Discontinued or dedesignated cash flow hedges are
immediately settled with counterparties, and the related accumulated derivative gains or losses are recognized into net earnings on the consolidated financial statements. Settled cash flow hedges related to forecasted transactions that remain
probable are recorded as a component of other comprehensive (loss) income and are subsequently amortized into net earnings when the hedged exposure affects net earnings. Forward contract effectiveness for cash flow hedges is calculated by comparing
the fair value of the contract to the change in value of the anticipated transaction using forward rates on a monthly basis. The Company also has entered into foreign currency forward contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments for
accounting purposes. These contracts are recorded at fair value, with the changes in fair value recognized into net earnings on the consolidated financial statements.

Recently Issued Accounting
Pronouncements:

From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) and are adopted by the Company as of the



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

specified effective dates. Unless otherwise discussed below, the Company believes that the impact of recently issued pronouncements will not have a material impact on the Company’s
consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows or do not apply to the Company’s operations.

In October 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance on multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements. This guidance establishes the
accounting and reporting guidance for arrangements including multiple revenue-generating activities. This guidance provides amendments to the criteria for separating and measuring deliverables and allocating arrangement consideration to one or more
units of accounting. The amendments in this guidance also establish a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable. Significantly enhanced disclosures are also required to provide information about a vendor’s
multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements, including information about the nature and terms of significant deliverables and a vendor’s performance within those arrangements. Once adopted, the amendments will also require a company to provide
information about the significant judgments made and changes to those judgments and about the way the application of the relative selling-price method affects the timing or amount of revenue recognition. The Company will be required to adopt this
authoritative guidance on multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements in the first quarter of fiscal year 2011. The Company is evaluating the requirements of this guidance and has not yet determined the impact of its adoption on the Company’s
condensed consolidated financial statements.

In
October 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance on certain revenue arrangements that include software elements. This guidance changes the accounting model for revenue arrangements that include both tangible products and software elements that
are “essential to the functionality” of the product and excludes these products from current software revenue guidance. The new guidance will include factors to help companies determine what software elements are considered “essential
to the functionality” of the product. Once adopted, the amendments will subject software-enabled products to other revenue guidance and disclosure requirements, such as guidance surrounding revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables. The
Company will be required to adopt this authoritative guidance on certain revenue arrangements that include software elements in the first quarter of fiscal year 2011. The Company is evaluating the requirements of this guidance and has not yet
determined the impact of its adoption on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements.

In March 2010, the FASB issued authoritative guidance on the milestone method of revenue recognition. Once adopted, this guidance will
allow the milestone method as an acceptable revenue recognition methodology when an arrangement includes substantive milestones. This guidance provides a definition of a substantive milestone that should be applied regardless of whether the
arrangement includes single or multiple deliverables or units of accounting. The scope of the applicability of this definition is limited to transactions involving milestones relating to research and development deliverables. This guidance also
includes enhanced disclosure requirements about each arrangement, individual milestones and related contingent consideration, information about substantive milestones and factors considered in the determination of whether this methodology is
appropriate. Early application and retrospective application are permitted. The Company will be required to adopt this authoritative guidance on the milestone method of revenue recognition in the first quarter of fiscal year 2011. The Company
expects the adoption of this guidance will not have a significant impact on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements.

Note 2:

Business Combinations and Asset Purchases

Acquisition of chemagen Biopolymer-Technologie AG.

In February 2011, the Company acquired all of the
outstanding stock of chemagen Biopolymer-Technologie AG (“chemagen”). chemagen manufactures and sells nucleic acid sample preparation systems and reagents utilizing M-PVA magnetic bead technology. The Company expects this acquisition to
enhance its genetic screening business by expanding the Company’s product offerings to diagnostics, academic and industrial end markets. The Company paid the shareholders of chemagen approximately $35.0 million in cash at the closing for the
stock of chemagen, plus potential additional consideration of up to $20.3



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

million. The purchase price is also subject to potential adjustments for chemagen’s indebtedness, working capital as of the closing date, and indemnification obligations of chemagen’s
equity holders. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets represents cost and revenue synergies specific to the Company as well as non-capitalizable intangible assets, such as the employee workforce acquired,
and will be allocated to goodwill, none of which will be tax deductible. The Company expects to report the operations for this acquisition within the results of the Company’s Human Health segment from the acquisition date.

Acquisition of VisEn Medical
Inc.

In July 2010, the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of VisEn Medical Inc. (“VisEn”). VisEn is an

in vivo

molecular imaging technology company. The Company expects this acquisition to
enhance its cellular imaging business by expanding the Company’s technologies and capabilities into preclinical research undertaken in academic institutes and pharmaceutical companies. The Company paid the equity holders of VisEn $23.0 million
in cash for the stock of VisEn, of which $18.2 million was paid at closing and an additional amount of $4.8 million is held in an escrow account to secure potential adjustments for VisEn’s indebtedness, working capital as of the closing date,
and indemnification obligations of VisEn’s equity holders. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010, the Company finalized the purchase price and related allocation resulting in an increase in deferred tax assets, included in long-term
liabilities, of $8.5 million and a decrease in goodwill of $8.5 million. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets represents cost and revenue synergies specific to the Company as well as non-capitalizable
intangible assets, such as the employee workforce acquired, and has been allocated to goodwill, none of which is tax deductible. The Company reports the operations for this acquisition within the results of the Company’s Human Health segment
from the acquisition date.

Acquisition of
Signature Genomic Laboratories, LLC.

In May 2010, the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of SGL Newco, Inc., the parent company of Signature Genomic Laboratories, LLC (“Signature Genomic”).
Signature Genomic is a provider of diagnostic cytogenetic testing of chromosome abnormalities in individuals with unexplained physical and developmental disabilities. The Company expects this acquisition to expand the Company’s existing genetic
testing business and expand its position in early detection of disease, specifically in the molecular diagnostics market. The Company paid the equity holders of Signature Genomic $90.0 million in cash, of which $77.5 million was paid at closing and
an additional amount of $12.5 million is held in an escrow account to secure certain adjustments for Signature Genomic’s indebtedness, working capital as of the closing date, and indemnification obligations of Signature Genomic’s equity
holders. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets represents cost and revenue synergies specific to the Company as well as non-capitalizable intangible assets, such as the employee workforce acquired, and has
been allocated to goodwill, none of which is tax deductible. The Company has reported the operations for this acquisition within the results of the Company’s Human Health segment from the acquisition date.

Acquisition of Remaining Interest in the Inductively
Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry Joint Venture.

In May 2010, the Company acquired the remaining fifty percent equity interest in the Company’s joint venture (the “ICPMS Joint Venture”) with the company
previously known as MDS, Inc. for the development and manufacturing of its Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (“ICPMS”) product line and other related tangible assets from DH Technologies Development Pte Ltd., a subsidiary of
Danaher Corporation (“Danaher”). The Company expects this acquisition will help support the continued success of the premier ICPMS product line by allowing the Company to direct development with a dedicated and consistent approach. The
fair value of the acquisition was $67.7 million, including cash consideration of $35.0 million, non-cash consideration of $2.6 million for certain non-exclusive rights to intangible assets owned by the Company, and $30.4 million representing the
fair value of the Company’s fifty percent equity interest in the ICPMS Joint Venture held prior to the acquisition. The Company recognized a pre-tax gain of $25.6 million from the re-measurement to fair value of the Company’s previously
held equity interest in the ICPMS Joint Venture. This pre-tax gain is reported in interest and other (income) expense, net, for fiscal year 2010. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets represents cost and
revenue synergies specific to the Company as well as



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

non-capitalizable intangible assets, and has been allocated to goodwill, none of which is tax deductible. The Company has reported the operations for this acquisition within the results of the
Company’s Environmental Health segment from the acquisition date.

Purchase of Intangible Assets from GE Healthcare.

In September 2009, the Company purchased the core technology and patents of GE Healthcare’s 3H and 14C Catalog
Radiochemicals, Scintillation Proximity Assay (“SPA”) reagents and Cytostar-T plate portfolios for aggregate consideration of $12.0 million in cash. The Catalog Radiochemical products are used for a variety of research applications,
including screening of potential drug candidates through binding assays. The SPA bead-based light-emitting assay and Cytostar-T plate technologies are offerings that enable the automation of High Throughput Screening (“HTS”) processes to
help drug discovery researchers determine if potential new drug compounds are effective against their intended disease targets. The Company expects that incorporation of these technologies will strengthen its G-protein-coupled receptor and Kinase
research product lines and complement its HTS and research reagent solutions. The core technology and patents that the Company purchased do not meet the definition of a business, as the purchased assets were not accompanied by any associated
processes. As a result, purchased intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. The Company has reported the amortization of these intangible assets within the results of the Company’s Human Health segment from the purchase
date.

Acquisition of Sym-Bio LifeScience Co.,
Ltd.

In August 2009, the Company acquired the outstanding equity interests of Sym-Bio LifeScience Co., Ltd. (“Sym-Bio”). Sym-Bio is a major supplier of diagnostics instruments and related reagents, particularly
in the area of infectious diseases, to hospitals in China. The Company expects this acquisition to expand the Company’s access to the hospital market segment in China, offering a larger base from which to expand its prenatal and newborn
screening business in the country and providing the Company with a significant diagnostics manufacturing and research and development base within China. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets represents cost
and revenue synergies specific to the Company as well as non-capitalizable intangible assets, such as the employee workforce acquired. The Company paid the shareholders of Sym-Bio approximately $51.2 million in cash for this acquisition plus an
additional amount of $12.5 million held in an escrow account for contingencies, of which $7.3 million is for potential additional contingent consideration with a fair value of $6.9 million at the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price
over the fair value of the acquired net assets has been allocated to goodwill, none of which is tax deductible. The Company has reported the operations for this acquisition within the results of the Company’s Human Health segment from the
acquisition date.

Acquisition of Analytica of
Branford, Inc.

In May 2009, the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of Analytica of Branford, Inc. (“Analytica”). Analytica is a leading developer of mass spectrometry and ion source technology. This
acquisition allows the Company to offer its customers access to critical technologies such as time-of-flight and quadrupole mass spectrometers and new ion sources that provide more complete information as well as better throughput. The Company also
gained significant intellectual property in the field of mass spectrometry and ion source technology. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets represents cost and revenue synergies specific to the Company as
well as non-capitalizable intangible assets, such as the employee workforce acquired. The Company paid the shareholders of Analytica approximately $21.7 million in cash for this acquisition. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2010, the
Company agreed to pay approximately $1.1 million to the shareholders of Analytica as additional purchase price for the election to treat the acquisition as a deemed asset sale. Based on the effect of this election, at the acquisition date the
Company has retrospectively adjusted the fiscal year 2009 comparative information. The adjustment resulted in a decrease in deferred tax liability, included in long-term liabilities, of $6.3 million, an increase in accrued expenses of $1.1 million
and an increase in other current assets of $0.2 million, offset by a decrease in goodwill of $5.4 million. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets has been allocated to goodwill, all of which is tax
deductible. The Company has reported the operations for this acquisition within the results of the Company’s Environmental Health segment from the acquisition date.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Allocations of the purchase price for acquisitions are based on estimates of the fair
value of the net assets acquired and are subject to adjustment upon finalization of the purchase price allocation. The accounting for business combinations requires estimates and judgments as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired
business, and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets, in determining the estimated fair values for assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and
liabilities assumed, including contingent consideration, are based on management’s estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques.
Contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the acquisition date with changes in the fair value after the acquisition date affecting earnings to the extent it is to be settled in cash. If the actual results differ from the estimates and
judgments used in these fair values, the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill, or require acceleration of the amortization expense of finite-lived
intangible assets. The Company does not consider these acquisitions to be material to its consolidated results of operations and is therefore not presenting pro forma financial information of operations. The Company has also determined that the
presentation of the results of operations for each of these acquisitions, from the date of acquisition, is impracticable due to the integration of the operations upon acquisition. See Note 12 for additional details.

As of January 2, 2011, the purchase price and related
allocation for the acquisitions completed in fiscal years 2010 and 2009 were final. For acquisitions completed subsequent to fiscal year 2008, during the measurement period, the Company will adjust assets or liabilities if new information is
obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have resulted in the recognition of those assets and liabilities as of that date. Adjustments to the initial allocation of the purchase price during
the measurement period require the revision of comparative prior period financial information when reissued in subsequent financial statements. The effect of measurement period adjustments to the allocation of the purchase price would be as if the
adjustments had been completed on the acquisition date. The effects of measurement period adjustments may cause changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income or expense recognized in prior periods. All changes that do not qualify as
measurement period adjustments are included in current period earnings.

The components of the fair values of the business combinations and allocations for the acquisitions completed in fiscal year 2010 are as follows:

Discontinued Operations

As part of the Company’s continuing efforts to focus on higher growth opportunities, the Company has discontinued certain businesses.
The Company has accounted for these businesses as discontinued operations and, accordingly, has presented the results of operations and related cash flows as discontinued operations for all periods presented. The assets and liabilities of these
businesses have been presented separately, and are reflected within the assets and liabilities from discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of January 2, 2011 and January 3, 2010.

The Company recorded the following pre-tax gains and losses,
which have been reported as a gain (loss) on disposition of discontinued operations during the three fiscal years ended:

In November 2010, the Company
sold its Illumination and Detection Solutions (“IDS”) business, which was included in the Company’s Environmental Health segment, for approximately $500.0 million, $482.0 million net of payments for acquired cash balances, subject to
an adjustment for working capital as of the closing date. The Company expects the divestiture of its IDS business to reduce the complexity of its product offerings and



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

organizational structure, and to provide capital to reinvest in other Human Health and Environmental Health end markets. The buyer acquired the Company’s IDS business through the purchase of
all outstanding stock of certain of the Company’s subsidiaries located in Germany, Canada, China, Indonesia, the Philippines, the United Kingdom and the United States as well as the purchase of related assets and the assumption of liabilities
held by the Company and certain of its subsidiaries located in Singapore and Germany. The Company recognized a pre-tax gain of $315.3 million, inclusive of the net working capital adjustment, in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010 as a result of
the sale of its IDS business. The gain was recognized as a gain on the disposition of discontinued operations.

As part of the Company’s strategic business alignment into the Human Health and Environmental Health segments, completed at the
beginning of fiscal year 2009, and the Company’s continuing efforts to focus on higher growth opportunities, in December 2008, the Company’s management approved separate plans to divest its Photonics and Photoflash businesses. The
distressed economic conditions during fiscal year 2009 adversely impacted the Company’s plan to market and sell the Photonics and Photoflash businesses. The Company implemented a number of actions during fiscal year 2009 to respond to these
changing circumstances and continued to actively market these businesses. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009, the Company determined that it could not effectively market and sell the Photonics business given the changed circumstances and,
after careful consideration, the Company decided to cease its plan to actively market and sell the Photonics business on a standalone basis. The Photonics business was included with the set of businesses which were sold as the Company’s IDS
business, as described above. In June 2010, the Company sold the Photoflash business for approximately $13.5 million, including a net working capital adjustment, plus potential additional contingent consideration. The Company recognized a pre-tax
gain of $4.4 million, inclusive of the net working capital adjustment, in the second quarter of fiscal year 2010 as a result of the sale. The gain was recognized as a gain on the disposition of discontinued operations.

In addition, during December 2008, the Company’s
management approved the shut down of certain instrument businesses within the Human Health segment, including Cellular Screening Fluorescence and Luminescence workstations, Analytical Proteomics Instruments and Proteomics and Genomics Instruments,
which resulted in a pre-tax gain of $0.1 million, a pre-tax gain of $0.4 million and a pre-tax loss of $4.8 million related to lease and severance costs and the reduction of fixed assets and inventory to net realizable value during fiscal years
2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

In November 2007, the Company acquired ViaCell, Inc. (“ViaCell”), which specializes in the collection, testing, processing and preservation of umbilical cord blood stem cells. Following the
ViaCell acquisition, the Board of Directors (the “Board”) approved a plan to sell the ViaCyte

SM

and Cellular Therapy Technology businesses that were acquired with ViaCell. The Company determined that both businesses did not strategically fit with the other products offered by the Human Health
segment. The Company also determined that without investing capital into the operations of both businesses, the Company could not effectively compete with larger companies that focus on the market for such products. After careful consideration, the
Company decided in the second quarter of fiscal year 2008 to shut down the ViaCyte

SM

and Cellular Therapy Technology businesses. The Company recorded a pre-tax loss of $8.0 million for severance and facility closure costs during fiscal year 2008 and recorded additional pre-tax losses
of $0.1 million and $1.3 million related to facility closure costs during fiscal years 2010 and 2009, respectively.

During fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company settled various commitments related to the divestiture of other discontinued
operations and recognized a pre-tax loss of $1.8 million in fiscal year 2010, a pre-tax loss of $2.1 million in fiscal year 2009 and a pre-tax loss of $0.4 million in fiscal year 2008. During fiscal year 2009, the Company reached a settlement with
the landlord of a closed facility and recognized a pre-tax loss of $1.4 million.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Summary pre-tax operating results of the discontinued operations for the periods prior
to disposition were as follows:

The Company recognized a tax
provision of $94.0 million on discontinued operations in fiscal year 2010, a tax provision of $4.6 million on discontinued operations in fiscal year 2009 and a tax benefit of $2.1 million in fiscal year 2008 on discontinued operations. The
recognition of $94.0 million income tax expense in fiscal year 2010 includes $16.0 million of income tax expense associated with unremitted earnings of directly-owned foreign subsidiaries that no longer qualify as permanently reinvested once the
subsidiary is held for sale, and $65.8 million of income tax expense for additional unremitted earnings from foreign subsidiaries associated with the sale of the Company’s IDS and Photoflash businesses that do not require the same level of
capital as previously required, and therefore the Company plans to repatriate $250.0 million of cash and have provided for the taxes on the related previously unremitted earnings. The benefit from income taxes of $2.1 million recorded in
discontinued operations in fiscal year 2008 includes $8.5 million of income tax benefits related to the favorable settlement of several income tax audits worldwide during the third quarter of fiscal year 2008, as discussed in Note 6, below.

Note 4:

Restructuring and Lease Charges, Net

The Company has undertaken a series of restructuring actions related to the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, alignment with the
Company’s growth strategy and the integration of its business units.

A description of the restructuring plans and the activity recorded are as follows:

The restructuring plan for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010 was intended principally to shift resources to higher growth geographic
regions and end markets. The restructuring plans for the second quarter of fiscal year 2010 and third quarter of fiscal year 2009 were intended principally to reduce resources in response to the continued economic downturn and its impact on demand
in certain end markets and to shift resources to higher growth geographic regions and end markets. The restructuring plan for the first quarter of fiscal year 2009 was intended principally to reduce resources in response to the economic downturn and
its impact on demand in certain end markets. The activities associated with these plans have been reported as restructuring expenses and are included as a component of operating expenses from continuing operations.

Q4 2010 Restructuring Plan

During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010, the
Company’s management approved a plan to shift resources to higher growth geographic regions and end markets (the “Q4 2010 Plan”). As a result of the Q4 2010 Plan, the Company recognized a $5.6 million pre-tax restructuring charge in
the Human Health segment related to a workforce reduction from reorganization activities and the closure of excess facility space. The Company also recognized a $7.6 million pre-tax restructuring charge in the Environmental Health segment related to
a workforce reduction from reorganization activities and the closure of excess facility space. The restructuring costs for the closure of excess facility space was offset by the recognition of a $2.8 million gain that had been deferred from a
previous sales-leaseback transaction on this facility. As part of the Q4 2010 Plan, the Company reduced headcount by 113 employees. All employee notifications and actions related to the closure of excess facility space for the Q4 2010 Plan were
completed by January 2, 2011.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The following table summarizes the Q4 2010 Plan activity:

All employee relationships have
been severed and the Company anticipates that the remaining severance payments of $7.9 million for workforce reductions will be completed by the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012. The Company also anticipates that the remaining payments
of $4.1 million for the closure of excess facility space will be paid through fiscal year 2022, in accordance with the terms of the applicable lease.

Q2 2010 Restructuring Plan

During the second quarter of fiscal year 2010, the Company’s management approved a plan to reduce resources in response to the
continued economic downturn and its impact on demand in certain end markets and to shift resources to higher growth geographic regions and end markets (the “Q2 2010 Plan”). As a result of the Q2 2010 Plan, the Company recognized a $7.0
million pre-tax restructuring charge in the Human Health segment related to a workforce reduction from reorganization activities and the closure of excess facility space. The restructuring costs for the closure of excess facility space was offset by
the recognition of a $0.1 million gain that had been deferred from a previous sales-leaseback transaction on this facility. The Company also recognized a $3.9 million pre-tax restructuring charge in the Environmental Health segment related to a
workforce reduction from reorganization activities. As part of the Q2 2010 Plan, the Company reduced headcount by 115 employees. All employee notifications and actions related to the closure of excess facility space for the Q2 2010 Plan were
completed by July 4, 2010.

The following
table summarizes the Q2 2010 Plan activity:

All employee relationships have
been severed and the Company anticipates that the remaining severance payments of $2.2 million for workforce reductions will be completed by the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011. The Company also anticipates that the remaining payments
of $2.1 million for the closure of excess facility space will be paid through fiscal year 2022, in accordance with the terms of the applicable lease.

Q3 2009 Plan

During the third quarter of fiscal year 2009, the Company’s management approved a plan to reduce resources in anticipation of the
economic downturn and its impact on demand in certain end markets and to shift resources to higher growth geographic regions and end markets (the “Q3 2009 Plan”). As a result of the Q3 2009



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Plan, the Company recognized a $4.3 million pre-tax restructuring charge in the Human Health segment related to a workforce reduction from reorganization activities and the closure of an excess
facility. The Company also recognized a $6.3 million pre-tax restructuring charge in the Environmental Health segment related to a workforce reduction from reorganization activities. During fiscal year 2010, the Company recorded a pre-tax
restructuring reversal of $0.5 million relating to its Q3 2009 Plan due to lower than expected costs associated with the workforce reductions in Europe within both the Human Health and Environmental Health segments. As part of the Q3 2009 Plan, the
Company reduced headcount by 131 employees. All notifications and actions related to the Q3 2009 Plan were completed by October 4, 2009.

The following table summarizes the Q3 2009 Plan activity:

All employee relationships have
been severed and the Company anticipates that the remaining severance payments of $2.0 million for workforce reductions will be completed by the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011. The Company also anticipates that the remaining payments
of $0.1 million for the closure of the excess facility will be paid through fiscal year 2011, in accordance with the terms of the applicable lease.

Q1 2009 Plan

During the first quarter of fiscal year 2009, the Company’s management approved a plan to reduce resources in anticipation of the
economic downturn and its impact on demand in certain end markets (the “Q1 2009 Plan”). As a result of the Q1 2009 Plan, the Company recognized a $4.8 million pre-tax restructuring charge in the Human Health segment related to a workforce
reduction from reorganization activities and the closure of an excess facility. The Company also recognized a $2.4 million pre-tax restructuring charge in the Environmental Health segment related to a workforce reduction from reorganization
activities and the closure of an excess facility. During fiscal year 2010, the Company recorded a pre-tax restructuring reversal of $1.2 million relating to its Q1 2009 Plan due to lower than expected costs associated with the workforce reductions
in Europe within both the Human Health and Environmental Health segments. As part of the Q1 2009 Plan, the Company reduced headcount by 106 employees. All notifications and actions related to the Q1 2009 Plan were completed by April 5, 2009.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The following table summarizes the Q1 2009 Plan activity:

All employee relationships have
been severed and the Company anticipates that the remaining severance payments of $0.4 million for workforce reductions will be completed by the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011. The Company also anticipates that the remaining payments
of $0.2 million for the closure of the excess facility will be paid through fiscal year 2012, in accordance with the terms of the applicable lease.

Previous Restructuring and Integration Plans

The principal actions of the restructuring and integration
plans from fiscal years 2001 through 2008 were workforce reductions related to the integration of the Company’s businesses in order to reduce costs and achieve operational efficiencies as well as workforce reductions in both the Human Health
and Environmental Health segments by shifting resources into geographic regions and product lines that are more consistent with the Company’s growth strategy. During fiscal year 2010, the Company paid $1.5 million related to these plans,
recorded a reversal of $0.9 million related to lower than expected costs associated with workforce reductions in Europe within both the Human Health and Environmental Health segments, and recorded a charge of $0.4 million to reduce the estimated
sublease rental payments reasonably expected to be obtained for an excess facility in Europe within the Environmental Health segment. As of January 2, 2011, the Company had approximately $3.7 million of remaining liabilities associated with
these restructuring and integration plans, primarily for residual lease obligations related to closed facilities in both the Human Health and Environmental Health segments. Payments for these leases, the terms of which vary in length, will be made
through fiscal year 2022.

Lease Charges

To facilitate the sale of a business in
fiscal year 2001, the Company was required to guarantee the lease obligations that the buyer assumed related to the lease for the building in which the business operated. The lease obligations continue through March 2011. While the Company assigned
its interest in the lease to the buyer at the time of the sale of the business, the buyer subsequently defaulted under the lease, and the lessor sought reimbursement from the Company. The Company recorded a charge of $2.7 million in fiscal year 2007
related to payments for this lease obligation. The buyer filed for bankruptcy protection during the third quarter of fiscal year 2008 and was delinquent in making both its lease payments and payments for certain building expenses. The buyer ceased
operations in the third quarter of fiscal year 2009 and vacated the property. The Company recorded an additional charge of $0.9 million during the third quarter of fiscal year 2009 related to waste removal and restoration costs, and reduced the
estimated sublease rental payments reasonably expected to be obtained for the property. The Company also recorded an additional charge of $0.1 million during the second quarter of fiscal year 2010 to further reduce the estimated sublease rental
payments reasonably expected to be obtained for the property. The Company was required to make payments for these obligations of $1.7 million during fiscal year 2010, $1.1 million during fiscal year 2009, and $0.4 million during fiscal year 2008.
The remaining balance of this accrual as of January 2, 2011 was $0.5 million.

Note 6:

Income Taxes

The Company regularly reviews its tax positions in each significant taxing jurisdiction in the process of evaluating its unrecognized tax
benefits. The Company makes adjustments to its unrecognized tax benefits when: (i) facts and circumstances regarding a tax position change, causing a change in management’s judgment regarding that tax position; (ii) a tax position is
effectively settled with a tax authority; and/or (iii) the statute of limitations expires regarding a tax position.

The tabular reconciliation of the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

The Company continues to
classify interest and penalties as a component of income tax expense. At January 2, 2011, the Company had accrued approximately $6.1 million and $6.2 million in interest and penalties, respectively. During fiscal year 2010, the Company
recognized approximately $0.8 million in interest and $0.9 million in penalties in its total tax provision. During fiscal year 2009, the Company recognized approximately $1.1 million in interest and a reversal of $0.5 million in penalties in its
total tax provision. At January 2, 2011, the Company had gross tax effected unrecognized tax benefits of $39.2 million ($6.3 million included in current liabilities and $32.9 million included in long-term liabilities), of which $33.2 million,
if recognized, would affect the continuing operations effective tax rate. The remaining amount, if recognized, would affect discontinued operations. With the Company’s adoption of the new authoritative guidance on business combinations in the
first quarter of fiscal year 2009, changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties, after the acquisition date, will affect income tax expense, including those associated with acquisitions that closed prior to the
effective date of the new authoritative guidance on business combinations.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

At January 2, 2011, the Company had uncertain tax positions of $6.5 million,
including accrued interest, net of tax benefits, and penalties, which are expected to be resolved within the next year. A portion of the uncertain tax positions could affect the continuing operations effective tax rate depending on the ultimate
resolution; however, the Company cannot quantify an estimated range at this time. The Company is subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as to income tax of numerous state and foreign jurisdictions.

The Company re-measured several of its uncertain tax
positions related to fiscal years 2006 through 2009 during fiscal years 2010 and 2009 based on new information arising from events during the year that affected positions for those years. The Company also effectively settled several income tax
audits worldwide. The re-measurements and closure of audits included uncertain tax positions in Hong Kong, the United Kingdom, Australia, the Philippines, and the federal and certain state governments within the United States. The net effect of
these re-measurements and closure of audits, statute of limitations lapses, provision to return adjustments, interest expense accruals, as well as other discrete items, resulted in the recognition of $11.9 million of income tax benefits in
continuing operations during fiscal year 2010 and $1.6 million of income tax benefits in continuing operations during fiscal year 2009. During fiscal year 2008, the Company effectively settled several income tax audits worldwide, including in
Canada, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States covering various years ranging from 1998 through 2005. The closing of these audits resulted in the recognition of $15.6 million of income tax benefits in continuing operations and
$8.5 million of income tax benefits in discontinued operations. Tax years ranging from 2000 through 2010 remain open to examination by various tax jurisdictions in which the Company has significant business operations, such as Singapore, Canada,
Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States. The tax years under examination vary by jurisdiction.

The tax effects of temporary
differences and attributes that gave rise to deferred income tax assets and liabilities as of January 2, 2011 and January 3, 2010 were as follows:



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

At January 2, 2011, the Company had state net operating loss carryforwards of
$206.3 million, foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $159.3 million, state tax credit carryforwards of $3.0 million, general business tax credit carryforwards of $10.3 million, and foreign tax credit carryforwards of $8.5 million. These are
subject to expiration in years ranging from 2011 to 2029, and without expiration for certain foreign net operating loss carryforwards and certain state credit carryforwards. At January 2, 2011, the Company also had U.S. federal net operating
loss carryforwards of approximately $92.2 million and federal credit carryforwards of approximately $3.6 million as a result of acquisitions made during fiscal years 2007 through 2010. The utilization of these losses and credits is subject to annual
limitations based on Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. These federal losses and credits will expire in fiscal years 2011 through 2026.

Valuation allowances generally take into consideration
limitations imposed upon the use of the tax attributes and reduce the value of such items to the likely net realizable amount. Based on the judgment of the Company, and consistent with prior years, full valuation allowances have been established
against these tax attributes with the exception of acquired federal net operating loss carryforwards, certain foreign net operating loss carryforwards and the federal research and experimental tax credit carryforwards that have been determined to be
more likely than not to be realized. The tax benefit of the reversal of the valuation allowance associated with the Company’s research and experimental credits was reported as part of the gain on disposal of discontinued operations in fiscal
year 2005. The foreign tax credit carryforwards of $8.5 million, if utilized, will result in a credit to equity rather than a reduction of the income tax provision on continuing operations.

In November 2009, the Worker, Homeownership, and Business Assistance Act of 2009 was enacted and allowed
businesses with net operating losses for 2008 or 2009 to carry back those losses for up to five years. The Company had anticipated carrying back losses of up to $80.0 million at the end of fiscal 2009 and classified certain deferred taxes
anticipated to be monetized with the filing of the 2009 tax return as a tax receivable. Subsequently, the Company decided not to implement all of the tax deferral strategies previously anticipated, and carried back losses of $43.6 million from
fiscal year 2009 to fiscal year 2005. As a result, the tax attributes that related to tax deferral strategies not implemented have reduced the Company’s deferred tax liability balances, with a corresponding reduction in income tax receivable.
The Company received a federal income tax refund of $8.9 million in January 2011 and generated general business tax credit carryforwards of $6.4 million.

Current deferred tax assets of $12.1 million and $28.8 million were included in other current assets at January 2, 2011 and
January 3, 2010, respectively. Short-term deferred tax liabilities of $15.8 million were included in other current liabilities at January 2, 2011. Short-term deferred tax liabilities were zero at January 3, 2010. Long-term deferred
tax liabilities of $54.6 million and $42.2 million were included in other long-term liabilities at January 2, 2011 and January 3, 2010, respectively.

As a result of the sale of the IDS and Photoflash businesses, the Company concluded that the remaining operations within those foreign
subsidiaries previously containing IDS and Photoflash operations did not require the same level of capital as previously required, and therefore the Company plans to repatriate $250.0 million of cash and has provided for the taxes on the
related previously unremitted earnings. Taxes have not been provided for unremitted earnings that the Company continues to consider permanently reinvested, which is based on its future operational and capital requirements. The impact of this tax
provision in fiscal year 2010 was an increase to the Company’s tax provision of $65.8 million in discontinued operations. The Company expects to utilize existing tax attributes to repatriate these earnings and expect the taxes to be paid to
repatriate these earnings will be minimal. The Company continues to maintain its permanent reinvestment assertion with regards to the remaining unremitted earnings of its foreign subsidiaries, and therefore does not accrue U.S. tax for the
repatriation of its remaining unremitted foreign earnings. As of January 2, 2011, the amount of foreign earnings that are expected to remain invested outside the U.S. indefinitely and for which no U.S. tax cost has been provided was
approximately $514.0 million. It is not practical to calculate the unrecognized deferred tax liability on those earnings.

Note 7:

Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per share was computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period
less restricted unvested shares. Diluted earnings per share was computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding plus all potentially dilutive common stock equivalents, primarily shares issuable upon the
exercise of stock options using the treasury stock method. The following table reconciles the number of shares utilized in the earnings per share calculations:

Antidilutive securities include
outstanding stock options with exercise prices and average unrecognized compensation cost in excess of the average fair market value of common stock for the related period. Antidilutive options were excluded from the calculation of diluted net
income per share and could become dilutive in the future.

Accounts Receivable, Net

Accounts receivable were net of reserves for doubtful accounts of $23.7 million and $22.3 million as of January 2, 2011 and
January 3, 2010, respectively.

During fiscal
year 2001, the Company established a wholly owned consolidated subsidiary to maintain a receivables purchase agreement with a third-party financial institution. Under this arrangement, the Company sold, on a revolving basis, certain of the
Company’s accounts receivable balances to the consolidated subsidiary which simultaneously sold an undivided percentage ownership interest in designated pools of receivables to a third-party financial institution. As collections reduced the
balance of sold accounts receivable, new receivables were sold. The Company’s consolidated subsidiary retained the risk of credit loss on the receivables. Accordingly, the full amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts had been provided for
on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The amount of receivables sold and outstanding with the third-party financial institution was not to exceed $65.0 million, reduced to $50.0 million in March 2009. Under the terms of this agreement,
the Company’s consolidated subsidiary retained collection and administrative responsibilities for the balances. The agreement required the third-party financial institution to be paid interest during the period from the date the receivable was
sold to its maturity date.

In March 2009, the
Company’s consolidated subsidiary entered into an agreement to extend the term of the accounts receivable securitization facility to December 30, 2009. On June 30, 2009, the Company’s consolidated subsidiary exercised the right
to terminate the receivables purchase agreement with a third-party financial institution, releasing both parties of their rights, liabilities and obligations under this agreement.

Note 12:

Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net

The Company tests goodwill and non-amortizing intangible assets at least annually for possible impairment. Accordingly, the Company
completes the annual testing of impairment for goodwill and non-amortizing intangible assets on the later of January 1 or the first day of each fiscal year. In addition to its annual test, the Company regularly evaluates whether events or
circumstances have occurred that may indicate a potential impairment of goodwill or non-amortizing intangible assets.

As discussed in Note 22, the Company realigned its organization into two new operating segments at the beginning of fiscal year 2009. In
conjunction with the realignment of its operating segments, the Company also redefined its reporting units based on the new alignment of its operating segments. Financial information in this report relating to fiscal year 2008 has been
retrospectively adjusted to reflect the changes in the Company’s operating segments. The Company’s segment management reviews the results of the operations at the operating segment level or one level below its operating segments.

The Company has determined that the reporting
units that should be used to test goodwill for impairment are the analytical sciences and laboratory services, genetic screening, bio-discovery and medical imaging. The income approach, specifically the discounted cash flow model, was used to
determine the fair values of each of the reporting units in order to allocate goodwill on a relative fair value basis.

The process of testing goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of the applicable reporting units. The test
consists of a two-step process. The first step is the comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if the carrying value exceeds the fair value. The second step measures the amount of an impairment loss, and
is only performed if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit. The Company performed its annual impairment testing for its reporting units on January 4, 2010, the annual impairment date for fiscal year 2010, and concluded
based on the first step of the process that there was no goodwill impairment.

The Company has consistently employed the income approach to estimate the current fair value when testing for impairment of goodwill. A number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the
application of the income approach to forecast operating cash flows, including markets and market share, sales



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

volumes and prices, costs to produce, tax rates, capital spending, discount rates, and working capital changes. Cash flow forecasts are based on approved business unit operating plans for the
early years’ cash flows and historical relationships in later years. The income approach is sensitive to changes in long-term terminal growth rates and the discount rates. The long-term terminal growth rates are consistent with the
Company’s historical long-term terminal growth rates, as the current economic trends are not expected to affect the long-term terminal growth rates of the Company. In fiscal year 2010, the long-term terminal growth rates for the Company’s
reporting units ranged from 5.0% to 7.5%. The range for the discount rates for the reporting units was 10.5% to 14.0%. Keeping all other variables constant, a 10.0% change in any one of the input assumptions for the various reporting units would
still allow the Company to conclude, based on the first step of the process, that there was no impairment of goodwill.

The Company has consistently employed the relief from royalty model to estimate the current fair value when testing for impairment of
non-amortizing intangible assets. The impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the non-amortizing intangible asset with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a non-amortizing intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an
impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess is recognized

.

In addition, the Company evaluates the remaining useful life of its non-amortizing intangible assets at least annually to determine whether events or circumstances continue to
support an indefinite useful life. If events or circumstances indicate that the useful lives of non-amortizing intangible assets are no longer indefinite, the assets will be tested for impairment. These intangible assets will then be amortized
prospectively over their estimated remaining useful life and accounted for in the same manner as other intangible assets that are subject to amortization. The Company performed its annual impairment testing of these assets on January 4, 2010,
and concluded that there was no impairment of non-amortizing intangible assets. An assessment of the recoverability of amortizing intangible assets takes place only when events have occurred that may give rise to an impairment. No such events
occurred during fiscal year 2010.

The changes in
the carrying amount of goodwill for fiscal years 2010 and 2009 are as follows, which included changes related to acquisitions completed during fiscal years 2010 and 2009 and immaterial adjustments related to acquisitions completed prior to fiscal
year 2009:

As discussed in Note 2, the
January 3, 2010 goodwill balance has been retrospectively adjusted by $5.4 million for the measurement period adjustment related to the Analytica acquisition. As discussed in Note 3, the financial information in this report relating to fiscal
years 2010, 2009 and 2008 has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the divesture of the Company’s IDS business, including the goodwill and identifiable intangible asset balances as of January 2, 2011, January 3, 2010 and
December 28, 2008.

Note 13:

Debt

Amended Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility.

On August 13, 2007, the Company entered into an amended and restated
senior unsecured revolving credit facility which provides for a $650.0 million facility through August 13, 2012. Letters of credit in the aggregate amount of approximately $14.0 million are treated as issued under this amended facility. The
Company uses the amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes, which may include working capital, refinancing existing indebtedness, capital expenditures, share repurchases, acquisitions and strategic alliances.
The interest rates under the amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility are based on the Eurocurrency rate at the time of borrowing plus a margin, or the base rate from time to time. The base rate is the higher of (i) the corporate base
rate announced from time to time by Bank of America, N.A. and (ii) the Federal Funds rate plus 50 basis points. The Company may allocate all or a portion of its indebtedness under the amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility to
interest based upon the Eurocurrency rate plus a margin, or the base rate. The Eurocurrency margin as of January 2, 2011 was 40 basis points. The weighted average Eurocurrency interest rate as of January 2, 2011 was 0.26%, resulting in a
weighted average effective Eurocurrency rate, including the margin, of 0.66%. The Company had drawn down



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

$274.0 million of borrowings in U.S. Dollars under the facility as of January 2, 2011, with interest based on the above described Eurocurrency rate. The agreement for the facility contains
affirmative, negative and financial covenants and events of default customary for financings of this type, which are consistent with those financial covenants contained in the Company’s previous senior revolving credit agreement. The financial
covenants in the Company’s amended and restated senior unsecured revolving credit facility include debt-to-capital ratios and a contingent maximum total leverage ratio, applicable if the Company’s credit rating is down-graded below
investment grade.

6% Senior Unsecured
Notes.

On May 30, 2008, the Company issued and sold seven-year senior notes at a rate of 6% with a face value of $150.0 million and received $150.0 million in gross proceeds from the issuance. The debt, which matures in May
2015, is unsecured. Interest on the 6% senior notes is payable semi-annually on May 30th and November 30th. The Company may redeem some or all of its 6% senior notes at any time in an amount not less than 10% of the original
aggregate principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, plus the applicable make-whole amount. The financial covenants in the Company’s 6% senior notes include debt-to-capital ratios which, if the Company’s credit rating is
down-graded below investment grade, would be replaced by a contingent maximum total leverage ratio.

The Company entered into forward interest rate contracts in October 2007, with notional amounts totaling $300.0 million and a weighted average interest rate of 4.25%, that were intended to hedge movements
in interest rates prior to the Company’s expected debt issuance. In May 2008, the Company settled forward interest rate contracts with notional amounts totaling $150.0 million upon the issuance of its 6% senior unsecured notes, and recognized
$8.4 million, net of taxes of $5.4 million, of accumulated derivative losses in other comprehensive (loss) income. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008, the Company concluded that the remaining portion of the expected debt issuance,
with a notional amount totaling $150.0 million, was no longer probable. As a result of the debt issuance no longer being probable, the Company discontinued and settled the forward interest rate contracts with notional amounts totaling $150.0 million
and recognized a loss of $17.5 million in interest and other (income) expense, net.

As of January 2, 2011, the balance remaining in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the effective cash flow hedges was $5.3 million, net of taxes of $3.4 million. The derivative
losses are being amortized into interest expense when the hedged exposure affects interest expense. The Company amortized $2.0 million into interest expense during each of the fiscal years 2010 and 2009, and $1.2 million during fiscal year 2008.

The following table summarizes the maturities of
the Company’s indebtedness at January 2, 2011:

Employee Benefit Plans

Savings Plan:

The Company has a 401(k) Savings Plan for the benefit of all qualified U.S. employees. Under
this plan, the Company’s employees, other than those eligible for continued accruals under the defined benefit pension plan in fiscal year 2010, received matching contributions in the amount equal to 100% of the first 5% of eligible
compensation up to applicable Internal Revenue Service limits. Employees eligible for continued accruals under the defined benefit pension plan in fiscal year 2010 received matching contributions of 55% of the first 6% of eligible compensation.
Effective February 1, 2011, all employees receive matching contributions in the amount equal to 100% of the first 5% of eligible compensation up to applicable Internal Revenue Service limits as active pension accruals ceased effective
January 31, 2011. Savings plan expense was $10.6 million in fiscal year 2010, $10.6 million in fiscal year 2009 and $9.7 million in fiscal year 2008.

Pension Plans:

The Company has a defined benefit pension plan covering some U.S. employees and non-U.S.
pension plans for some non-U.S. employees. The principal U.S. defined benefit pension plan was closed to new hires effective January 31, 2001, and benefits for those employed by the Company’s former Life Sciences businesses were frozen as
of that date. Plan benefits were frozen as of March 2003 for those employed by the Company’s former Analytical Instruments business and corporate employees. Plan benefits were frozen as of January 31, 2011 for all employees that were still
actively accruing in the plan. The plans provide benefits that are based on an employee’s years of service and compensation near retirement.

Net periodic pension cost for U.S. and non-U.S. plans included the following components:

The following table sets forth the changes in the funded status of the principal U.S.
pension plan and the principal non-U.S. pension plans and the amounts recognized in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets as of January 2, 2011 and January 3, 2010.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Assets of the defined benefit pension plans are primarily equity and debt securities. Asset allocations at January 2, 2011 and January 3, 2010, and target asset allocations for fiscal year 2011
are as follows:

(1)

Blackstone Park Avenue Non-Taxable Fund L.P. was redeemed for cash as of December 31, 2009. This amount was included in the “Other” asset category and
“Equity securities” asset category as of January 3, 2010. The Company reinvested this cash into equity securities during the first and second quarters of fiscal year 2010.

The Company maintains target allocation percentages among
various asset classes based on investment policies established for the pension plans which are designed to maximize the total rate of return (income and appreciation) after inflation within the limits of prudent risk taking, while providing for
adequate near-term liquidity for benefit payments. The Company’s expected returns on assets assumptions are derived from management’s estimates, as well as other information compiled by management, including studies that utilize customary
procedures and techniques. The studies include a review of anticipated future long-term performance of individual asset classes and consideration of the appropriate asset allocation strategy given the anticipated requirements of the plans to
determine the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested to provide for the pension plans benefits. While the study gives appropriate consideration to recent fund performance and historical returns, the assumption is primarily a
long-term, prospective rate.

The target
allocations for plan assets are listed in the above table. Equity securities primarily include investments in large-cap and mid-cap companies located in the United States and abroad, and equity index funds. Debt securities include corporate bonds of
companies from diversified industries, high-yield bonds, and U.S. government securities. Other types of investments include investments in non U.S. government index liked bonds, multi-strategy hedge funds and venture capital funds that follow
several different strategies.

Valuation Techniques:

For Level 1 inputs, the
Company utilizes quoted market prices as these instruments have active markets. For Level 2 inputs, the Company utilizes quoted market prices in markets that are not active, broker or dealer quotations, or utilizes alternative pricing sources with
reasonable levels of price transparency. For Level 3 inputs, the Company utilizes unobservable inputs based on the best information available, including estimates by management primarily based on information provided by third-party fund managers,
independent brokerage firms and insurance companies.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending Level 3 assets for fiscal years 2010 and 2009 is as follows:

The Company does not expect to
make a contribution to the U.S. pension plan during fiscal year 2011. With respect to non-U.S. plans, the Company expects to contribute approximately $11.0 million in fiscal year 2011.

The Company also sponsors a supplemental executive retirement plan to provide senior
management with benefits in excess of normal pension benefits. Effective July 31, 2000, this plan was closed to new entrants. At January 2, 2011 and January 3, 2010, the projected benefit obligations were $19.1 million and $18.0
million, respectively. Assets with a fair value of $0.1 million, segregated in a trust (which is included in marketable securities and investments on the consolidated balance sheets), were available to meet this obligation as of both January 2,
2011 and January 3, 2010. Pension expense for this plan was approximately $1.6 million in fiscal year 2010, $1.5 million in fiscal year 2009 and $1.3 million in fiscal year 2008.

Postretirement Medical Plans:

The Company provides healthcare benefits for
eligible retired U.S. employees under a comprehensive major medical plan or under health maintenance organizations where available. The majority of the Company’s U.S. employees become eligible for retiree health benefits if they retire directly
from the Company and have at least ten years of service. Generally, the major medical plan pays stated percentages of covered expenses after a deductible is met and takes into consideration payments by other group coverage and by Medicare. The plan
requires retiree contributions under most circumstances and has provisions for cost-sharing charges. Effective January 1, 2000, this plan was closed to new hires. For employees retiring after 1991, the Company has capped its medical premium
contribution based on employees’ years of service. The Company funds the amount allowable under a 401(h) provision in the Company’s defined benefit pension plan. Assets of the plan are primarily equity and debt securities.

Note 16:

Contingencies

The Company is conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at current and former locations of the Company
and, along with other companies, has been named a potentially responsible party (“PRP”) for certain waste disposal sites. The Company accrues for environmental issues in the accounting period that the Company’s responsibility is
established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated. The Company has accrued $6.0 million as of January 2, 2011, which represents management’s estimate of the total cost of ultimate disposition of known environmental matters. This
amount is not discounted and does not reflect the recovery of any amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements. These cost estimates are subject to a number of variables, including the stage of the environmental investigations, the
magnitude of the possible contamination, the nature of the potential remedies, possible joint and several liability, the time period over which remediation may occur, and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations. For sites where the
Company has been named a PRP, management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute. The Company expects that the majority of such accrued amounts could be
paid out over a period of up to ten years. As assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site, these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available. There have been no
environmental problems to date that have had, or are expected to have, a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. While it is possible that a loss exceeding the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial
statements may be incurred, the potential exposure is not expected to be materially different from those amounts recorded.

Enzo Biochem, Inc. and Enzo Life Sciences, Inc. (collectively, “Enzo”) filed a complaint dated October 23, 2002 in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Civil Action No. 02-8448, against Amersham plc, Amersham BioSciences, PerkinElmer, Inc., PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Inc., Sigma-Aldrich Corporation, Sigma Chemical Company,
Inc., Molecular Probes, Inc., and Orchid BioSciences, Inc. (the “New York Case”). The complaint alleges that the Company has breached its distributorship and settlement agreements with Enzo, infringed Enzo’s patents, engaged in unfair
competition and fraud, and committed torts against Enzo by, among other things, engaging in commercial development and exploitation of Enzo’s patented products and technology, separately and together with the other defendants. Enzo seeks
injunctive and monetary relief. In 2003, the court severed the lawsuit and ordered Enzo to serve individual complaints against the five defendants. The Company subsequently filed an answer and a counterclaim alleging that Enzo’s patents are
invalid. In July 2006, the court issued a decision regarding the construction of the claims in Enzo’s patents that effectively limited the coverage of certain of those claims and, the Company believes, excludes certain of the Company’s
products from the coverage of Enzo’s patents. Summary judgment motions were filed by the defendants in January 2007, and a hearing with oral argument on those motions took place in July 2007. In January 2009, the case was assigned to a new
district court judge and in March 2009, the new judge denied the pending summary judgment motions without prejudice and ordered a stay of the case until the federal appellate court decides Enzo’s appeal of the judgment of the United States
District Court for the District of Connecticut in Enzo Biochem vs. Applera Corp. and Tropix, Inc. (the “Connecticut Case”), which involves a number of the same patents and which could materially affect the scope of Enzo’s case against
the Company. On March 26, 2010, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (“CAFC”) affirmed-in-part and reversed-in-part the judgment in the Connecticut Case. Pending further disposition of the Connecticut Case, the
New York Case against the Company and other defendants remains stayed.

The Company believes it has meritorious defenses to the matter described above, and it is contesting the action vigorously. While this matter is subject to uncertainty, in the opinion of the
Company’s management,



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

based on its review of the information available at this time, the resolution of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

The Company is also subject to various other
claims, legal proceedings and investigations covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of its business activities. Although the Company has established accruals for potential losses that it believes are probable and
reasonably estimable, in the opinion of the Company’s management, based on its review of the information available at this time, the total cost of resolving these other contingencies at January 2, 2011 should not have a material adverse
effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. However, each of these matters is subject to uncertainties, and it is possible that some of these matters may be resolved unfavorably to the Company.

Warranty Reserves

The Company provides warranty protection for certain products for periods usually ranging from one to three years beyond the date of sale.
The majority of costs associated with warranty obligations include the replacement of parts and the time for service personnel to respond to repair and replacement requests. A warranty reserve is recorded based upon historical results, supplemented
by management’s expectations of future costs. Warranty reserves are included in “Accrued expenses and other current liabilities” on the consolidated balance sheets. A summary of warranty reserve activity for the fiscal years ended

Stock-Based Compensation:

In addition to the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan, the Company formerly had three stock-based compensation plans, the Amended
and Restated 2001 Incentive Plan, the 2005 Incentive Plan and the Amended and Restated Life Sciences Incentive Plan (collectively the “Prior Plans”), under which the Company’s common stock was made available for stock option grants,
restricted stock awards, and stock grants as part of the Company’s compensation programs. On April 28, 2009, the Company’s shareholders approved the 2009 Incentive Plan (the “2009 Plan”), which is described in more detail in
the Company’s definitive proxy statement



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 20, 2009. Under the 2009 Plan, 10.0 million shares of the Company’s common stock, as well as shares of the Company’s
common stock previously granted under the Amended and Restated 2001 Incentive Plan and the 2005 Incentive Plan that were cancelled or forfeited without the shares being issued, are authorized for stock option grants, restricted stock awards, and
stock grants as part of the Company’s compensation programs. The 2009 Plan replaced the Prior Plans. Awards granted under the Prior Plans prior to the approval of the 2009 Plan remain outstanding.

For fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company recorded
incremental pre-tax compensation expense related to the stock options of $6.6 million, $8.7 million, and $10.4 million, respectively. The total pre-tax stock-based compensation expense for the cost of stock options, restricted stock, restricted
stock units, performance units and stock grants was $13.8 million in both fiscal years 2010 and 2009 and $17.8 million in fiscal year 2008. The total pre-tax stock-based compensation expense recognized in continuing operations for the cost of stock
options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance units and stock grants was $12.6 million in fiscal year 2010, $12.8 million in fiscal year 2009 and $16.6 million in fiscal year 2008. The total pre-tax stock-based compensation expense
recognized in discontinued operations for the cost of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance units and stock grants was $1.2 million in fiscal year 2010, $1.0 million in fiscal year 2009 and $1.2 million in fiscal year
2008. The total income tax benefit recognized in the consolidated statements of operations for stock-based compensation was $4.7 million in fiscal year 2010, $4.8 million in fiscal year 2009 and $5.1 million in fiscal year 2008. Stock-based
compensation costs capitalized as part of inventory were $0.3 million and $0.2 million as of January 2, 2011 and January 3, 2010, respectively.

Stock Options:

The Company has granted options to purchase common shares at prices equal to the market price
of the common shares on the date the option is granted. Conditions of vesting are determined at the time of grant. Options are generally exercisable in equal annual installments over a period of three years, and will generally expire seven years
after the date of grant. Options assumed as part of business combination transactions retain all the rights, terms and conditions of the respective plans under which they were originally issued.

The fair value of each option grant is estimated using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally the vesting period. Use of a valuation model requires management to make certain
assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. Expected volatility was calculated primarily based on the historical volatility of the Company’s stock. The average expected life was based on the contractual term of the option and historic
exercise experience. The risk-free interest rate is based on United States Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life assumed at the date of grant. Forfeitures are estimated based on voluntary termination behavior,
as well as an analysis of actual option forfeitures. The Company’s weighted-average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model are as follows:

The following table summarizes stock option activity for the three fiscal years ended
January 2, 2011:

The weighted-average grant-date
fair value of options granted during fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008 were $5.99, $3.33, and $5.85, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008 were $6.1 million, $2.0 million, and $19.4
million, respectively. Cash received from option exercises for fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $29.0 million, $6.2 million, and $43.7 million, respectively. The related excess tax benefit classified as a financing cash inflow was $2.4 million
for fiscal year 2010, $0.2 million for fiscal year 2009, and $0.3 million for fiscal year 2008.

The aggregate intrinsic value for stock options outstanding at January 2, 2011 was $25.3 million with a weighted-average remaining contractual term of 3.2 years. The aggregate intrinsic value for
stock options exercisable at January 2, 2011 was $10.7 million with a weighted-average remaining contractual term of 2.2 years. At January 2, 2011, there were 6.6 million stock options that were vested, and expected to vest in the
future, with an aggregate intrinsic value of $23.9 million and a weighted-average remaining contractual term of 3.2 years.

There was $5.4 million of total unrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to nonvested stock options granted
as of January 2, 2011. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.6 years, and will be adjusted for any future changes in estimated forfeitures.

The following table summarizes total compensation expense recognized related to the stock options, which is a
function of current and prior year awards, net of estimated forfeitures, included in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations during the fiscal years ended:



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Restricted Stock Awards:

The Company has awarded shares of
restricted stock and restricted stock units that contain time-based vesting provisions and performance-based vesting provisions to certain employees at no cost to them, which cannot be sold, assigned, transferred or pledged during the restriction
period. These awards were granted under the Company’s 2009 Plan, 2005 Incentive Plan and 2001 Incentive Plan. Recipients of the restricted stock have the right to vote such shares and receive dividends.

Restricted Stock Awards (Time-based Vesting)

—The
Company grants restricted stock and restricted stock units that vest through the passage of time, assuming continued employment. The fair value of the award at the time of the grant is expensed on a straight line basis primarily in selling, general
and administrative expenses over the vesting period, which is generally three years.

Restricted Stock Awards (Performance-based Vesting)

—The Company grants restricted stock and restricted stock units that vest based on certain specified performance criteria, assuming
employment at the time the performance criteria are met. The fair value of the shares is expensed over the period of performance primarily in selling, general and administrative expenses, once achievement of criteria is deemed probable.

The following table summarizes the restricted stock activity
for the three fiscal years ended January 2, 2011:

The weighted-average grant-date
fair value of restricted stock awards granted were $21.20 in fiscal year 2010, $13.24 in fiscal year 2009, and $25.38 in fiscal year 2008. The fair value of restricted stock awards vested was $3.0 million in fiscal year 2010, $1.8 million in
fiscal year 2009, and $4.7 million in fiscal year 2008. The total compensation expense recognized related to the restricted stock awards, which is a function of current and prior year awards, was $4.3 million in fiscal year 2010, $2.3 million in
fiscal year 2009, and $6.0 million in fiscal year 2008.

As of January 2, 2011, there was $7.7 million of total unrecognized compensation cost, net of forfeitures, related to nonvested restricted stock awards. That cost is expected to be recognized over a
weighted-average period of 1.5 fiscal years.

Performance Units:

The Company’s performance unit program provides a cash award based on the
achievement of specific performance criteria. A target number of units are granted at the beginning of a three-year performance period. The number of units earned at the end of the performance period is determined by multiplying the number of units
granted by a performance factor ranging from 0% to 200%. Awards are determined by multiplying the number of units earned by the stock price at the end of the performance period, and are paid in cash and accounted for as a liability based award. The
compensation expense associated with these units is recognized over the period that the performance targets are expected to be achieved. The Company granted 129,879 performance units, 205,900 performance units, and 131,151 performance units during
fiscal



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

years 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. The weighted-average grant-date fair value of performance units granted during fiscal years 2010, 2009, and 2008 was $20.89, $13.17, and $24.95,
respectively. The total compensation expense related to these performance units, which is a function of current and prior year awards, was $2.0 million, $2.1 million, and $0.6 million for fiscal years 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. As of
January 2, 2011, there were 323,674 performance units outstanding subject to forfeiture.

Stock Awards:

The Company’s stock award program provides non-employee Directors an annual equity award. For fiscal years 2010, 2009, and 2008 the award equaled the
number of shares of the Company’s common stock which has an aggregate fair market value of $100,000 on the date of the award. The stock award is prorated for non-employee Directors who serve for only a portion of the year. The shares are
granted in April following the annual meeting of shareholders, on the third business day after the Company’s first quarter earnings release. The compensation expense associated with these stock awards is recognized when the stock award is
granted. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2008, a new non-employee Director was awarded 667 shares as a prorated award for serving a portion of fiscal year 2007. During fiscal years 2010, 2009, and 2008, each non-employee Director was awarded
4,337 shares, 5,790 shares, and 3,740 shares, respectively. The weighted-average grant-date fair value of stock awards granted during fiscal years 2010, 2009, and 2008 was $23.06, $17.27, and $26.70, respectively. The total compensation expense
recognized related to these stock awards was $0.8 million, $0.8 million, and $0.8 million for fiscal years 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan:

In April 1999, the Company’s shareholders approved the 1998 Employee
Stock Purchase Plan. In April 2005, the Compensation and Benefits Committee of the Board voted to amend the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, effective July 1, 2005, whereby participating employees have the right to purchase common stock at a price
equal to 95% of the closing price on the last day of each six-month offering period. The number of shares which an employee may purchase, subject to certain aggregate limits, is determined by the employee’s voluntary contribution, which may not
exceed 10% of the employee’s base compensation. During fiscal year 2010, the Company issued 0.1 million shares of common stock under the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan at a weighted-average price of $21.80 per share. During
fiscal year 2009, the Company issued 0.2 million shares under this plan at a weighted-average price of $16.05 per share. During fiscal year 2008, the Company issued 0.1 million shares under this plan at a weighted-average price of $25.56
per share. At January 2, 2011 there remains available for sale to employees an aggregate of 1.3 million shares of the Company’s common stock out of the 5.0 million shares authorized by shareholders for issuance under this plan.

Comprehensive (Loss) Income:

The components of accumulated other
comprehensive loss consists of the following:



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The tax effects on the foreign currency translation component of other comprehensive
(loss) income are minimal due to the Company’s previous position that undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries are permanently reinvested. As a result of the sale of the IDS and Photoflash businesses, the Company concluded that the
remaining operations within those foreign subsidiaries previously containing IDS and Photoflash operations did not require the same level of capital as previously required, and therefore the Company plans to repatriate $250.0 million of cash
and has provided for the taxes on the related previously unremitted earnings. Taxes have not been provided for unremitted earnings that the Company continues to consider permanently reinvested, which is based on its future operational and capital
requirements. The components of other comprehensive (loss) income were as follows:

Stock Repurchase Program:

On October 23, 2008, the Company
announced that the Board authorized the Company to repurchase up to 10.0 million shares of common stock under a stock repurchase program (the “Repurchase Program”). On August 31, 2010, the Company announced that the Board had
authorized the Company to repurchase an additional 5.0 million shares of common stock under the Repurchase Program. The Repurchase Program will expire on October 22, 2012 unless terminated earlier by the Board, and may be suspended or
discontinued at any time. During fiscal year 2008, the Company repurchased approximately 1.0 million shares of common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of $18.0 million, including commissions, under the Repurchase Program. During
fiscal year 2009, the Company repurchased approximately 1.0 million shares of common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of $14.2 million, including commissions, under the Repurchase Program. During fiscal year 2010, the Company
repurchased approximately 3.0 million shares of common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of $71.5 million, including commissions, under the Repurchase Program. As of January 2, 2011, approximately 10.0 million shares of
common stock remained available for repurchase from the



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

15.0 million shares authorized by the Board under the Repurchase Program. From January 3, 2011 through February 24, 2011, the Company repurchased approximately 3.0 million
shares of common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of $80.6 million, including commissions, under the Repurchase Program.

The Board has authorized the Company to repurchase shares of common stock to satisfy minimum statutory tax withholding obligations in
connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit awards granted pursuant to the Company’s equity incentive plans. During fiscal year 2008, the Company repurchased 37,521 shares of common stock. During fiscal year
2009, the Company repurchased 28,890 shares of common stock. During fiscal year 2010, the Company repurchased 57,551 shares of common stock for this purpose.

The repurchased shares have been reflected as additional authorized but unissued shares, with the payments reflected in common stock and
capital in excess of par value.

Dividends:

The Board declared regular quarterly
cash dividends of $0.07 per share in each quarter of fiscal year 2010 and in each quarter of fiscal year 2009. In the future, the Board may reduce or eliminate the Company’s common stock dividend in order to fund investments for growth,
repurchase shares or conserve capital resources.

Note 19:

Derivatives and Hedging Activities

The Company uses derivative instruments as part of its risk management strategy only, and includes derivatives utilized as economic hedges
that are not designated as hedging instruments. By nature, all financial instruments involve market and credit risks. The Company enters into derivative instruments with major investment grade financial institutions and has policies to monitor the
credit risk of those counterparties. The Company does not enter into derivative contracts for trading or other speculative purposes, nor does the Company use leveraged financial instruments. Approximately 61% of the Company’s business is
conducted outside of the United States, generally in foreign currencies. The fluctuations in foreign currency can increase the costs of financing, investing and operating the business. The intent of these economic hedges is to offset gains and
losses that occur on the underlying exposures from these currencies, with gains and losses resulting from the forward currency contracts that hedge these exposures.

In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into
foreign exchange contracts for periods consistent with its committed exposures to mitigate the effect of foreign currency movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Transactions covered by hedge contracts include intercompany and
third-party receivables and payables. The contracts are primarily in European and Asian currencies, have maturities that do not exceed 12 months, have no cash requirements until maturity, and are recorded at fair value on the Company’s
consolidated balance sheets. Unrealized gains and losses on the Company’s foreign currency contracts are recognized immediately in earnings for hedges designated as fair value and, for hedges designated as cash flow, the related unrealized
gains or losses are deferred as a component of other comprehensive (loss) income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Deferred gains and losses are recognized in income in the period in which the underlying anticipated transaction occurs
and impacts earnings.

Principal hedged currencies
include the British Pound (GBP), Canadian Dollar (CAD), Euro (EUR), Japanese Yen (JPY), and Singapore Dollar (SGD). The Company held forward foreign exchange contracts with U.S. equivalent notional amounts totaling $107.3 million at January 2,
2011 and $168.5 million at January 3, 2010, and the approximate fair value of these foreign currency derivative contracts was insignificant. The gains and losses realized on foreign currency derivative contracts are not material. The duration
of these contracts was generally 30 days during fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company entered into forward interest rate contracts in October 2007, with notional
amounts totaling $300.0 million and a weighted average interest rate of 4.25%, that were intended to hedge movements in interest rates prior to the Company’s expected debt issuance. In May 2008, the Company settled forward interest rate
contracts with notional amounts totaling $150.0 million upon the issuance of its 6% senior unsecured notes, and recognized $8.4 million, net of taxes of $5.4 million, of accumulated derivative losses in other comprehensive (loss) income. During
the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008, the Company concluded that the remaining portion of the expected debt issuance, with a notional amount totaling $150.0 million, was no longer probable. As a result of the debt issuance no longer being
probable, the Company discontinued and settled the forward interest rate contracts with notional amounts totaling $150.0 million and recognized a loss of $17.5 million in interest and other (income) expense, net.

As of January 2, 2011, the balance remaining in
accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the effective cash flow hedges was $5.3 million, net of taxes of $3.4 million. The derivative losses are being amortized into interest expense when the hedged exposure affects interest expense.
The Company amortized $2.0 million into interest expense during each of the fiscal years 2010 and 2009, and $1.2 million during fiscal year 2008.

Note 20:

Fair Value Measurements

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash
investments, marketable securities and accounts receivable. The Company believes it had no significant concentrations of credit risk as of January 2, 2011.

The Company uses the market approach technique to value its financial instruments and there were no changes in valuation techniques during
fiscal years 2010 and 2009. The Company’s financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value are primarily comprised of marketable securities, derivative contracts used to hedge the Company’s currency risk, and acquisition related
contingent consideration. The Company has not elected to measure any additional financial instruments or other items at fair value.

Valuation Hierarchy:

The following summarizes the three levels of inputs required by the guidance to
measure fair value. For Level 1 inputs, the Company utilizes quoted market prices as these instruments have active markets. For Level 2 inputs, the Company utilizes quoted market prices in markets that are not active, broker or dealer quotations, or
utilizes alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. For Level 3 inputs, the Company utilizes unobservable inputs based on the best information available, including estimates by management primarily based on information
provided by third-party fund managers, independent brokerage firms and insurance companies. A financial asset’s or liability’s classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the
fair value measurement. In determining fair value, the Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible.

The following tables show the assets and liabilities carried
at fair value measured on a recurring basis at January 2, 2011 and January 3, 2010 classified in one of the three classifications described above:



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Valuation Techniques:

The Company’s Level 1 and Level 2 assets and liabilities are comprised of investments in equity and fixed-income securities as well as
derivative contracts. For financial assets and liabilities that utilize Level 1 and Level 2 inputs, the Company utilizes both direct and indirect observable price quotes, including common stock price quotes, foreign exchange forward prices, and bank
price quotes. Below is a summary of valuation techniques for Level 1 and Level 2 financial assets and liabilities.

Marketable securities

Include equity and fixed-income securities measured at fair value using

the quoted market prices at the reporting date.

Foreign exchange derivative assets

and liabilities

Include foreign exchange derivative contracts that are valued using quoted forward foreign exchange prices at the reporting
date.

The Company has classified
its net liabilities for contingent consideration relating to its acquisitions of Opto Technology Inc., acquired in January 2009, and Sym-Bio within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy because the fair value is determined using significant
unobservable inputs, which included probability weighted cash flows. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending Level 3 net liabilities is as follows:

The carrying amounts of cash and
cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value due to the short-term maturities of these assets and liabilities.

The Company’s amended senior unsecured revolving credit
facility, with a $650.0 million available limit, and the Company’s 6% senior unsecured notes, with a face value of $150.0 million, had outstanding balances as of January 2, 2011 of $274.0 million and $150.0 million, respectively,
and as of January 3, 2010 of $406.0 million and $150.0 million, respectively. The interest rate on the Company’s amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility is reset at least monthly to correspond to variable rates that reflect
currently available terms and conditions for similar debt. The Company had no change in credit standing during fiscal year 2010. Consequently, the carrying value of the current year and prior year credit facilities approximate fair value. The
fair value of the 6% senior unsecured notes is estimated using market quotes from brokers or is based on current



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

rates offered for similar debt. At January 2, 2011, the 6% senior unsecured notes had an aggregate carrying value of $150.0 million and a fair value of $166.8 million. At
January 3, 2010, the 6% senior unsecured notes had an aggregate carrying value of $150.0 million and a fair value of $159.4 million.

As of January 2, 2011, there has not been any significant impact to the fair value of the Company’s derivative liabilities due
to credit risk. Similarly, there has not been any significant adverse impact to the Company’s derivative assets based on the evaluation of its counterparties’ credit risks.

Note 21:

Leases

The Company leases certain property and equipment under operating leases. Rental expense charged to continuing operations for fiscal years
2010, 2009, and 2008 amounted to $46.8 million, $36.2 million, and $36.5 million, respectively. Minimum rental commitments under noncancelable operating leases are as follows: $40.3 million in fiscal year 2011, $29.6 million in fiscal year 2012,
$19.9 million in fiscal year 2013, $15.2 million in fiscal year 2014, $15.0 million in fiscal year 2015 and $58.9 million in fiscal year 2016 and thereafter.

Note 22:

Industry Segment and Geographic Area Information

The Company discloses information about its operating segments based on the way that management organizes the segments within the Company
for making operating decisions and assessing financial performance.

Beginning with fiscal year 2009, the Company realigned its businesses in a manner intended to allow the Company to prioritize its capabilities on two key strategic operating areas—Human Health and
Environmental Health. The Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on sales and operating income. Intersegment sales and transfers are not significant. The Company’s management reviews the results of the Company’s
operations by these two operating segments. The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in Note 1. Financial information in this report relating to fiscal year 2008 has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect
the changes in the Company’s operating segments. The principal products and services of these operating segments are:

•

Human Health

.    Develops diagnostics, tools and applications to help detect diseases earlier and more accurately and to
accelerate the discovery and development of critical new therapies. Within the Human Health segment, the Company serves both the diagnostics and research markets.

•

Environmental Health

.    Provides technologies and applications to facilitate the creation of safer food and consumer
products, more secure surroundings and efficient energy resources. The Environmental Health segment serves the environmental and safety, industrial and laboratory services markets.

The expenses for the Company’s corporate headquarters,
such as legal, tax, audit, human resources, information technology, and other management and compliance costs, have been included as “Corporate” below. The Company has a process to allocate and recharge expenses to the reportable segments
when such costs are administered or paid by the corporate headquarters based on the extent to which the segment benefited from the expenses. These amounts have been calculated in a consistent manner and are included in the Company’s
calculations of segment results to internally plan and assess the performance of each segment for all purposes, including determining the compensation of the business leaders for each of the Company’s operating segments.

Controls and Procedures

Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management, with the participation of our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of January 2, 2011. The term “disclosure controls and procedures” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports that it files
or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation,
controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its
principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only
reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as
of January 2, 2011, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for
establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the
supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the company’s board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and includes those policies and procedures that:

•

Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company;

•

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and

•

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s assets that
could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the
risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 2, 2011. In making this
assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework.



Based on this assessment, our management concluded that, as of January 2, 2011, our
internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria.

Our registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting. This report appears below.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of PerkinElmer, Inc.

Waltham, Massachusetts

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of PerkinElmer, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of
January 2, 2011, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s
principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal
control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any
evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion,
the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 2, 2011, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and
for the year ended January 2, 2011 of the Company and our report dated March 1, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedule.
