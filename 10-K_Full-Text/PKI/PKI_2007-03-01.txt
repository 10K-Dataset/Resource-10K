Recent Developments

As part of our strategy to grow our core businesses, we have taken the following actions in recent years:

Acquisitions:

Agilix Corporation.

In February 2006, we acquired specified assets of Agilix Corporation (“Agilix”)
for approximately $8.7 million in cash plus potential additional contingent consideration, which we expect to be immaterial to us. Assets acquired primarily relate to Agilix’s core technology which centers around labeling technology using
isobaric mass tags that allow for the simultaneous quantification of molecules, such as proteins, from multiple samples.

Spectral Genomics, Inc.

In April 2006, we acquired specified assets and assumed specified liabilities of Spectral Genomics, Inc.
(“Spectral”), a leader in molecular karyotyping technology used to evaluate chromosomal abnormalities. Consideration for the transaction was approximately $12.1 million in cash plus potential additional contingent consideration, which we
expect to be immaterial to us. We will make a $1.9 million payment in the first quarter of 2007, as well as royalty payments based on future sales, to license additional intellectual property rights from a third party.

Clinical & Analytical Service Solutions Ltd.

In June
2006, we acquired the stock of Clinical & Analytical Service Solutions Ltd. (“C&A”), a scientific equipment asset and managed maintenance company serving the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and healthcare markets. Consideration
for the transaction was approximately $12.4 million in cash, net of cash acquired, plus potential additional contingent consideration, which we expect to be immaterial to us.

J.N. Macri Technologies LLC and NTD Laboratories, Inc.

In July 2006, we acquired specified assets and assumed
specified liabilities of J.N. Macri Technologies LLC (“Macri”) and acquired the stock of NTD Laboratories, Inc. (“NTD”). Macri holds and licenses global patents related to free beta Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (“free Beta
hCG”). Free Beta hCG is a peptide hormone produced in the early stage of pregnancy that is widely recognized as an important biomarker for first-trimester prenatal risk assessment. NTD is a laboratory specializing in prenatal risk assessment
and offers laboratory developed and validated testing under the brand name UltraScreen

®

, of which free Beta hCG is an important component. Aggregate consideration for these transactions was $55.2 million in cash, net of cash acquired.

Avalon Instruments Limited

. In September 2006, we acquired the stock of Avalon Instruments Limited
(“Avalon”). The acquisition of Avalon expands and complements our molecular spectroscopy product portfolio by adding a family of innovative bench-top dispersive Raman spectrometers. Raman spectroscopy identifies and characterizes the
composition of both organic and inorganic materials in a wide range of applications. Consideration for this transaction was $5.4 million in cash, net of cash acquired, plus potential additional contingent consideration, which we expect to be
immaterial to us.

Triton Technology Ltd

. In
December 2006, we acquired specified assets of Triton Technology Ltd (“Triton”). We acquired from Triton a line of Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (“DMA”) products. The DMA products offer a thermal analysis tool that is used by
scientists in the polymers, pharmaceuticals and food industries for diverse applications ranging from simple quality control to advanced research. Consideration for this transaction was $2.3 million in cash at the closing, plus additional cash
payments of $1.6 million in 2007.

Evotec Technologies
GmbH

. In January 2007, we acquired the stock of Evotec Technologies GmbH (“Evotec”). The acquisition is intended to allow us to provide our customers in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and academic arenas with Evotec’s high
content screening (“HCS”) instruments and software. These analysis tools determine the composition of cells and cell structure, a critical step in moving potential drug targets quickly through the discovery process. Consideration for this
transaction was approximately $33.0 million in cash, subject to a net working capital adjustment.



Euroscreen Products S.A.

In January 2007, we acquired the stock of Euroscreen Products S.A.
(“Euroscreen”), a developer of the AequoScreen

™

cellular assay platform. The AequoScreen

™

platform from Euroscreen is based on an innovative luminescence technology that generates higher quality data, while reducing the number of false positives in G protein-coupled receptor (“GPCR”) screening
applications. Consideration for this transaction was approximately $18.1 million in cash.

The operations for each of these acquisitions completed in 2006 are reported within the results of our Life and Analytical Sciences segment from the acquisition date. The operations subsequent to the acquisitions,
individually and in the aggregate, did not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Research and Development Expenses:

Research and development expenses were $99.7 million in 2006 and $87.4 million for 2005, an increase of $12.3 million, or 14%. We directed our research
and development efforts during 2006 and 2005 primarily toward genetic screening, biopharmaceutical, and environmental and chemical end markets within our Life and Analytical Sciences segment and medical digital imaging and photonics within our
Optoelectronics segment in order to help accelerate our growth initiatives. We expect our research and development spending to increase on both an absolute and percentage-of-sales basis in 2007 and to continue to emphasize these same markets.

Share Repurchase Program:

During 2006, we repurchased in the open market 8.9 million shares of
our common stock at an aggregate cost of $190.1 million, including commissions. These repurchases were made pursuant to our stock repurchase program announced in November 2005 (the “Program”). The repurchased shares have been reflected as
additional authorized but unissued shares, with the payments reflected in common stock and capital in excess of par value. On November 6, 2006, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to 10.0 million
additional shares of our common stock under a new stock repurchase program (the “New Program”). The New Program will expire on October 25, 2010 unless this authorization is terminated earlier by our Board. The New Program may also be
suspended or discontinued at any time. From January 1, 2007 through February 23, 2007, we repurchased 2.4 million shares of our common stock in the open market under the New Program at an aggregate cost of $57.0 million, including
commissions. We are likely to have adequate financial flexibility to fund additional share repurchases given current cash and debt levels.

We have also taken the following actions in recent years to further focus our core businesses:

Restructuring:

During the second quarter of 2006, our management approved a plan for workforce reductions in two locations in the United
States as we shift resources into product lines that are more consistent with our growth strategy. We refer to this plan as our Q2 2006 Plan. The actions within the Q2 2006 Plan related to workforce reductions resulting from reorganization
activities within the Life and Analytical Sciences segment. We completed notifying affected employees on June 30, 2006. As a result of this plan for workforce reductions, we recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of $0.8 million during the
second quarter of 2006. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2005, we had recognized a $2.2 million restructuring charge in the Life and Analytical Sciences segment and a $6.0 million restructuring charge in the Optoelectronics segment (the
“Q4 2005 Plan”). The principal actions in the Q4 2005 Plan were workforce reductions and the closure of several facilities resulting from reorganization activities to shift resources into geographic regions and product lines that were more
consistent with our growth strategy.



During 2006, we recorded a pre-tax restructuring reversal, net, of $1.2 million relating to our Q4 2005
Plan due to the completion in June 2006 of the sale of a building previously reserved for as part of the Q4 2005 Plan, partially offset by higher than expected severance costs. The amount of the proceeds from the sale of the building in excess of
the current book value of the building was recorded as a pre-tax restructuring reversal within our Optoelectronics segment. During 2006, we also recorded a pre-tax restructuring reversal of $0.6 million relating to our Q2 2005 plan due to lower than
expected employee separation costs associated with both the Life and Analytical Sciences and Optoelectronics segments, and a pre-tax restructuring reversal of $2.7 million relating to the Q4 2002 Plan due to the completion in December 2006 of the
sale of a building previously reserved for in the Q4 2002 Plan. The amount of the proceeds from this sale in excess of the current book value of the property was recorded as a pre-tax restructuring reversal within our Life and Analytical Sciences
segment.

During 2005, we recorded $22.1 million in
restructuring and integration charges. During the second and fourth quarters of 2005, our management approved separate plans to terminate employees in several locations as we shift into geographic regions and product lines that are more consistent
with our growth strategy. As a result of these plans of termination, we incurred pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $9.9 million. Also, as part of our planned effort to consolidate our operations, we closed one of our Optoelectronics
properties. As a result, we recorded an additional pre-tax restructuring charge during fiscal 2005 of approximately $6.1 million which consisted primarily of an impairment charge related to this facility. In addition, due to a soft sublease market,
we increased our reserves for our financial obligations under several leases associated with previous restructurings in 2001 and 2002. As a result, we recorded an additional pre-tax restructuring charge during fiscal 2005 of approximately $6.1
million which is expected to be paid through 2014.

Fluid Sciences
Segment Divestiture:

In September 2005, our Board of
Directors approved a plan to divest our Fluid Sciences segment to increase our strategic focus on higher growth markets within our Life and Analytical Sciences and Optoelectronics segments. The Fluid Sciences segment consisted of three
businesses—Aerospace, Fluid Testing and Semiconductor. We have reflected this segment as a discontinued operation for all periods presented in this annual report on Form 10-K. In November 2005, we sold the Fluid Testing business for
approximately $34.5 million, resulting in a net pre-tax gain of $30.3 million. In December 2005, we sold the Aerospace business for approximately $333.0 million, resulting in a net pre-tax gain of $250.6 million. In February 2006, we sold
substantially all of the assets of our Fluid Sciences Semiconductor business for approximately $26.5 million, subject to a net working capital adjustment, plus potential additional contingent consideration. We recognized a pre-tax gain of $3.8
million, exclusive of additional contingent consideration, in 2006. We recognized these gains during fiscal 2006 and 2005 as gains on the disposition of discontinued operations. We received total cash proceeds for these transactions of approximately
$390.0 million.

Raw Materials and Supplies

Each of our businesses uses a wide variety of raw materials that are generally available from alternate sources of supply and in adequate quantities from
domestic and foreign sources. We generally have two to five year contracts, with no minimum purchase requirements, with certain of our suppliers for these raw materials. For certain critical raw materials, we have qualified only a single source. We
periodically purchase quantities of some of these critical raw materials in excess of current requirements, in anticipation of future manufacturing needs. With sufficient lead times, we believe we would be able to qualify alternative suppliers for
each of these raw materials.

Intellectual Property

We own numerous United States and foreign patents and have patent
applications pending in the United States and abroad. We also license intellectual property rights to and from third parties, some of which bear royalties and are terminable in specified circumstances. In addition to our patent portfolio, we possess
a wide array of unpatented proprietary technology and know-how. We also own numerous United States and foreign trademarks and trade names for a variety of our product names, and have applications for the registration of trademarks and trade names
pending in the United States and abroad. We believe that patents and other proprietary rights are important to the development of both of our reporting segments, but we also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations and
licensing opportunities to develop and



maintain the competitive position of both of our reporting segments. We do not believe that the loss of any one patent or other proprietary right would have
a material adverse effect on our overall business or on any of our reporting segments.

In some cases, we may participate in litigation or other proceedings to defend against or assert claims of infringement, to enforce our patents or our licensors’ patents, to protect our trade secrets, know-how or
other intellectual property rights, or to determine the scope and validity of our or third parties’ intellectual property rights. Litigation of this type could result in substantial cost to us and diversion of our resources. An adverse outcome
in any litigation or proceeding could subject us to significant liabilities or expenses, require us to cease using disputed intellectual property or cease the sale of a product, or require us to license the disputed intellectual property from third
parties. We are currently involved in several lawsuits involving claims of violation of intellectual property rights. See “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” for a discussion of these matters.

Backlog

We believe that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects for any of our business units due to the
short lead time required on a majority of our sales. Therefore, we believe that backlog information is not material to an understanding of our business.

Competition

Because of the wide range of our products and services, we face many different types of competition and competitors. This affects our ability to sell our
products and services and the prices at which these products and services are sold. Our competitors range from large foreign and domestic organizations that produce a comprehensive array of goods and services and that may have greater financial and
other resources, to small firms producing a limited number of goods or services for specialized market segments.

In our Life and Analytical Sciences segment, we compete on the basis of service level, price, technological innovation, product differentiation, product
availability, quality and reliability. Competitors range from multinational organizations with a wide range of products to specialized firms that in some cases have well-established market niches. We expect the proportion of large competitors in
this reporting segment to increase through the continued consolidation of competitors.

We do not believe any single competitor competes directly with our Optoelectronics segment across its full product range. However, we do compete with specialized manufacturing companies in the manufacturing and sale
of specialty flashtubes and ultra specialty lighting sources, photo detectors and photodiodes, and switched power supplies. Competition is based on price, technological innovation, operational efficiency, and product reliability and quality.

We believe we compete effectively in each of the areas in
which our businesses experience competition.

Research and Development

Research and development expenditures were approximately
$99.7 million during fiscal 2006, approximately $87.4 million during fiscal 2005, and approximately $82.4 million during fiscal 2004.

We directed our research and development efforts in 2006, 2005 and 2004 primarily toward drug discovery, genetic screening, and environmental and chemical
analysis tools within our Life and Analytical Sciences segment, and medical digital imaging, xenon flash and Cermax

®

lighting within our Optoelectronics segment.

Environmental Matters

Our operations are subject to various foreign, federal, state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations. These requirements include those
governing emissions and discharges of hazardous substances, the



remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater, the regulation of radioactive materials, and the health and safety of our employees.

We may have liability under the Comprehensive Environmental Response
Compensation and Liability Act, and comparable state statutes that impose liability for investigation and remediation of contamination without regard to fault, in connection with materials that we or our former businesses sent to various third-party
sites. We have incurred, and expect to incur, costs pursuant to these statutes.

We are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at our current and former locations and, along with other companies, have been named a potentially responsible party (“PRP”)
for certain waste disposal sites. We accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period that our responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated. We have accrued $3.5 million as of December 31, 2006,
representing our management’s estimate of the total cost of ultimate disposition of known environmental matters. This amount is not discounted and does not reflect any recovery of any amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements.
These cost estimates are subject to a number of variables, including the stage of the environmental investigations, the magnitude of the possible contamination, the nature of the potential remedies, possible joint and several liability, the time
period over which remediation may occur, and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations. For sites where we have been named a PRP, our management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other
significant named parties to contribute. We expect that the majority of such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to ten years. As assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site, these liabilities are
reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available. There have been no environmental problems to date that have had or are expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or
cash flows. While it is possible that a loss exceeding the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may be incurred, the potential exposure is not expected to be materially different from those amounts recorded.

We may become subject to new or unforeseen environmental costs or
liabilities. Compliance with new or more stringent laws or regulations, stricter interpretations of existing laws, or the discovery of new contamination could cause us to incur additional costs.

Employees

As of December 31, 2006, we employed approximately 8,500 employees. Several of our subsidiaries are parties to
contracts with labor unions and workers’ councils. As of December 31, 2006, we employed an aggregate of approximately 1,600 union and workers’ council employees. We consider our relations with employees to be satisfactory.



Financial Information About Reporting Segments

The table below sets forth sales and operating profit (loss) by reporting segment for the 2006, 2005 and 2004 fiscal years:

Discontinued
operations have not been included in the preceding table.

Additional information relating to our reporting segments for the 2006, 2005 and 2004 fiscal years is as follows:

Financial Information About
Geographic Areas

Each of our reporting segments conducts
business in, and derives substantial revenue from, various countries outside the United States. During fiscal 2006, we had $956.0 million in sales from our international operations, representing approximately 62% of our total sales. During fiscal
2006, we derived approximately 78% of our international sales from our Life and Analytical Sciences segment, and approximately 22% of our international sales from our Optoelectronics segment. We anticipate that sales from international operations
will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total sales in the future.



We are exposed to the risks associated with international operations, including exchange rate
fluctuations, regional and country-specific political and economic conditions, foreign receivables collection concerns, trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements, tax risks, staffing and labor law concerns, intellectual
property protection risks and differing regulatory requirements. Geographic information is discussed in Note 22 to our consolidated financial statements.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors

The following important factors affect our business and operations generally or affect multiple segments of our business and operations:

If we do not introduce new products in a timely manner, we may lose market share and be unable to achieve revenue
growth targets.

We sell many of our products in
industries characterized by rapid technological change, frequent new product and service introductions, and evolving customer needs and industry standards. Many of the businesses competing with us in these industries have significant financial and
other resources to invest in new technologies, substantial intellectual property portfolios, substantial experience in new product development, regulatory expertise, manufacturing capabilities and the distribution channels to deliver products to
customers. Our products could become technologically obsolete over time, or we may invest in technology that does not lead to revenue growth or continue to sell products for which the demand from our customers is declining, in which case we may lose
market share or not achieve our revenue growth targets. The success of our new product offerings will depend upon several factors, including our ability to:

•

accurately anticipate customer needs,

•

innovate and develop new technologies and applications,

•

successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner,

•

price our products competitively and manufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes and on time, and

•

differentiate our offerings from our competitors’ offerings.

Many of our products are used by our customers to develop, test and manufacture their products. We must anticipate industry
trends and consistently develop new products to meet our customers’ expectations. In developing new products, we may be required to make significant investments before we can determine the commercial viability of the new product. If we fail to
accurately foresee our customers’ needs and future activities, we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant sales. We may also suffer a loss in market share and potential sales revenue if we are
unable to commercialize our technology in a timely and efficient manner.

In addition, some of our licensed technology is subject to contractual restrictions, which may limit our ability to develop or commercialize products for some applications. For example, some of our license agreements
are limited to the field of life sciences research, and exclude clinical diagnostics applications.

We may not be able to successfully execute acquisitions or license technologies, integrate acquired businesses or licensed technologies into our
existing businesses, or make acquired businesses or licensed technologies profitable.

We have in the past, and may in the future, supplement our internal growth by acquiring businesses and licensing technologies that complement or augment our existing product lines. However, we may be unable to
identify or complete promising acquisitions or license transactions for many reasons, including:

•

competition among buyers and licensees,



•

the high valuations of businesses and technologies,

•

the need for regulatory and other approval, and

•

our inability to raise capital to fund these acquisitions.

Some of the businesses we may seek to acquire may be unprofitable or marginally profitable. Accordingly, the earnings or
losses of acquired businesses may dilute our earnings. For these acquired businesses to achieve acceptable levels of profitability, we must improve their management, operations, products and market penetration. We may not be successful in this
regard and may encounter other difficulties in integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations, such as incompatible management, information or other systems, or cultural differences.

To finance our acquisitions, we may have to raise additional funds, either
through public or private financings. We may be unable to obtain such funds or may be able to do so only on terms unacceptable to us.

We may not be successful in adequately protecting our intellectual property.

Patent and trade secret protection is important to us because developing new products, processes and technologies gives us a
competitive advantage, although it is time-consuming and expensive. We own many United States and foreign patents and intend to apply for additional patents. Patent applications we file, however, may not result in issued patents or, if they do, the
claims allowed in the patents may be narrower than what is needed to protect fully our products, processes and technologies. Similarly, applications to register our trademarks may not be granted in all countries in which they are filed. For our
intellectual property that is protected by keeping it secret, such as trade secrets and know-how, we may not use adequate measures to protect this intellectual property.

Third parties may also challenge the validity of our issued patents, may circumvent or “design around” our patents
and patent applications, or may claim that our products, processes or technologies infringe their patents. In addition, third parties may assert that our product names infringe their trademarks. We may incur significant expense in legal proceedings
to protect our intellectual property against infringement by third parties or to defend against claims of infringement by third parties. Claims by third parties in pending or future lawsuits could result in awards of substantial damages against us
or court orders that could effectively prevent us from manufacturing, using, importing or selling our products in the United States or other countries.

If we are unable to renew our licenses or otherwise lose our licensed rights, we may have to stop selling products or we may lose competitive
advantage.

We may not be able to renew our existing
licenses, or licenses we may obtain in the future, on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we lose the rights to a patented or other proprietary technology, we may need to stop selling products incorporating that technology and possibly other
products, redesign our products or lose a competitive advantage. Potential competitors could in-license technologies that we fail to license and potentially erode our market share.

Our licenses typically subject us to various economic and commercialization obligations. If we fail to comply with these
obligations we could lose important rights under a license, such as the right to exclusivity in a market. In some cases, we could lose all rights under the license. In addition, rights granted under the license could be lost for reasons out of our
control. For example, the licensor could lose patent protection for a number of reasons, including invalidity of the licensed patent, or a third party could obtain a patent that curtails our freedom to operate under one or more licenses.

If we do not compete effectively, our business will be harmed.

We encounter aggressive competition from numerous
competitors in many areas of our business. We may not be able to compete effectively with all of these competitors. To remain competitive, we must develop new



products and periodically enhance our existing products. We anticipate that we may also have to adjust the prices of many of our products to stay
competitive. In addition, new competitors, technologies or market trends may emerge to threaten or reduce the value of entire product lines.

Our quarterly operating results could be subject to significant fluctuation, and we may not be able to adjust our operations to effectively address
changes we do not anticipate.

Given the nature of the
markets in which we participate, we cannot reliably predict future sales and profitability. Changes in competitive, market and economic conditions may require us to adjust our operations, and we may not be able to make those adjustments or make them
quickly enough to adapt to changing conditions. A high proportion of our costs are fixed, due in part to our research and development and manufacturing costs. Thus, small declines in sales could disproportionately affect our operating results in a
quarter. Factors that may affect our quarterly operating results include:

•

demand for and market acceptance of our products,

•

competitive pressures resulting in lower selling prices,

•

adverse changes in the level of economic activity in regions in which we do business,

•

adverse changes in industries, such as pharmaceutical and biomedical, on which we are particularly dependent,

•

changes in the portions of our sales represented by our various products and customers,

•

delays or problems in the introduction of new products,

•

our competitors’ announcement or introduction of new products, services or technological innovations,

•

increased costs of raw materials or supplies, and

•

changes in the volume or timing of product orders.

If we are unable to produce an adequate quantity of products to meet our customers’ demands, our revenue growth may be adversely affected.

We have an established global manufacturing base with
facilities in multiple locations around the world. Each of these facilities faces risks to its production capacity that may relate to natural disasters, labor relations or regulatory compliance. In addition, in any of these facilities, we may not
manage the manufacturing or production processes at expected levels, we may fail to anticipate or act on the need to increase the production capacity, or we may be unable to quickly resolve technical manufacturing issues that arise from time to
time. Any of these risks could cause our revenue growth to be adversely affected.

If we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with the regulations of the United States Food and Drug Administration and other governmental agencies, we may be forced to recall products and cease their
manufacture and distribution, and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties.

Some of the products produced by our Life and Analytical Sciences segment are subject to regulation by the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and similar international agencies. These
regulations govern a wide variety of product activities, from design and development to labeling, manufacturing, promotion, sales, resales and distribution. If we fail to comply with those regulations or those of similar international agencies, we
may have to recall products, cease their manufacture and distribution, and may be subject to fines or criminal prosecution.

Changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses.

We compete in markets in which we or our customers must comply with federal,
state, local and foreign regulations, such as environmental, health and safety, and food and drug regulations. We develop, configure and



market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations. Any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for our products or
increase our costs of producing these products.

Economic, political and other risks associated with foreign operations could adversely affect our international sales.

Because we sell our products worldwide, our businesses are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. Our sales originating outside
the United States represented the majority of our total sales in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006. We anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total sales. In addition,
many of our manufacturing facilities, employees and suppliers are located outside the United States. Accordingly, our future results of operations could be harmed by a variety of factors, including:

•

changes in foreign currency exchange rates,

•

changes in a country’s or region’s political or economic conditions, particularly in developing or emerging markets,

•

longer payment cycles of foreign customers and difficulty of collecting receivables in foreign jurisdictions,

•

trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements,

•

differing tax laws and changes in those laws, or changes in the countries in which we are subject to tax

•

differing business practices associated with foreign operations,

•

difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations,

•

differing labor laws and changes in those laws,

•

differing protection of intellectual property and changes in that protection, and

•

differing regulatory requirements and changes in those requirements.

If we do not retain our key personnel, our ability to execute our business strategy will be limited.

Our success depends to a significant extent upon the
continued service of our executive officers and key management and technical personnel, particularly our experienced engineers, and on our ability to continue to attract, retain, and motivate qualified personnel. The competition for these employees
is intense. The loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. In addition, there could be a material adverse effect on us should the turnover rates for engineers and other key
personnel increase significantly or if we are unable to continue to attract qualified personnel. We do not maintain any key person life insurance policy on any of our officers or employees.

Restrictions in our senior unsecured credit facility may limit our
activities.

Our senior unsecured revolving credit
facility contains, and future debt instruments to which we may become subject may contain, restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit our company. Our senior unsecured revolving credit facility
includes restrictions on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to:

•

pay dividends on, redeem or repurchase our capital stock,

•

sell assets,

•

incur obligations that restrict their ability to make dividend or other payments to us,

•

guarantee or secure indebtedness,



•

enter into transactions with affiliates, and

•

consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.

We are also required to meet specified financial ratios under the terms of
our senior unsecured revolving credit facility. Our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance, which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors, including factors
that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates, changes in technology and changes in the level of competition.

Our failure to comply with any of these restrictions in our senior unsecured revolving credit facility may result in an event of default under that
facility, which could permit acceleration of the debt under that facility, and require us to prepay that debt before its scheduled due date.

Our results of operations will be adversely affected if we fail to realize the full value of our intangible assets.

As of December 31, 2006, our total assets included $1.5 billion of net
intangible assets. Net intangible assets consist principally of goodwill associated with acquisitions and costs associated with securing patent rights, trademark rights and technology licenses, net of accumulated amortization. We test certain of
these items—specifically all of those that are considered “non-amortizing”—on an annual basis for potential impairment by comparing the carrying value to the fair market value of the reporting unit to which they are assigned. All
of our amortizing intangible assets are evaluated for impairment should discrete events occur that call into question the recoverability of the intangible.

Adverse changes in our business or the failure to grow our Life and Analytical Sciences segment may result in impairment of our intangible assets which
could adversely affect our results of operations.

Properties

As of December 31, 2006, our continuing operations occupied approximately 2,453,000 square feet. We own approximately 717,000 square feet of this space and lease the balance. We conduct our other operations in
manufacturing and assembly plants, research laboratories, administrative offices and other facilities located in 6 states and 35 foreign countries.

Facilities outside of the United States account for approximately 1,325,000 square feet of our owned and leased property, or approximately 54% of our
total occupied space.

Our real property leases are both
short-term and long-term. We believe that our properties are well-maintained and are adequate for our present requirements.

The following table indicates, as of December 31, 2006, the approximate square footage of real property owned and leased attributable to the
continuing operations of each of our reporting segments:



Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

In papers dated October 23, 2002, Enzo Biochem, Inc. and Enzo Life Sciences, Inc. (collectively, “Enzo”) filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York,
Civil Action No. 02-8448, against Amersham plc, Amersham BioSciences, PerkinElmer, Inc., PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Inc., Sigma-Aldrich Corporation, Sigma Chemical Company, Inc., Molecular Probes, Inc., and Orchid BioSciences, Inc. The
complaint alleges that we have breached our distributorship and settlement agreements with Enzo, infringed Enzo’s patents, engaged in unfair competition and fraud, and committed torts against Enzo by, among other things, engaging in commercial
development and exploitation of Enzo’s patented products and technology, separately and together with the other defendants. Enzo seeks injunctive and monetary relief. In 2003, the court severed the lawsuit and ordered Enzo to serve individual
complaints against the five defendants. We subsequently filed an answer and a counterclaim alleging that Enzo’s patents are invalid. In July 2006, the court issued a decision regarding the construction of the claims in Enzo’s patents that
effectively limited the coverage of certain of those claims and, we believe, excludes certain of our products from the coverage of Enzo’s patents. Discovery is ongoing. No trial date has been set, but summary judgment motions were filed by the
defendants in January 2007.

On October 17, 2003, Amersham
Biosciences Corp. filed a complaint, which was subsequently amended, in the United States District Court for New Jersey, Civil Action No. 03-4901, against our subsidiary, alleging that our ViewLux

™

and certain of our Image FlashPlate

™

products infringe three of Amersham’s patents related to high-throughput
screening (the “NJ case”). On August 18, 2004, Amersham plc filed a complaint against two of our United Kingdom-based subsidiaries in the Patent Court of the English High Court of Justice, Case No. 04C02688, alleging that our
same products infringe one corresponding Amersham patent in the United Kingdom, which was granted in August 2004 (the “UK case”). Amersham seeks injunctive and monetary relief in both cases. We filed answers and counterclaims in both
cases. On October 29, 2003, we filed a complaint, which was subsequently amended, against Amersham in the United States District Court for Massachusetts, Civil Action No. 03-12098, alleging that Amersham’s IN Cell Analyzer, and
LEADseeker

™

Multimodality Imaging system and
certain Cyclic AMP and IP3 assays infringe two of our patents related to high-throughput screening (the “MA case”). We seek injunctive and monetary relief. Amersham subsequently filed an answer and counterclaims. After a trial in the UK
case in December 2005, the court ruled in February 2006 that Amersham’s patent in question was invalid in the United Kingdom and awarded costs to us. Amersham initiated an appeal of the ruling in the UK case but withdrew that appeal in January
2007. In May 2006, the court in the NJ case issued a decision regarding the construction of the claims in Amersham’s patents that adopted many of Amersham’s claim construction positions. Our motion asking the court to reconsider that
decision was denied. Discovery has not yet been completed in either the NJ or MA case, nor has a trial date been set in either case. A voluntary mediation occurred in September 2006, but did not result in a resolution of these matters. Fact
discovery, which was stayed pending the mediation, has now resumed. At the suggestion of the court in the NJ case, additional mediation is being scheduled.

We believe we have meritorious defenses to these lawsuits and other proceedings, and we are contesting the actions vigorously in all of the above matters.
We are currently unable, however, to reasonably estimate the amount of loss, if any, that may result from the resolution of these matters or to determine whether resolution of any of these matters will have a material adverse impact on our
consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.

We are also subject to various other claims, legal proceedings and investigations covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities. Each of these matters is subject to
uncertainties, and it is possible that some of these matters may be resolved unfavorably to us. We have established accruals for potential losses that we believe are probable and reasonably estimable. In the opinion of our management, based on its
review of the information available at this time, the total cost of resolving these other contingencies at December 31, 2006 should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on
Form 10-K.

Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

Market Price of Common Stock

Our common stock is listed and traded on the New York Stock Exchange. The following table sets forth the high and low per share sale prices for our common
stock on that exchange for each fiscal quarter in 2006 and 2005.

As of
February 23, 2007, we had approximately 7,676 holders of record of our common stock.

Stock Repurchase Program

On October 21, 2005 our Board of Directors reaffirmed our authority to repurchase up to 10,000,000 shares of our common stock, which we publicly disclosed on November 14, 2005 (the “Program”). During the fourth quarter
of 2005, we repurchased 1,096,000 shares of our common stock in the open market under the Program at an aggregate cost of $24.4 million, including commissions. During the first quarter of 2006, we repurchased 5,000,000 shares of our common stock in
the open market under the Program at an aggregate cost of $116.4 million, including commissions. We did not repurchase any shares of our common stock in the second quarter of 2006. During the third quarter of 2006, we repurchased 3,904,000 shares of
our common stock in the open market under the Program at an aggregate cost of $73.7 million, including commissions, completing the repurchase of 10,000,000 shares in the aggregate, the maximum authorized under the Program. We did not repurchase any
shares of our common stock in the fourth quarter of 2006.

On
November 6, 2006, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to 10,000,000 additional shares of our common stock under a new stock repurchase program (the “New Program”). The New Program will expire on
October 25, 2010 unless this authorization is terminated earlier by our Board. The New Program may also be suspended or discontinued at any time. From January 1, 2007 through February 23, 2007, we repurchased 2,377,900 shares of our
common stock in the open market under the New Program at an aggregate cost of $57.0 million, including commissions.

Dividends

During the 2006 and 2005 fiscal years, we declared regular quarterly cash dividends on our common stock. The table below sets forth the cash dividends per
share that we declared on our common stock during each of those fiscal years, by quarter.

Selected Financial Data

The following table sets forth selected historical financial information as of and for each of the fiscal years in the five-year period ended
December 31, 2006. We derived the selected historical financial information as of and for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2006 from our audited consolidated financial statements which are included
elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. We derived the selected historical financial information as of and for the fiscal years ended December 28, 2003 and December 29, 2002 from our audited consolidated financial statements which
are not included in this annual report on Form 10-K. As with our financial statements for the fiscal years ended January 1, 2006 and January 2, 2005, we adjusted the information in the financial statements for the fiscal years ended
December 28, 2003 and December 29, 2002, where appropriate, to account for our discontinued operations.

Our historical financial information may not be indicative of our results of operations or financial position that you should expect in the future.



You should read the following selected historical financial information together with our
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and our consolidated financial statements, including the related notes, included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.



(1)

We adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 123(R),

“Share-Based Payment

” (“SFAS No. 123(R)”), on
January 2, 2006. The total incremental pre-tax compensation related to stock options was $9.2 million in 2006.

(2)

In 2005, we incurred $54.9 million in fees associated with the extinguishment of our senior subordinated 8


/8% notes due 2013 offset by gains on the sales of investments of $5.8 million.

(3)

We incurred pre-tax restructuring (reversals) charges, net, of ($3.6) million in 2006, $22.1 million in 2005, ($2.8) million in 2003 and $36.6 million in 2002. The 2002 pre-tax
restructuring charge primarily related to the combination of our Life Science and Analytical Instruments businesses into the Life and Analytical Sciences segment.

(4)

The 2005 effective tax rate on continuing operations of 0.19% was largely due to a $27.5 million benefit related to the settlement of federal, state and foreign income tax audits
and an additional accrual of $15.5 million related to the homeland investment provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.

(5)

In 2006, we adopted Statement of SFAS No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements
No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)” (“SFAS No. 158”). The impact of adopting SFAS No. 158 was a reduction to accumulated other comprehensive income of $32.7 million, a reduction to other assets of $26.6 million, an increase to
current liabilities of $7.3 million, an increase to current assets of $0.7 million and a reduction to long-term liabilities of $0.4 million, with no impact to our consolidated statements of operations or statements of cash flows.

(6)

In 2006, we repurchased in the open market 8.9 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $190.1 million, including commissions. The repurchased shares have
been reflected as additional authorized but unissued shares, with the payments reflected in common stock and capital in excess of par value. These repurchases were made pursuant to our stock repurchase program announced in November 2005 (the
“Program”).

(7)

In 2006, we sold substantially all of the assets of our Fluid Sciences Semiconductor business for approximately $26.5 million, subject to a net working capital adjustment, plus
potential additional contingent consideration. We recognized a pre-tax gain of $3.8 million, exclusive of additional contingent consideration.

(8)

In 2005, we sold the Aerospace and Fluid Testing businesses of our Fluid Sciences segment for a net pre-tax gain of $280.9 million. Net pre-tax losses of $8.5 million related to the
sale of the Lithography Business and Fiber Optic Test Equipment Business were partially offset by other pre-tax gains of $1.4 million that related to multiple discontinued operations.

(9)

In 2002, we sold the Security and Detection Systems business for a net pre-tax gain on the sale of $15.0 million. We also approved separate plans to shut down our Telecommunications
Component and sell our Entertainment Lighting businesses with related losses recorded to reduce the assets to the amount estimated to be fair value less cost to sell Entertainment Lighting business of $2.1 million and Telecommunications Component
business of $18.4 million.

(10)

We adopted Statement of SFAS No. 142,

“

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

”

(“SFAS No. 142”) in 2002. We completed our transitional
implementation of the impairment of testing provisions of SFAS No. 142, which resulted in a $117.8 million after-tax charge for goodwill associated with the lighting reporting unit within the Optoelectronics segment.



Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

This annual report on Form 10-K, including the following management’s discussion and analysis, contains
forward-looking information that you should read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements that we have included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. For this purpose, any
statements contained in this report that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. Words such as “believes,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “expects,” “will” and
similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from the plans, intentions or expectations we disclose in the forward-looking statements we make. We have included important factors
above under the heading “Risk Factors” in Item 1A above that we believe could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements we make. We are not obligated to publicly update any forward-looking
statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Overview

We are a leading provider of
scientific instruments, consumables and services to the pharmaceutical, biomedical, academic research, environmental testing and general industrial markets, commonly referred to as the health sciences and photonics markets. We design, manufacture,
market and service products and systems within two businesses, each constituting a separate reporting segment:

•

Life and Analytical Sciences.

We are a leading provider of drug discovery, genetic screening and environmental and chemical analysis tools, including
instruments, reagents, consumables, and services.

•

Optoelectronics.

We provide a broad range of digital imaging, sensor and specialty lighting components used in the biomedical, consumer products and other
specialty end markets.

The health sciences
markets include all of the businesses in our Life and Analytical Sciences segment and the medical imaging business, as well as elements of the medical sensors and lighting businesses in our Optoelectronics segment. The photonics markets include the
remaining businesses in our Optoelectronics segment.

Accounting Period

Our fiscal year ends on the Sunday nearest
December 31. We report fiscal years under a 52/53 week format. Under this method, certain years will contain 53 weeks. The fiscal years ended December 31, 2006 and January 1, 2006 included 52 weeks. The fiscal year ended
January 2, 2005 included 53 weeks.

Consolidated Results of Continuing
Operations

Sales

2006 Compared to 2005.

Sales for 2006 were $1,546.4 million
versus $1,473.8 million during 2005, an increase of $72.6 million, or 5%. Acquisitions increased 2006 sales by $21.6 million over 2005. Changes in foreign exchange rates increased sales by $9.8 million over 2005. The analysis in the remainder of
this paragraph compares segment sales for 2006 as compared to 2005 and includes the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions. The total increase in sales includes a $63.5 million, or 6%, increase in our Life and Analytical
Sciences segment sales, which grew from $1,081.1 million in 2005 to $1,144.6 in 2006 primarily due to increases in sales of service of $31.8 million, instruments of $29.8 and consumables and reagents of $1.9 million. Our Optoelectronics segment
sales grew $9.1 million, or 2%, from $392.7 million in 2005 to $401.8 million in 2006 primarily due to sales of our digital imaging products increasing by $15.1 million, while sales within our sensors and specialty lighting product lines
decreased $6.0 million.



2005 Compared to 2004.

Sales for 2005 were $1,473.8 million, versus $1,429.1 million during
2004, an increase of $44.7 million, or 3%. Acquisitions increased 2005 sales by $12.1 million over 2004, whereas changes in foreign exchange rates had an immaterial impact on sales on a year-over-year basis. Fiscal 2005 had 52 weeks compared to 53
weeks in fiscal 2004. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, an average week’s sales represented $29.4 million. The analysis in the remainder of this paragraph compares significant sales for 2005 as compared to 2004 and includes the effect of
foreign exchange rate fluctuations and the previously mentioned extra week during 2004. The total increase in sales reflects an $18.3 million, or 2%, increase in our Life and Analytical Sciences segment sales, which grew from $1,062.8 million in
2004 to $1,081.1 in 2005. Our Optoelectronics segment sales grew $26.4 million, or 7%, from $366.3 million in 2004 to $392.7 million in 2005.

Cost of Sales

2006 Compared to 2005.

Cost of sales for 2006 was $918.3 million, versus $859.3 million for 2005, an increase of $59.0 million, or 7%. As a
percentage of sales, cost of sales increased to 59.4% in 2006 from 58.3% in 2005, resulting in a decrease in gross margin of 110 basis points to 40.6% in 2006 from 41.7% in 2005. This decrease was primarily attributable to unfavorable product and
geography mix of sales, pricing pressures and inflation, including commodity costs during 2006. Partially offsetting these items were efficiencies gained through increased production volume and successful execution of productivity initiatives.
Amortization of intangible assets was $29.2 million in 2006 as compared to $27.8 million in 2005. With the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), cost of sales for 2006 also included stock option expense of $1.3 million. No stock option expense was
recorded in 2005.

2005 Compared to 2004.

Cost of
sales for 2005 was $859.3 million, versus $846.3 million for 2004, an increase of $13.0 million, or 2%. As a percentage of sales, cost of sales decreased to 58.3% in 2005 from 59.2% in 2004, resulting in an increase in gross margin of 90 basis
points to 41.7% in 2005 from 40.8% in 2004. The increase in gross margin was largely attributable to higher sales volume enabling better leveraging of fixed costs and increased manufacturing productivity, offset by pricing pressures and inflation,
including commodity costs in 2005 and higher contribution of Optoelectronics revenue as a percentage of overall sales. While Optoelectronics does have lower gross margins than Life and Analytical Sciences, it also has lower operating expenses as a
percentage of sales. Amortization of intangible assets was $27.8 million in 2005 as compared to $27.6 million in 2004.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

2006 Compared to 2005.

Selling, general and administrative expenses for 2006 were $376.9 million, versus $365.5 million for 2005, an increase
of $11.4 million, or 3%. As a percentage of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 40 basis points to 24.4% in 2006 from 24.8% in 2005. This decrease was the result of increased fixed cost leverage and cost controls, offset in
part by increased investment in business development activities, stock option expense and an increase in the number of sales employees in emerging markets and higher growth product lines. Amortization of intangible assets was $3.0 million in 2006 as
compared to $0.8 million in 2005. With the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), selling, general and administrative expenses for 2006 also included $7.2 million of stock option expense whereas no stock option expense was recorded in 2005.

2005 Compared to 2004.

Selling, general and administrative
expenses for 2005 were $365.5 million, versus $362.3 million for 2004, an increase of $3.2 million, or 1%. As a percentage of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 60 basis points to 24.8% in 2005 from 25.4% in 2004. The
decrease as a percentage of sales of 60 basis points in 2005 was primarily due to net productivity improvements and cost reductions in both our Life and Analytical Sciences and Optoelectronics segments. Amortization of intangible assets was $0.8
million in 2005.



Research and Development Expenses

2006 Compared to 2005.

Research and development expenses for
2006 were $99.7 million versus $87.4 million in 2005, an increase of $12.3 million, or 14%. As a percentage of sales, research and development expenses increased to 6.4% in 2006 from 5.9% in 2005. Amortization of intangible assets was $1.6 million
in 2006 as compared to $0.1 million in 2005. With the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), research and development expenses for 2006 also included $0.7 million of stock option expense whereas no stock option expense was recorded in 2005. We directed
research and development efforts during 2006 and 2005 primarily toward genetic screening, biopharmaceutical, and environmental and chemical end markets within our Life and Analytical Sciences segment and medical digital imaging within our
Optoelectronics segment in order to help accelerate our growth initiatives. We expect our research and development spending to increase on both an absolute and percentage of sales basis in 2007, and to continue to emphasize these same markets.

2005 Compared to 2004.

Research and development
expenses for 2005 were $87.4 million versus $82.4 million in 2004, an increase of $5.0 million, or 6%. As a percentage of sales, research and development expenses increased to 5.9% in 2005 from 5.8% in 2004. Amortization of intangible assets was
$0.1 million in 2005. We directed research and development efforts during 2005 and 2004 primarily toward drug discovery, genetic screening and environmental and chemical analysis tools within our Life and Analytical Sciences segment, and medical
digital imaging and Cermax

lighting within our
Optoelectronics segment.

Restructuring (Reversals) and
Integration Charges, Net

2006 Compared to
2005.

Restructuring and integration (reversals) and charges, net, for 2006 were ($3.6) million versus $22.1 million for 2005. The following table summarizes our restructuring accrual balances and related activity by restructuring plan
during 2006, 2005 and 2004:

Q2 2006 Plan:

During the second quarter of 2006, we recognized a $0.8 million pre-tax
restructuring charge in the Life and Analytical Sciences segment, which we refer to as the Q2 2006 Plan. The principal actions in the Q2 2006 Plan were workforce reductions resulting from reorganization activities to shift resources into
product lines that were more consistent with our growth strategy.

As part of our Q2 2006 Plan, we reduced headcount by 23. All actions related to the Q2 2006 Plan were completed by the end of the second quarter of 2006, and we anticipate that the remaining payments of $0.1 million will be completed by the
end of the second quarter of 2007.



The following table summarizes the components of the Q2 2006 Plan activity recognized in 2006 by segment:

Q4 2005 Plan:

During the fourth quarter of 2005, we recognized an $8.2 million pre-tax
restructuring charge in both Life and Analytical Sciences and Optoelectronics, which we refer to as the Q4 2005 Plan. The principal actions in the Q4 2005 Plan were workforce reductions resulting from our resource shift toward product lines that are
more consistent with our growth strategy, as well the closure of manufacturing and administrative facilities in order to consolidate certain operations in our North American and European territories.

During 2006, we recorded a pre-tax restructuring reversal, net, of $1.2
million relating to our Q4 2005 Plan due to the completion in June 2006 of the sale of a building previously reserved for in the Q4 2005 Plan, partially offset by higher than expected severance costs. The amount of the proceeds from the sale of the
building in excess of the current book value of the building was recorded as a pre-tax restructuring reversal within our Optoelectronics segment.

As part of the Q4 2005 Plan, we reduced headcount by 44. All actions related to the Q4 2005 Plan have been completed and we anticipate that the remaining
payments of $0.2 million will be completed by the end of 2008.

The following table summarizes the Q4 2005 Plan pre-tax restructuring charges recognized in 2005 by segment:

Q2 2005 Plan:

During the second quarter of 2005, we recognized an $8.2 million pre-tax
restructuring charge in Life and Analytical Sciences and Optoelectronics, which we refer to as the Q2 2005 Plan. The principal actions in the Q2 2005 Plan were workforce reductions resulting from reorganization activities to shift resources into
geographic regions and product lines that were more consistent with our growth strategy. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we recorded a pre-tax restructuring reversal of $0.4 million relating to this plan due to lower than expected employee
separation costs associated with the Life and Analytical Sciences segment.

During 2006, we recorded a pre-tax restructuring reversal of $0.6 million relating to this plan due to lower than expected employee separation costs associated with both the Life and Analytical Sciences and
Optoelectronics segments.

As part of the Q2 2005 Plan, we
reduced headcount by 228. All actions related to the Q2 2005 Plan have been completed and we anticipate that the remaining payments of $0.4 million will be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2008.



The following table summarizes the Q2 2005 pre-tax restructuring charges recognized in 2005 by segment:

2001 to 2003 Restructuring and
Integration Plans:

The principal actions in these
restructuring plans were workforce reductions related to the integration of our Life Sciences and Analytical Instruments businesses in order to reduce costs and achieve operational efficiencies as well as workforce reductions at one of the
Optoelectronics manufacturing facilities to reflect declining demand for several product lines. We have approximately $2.0 million of remaining liabilities associated with 2001 to 2003 restructuring and integration plans, primarily relating to
workforce severance benefits associated with the closure of our European manufacturing facility in the Life and Analytical Sciences segment and remaining lease obligations of closed facilities. The remaining terms of these leases vary in length and
will be paid through 2014.

During 2006, we recorded a pre-tax
restructuring reversal of $2.7 million relating to the Q4 2002 Plan due to the completion in December 2006 of the sale of a building previously reserved for in the Q4 2002 Plan. The amount of the proceeds from this sale in excess of the current book
value of the property was recorded as a pre-tax restructuring reversal within our Life and Analytical Sciences segment.

Impairment of Assets

2006 Compared to 2005.

Impairment of assets was $3.2 million in 2006 and zero in 2005. The 2006 impairment was recorded within the Life and
Analytical Sciences segment, which included a $2.8 million loss related to a manufacturing facility, and a $0.4 million loss on impairment of a license agreement.

Gains (Losses) on Dispositions

2006 Compared to 2005.

Dispositions resulted in a net gain of $1.5 million in 2006 and in 2005. Gain on
dispositions in 2006 included a $0.6 million gain from an insurance reimbursement due to fire damage in a certain manufacturing facility and a $0.9 million gain on disposal of fixed assets. Gain on dispositions in 2005 included a $2.0 million gain
from an insurance reimbursement due to fire damage in certain manufacturing facilities offset by a $0.5 million loss on disposal of fixed assets due to a facility upgrade.

2005 Compared to 2004.

Dispositions resulted in a net gain of $1.5 million in 2005 versus a net loss of $0.4
million in 2004. Loss on dispositions in 2004 included a $0.7 million loss from the sale of a business and was partially offset by a $0.3 million gain from the sale of facilities.



Interest and Other Expense, Net

Interest and other expense, net consisted of the following:

2006 Compared to 2005.

Interest and other (income) expense, net for 2006 was $2.7 million versus $74.3 million for 2005, a decrease of $71.6 million or 96%. The decrease in interest and other (income)
expense, net in 2006 as compared to 2005, was due primarily to the overall reduction in outstanding debt, lower borrowing costs, an increase in outstanding cash balances and extinguishment of debt from 2005. Interest income increased $6.1 million
due to higher cash balances and higher investment rates. In addition, interest expense decreased $18.1 million primarily due to the repurchase of our senior subordinated 8


/8% notes due 2013, which we repurchased through a tender offer in the fourth quarter of 2005, and the repayment of the remainder of our term loan. The
decrease in interest expense resulting from the debt reduction in 2005 was partially offset by $151.5 million in debt outstanding as of December 31, 2006 under our new senior unsecured revolving credit facility, which we also entered into
during the fourth quarter of 2005. We also recognized a net gain on dispositions of investments of $2.3 million associated with the dissolution of certain investments. We incurred a nonrecurring charge of $54.9 million in 2005 to repay our senior
subordinated 8


/


% notes due 2013. Other expenses in 2006 and 2005 consisted primarily of expense related to
foreign currency translation. A more complete discussion of our liquidity is set forth below under the heading, “Liquidity and Capital Resources.”

2005 Compared to 2004.

Interest and other expense, net
for 2005 was $74.3 million versus $38.3 million for 2004, an increase of $36.0 million or 94%. The increase in interest and other expense, net in 2005 as compared to 2004, was due primarily to the fees associated with the extinguishment of
approximately $300 million of our senior subordinated 8


/8% notes due 2013, which included premium fees of
$36.3 million, an $8.9 million accelerated amortization of term loan and senior subordinated 8


/


% notes due
2013 issuance fees, and $8.5 million in charges associated with terminating interest rate swaps. The increase was partially offset by a corresponding decrease in interest expense on our senior subordinated 8


/


% notes due 2013 that were purchased pursuant to our tender offer in the fourth quarter of 2005, as well as a lower
average outstanding term loan balance (which was approximately $120 million). In addition, we recognized a gain on sale of investments of $5.8 million associated with the liquidation of an investment.

Provision/Benefit for Income Taxes

2006 Compared to 2005.

The 2006 provision for income taxes from
continuing operations was $32.4 million, versus a provision of $0.1 million in 2005. The 2006 effective tax rate from continuing operations was 21.5% as compared to the 2005 effective tax rate of 0.2%. The lower effective tax rate in 2005 was
primarily due to (i) a benefit from the settlement of income tax audits for prior years in 2005 offset by the tax cost of the domestic reinvestment plan repatriation calculated in accordance with the homeland investment provisions of the
American Jobs Creation Act of 2004; and (ii) the use in 2005 of federal, state, and foreign tax attributes (current year state and foreign net operating losses, federal current year research and experimental credits, and state current year
income tax credits) enabled by the sale of our Fluid Sciences segment.

Our effective tax rate, excluding one-time discrete items, for 2006 was 23.7% compared to 23.5% for 2005. The slight difference in the rates was due to differences in the geographical distribution of income in 2006 versus 2005.



In December 2006, the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 (the “Tax Act”) was enacted. The
Tax Act retroactively restored the expired research and experimental tax credit provisions of the law from January 1, 2006, and extended the credit through December 31, 2007. As a result of the Tax Act, we recorded a benefit for the
research and experimental tax credit in 2006 in the amount of $1.6 million.

2005 Compared to 2004.

The 2005 provision for income taxes from continuing operations was $0.1 million, versus a provision of $23.5 million in 2004. The 2005 effective tax rate from continuing operations
was 0.2% as compared to the 2004 effective tax rate of 23.6%. The reduction in the effective tax rate between the years was due to (i) an incremental $17.0 million benefit associated with the conclusion of audits with the Internal Revenue
Service and Revenue Canada with respect to the years 1999 through 2002; and (ii) the use in 2005 of federal, state, and foreign tax attributes (current year state and foreign net operating losses, federal current year research and experimental
credits, and state current year income tax credits) enabled by the sale of our Fluid Sciences segment. These benefits were partially offset by an incremental accrual of $6.8 million for the tax cost of the domestic reinvestment plan repatriation
calculated in accordance with the homeland investment provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.

Discontinued Operations

As part of our continued efforts to focus on higher growth opportunities, we have discontinued certain businesses and accounted for them as discontinued operations in accordance with SFAS No. 144, “

Accounting for the Impairment
or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

.” Accordingly, the results of operations and related cash flows have been presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented. The assets and liabilities of these businesses have been presented
separately and are reflected within the assets and liabilities from discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2006 and January 1, 2006. We recorded the following gains and losses, which we
report as the gain (loss) on dispositions of discontinued operations, during the three years ended December 31, 2006:

In September 2005, our
Board of Directors approved a plan to divest our Fluid Sciences segment. The Fluid Sciences segment consisted of three businesses—Aerospace, Fluid Testing and Semiconductor. In November 2005, we sold the Fluid Testing division for approximately
$34.5 million, resulting in a net pre-tax gain of $30.3 million. In December 2005, we sold the Aerospace division for approximately $333.0 million, resulting in a net pre-tax gain of $250.6 million. These gains were recognized during fiscal 2005 as
gains on the dispositions of discontinued operations. We received total cash proceeds in these transactions of approximately $360.0 million. During 2006, we finalized the net working capital adjustments associated with the sales of these businesses,
settled a claim related to an employee benefit program, and ceased future benefit accruals to a postretirement medical plan. In 2006, these actions resulted in the recognition of a gain of $0.5 million and a loss of $0.2 million relative to the
Aerospace business and the Fluid Testing business, respectively. In February 2006, we sold



substantially all of the assets of our Semiconductor business for approximately $26.5 million, subject to a net working capital adjustment, plus potential
additional contingent consideration. We recognized a pre-tax gain of $3.8 million, exclusive of additional contingent consideration in 2006.

In December 2005, our Board of Directors approved a plan to sell our Lithography business. In June 2005, our Board of Directors approved a plan to shut
down our Fiber Optics Test Equipment business. The results of these businesses were previously reported as part of the Optoelectronics segment. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we substantially completed the remediation of an
environmental matter within the Lithography business, resulting in recognition of a pre-tax loss of $1.7 million. The completion of the shutdown of the Fiber Optics Test Equipment business resulted in a pre-tax loss of $5.2 million related to lease
and severance costs and the reduction of fixed assets and inventory to net realizable value. We recognized the net loss during fiscal 2005.

In September 2004, our Board of Directors approved a plan to shut down our Computer-To-Plate business. In June 2004, our Board of Directors approved a
plan to shut down our Electroformed Products business and sell our Ultraviolet Lighting business. The results of these businesses were previously reported as part of the Optoelectronics reporting segment. The abandonment of the Computer-To-Plate
business resulted in a $1.0 million write-down of certain fixed assets and inventory for the year ended January 2, 2005. The net assets of the Electroformed Products business were written off resulting in a $1.6 million pre-tax loss in 2004.
The fixed assets and inventory of the Ultraviolet Lighting business were sold in July 2004 for their approximate book value.

During 2006, 2005 and 2004, we settled various claims under certain long-term contracts and transition services with our Technical Services business,
which we sold in August 1999. The net settlement and the reversal of certain previously established contingencies resulted in pre-tax gains of $1.2 million in 2006, $0.9 million in 2005 and $1.5 million in 2004.

Summary operating results of the discontinued operations for the periods
prior to disposition were as follows:

Acquisitions

Acquisition of Agilix Corporation.

In February 2006, we acquired
specified assets of Agilix Corporation (“Agilix”) for approximately $8.7 million in cash plus potential additional contingent consideration, which we expect to be immaterial to us. Assets acquired primarily relate to Agilix’s
core technology which centers around labeling technology using isobaric mass tags that allow for the simultaneous quantification of molecules, such as proteins, from multiple samples.

Acquisition of Spectral Genomics, Inc.

In April 2006, we acquired specified assets and assumed specified
liabilities of Spectral Genomics, Inc. (“Spectral”), a leader in molecular karyotyping technology used to evaluate chromosomal abnormalities. Consideration for the transaction was approximately $12.1 million in cash plus



potential additional contingent consideration, which we expect to be immaterial to us. We will make a $1.9 million payment in the first quarter of 2007,
as well as royalty payments based on future sales, to license additional intellectual property rights from a third party.

Acquisition of Clinical & Analytical Service Solutions Ltd.

In June 2006, we acquired the stock of Clinical & Analytical
Service Solutions Ltd. (“C&A”), a scientific equipment asset and managed maintenance company serving the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and healthcare markets. Consideration for the transaction was approximately $12.4 million in
cash, net of cash acquired, plus potential additional contingent consideration, which we expect to be immaterial to us.

Acquisition of J.N. Macri Technologies LLC and NTD Laboratories, Inc.

In July 2006, we acquired specified assets and assumed specified
liabilities of J.N. Macri Technologies LLC (“Macri”) and acquired the stock of NTD Laboratories, Inc. (“NTD”). Macri holds and licenses global patents related to free beta Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (“free Beta hCG”).
Free Beta hCG is a peptide hormone produced in the early stage of pregnancy that is widely recognized as an important biomarker for first-trimester prenatal risk assessment. NTD is a laboratory specializing in prenatal risk assessment and offers
laboratory developed and validated testing under the brand name UltraScreen

®

, of which free Beta hCG is an important component. Aggregate consideration for these transactions was $55.2 million in cash, net of cash acquired.

Acquisition of Avalon Instruments Limited.

In September 2006, we acquired the stock of Avalon Instruments
Limited (“Avalon”). The acquisition of Avalon expands and complements our molecular spectroscopy product portfolio by adding a family of innovative bench-top dispersive Raman spectrometers. Raman spectroscopy identifies and characterizes
the composition of both organic and inorganic materials in a wide range of applications. Consideration for this transaction was $5.4 million in cash, net of cash acquired, plus potential additional contingent consideration, which we expect to be
immaterial to us.

Acquisition of Triton Technology
Ltd

. In December 2006, we acquired specified assets of Triton Technology Ltd (“Triton”). We acquired from Triton a line of Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (“DMA”) products. The DMA products offer a thermal analysis tool
that is used by scientists in the polymers, pharmaceuticals and food industries for diverse applications ranging from simple quality control to advanced research. Consideration for this transaction was $2.3 million in cash at the closing, plus
additional cash payments of $1.6 million in 2007.

Acquisition of Evotec Technologies GmbH

. In January 2007, we acquired the stock of Evotec Technologies GmbH (“Evotec”). The acquisition is intended to allow us to provide our customers in the pharmaceutical,
biotechnology and academic arenas with Evotec’s high content screening (“HCS”) instruments and software. These analysis tools determine the composition of cells and cell structure, a critical step in moving potential drug targets
quickly through the discovery process. Consideration for this transaction was approximately $33.0 million in cash, subject to a net working capital adjustment.

Acquisition of Euroscreen Products S.A.

In January 2007, we acquired the stock of Euroscreen Products S.A. (“Euroscreen”), a
developer of the AequoScreen

™

cellular assay
platform. The AequoScreen

™

platform from
Euroscreen is based on an innovative luminescence technology that generates higher quality data, while reducing the number of false positives in G protein-coupled receptor (“GPCR”) screening applications. Consideration for this transaction
was approximately $18.1 million in cash.

The operations for
each of these acquisitions completed in 2006 are reported within the results of our Life and Analytical Sciences segment from the acquisition date. The operations subsequent to the acquisitions, individually and in the aggregate, did not have a
material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

These acquisitions were accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 141, “

Business Combinations

”, and we have accordingly allocated the purchase prices of the acquisitions based upon the
preliminary fair values of the



assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The purchase prices and related allocations have not been finalized and may be revised as a result of adjustments
made to the purchase prices, additional information regarding liabilities assumed, including contingent liabilities, and revisions of preliminary estimates of fair values made at the dates of purchase. In connection with the fair valuing of the
assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we, assisted by valuation consultants, performed assessments of intangible assets using customary valuation procedures and techniques.

Contingencies, Including Tax Matters

We are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at our current and former locations and, along with other companies, have
been named a potentially responsible party (“PRP”) for certain waste disposal sites. We accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period that our responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated. We have
accrued $3.5 million as of December 31, 2006, representing our management’s estimate of the total cost of ultimate disposition of known environmental matters. This amount is not discounted and does not reflect any recovery of any amounts
through insurance or indemnification arrangements. These cost estimates are subject to a number of variables, including the stage of the environmental investigations, the magnitude of the possible contamination, the nature of the potential remedies,
possible joint and several liability, the time period over which remediation may occur, and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations. For sites where we have been named a PRP, our management does not currently anticipate any additional
liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute. We expect that the majority of such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to ten years. As assessment and remediation activities progress at
each individual site, these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available. There have been no environmental problems to date that have had or are expected to have a material adverse effect on our
financial position, results of operations or cash flows. While it is possible that a loss exceeding the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may be incurred, the potential exposure is not expected to be materially different from
those amounts recorded.

In papers dated October 23, 2002,
Enzo Biochem, Inc. and Enzo Life Sciences, Inc. (collectively, “Enzo”) filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Civil Action No. 02-8448, against Amersham plc, Amersham BioSciences,
PerkinElmer, Inc., PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Inc., Sigma-Aldrich Corporation, Sigma Chemical Company, Inc., Molecular Probes, Inc., and Orchid BioSciences, Inc. The complaint alleges that we have breached our distributorship and settlement
agreements with Enzo, infringed Enzo’s patents, engaged in unfair competition and fraud, and committed torts against Enzo by, among other things, engaging in commercial development and exploitation of Enzo’s patented products and
technology, separately and together with the other defendants. Enzo seeks injunctive and monetary relief. In 2003, the court severed the lawsuit and ordered Enzo to serve individual complaints against the five defendants. We subsequently filed an
answer and a counterclaim alleging that Enzo’s patents are invalid. In July 2006, the court issued a decision regarding the construction of the claims in Enzo’s patents that effectively limited the coverage of certain of those claims and,
we believe, excludes certain of our products from the coverage of Enzo’s patents. Discovery is ongoing. No trial date has been set, but summary judgment motions were filed by the defendants in January 2007.

On October 17, 2003, Amersham Biosciences Corp. filed a complaint, which
was subsequently amended, in the United States District Court for New Jersey, Civil Action No. 03-4901, against our subsidiary, alleging that our ViewLux

™

and certain of its Image FlashPlate

™

products infringe three of Amersham’s patents related to high-throughput screening (the “NJ case”). On
August 18, 2004, Amersham plc filed a complaint against two of our United Kingdom-based subsidiaries in the Patent Court of the English High Court of Justice, Case No. 04C02688, alleging that our same products infringe one corresponding
Amersham patent in the United Kingdom, which was granted in August 2004 (the “UK case”). Amersham seeks injunctive and monetary relief in both cases. We filed answers and counterclaims in both cases. On October 29, 2003, we filed a
complaint, which was subsequently amended, against Amersham in the United States District Court for Massachusetts, Civil



Action No. 03-12098, alleging that Amersham’s IN Cell Analyzer, and LEADseeker

™

Multimodality Imaging system and certain Cyclic AMP and IP3 assays infringe two of our
patents related to high-throughput screening (the “MA case”). We seek injunctive and monetary relief. Amersham subsequently filed an answer and counterclaims. After a trial in the UK case in December 2005, the court ruled in February 2006
that Amersham’s patent in question was invalid in the United Kingdom and awarded costs to us. Amersham initiated an appeal of the ruling in the UK case but withdrew that appeal in January 2007. In May 2006, the court in the NJ case issued a
decision regarding the construction of the claims in Amersham’s patents that adopted many of Amersham’s claim construction positions. Our motion asking the court to reconsider that decision was denied. Discovery has not yet been completed
in either the NJ or MA case, nor has a trial date been set in either case. A voluntary mediation occurred in September 2006, but did not result in a resolution of these matters. Fact discovery, which was stayed pending the mediation, has now
resumed. At the suggestion of the court in the NJ case, additional mediation is being scheduled.

We believe we have meritorious defenses to these lawsuits and other proceedings, and we are contesting the actions vigorously in all of the above matters.
We are currently unable, however, to reasonably estimate the amount of loss, if any, that may result from the resolution of these matters or to determine whether resolution of any of these matters will have a material adverse impact on our
consolidated financial statements.

During 2005, the Internal
Revenue Service concluded its audit of federal income taxes for the years 1999 through 2002. We have agreed to the conclusions of the Internal Revenue Service in all matters with the exception of one, and have filed a single issue protest with the
Appeals Division of the Internal Revenue Service. We expect to resolve the matter in the first half of 2007. Regardless of the outcome of the protest, we do not expect the final resolution to significantly impact our financial position, results of
operations or cash flows.

We are under regular examination by
tax authorities in the United States and other countries (such as Germany and the United Kingdom) in which we have significant business operations. The tax years under examination vary by jurisdiction. We regularly assess the likelihood of
additional assessments in each of the taxing jurisdictions resulting from these and subsequent years’ examinations. We have established income tax reserves which we believe to be adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments.
Once established, reserves are adjusted as additional information becomes available and when an event occurs requiring a change to the reserves. The resolution of tax matters is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial
condition.

We are also subject to various other claims, legal
proceedings and investigations covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities. Each of these matters is subject to uncertainties, and it is possible that some of these matters may be resolved
unfavorably to us. We have established accruals for potential losses that we believe are probable and reasonably estimable. In the opinion of our management, based on our review of the information available at this time, the total cost of resolving
these other contingencies at December 31, 2006, should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.

Reporting Segment Results of Continuing Operations

Life and Analytical Sciences

2006 Compared to 2005.

Sales for 2006 were $1,144.6 million, versus $1,081.1 million in 2005, an increase of $63.5 million, or 6%. The effect
of acquisitions increased our sales for 2006 by $21.6 million, as compared to 2005. Changes in foreign exchange rates increased sales by approximately $8.3 million in 2006, as compared to 2005. The following analysis in the remainder of this
paragraph compares selected sales by market and product type for 2006, as compared to 2005, and includes the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions. Our OneSource

™

laboratory service sales increased by $31.8 million, sales to genetic screening
customers increased by $24.8 million, and sales to environmental and chemical analysis customers increased by



$16.7 million, while sales to biopharmaceutical customers decreased by $9.9 million. Sales by type of product included increases in sales of service of $31.8
million, instruments of $29.8, and consumables and reagents of $1.9 million.

Operating profit for 2006 was $115.4 million, versus $110.2 million for 2005, an increase of $5.2 million, or 5%. The increase in operating profit in 2006 as compared to 2005 was primarily the result of increased
sales volume and a decrease in pre-tax restructuring charges in 2005 partially offset by a decrease in gross margin and an increase in stock option, amortization, selling, general and administrative, and research and development expenses. Pre-tax
restructuring charges decreased from a $12.9 million in 2005 to a reversal of $1.7 million in 2006. The decrease in gross margin is due to unfavorable product and geography mix of sales, pricing pressures and inflation, including commodity costs
during 2006, partially offset by efficiencies gained through increased production volume and successful execution of productivity initiatives. Fiscal 2006 includes stock option expense of $3.2 million. Amortization of intangible assets was $31.3
million for 2006 and $26.2 million for 2005.

2005 Compared
to 2004.

Sales for 2005 were $1,081.1 million, versus $1,062.8 million in 2004, an increase of $18.3 million, or 2%. Changes in foreign exchange rates had an immaterial impact on sales and operating profit. Fiscal 2005 had 52 weeks compared
to 53 weeks in fiscal 2004. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, an average week’s sales represented $22.3 million. The following analysis compares significant sales by market and product type for 2005, as compared to 2004, and includes the
effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations and the previously mentioned extra week during 2004. Sales to genetic screening customers increased $17.1 million, OneSource

™

service sales increased by $15.1 million, sales to environmental and chemical analysis customers increased $5.5
million, and sales to biopharmaceutical customers decreased $19.4 million. Sales by type of product included increases in sales of instruments of $9.0 million, service of $15.1 million, offset by decreases in reagent consumables of $5.8 million.

Operating profit for 2005 was $110.2 million, versus $103.6
million in 2004, an increase of $6.6 million or 6%. Increases in operating profit resulting from increased sales volume and productivity initiatives were offset by a pre-tax restructuring charge of $12.9 million and a $1.7 million increase in
research and development spending. Amortization of intangibles was $26.2 million for the year ended January 1, 2006, versus $26.4 million for the year ended January 2, 2005.

Optoelectronics

2006 Compared to 2005.

Sales for 2006 were $401.8 million, versus $392.7 million for 2005, an increase of $9.1 million, or 2%. Changes in
foreign exchange rates increased sales by approximately $1.5 million in 2006, as compared to sales in 2005. The analysis in the remainder of this paragraph compares selected sales by product type for 2006, as compared to 2005, and includes the
effect of foreign exchange fluctuations and acquisitions. Sales of our digital imaging products increased by $15.1 million while sales within our sensors and specialty lighting product lines decreased $6.1 million due to a decrease in Cermax

®

video and specific military platforms.

Operating profit for 2006 was $70.0 million, versus $58.4 million for 2005,
an increase of $11.6 million, or 20%. The increase in operating profit in 2006, as compared to 2005, was primarily the result of a $1.9 million pre-tax restructuring reversal in 2006 as compared to the $9.2 million pre-tax restructuring charge in
2005, offset by a decrease in gross margin. The decrease in gross margin is due to an unfavorable product mix and pricing pressures, inflation, including commodity costs during 2006, and capacity issues within the amorphous silicon business, offset
by successful execution of productivity initiatives. Fiscal 2006 includes stock option expense of $1.6 million. Amortization of intangible assets was $2.5 million for 2006 and $2.6 million for 2005. Fiscal 2005 also included a $0.2 million
charge for in-process research and development related to the acquisition of the capital stock of Elcos AG, or Elcos, a leading European designer and manufacturer of custom light emitting diode, or LED, solutions for biomedical and industrial
applications.



2005 Compared to 2004.

Sales for 2005 were $392.7 million, versus $366.3 million for 2004, an
increase of $26.4 million, or 7%. Acquisitions increased 2005 sales by $12.1 million over 2004 sales. Changes in foreign exchange rates had an immaterial impact on sales and operating profit. Fiscal 2005 had 52 weeks compared to 53 weeks in fiscal
2004. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, an average week’s sales represented $7.1 million. The following analysis of significant sales by product line for 2005, as compared to 2004, includes the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates
and the previously mentioned extra week during 2004. Sales of specialty lighting products increased by $10.2 million, sales of digital imaging products increased by $9.4 million due to increased sales of diagnostic and radiotherapy digital x-ray
products, and sales of sensors increased $6.8 million.

Operating profit for 2005 was $58.4 million, versus $59.1 million for 2004, a decrease of $0.7 million, or 1%. The decrease in operating profit was primarily the result of increases in operating profit from increased sales volume, net
productivity improvements and cost reduction actions, which were more than offset by pricing reductions and a $9.2 million pre-tax restructuring charge. Amortization of intangible assets increased to $2.6 million in 2005 from $1.2 million in 2004
due to the acquisition of Elcos in the beginning of 2005.

Liquidity and
Capital Resources

We require cash to pay our operating
expenses, make capital expenditures, service our debt and other long-term liabilities and pay dividends on our common stock. Our principal sources of funds are from our operations and the capital markets, particularly the debt markets. In the near
term, we anticipate that our operations will generate sufficient cash to fund our operating expenses, capital expenditures, interest payments on our debt and dividends on our common stock. In the long-term, we expect to use internally generated
funds and external sources to satisfy our debt and other long-term liabilities.

Principal factors that could affect the availability of our internally generated funds include:

•

deterioration of sales due to weakness in markets in which we sell our products and services, and

•

changes in our working capital requirements.

Principal factors that could affect our ability to obtain cash from external sources include:

•

financial covenants contained in the financial instruments controlling our borrowings that limit our total borrowing capacity,

•

increases in interest rates applicable to our outstanding variable rate debt,

•

a ratings downgrade that would limit our ability to borrow under our accounts receivable facility and our overall access to the corporate debt market,

•

volatility in the markets for corporate debt,

•

a decrease in the market price for our common stock, and

•

volatility in the public equity markets.

Cash Flows

Fiscal Year 2006

Operating Activities.

Net cash generated by continuing operations operating activities was $127.0 million in 2006, compared to net cash generated
by continuing operations operating activities of $192.9 million in 2005. Principal contributors to the generation of cash from operating activities during 2006 were net income from continuing operations of $118.3 million and depreciation and
amortization of $69.2 million. These amounts were offset in part by taxes paid on divestitures of $60.3 million and a net increase in working capital of $9.4 million. Contributing to the net increase in working capital in 2006, excluding the effect
of foreign exchange rate



fluctuations, was an increase in inventory of $11.1 million and a decrease in accounts payable of $1.7 million, offset in part by a decrease in accounts
receivable of $3.3 million. Strong performance in accounts receivable collections in the Life and Analytical Sciences segment was partially offset by increased accounts payable disbursements in both the Life and Analytical Sciences and
Optoelectronics segments. The increase in inventory is primarily the result of expanding the amount of inventory held at service locations within the Life and Analytical Sciences segment. There was no incremental use of our accounts receivable
securitization facility during 2006, which totaled $45.0 million at both December 31, 2006 and January 1, 2006. Changes in accrued expenses, other assets and liabilities and other items totaled $9.2 million during 2006, and primarily
relates to timing of payments for tax, restructuring and salary and benefits. Also included in the $9.2 million above are the net gain from dispositions of property, plant and equipment of $1.5 million and the net gain from settlement of investments
of $2.3 million.

Investing Activities.

Net cash used in
continuing operations investing activities was $140.0 million in 2006, compared to $333.3 million of cash provided by continuing operations investing activities in 2005. Included in 2006 was $25.0 million of net proceeds received from the sale of
our Semiconductor business unit and $6.6 million of net proceeds from the sale of investments. This was offset by approximately $129.0 million of net cash used for acquisitions. In addition, we incurred $12.1 million of business development
transaction costs, earn-out payments and other costs in connection with these and previous transactions. Capital expenditures in 2006 were $44.5 million, mainly in the areas of tooling and other capital equipment purchases, in addition to facility
improvements. These cash outflows were partially offset by $5.3 million from the advance and settlement of an insurance claim, $4.9 million received from the sale of property, plant and equipment, and $3.8 million from the settlement of life
insurance policies.

Financing Activities.

Net cash used
in continuing operations financing activities was $313.5 million in 2006, compared to $217.6 million in 2005, an increase of $95.9 million, or 44%. In 2006, we repurchased in the open market 8.9 million shares of our common stock at a total
cost of $190.1 million, including commissions. Debt reductions during 2006 totaled $110.7 million, compared to reductions in 2005 of $374.7 million. These uses of cash were offset by proceeds from common stock option exercises of $21.5 million
and the related tax benefit of $2.2 million. In addition, we paid $35.5 million in dividends during 2006.

Fiscal Year 2005

Operating Activities.

Net cash generated by continuing operations operating activities was $192.9 million in 2005. Contributing to the
generation of cash from operating activities during 2005 were depreciation and amortization of $67.0 million, net income from continuing operations of $66.5 million, amortization of deferred debt issuance costs, accretion of discounts and
extinguishment of debt of $57.4 million, , non-cash restructuring expense of $22.1 million, a decrease in working capital accounts of $12.5 million and stock-based compensation of $9.8 million, offset by $27.8 million from the resolution of prior
year tax contingencies and $14.6 million from accrued expenses and other. Contributing to the decrease in working capital accounts in 2005, excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations, was an increase in accounts payable of $23.2
million, offset by increases in accounts receivable of $10.4 million and inventory of $0.3 million. There was no incremental use of our accounts receivable securitization facility during 2005. The outstanding amount under this facility totaled $45.0
million at both January 1, 2006 and January 2, 2005.

Investing Activities.

Investing activities related to continuing operations contributed $333.3 million in 2005. In 2005, we received $366.6 million from the disposition of businesses, primarily comprising Fluid Sciences proceeds
of $359.1 million. We also received $9.4 million from dispositions of property, plant and equipment and $2.9 million from the advance and settlement of an insurance claim. In 2005, we also made capital expenditures of $28.0 million, mainly for
tooling and productivity improvements and for system and facility costs. In addition, we used $17.6 million for acquisitions and investments, primarily for our acquisition of Elcos for $13.2 million and the settlement of earnouts for $1.8 million.



Financing Activities.

In 2005, we used $217.6 million of net cash in continuing operations
financing activities. Debt reductions during 2005 totaled $374.7 million, primarily comprising $300.0 million used to repay our senior subordinated debt, and $70.0 million to repay our term loan. In addition, we paid $36.3 million of premium related
to the prepayment of our senior subordinated debt and $8.5 million to settle interest rate swaps on this debt. We also paid $36.3 million in dividends and $24.4 million to purchase our common stock pursuant to a stock repurchase program we
implemented in 2005. We borrowed $244.3 million related to the repatriation of funds under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 and received $19.4 million from the exercise of employee stock options.

Current Borrowing Arrangements

Senior Unsecured Credit Facility.

On October 31, 2005, we
entered into a $350.0 million five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility. Letters of credit in the aggregate amount of approximately $15.0 million, originally issued under our previous credit agreement, are treated as issued under this
agreement. We use the senior unsecured revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes which may include working capital, refinancing existing indebtedness, capital expenditures, share repurchases, acquisitions and strategic alliances. The
interest rates under the senior unsecured revolving credit facility are based on the Eurocurrency rate at the time of borrowing plus a margin or the base rate from time to time. The base rate is the higher of (1) the corporate base rate
announced from time to time by Bank of America, N.A. and (2) the Federal Funds rate plus 50 basis points. We may allocate all or a portion of our indebtedness under the senior unsecured revolving credit facility to interest based upon the
Eurocurrency rate plus a margin or the base rate. The Eurocurrency margin as of December 31, 2006 was 60 basis points; the weighted average Eurocurrency rate was 3.62%. There were approximately $151.5 million of borrowings under the facility as
of December 31, 2006 with interest based on the above described Eurocurrency rate. At year end, the borrowings were undertaken by certain foreign subsidiaries of ours and the funds were borrowed in the subsidiaries’ functional currencies
of Euro (EUR), Canadian Dollars (CAD) and Japanese Yen (JPY). The effective rates of the borrowings as of December 31, 2006 were as follows: EUR: 4.27%; CAD: 4.88% and JPY: 1.09%.

Our senior unsecured revolving credit facility contains covenants that require us to maintain specific financial ratios,
including:

•

A minimum interest coverage ratio, and

•

A maximum total leverage ratio.

At all times during 2006, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants.

Senior Subordinated Notes.

In December 2002 we issued
ten-year senior subordinated notes at a rate of 8


/


% with a face value of $300.0 million (the “Senior
Subordinated Notes”). In the fourth quarter of 2005, we commenced and substantially completed a tender offer and consent solicitation for any and all of the Senior Subordinated Notes. We repurchased all but $25 thousand of these notes as of
November 23, 2005. In connection with the tender offer, we solicited consents to amend the indenture under which the Senior Subordinated Notes were issued and removed most of the restrictive covenants from the indenture.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Receivables Securitization Facility.

During 2001, we established a
wholly owned consolidated subsidiary to maintain a receivables purchase agreement with a third party financial institution. Under this arrangement, we sold, on a revolving basis, certain of our accounts receivable balances to the consolidated
subsidiary which simultaneously sold an undivided percentage ownership interest in designated pools of receivables to a third party financial institution. As collections reduce the balance of sold accounts receivable, new receivables are sold. Our
consolidated subsidiary retains the risk of credit loss on the receivables. Accordingly, the full amount



of the allowance for doubtful accounts has been provided for on our balance sheet. The amount of receivables sold and outstanding with the third party
financial institution may not exceed $65.0 million. Under the terms of this arrangement, our consolidated subsidiary retains collection and administrative responsibilities for the balances. The amount of receivables sold to the consolidated
subsidiary was $67.8 million as of December 31, 2006 and $91.0 million as of January 1, 2006. At each of December 31, 2006 and January 1, 2006, an undivided interest of $45.0 million in the receivables had been sold to the third
party financial institution under this arrangement. The remaining interest in receivables of $22.8 million and $46.0 million that were sold to and held by the consolidated subsidiary were included in accounts receivable in the consolidated financial
statements at December 31, 2006 and January 1, 2006, respectively.

The agreement requires the third party financial institution to be paid interest during the period from the date the receivable is sold to its maturity date. At December 31, 2006, the effective interest rate was
LIBOR plus approximately 50 basis points. The servicing fees received constitute adequate compensation for services performed. No servicing asset or liability is therefore recorded. The agreement also includes conditions that require us to maintain
a senior unsecured credit rating of BB or above, as defined by Standard & Poor’s Rating Services, and Ba2 or above, as defined by Moody’s Investors Service. At December 31, 2006, we had a senior unsecured credit rating of
BBB- with a stable outlook from Standard & Poor’s Rating Services, and of Baa3 with a stable outlook from Moody’s Investors Service. In January 2007, our consolidated subsidiary entered into an agreement to extend the term of the
accounts receivable securitization facility to January 25, 2008.

Dividends

Our Board of Directors declared
regular quarterly cash dividends of seven cents per share in each quarter of 2006 and 2005, resulting in an annual dividend rate of 28 cents per share.

Contractual Obligations

The following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2006:

Because the credit
facility borrowings carry variable interest rates, the above table does not contemplate interest obligations.

Capital Expenditures

During 2007, we expect to make capital expenditures of approximately $40.0 million to $45.0 million primarily to introduce new products, to improve our operating processes, to shift the production capacity to lower cost locations, to
increase capacity in the amorphous silicon business and to develop information technology. We expect to use our available cash and internally generated funds to fund these expenditures.



Other Potential Liquidity Considerations

During 2006, we repurchased in the open market 8.9 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $190.1
million, including commissions. These repurchases were made pursuant to our stock repurchase program announced in November 2005 (the “Program”). The repurchased shares have been reflected as additional authorized but unissued shares, with
the payments reflected in common stock and capital in excess of par value. On November 6, 2006, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to 10.0 million additional shares of our common stock under a new stock
repurchase program (the “New Program”). The New Program will expire on October 25, 2010 unless this authorization is terminated earlier by our Board. The New Program may also be suspended or discontinued at any time. From
January 1, 2007 through February 23, 2007, we repurchased 2.4 million shares of our common stock in the open market under the New Program at an aggregate cost of $57.0 million, including commissions. Any repurchased shares will be
available for use in connection with corporate programs. If we continue to repurchase shares, the repurchase program will be funded using our existing financial resources, including cash and cash equivalents and our existing senior unsecured
revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2006, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $191.1 million.

During 2005 and 2006, we have received advance payments toward business interruption and building damage from an insurance claim for a chemical fire that
occurred within our Life and Analytical Sciences facility in Boston, Massachusetts in early 2005. The incident occurred during non-business hours and no employee casualties or injuries were reported. We expect that we will reach final settlement
with the insurer in 2007 and believe we have sufficient insurance so that any gain or loss incurred by us in connection with this fire and environmental clean-up should not have a material effect on our results of operations.

Effects of Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncement

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R), which requires
compensation costs related to stock-based transactions, including employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on fair value. SFAS No. 123(R) revises SFAS No. 123, as amended,

“Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation”

(“SFAS No. 123”), and supersedes Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 25,

“Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

.” We adopted SFAS No. 123(R) on
January 2, 2006, and prior to adoption we applied the intrinsic value based method prescribed in APB Opinion No. 25, as permitted by SFAS No. 123, in accounting for employee stock-based compensation. We generally did not recognize
compensation expense in connection with the grant of stock options because the options granted had an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant.

In transitioning from APB Opinion No. 25 to SFAS No. 123(R), we
have applied the modified prospective method. Accordingly, periods prior to adoption have not been restated and are not directly comparable to periods after adoption. Under the modified prospective method, compensation cost recognized in periods
after adoption includes (i) compensation cost for all stock-based payments granted prior to, but not yet vested as of January 2, 2006, based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS
No. 123, less estimated forfeitures, and (ii) compensation cost for all stock-based payments granted subsequent to January 1, 2006, based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS
No. 123(R), less estimated forfeitures.

The total pre-tax
stock-based compensation expense for the cost of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance units was $17.5 million in 2006. The total income tax benefit recognized in the consolidated statements of operations for
stock-based compensation was $6.1 million in 2006, respectively. At December 31, 2006, total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense, expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.6 fiscal years, amounted to $10.6 million.
Total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense will be adjusted for future changes in estimated forfeitures, if any.



Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), we presented all excess tax benefits related to stock
compensation as cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. SFAS No. 123(R) requires the cash flows resulting from these tax benefits to be classified as cash flows from financing activities. In 2006, the
tax benefit from the exercise of stock options was $2.2 million, which was classified as cash flows from financing activities, as compared to $5.3 million in 2005, which was classified as cash flows from operating activities.

Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), unearned compensation was
recorded in a contra-equity account and established at the date restricted stock was granted, representing the amount of unrecognized restricted stock expense that would be reduced as expense is recognized. Under the provisions of SFAS
No. 123(R), the recognition of unearned compensation at the date restricted stock is granted is no longer required. Therefore, in the first quarter of 2006, the $6.4 million of unrecognized restricted stock that had been recorded in
“Unearned compensation” in the consolidated balance sheet as of January 1, 2006 was reclassified to “Capital in excess of par value.”

In September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108,

“Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when
Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements”

(“SAB 108”). SAB 108 provides guidance on how prior year misstatements should be taken into consideration when quantifying misstatements in current year
financial statements for purposes of determining whether the current year’s financial statements are materially misstated. We were required to adopt SAB 108 in 2006. The adoption of SAB 108 did not have a material impact on our
consolidated financial statements.

In September 2006, the FASB
issued SFAS No. 158 which requires companies to recognize a net liability or asset and an offsetting adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income to report the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit
plans. Additionally, SFAS No. 158 requires companies to measure plan assets and obligations at their year-end balance sheet date. SFAS No. 158 requires prospective application and was effective for us as of the end of fiscal year
2006.

The impact of adopting SFAS No. 158 was a reduction
to accumulated other comprehensive income of $32.7 million, a reduction to other assets of $26.6 million, an increase to current liabilities of $7.3 million, an increase to current assets of $0.7 million and a reduction to long-term liabilities of
$0.4 million, with no impact to our consolidated statements of operations or statements of cash flows. There was also no impact from the adoption of SFAS No. 158 on our compliance with the financial covenants contained in our loan agreement,
described in more detail in Note 16 of our consolidated financial statements.

Effects of Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation (“FIN”) No. 48,

“Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes”

(“FIN No. 48”). FIN No. 48 was issued to clarify the accounting for
uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements by prescribing a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax
return in accordance with SFAS No. 109,

“Accounting for Income Taxes.”

The new interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. We are required to adopt FIN No. 48 in the first quarter
of fiscal year 2007. We are currently evaluating the requirements of FIN No. 48 and have not yet determined the impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,

“Fair Value Measurements”

(“SFAS
No. 157”). SFAS No. 157 clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the
information used to develop those assumptions. Under the standard, fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy. We will be required to adopt SFAS No. 157 in the first quarter of fiscal year
2008. We are currently evaluating the requirements of SFAS No. 157 and have not yet determined the impact, if any, of its adoption on our consolidated financial statements.



In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,

“The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets
and Financial Liabilities”

(“SFAS No. 159”). SFAS No. 159 provides entities with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value, with the objective to reduce both the complexity in accounting
for financial instruments and the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently. We will be required to adopt SFAS No. 159 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008. We are currently evaluating the
requirements of SFAS No. 159 and have not yet determined the impact, if any, of its adoption on our consolidated financial statements.

Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
sales and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to bad debts, inventories, intangible assets, income taxes, restructuring, pensions and other
postretirement benefits, contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments
about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more
significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements.

Revenue recognition.

We record product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price to the buyer
is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. For products that include installation, if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element, we recognize product revenue upon delivery, and we delay
recognition of installation revenue until the installation is complete. For sales that include customer-specified acceptance criteria, we recognize revenue only after the acceptance criteria have been met. We defer revenue from services and
recognize it over the contractual period or as we render services and the customer accepts them. When arrangements include multiple elements, we use objective evidence of fair value to allocate revenue to the elements and recognize revenue when the
criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element, all in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 00-21, “

Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables”

. Because the majority of our sales relate to
specific manufactured products or units rather than long-term customized projects, we generally do not experience significant changes in original estimates. Further, we have not experienced any significant refunds or promotional allowances that
require significant estimation.

Warranty Costs

. We
provide for estimated warranty costs for products at the time of their sale. Warranty liabilities are based on estimated future repair costs using historical labor and material incurred in the warranty period.

Allowances for doubtful accounts.

We maintain allowances for
doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. We generally compute our allowance for doubtful accounts by (1) applying specific percentage reserves on accounts that are past due
and deemed uncollectible; and (2) specifically reserving for customers known to be in financial difficulty. Therefore, if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate beyond our estimates, we may have to increase our allowance
for doubtful accounts. This would reduce our earnings.

Inventory valuation.

We initially value inventory at actual cost to purchase and/or manufacture. We periodically review these values to ascertain that market value of the inventory continues to exceed its recorded cost.
Generally, reductions in value of inventory below cost are caused by our maintenance of stocks of products in excess of demand or technological obsolescence of the inventory. We regularly review inventory quantities on



hand and, when necessary, record provisions for excess and obsolete inventory based on either our estimated forecast of product demand and production
requirements or historical trailing usage of the product. If our sales do not materialize as planned or at historic levels, we may have to increase our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory. This would reduce our earnings. If actual market
conditions are more favorable than anticipated, inventory previously written down may be sold, resulting in lower costs of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period.

Business Combinations.

The allocation of purchase price for
business combinations requires estimates and judgment as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets in determining the estimated fair value for purchase
price allocation purposes. In connection with the fair valuing of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we are assisted by valuation consultants, and assessments of intangible assets using customary valuation procedures and techniques are
performed. If the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these estimates, the amounts recorded in the financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill or require acceleration of
the amortization expense of finite-lived intangible assets.

Value of long-lived assets, including intangibles.

We carry a variety of long-lived assets on our balance sheet including property and equipment, investments, identifiable intangible assets, and goodwill. We periodically review
the carrying value of all of these assets based, in part, upon current estimated market values and our projections of anticipated future cash flows. We undertake this review (1) on an annual basis for assets such as goodwill and non-amortizing
intangible assets and (2) on a periodic basis for other long-lived assets when facts and circumstances suggest that cash flows emanating from those assets may be diminished. Any impairment charge that we record reduces our earnings. We
completed the annual impairment tests of goodwill for 2006 and 2005 and concluded that there were no impairments. While we believe that our estimates of current value are reasonable, different assumptions regarding items such as future cash flows
and the volatility inherent in markets which we serve could affect our evaluations and result in impairment charges against the carrying value of those assets. In addition, we currently evaluate the remaining useful life of our non-amortizing
intangible assets at least annually to determine whether events or circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life. If events or circumstances indicate that the useful lives of non-amortizing intangible assets are no longer indefinite,
the assets will be tested for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 142. These intangible assets will then be amortized prospectively over their estimated remaining useful life and accounted for in the same manner as other intangible assets
that are subject to amortization.

Employee compensation and
benefits.

Retirement and postretirement benefit plans are a significant cost of doing business and represent obligations that will be ultimately settled far in the future and therefore are subject to estimation. Retirement and
postretirement benefit plan expenses are allocated to cost of sales, research and development, and selling, general and administrative expenses, in our consolidated statement of operations. We incurred expenses of $10.2 million in 2006, $11.9
million in 2005 and $9.1 million in 2004 for our retirement and postretirement plans. We expect expenses of approximately $12.0 million in 2007 for our retirement and postretirement plans. Pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of
future benefit costs over the employee’s approximate service period based on the terms of the plans and the investment and funding decisions made. We are required to make assumptions regarding such variables as the expected long-term rate of
return on assets and the discount rate applied, to determine service cost and interest cost, in order to arrive at pension income or expense for the year. As of December 31, 2006, we estimated the expected long-term rate of return of assets in
our pension portfolios in the United States was 8.5%, and was 7.6% for plans outside the United States. We have analyzed the rates of return on assets used and determined that these rates are reasonable based on the plans’ historical
performance relative to the overall markets in the countries where we invest the assets, as well as our current expectations for long-term rates of returns for our pension assets. Our management will continue to assess the expected long-term rate of
return on plan assets assumptions for each plan based on relevant market conditions, and will make adjustments to the assumptions as appropriate. Discount rate assumptions have been, and continue to be, based on the prevailing market long-term
interest rates at the measurement date. If any of our



assumptions were to change, our pension plan expenses would also change. A one-quarter percent increase in the discount rate would decrease our net periodic
benefit cost by $0.4 million for 2007 in the United States and by $0.1 million for 2007 for all plans outside the United States. A one percent decrease in the estimated return on plan assets would increase our pre-tax pension expense by $2.1 million
for 2007 in the United States and by $1.0 million for 2007 for all plans outside the United States. We have reduced the volatility in our healthcare costs provided to our retirees by adopting a defined dollar plan feature. Under the defined
dollar plan feature, our total annual liability for healthcare costs to any one retiree is limited to a fixed dollar amount, regardless of the nature or cost of the healthcare needs of that retiree. Our maximum future liability, therefore, cannot be
increased by future changes in the cost of healthcare.

Restructuring activities.

Our financial statements detail specific charges relating to restructuring activities as well as the actual spending that has occurred against the resulting accruals in accordance with SFAS
No. 146,

“Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.”

Our pre-tax restructuring charges are estimates based on our preliminary assessments of (1) severance benefits to be granted to employees, based
on known benefit formulas and identified job grades, (2) costs to abandon certain facilities based on known lease costs of sub-rental income and (3) asset impairments as discussed above under “Value of Long-Lived Assets, Including
Intangibles.” Because these accruals are estimates, they are subject to change as a result of deviations from initial restructuring plans or subsequent information that may come to our attention. For example, actual severance costs may be less
than anticipated if employees voluntarily leave prior to the time at which they would be entitled to severance, or if anticipated legal hurdles in foreign jurisdictions prove to be less onerous than expected. In addition, unanticipated successes or
difficulties in terminating leases and other contractual obligations may lead to changes in estimates. When such changes in estimates occur, they are reflected in our financial statements on the income statement line entitled “restructuring and
integration (reversals) charges, net.”

Gains or losses
on dispositions.

When we record the disposition of an asset or discontinuance of an operation, we make an estimate relative to the amount we expect to realize on the sale or disposition. This estimate is based on a variety of factors,
including current interest in the market, alternative markets for the assets, and other relevant factors. If anticipated proceeds are less than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation, we record a loss. If anticipated proceeds are
greater than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation, we recognize a gain net of expected contingencies when the transaction has been consummated. Accordingly, we may realize amounts different than were first estimated. During the year
ended December 31, 2006, we recognized $1.5 million in gains from disposition of fixed assets. We also recorded $2.4 million in gains from the disposition of discontinued operations, which consisted of gains from the final disposition of our
Aerospace, Fluid Testing, Telecommunications Components and Technical Services businesses, offset by losses associated with the disposition of our Fiber Optics Test Equipment and Lithography businesses. Any such changes decrease or increase current
earnings, and are recorded either against the “gains on disposition” or “discontinued operations” line items appearing in our income statement.

Income taxes.

Our business operations are global in nature, and we are subject to taxes in numerous
jurisdictions. Tax laws and tax rates vary substantially in these jurisdictions and are subject to change given the political and economic climate in those countries. We report and pay income tax based on operational results and applicable law. Our
tax provision contemplates tax rates currently in effect to determine both our current and deferred tax provisions. Any significant fluctuation in rates or changes in tax laws could cause our estimates of taxes we anticipate either paying or
recovering in the future to change. Such changes could lead to either increases or decreases in our effective tax rate.

Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related tax assets and liabilities. In the
ordinary course of our business, there are operational decisions, transactions, facts and circumstances, and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is not certain. Furthermore, our tax positions are periodically subject to challenge
by taxing authorities throughout the world. Where appropriate, we reserve for tax matters when we believe that the likelihood of an incremental liability being incurred is probable in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 5,

“

Accounting for Contingencies”,



and SFAS No. 109,

“

Accounting for Income Taxes” (“SFAS No. 109”). Any significant impact as a result of changes in
underlying facts, law, tax rates, tax audit, or review could lead to adjustments to our income tax expense, our effective tax rate, or our cash flow.

Additionally, in accordance with SFAS No. 109 we have established valuation allowances against a variety of deferred tax assets, including net
operating loss carryforwards, foreign tax credits, other income tax credits and certain pension accruals. Valuation allowances take into consideration our ability to use these deferred tax assets and reduce the value of such items to the amount that
is deemed more likely than not to be recoverable. Improvements or other changes in our operations, domestically and internationally, could increase our ability to utilize these tax attributes in the future. The release of valuation allowances in
periods when these tax attributes become realizable would reduce our effective tax rate.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risks

Financial Instruments

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash investments, marketable
securities and accounts receivable. We believe we had no significant concentrations of credit risk as of December 31, 2006.

In the ordinary course of business, we enter into foreign exchange contracts for periods consistent with our committed exposures to mitigate the effect of
foreign currency movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Transactions covered by hedge contracts include intercompany and third-party receivables and payables. The contracts are primarily in European and Asian currencies, have
maturities that do not exceed 12 months, have no cash requirements until maturity, and are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet. Credit risk is insignificant as the foreign exchange instruments are contracted with major banking
institutions. Unrealized gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts are recognized immediately in earnings for hedges designated as fair value and, for hedges designated as cash flow, the related unrealized gains or losses are deferred as a
component of other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. Deferred gains and losses are recognized in income in the period in which the underlying anticipated transaction occurs. For the year ended December 31,
2006, we did not engage in any designated cash flow hedges. Principal hedged currencies include the British Pound (GBP), Canadian Dollar (CAD), Euro (EUR), Japanese Yen (JPY), and Singapore Dollar (SGD). We held forward foreign exchange contracts
with U.S. equivalent notional amounts totaling $174.8 million at December 31, 2006 and $197.6 million as of January 1, 2006. The approximate fair value of these foreign currency derivative contracts was insignificant. The gains and losses
realized on foreign currency derivative contracts are not material and the duration of these contracts was generally 30 days for 2006. We do not enter into derivatives for trading or other speculative purposes, nor do we use leveraged financial
instruments.



Market Risk

Market Risk.

We are exposed to market risk, including changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates. To
manage the volatility relating to these exposures, we enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted market exposures.

Foreign Exchange Risk.

The potential change in foreign currency exchange rates offers a substantial risk to us,
as approximately 62% of our business is conducted outside of the United States, generally in foreign currencies. Our risk management strategy currently uses forward contracts to mitigate certain balance sheet foreign currency transaction exposures.
The intent is to offset gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures, with gains and losses resulting from the forward contracts that hedge these exposures. Moreover, we are able to partially mitigate the impact that fluctuations in
currencies have on our net income as a result of our manufacturing facilities located in countries outside the United States, material sourcing and other spending which occur in countries outside the U.S resulting in a natural hedge.

Although we attempt to manage our foreign currency exchange risk through the
above activities, when the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies in which we transact business, generally sales and net income will be positively but not proportionately impacted.

Foreign Currency Risk—Value-at-Risk Disclosure

. We utilize a Value-at-Risk model to determine the potential
earning/fair value exposures presented by our foreign currency related financial instruments. As discussed above, we seek to minimize this exposure through our hedging program. Our Value-at-Risk computation is based on the Monte Carlo simulation,
utilizing a 95% confidence interval and a holding period of 30 days. As of December 31, 2006, this computation estimated that there is a 5% chance that the market value of the underlying exposures and the corresponding derivative instruments
either increase or decrease due to foreign currency fluctuations by more than $0.1 million. This Value-At-Risk measure is consistent with our financial statement disclosures relative to our foreign currency hedging program. Specifically, during each
of the four quarters ended in fiscal 2006 the Value-At-Risk was $0.1 million, with an average of approximately $0.1 million.

Interest Rate Risk.

As described above, our debt portfolio includes variable rate instruments. Fluctuations in interest rates can therefore
have a direct impact on both our short-term cash flows, as they relate to interest, and our earnings.

Interest Rate Risk—Sensitivity

. As of December 31, 2006, our debt portfolio consisted of $151.8 million of variable rate debt. In
addition, our cash and cash equivalents, for which we receive interest at variable rates, were $191.1 million at December 31, 2006. Our current earnings exposure for changes in interest rates can be summarized as follows:

(1) Changes in interest rates can cause interest charges on
our variable rate debt, consisting of $151.8 million of revolving debt facilities, to fluctuate. An increase of 10%, or approximately 42 basis points, in current interest rates would cause an additional pre-tax charge to our earnings of $0.6 million
for fiscal year 2007.

(2) Changes in interest
rates can cause our cash flows relative to interest payments on variable rate debt to fluctuate. As described above, an increase of 10%, or approximately 42 basis points, in current interest rates would cause our cash outflows to increase by $0.6
million for fiscal year 2007.

(3) Changes in
interest rates can cause our cash flows relative to interest received to fluctuate.



Item 8.

Financial Statements and Supplemental Data




REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of PerkinElmer, Inc.

Waltham, Massachusetts

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of PerkinElmer, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2006
and January 1, 2006, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006. Our audits also included the
financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)2. These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
PerkinElmer, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2006 and January 1, 2006, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material
respects the information set forth therein.

As discussed in
Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 123(R),

“Share-Based Payment”

and SFAS No. 158

“Employers’ Accounting for
Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)”

.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission, and our report dated March 1, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, and an unqualified opinion on the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1:

Nature of Operations and Accounting Policies

Nature of Operations:

PerkinElmer, Inc. is a global high technology company which designs, manufactures, markets and
supports products, systems and service offerings within two reporting segments: Life and Analytical Sciences and Optoelectronics.

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of PerkinElmer, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”). All material intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Investments in business entities in which the Company does not have control, but has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies, are accounted
for by the equity method.

The Company’s fiscal year ends
on the Sunday nearest December 31. The Company reports fiscal years under a 52/53 week format. Under this method, certain years will contain 53 weeks. The fiscal years ended December 31, 2006 and January 1, 2006 included 52 weeks. The
year ended January 2, 2005 included 53 weeks.

Accounting Policies and Estimates:

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires the Company to make
estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates. The Company bases its
estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not
readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

Revenue Recognition:

The Company’s product sales are recorded when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price to the buyer is fixed or
determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. For products that include installation, and if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element, product revenue is recognized upon delivery, and installation revenue is
recognized when the installation is complete. For sales that include customer-specified acceptance criteria, revenue is recognized after the acceptance criteria have been met. Certain of the Company’s products require specialized installation.
Revenue for these products is deferred until installation is completed. Revenue from services is deferred and recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer. When arrangements include multiple
elements, the Company uses objective evidence of fair value to allocate revenue to the elements and recognizes revenue when the criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element.

Warranty Costs

:    The Company provides for
estimated warranty costs for products at the time of their sale. Warranty liabilities are based on estimated future repair costs using historical labor and material costs incurred in the warranty period.

Shipping and Handling Costs:

The Company
reports shipping and handling costs in both sales and the related costs as cost of goods sold to the extent they are billed to customers. In all other instances they are reflected as a component of cost of goods sold.

Inventories:

Inventories, which include material, labor and
manufacturing overhead, are valued at the lower of cost or market. Substantially all inventories are accounted for using the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method of determining inventory costs. Inventory quantities on-hand are regularly
reviewed, and where necessary, provisions for excess and obsolete inventory are recorded based primarily on the Company’s estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements.

Income Taxes:

The Company uses the asset and
liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. This
method also requires the recognition of future tax benefits such as net operating loss carryforwards, to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. A valuation allowance is established for any deferred tax asset for which realization is not more likely than not.
Pursuant to Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 23, “

Accounting for Income Taxes—Special Areas”

(“APB Opinion No. 23”), and related interpretations with respect to corporate earnings
permanently reinvested offshore, the Company does not accrue tax for the repatriation of its foreign earnings that it considers to be permanently reinvested outside the United States.

Property, Plant and Equipment:

The Company depreciates plant and equipment using the
straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which generally fall within the following ranges: buildings—10 to 40 years; leasehold improvements—estimated useful life or remaining term of lease, whichever is shorter; machinery
and equipment—3 to 7 years. Certain tooling costs are capitalized and amortized over a 3 year life, while repairs and maintenance costs are expensed.

Asset Retirement Obligations

:    The Company records obligations associated with its lease obligations, the retirement of
tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset-retirement costs in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 143, “

Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations,”

and FASB Interpretation
(“FIN”) No. 47, “

Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations

,

an interpretation of SFAS No. 143”

. The Company reviews legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that
result from contractual obligations or the acquisition, construction, development and/or normal use of the assets. If it is determined that a legal obligation exists, regardless of whether the obligation is conditional on a future event, the fair
value of the liability for an asset retirement obligation is recognized in the period in which it is incurred, if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated
asset, and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset. The difference between the gross expected future cash flow and its present value is accreted over the life of the related lease as an operating expense.

Pension Plans:

The
Company’s funding policy provides that payments to the United States (U.S.) pension trusts shall at least be equal to the minimum funding requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. Non-U.S. plans are accrued for, but
generally not fully funded, and benefits are paid from operating funds. In future reporting periods, the difference between actual amounts and estimates based on actuarial assumptions will be recognized in “other comprehensive income” in
the period in which they occur.

In September 2006, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 158,

“Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and
132(R)”

(“SFAS No. 158”). SFAS No. 158 requires companies to recognize a net liability or asset and an offsetting adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income to report the funded status of defined benefit
pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Additionally, SFAS No. 158 requires companies to measure plan assets and obligations at their year-end balance sheet date. SFAS No. 158 requires prospective application and was
effective for the Company as of the end of fiscal year 2006.

The impact of adopting SFAS No. 158 was a reduction to accumulated other comprehensive income of $32.7 million, a reduction to other assets of $26.6 million, an increase to current liabilities of $7.3 million, an increase to current
assets of $0.7 million and a reduction to long-term liabilities of $0.4 million, with no impact to the Company’s consolidated statements of operations or statements of cash flows. There was also no impact from the adoption of SFAS No. 158
on the Company’s compliance with the financial covenants contained in its loan agreement, described in more detail in Note 14, below.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Translation of Foreign Currencies:

For foreign operations, asset and
liability accounts are translated at current exchange rates; income and expenses are translated using weighted average exchange rates. Resulting translation adjustments, as well as gains and losses from certain intercompany transactions, are
reported in accumulated other comprehensive income, a separate component of stockholders’ equity.

Intangible Assets:

The Company’s intangible assets consist of (1) goodwill, which is not being amortized;
(2) indefinite lived intangibles, which consist of certain trademarks and trade names that are not subject to amortization; and (3) amortizing intangibles, which consist of patents and purchased technologies, which are being amortized over
their useful lives. All intangible assets are subject to impairment tests on an annual or periodic basis.

The annual impairment assessment of goodwill is performed by the Company on the later of January 1 or the first day of each fiscal year. This same
impairment test will be performed at other times during the course of the year should an event occur which suggests that the recoverability of goodwill should be reconsidered. Non-amortizing intangibles are also subject to an annual impairment test.
The impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess is
recognized

.

Amortizing intangibles are currently evaluated for impairment using the methodology set forth in SFAS No. 144, “

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets”

. Recoverability of these assets
is assessed only when events have occurred that may give rise to an impairment. When a potential impairment has been identified, forecasted undiscounted net cash flows of the operations to which the asset relates are compared to the current carrying
value of the long-lived assets present in that operation. If such cash flows are less than such carrying amounts, long-lived assets, including such intangibles, are written down to their respective fair values.

Stock-Based Compensation:

The Company has three
stock-based compensation plans from which it makes grants, which are described more fully in Note 19. Effective January 2, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 123(R),

“Share-Based Payment

” (“SFAS
No. 123(R)”), which requires compensation costs related to stock-based transactions, including employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on fair value. SFAS No. 123(R) revises SFAS No. 123, as
amended,

“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation”

(“SFAS No. 123”), and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25,

“Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

” (“APB Opinion No. 25”). Prior to
January 2, 2006, the Company applied the intrinsic value based method prescribed in APB Opinion No. 25, as permitted by SFAS No. 123, in accounting for employee stock-based compensation. The Company generally did not recognize
compensation expense in connection with the grant of stock options because the options granted had an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant.

In transitioning from APB Opinion No. 25 to SFAS No. 123(R), the
Company applied the modified prospective method. Accordingly, periods prior to adoption have not been restated and are not directly comparable to periods after adoption. Under the modified prospective method, compensation cost recognized in periods
after adoption includes (i) compensation cost for all stock-based payments granted prior to, but not yet vested as of January 2, 2006, based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS
No. 123, less estimated forfeitures, and (ii) compensation cost for all stock-based payments granted subsequent to January 1, 2006, based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS
No. 123(R), less estimated forfeitures.

The FASB Staff
Position ("FSP") No. 123R-3,

"Transition Election Related to Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment Awards."

The FSP No. 123R-3 required an entity to follow either the transition guidance for the
additional-paid-in-capital pool as prescribed in SFAS No. 123R or the alternative transition method described in FSP No. 123R-3. An entity that adopted SFAS No. 123R using the modified prospective



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

application may make a one-time election to adopt the transition method described in the FSP No. 123R-3, and may take up to one year from the latter of
its initial adoption of SFAS No. 123R or the effective date of the FSP No. 123R-3 to evaluate the available transition alternatives and make its one-time election. The Company adopted the alternative transition method provided in the FSP
No. 123R-3 for calculating the tax effects of stock-based compensation under SFAS No. 123R.

Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), the Company presented all excess tax benefits related to stock compensation as cash flows from operating
activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. SFAS No. 123(R) requires the cash flows resulting from these tax benefits to be classified as cash flows from financing activities. Tax benefits are recognized related to the cost for
share-based payments to the extent the equity instrument would ordinarily result in a future tax deduction under existing law. Tax expense will be recognized to write off excess deferred tax assets when the tax deduction upon settlement of a vested
option is less than the cumulative compensation expense recorded in the statement of operations for that option, to the extent not offset by prior tax credits for settlements where the tax deduction was greater than the expense recognized based on
the fair value at date of grant.

Prior to the adoption of SFAS
No. 123(R), unearned compensation was recorded in a contra-equity account and established at the date restricted stock was granted representing the amount of unrecognized restricted stock expense. Under the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R),
the recognition of unearned compensation at the date restricted stock is granted is no longer allowed. Therefore, in the first quarter of 2006, the unrecognized restricted stock that had been in “Unearned compensation” in the consolidated
balance sheet as of January 1, 2006 was reclassified to “Capital in excess of par value.”

Marketable Securities and Investments:

Marketable Securities and Investments, whether debt or equity, are accounted for in
accordance with SFAS No. 115, “

Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities”

. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. If securities are classified as available for sale,
the Company records these investments at their fair values with unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Under the cost method of accounting, equity investments in private companies are carried at cost
and are adjusted for other-than-temporary declines in fair value, additional investments or distributions.

Cash Flows:

For purposes of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, the Company considers all highly liquid unrestricted
instruments with a purchased maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value due to the short maturities.

Environmental Matters:

The Company accrues for costs associated with the remediation of
environmental pollution when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the Company’s proportionate share of the amount can be reasonably estimated. The recorded liabilities have not been discounted.

Comprehensive Income (Loss):

Comprehensive
income (loss) is defined as net income or loss and other changes in stockholders’ equity from transactions and other events from sources other than stockholders. Comprehensive income (loss) is reflected in the Consolidated Statements of
Stockholders’ Equity and Comprehensive Income.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging:

The Company records derivative instruments on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities, measured at fair value. Gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of
those derivatives would be accounted for depending on the use of the derivative instrument and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Reclassifications:

Certain reclassifications have been made to prior
years’ financial statements to conform to the 2006 presentation. These reclassifications have no material impact on previously reported net income or cash flows.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements:

In September 2006, the SEC issued Staff Accounting
Bulletin No. 108,

“Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements”

(“SAB 108”). SAB 108 provides guidance on how prior year
misstatements should be taken into consideration when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements for purposes of determining whether the current year’s financial statements are materially misstated. The Company was required
to adopt SAB 108 in 2006. The adoption of SAB 108 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In July 2006, the FASB issued FIN No. 48,

“Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes”

(“FIN No. 48”). FIN
No. 48 was issued to clarify the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements by prescribing a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax
position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return in accordance with SFAS No. 109,

“Accounting for Income Taxes.”

The new interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company is
required to adopt FIN No. 48 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2007. The Company is currently evaluating the requirements of FIN No. 48 and has not yet determined the impact on its consolidated financial statements.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,

“Fair
Value Measurements”

(“SFAS No. 157”). SFAS No. 157 clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability, and establishes a fair value
hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions. Under the standard, fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy. The Company will be required to adopt SFAS No. 157
in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008. The Company is currently evaluating the requirements of SFAS No. 157 and has not yet determined the impact, if any, of its adoption on its consolidated financial statements.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,

“The Fair Value
Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities”

(“SFAS No. 159”). SFAS No. 159 provides entities with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value, with the objective to reduce both
the complexity in accounting for financial instruments and the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently. The Company will be required to adopt SFAS No. 159 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008.
The Company is currently evaluating the requirements of SFAS No. 159 and have not yet determined the impact, if any, of its adoption on its consolidated financial statements.

Note 2:

Acquisition of Triton Technology Ltd

.    In
December 2006, the Company acquired specified assets of Triton Technology Ltd (“Triton”). The Company acquired from Triton a line of Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (“DMA”) products. The DMA products offer a thermal analysis
tool that is used by scientists in the polymers, pharmaceuticals and food industries for diverse applications ranging from simple quality control to advanced research. Consideration for this transaction was $2.3 million in cash at the closing, plus
additional cash payments of $1.6 million in 2007.

Acquisition of Evotec Technologies GmbH

.    In January 2007, the Company acquired the stock of Evotec Technologies GmbH (“Evotec”). The acquisition is intended to allow the Company to provide its
customers in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and academic arenas with Evotec’s high content screening (“HCS”) instruments and software. These analysis tools determine the composition of cells and cell structure, a critical step in
moving potential drug targets quickly through the discovery process. Consideration for this transaction was approximately $33.0 million in cash, subject to a net working capital adjustment.

Acquisition of
Euroscreen Products S.A.

In January 2007, the Company acquired the stock of Euroscreen Products S.A. (“Euroscreen”), a developer of the AequoScreen

TM

cellular assay platform. The AequoScreen

TM

platform from Euroscreen is based on an innovative luminescence technology that generates higher quality data, while reducing the number of false positives in G protein-coupled receptor (“GPCR”) screening applications.
Consideration for this transaction was approximately $18.1 million in cash.

The operations for each of these acquisitions completed in 2006 are reported within the results of the Company’s Life and Analytical Sciences segment from the acquisition date. The operations subsequent to the
acquisitions, individually and in the aggregate, did not have a material effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

The acquisitions were accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 141,

“Business Combinations”

, and the Company has accordingly
allocated the purchase prices of the acquisitions based upon the preliminary fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The purchase prices and related allocations have not been finalized



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

and may be revised as a result of adjustments made to the purchase prices, additional information regarding liabilities assumed, including contingent
liabilities, and revisions of preliminary estimates of fair values made at the dates of purchase. In connection with the fair valuing of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, management, assisted by valuation consultants, performed
assessments of intangible assets using customary valuation procedures and techniques.

The components of the preliminary purchase prices and allocations for the acquisitions completed in 2006 are as follows:

Note 3:

Restructuring Charges

The Company has undertaken a series of restructuring actions related to the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and the integration of its business
units. Restructuring actions in 2001 and 2002 were recorded in accordance with EITF 94-3, “

Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a
Restructuring)”

. Restructuring actions taken since 2002 were recorded in accordance with SFAS No. 146, “

Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities”

(“SFAS No. 146”). In certain
instances, specifically when governmental authorities are involved in setting severance levels, SFAS No. 112, “

Employers’ Accounting for Postemployment Benefits”

, is applied.

A description of each of the restructuring plans and the activity recorded is
as follows:

Q2 2006 Plan:

During the second quarter of 2006, the Company’s management approved a
plan for workforce reductions in two locations in the United States as the Company shifts resources into product lines that are more consistent with the Company’s growth strategy. The Company completed notifying affected employees on
June 30, 2006. As a result of this plan, the Company recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of $0.8 million during the second quarter of 2006 (the “Q2 2006 Plan”). The principal actions within the Q2 2006 Plan related to a workforce
reduction resulting from reorganization activities within the Life and Analytical Sciences segment.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The following table summarizes the components of the Q2 2006 Plan activity:

All actions related to
the Q2 2006 Plan have been completed and the Company anticipates that the remaining payments of $0.1 million will be completed by the end of the second quarter of 2007.

Q4 2005 Plan:

During the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company recognized a $2.2 million pre-tax restructuring charge in the Life and Analytical Sciences segment and a
$6.0 million pre-tax restructuring charge in the Optoelectronics segment (the “Q4 2005 Plan”). The purpose of these restructuring actions was to shift resources into geographic regions and product lines that were more consistent with
the Company’s growth strategy. The principal actions in the Q4 2005 Plan were workforce reductions and the closure of several facilities resulting from reorganization activities.

During 2006, the Company recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge, net, of
$0.2 million relating to its Q4 2005 Plan due to higher than expected costs associated with the workforce reductions in Europe within the Life and Analytical Sciences segment. The Company also recorded a pre-tax restructuring reversal of $1.4
million relating to its Q4 2005 Plan due to the completion in June 2006 of the sale of a building previously reserved for in the Q4 2005 Plan. The amount of the proceeds from this sale in excess of the current book value of the property was recorded
as a pre-tax restructuring reversal within the Optoelectronics segment.

The following table summarizes the components of the Q4 2005 Plan activity:

All actions related to
the Q4 2005 Plan have been completed and the Company anticipates that the remaining payments of $0.2 million will be completed by the end of 2008.

Q2 2005 Plan:

During the second quarter of 2005, the Company recognized a $5.3 million pre-tax restructuring charge in the Life and Analytical Sciences segment and a
$2.9 million pre-tax restructuring charge in the Optoelectronics segment (the “Q2 2005 Plan”). The purpose of these restructuring actions was to shift resources into geographic



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

regions and product lines that were more consistent with the Company’s growth strategy. The principal actions in the Q2 2005 Plan were workforce
reductions resulting from reorganization activities. All workforce reductions have been completed and the remaining payments relate to international severance contracts.

During 2006, the Company recorded a pre-tax restructuring reversal of $0.6 million relating to the Q2 2005 Plan due to lower
than expected employee separation costs associated with both the Life and Analytical Sciences and Optoelectronics segments.

The following table summarizes the components of the Q2 2005 Plan activity:

All actions related to
the Q2 2005 Plan have been completed and the Company anticipates that the remaining payments of $0.4 million will be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2008.

2001 to 2003 Restructuring and Integration Plans:

The principal actions in these restructuring plans were workforce reductions
related to the integration of the Company’s Life Sciences and Analytical Instruments businesses in order to reduce costs and achieve operational efficiencies as well as workforce reductions at one of the Optoelectronics manufacturing facilities
to reflect declining demand for several product lines. The Company has approximately $2.0 million of remaining liabilities associated with 2001 to 2003 restructuring and integration plans, primarily relating to workforce severance benefits
associated with the closure of our European manufacturing facility in the Life and Analytical Sciences segment and remaining lease obligations of closed facilities. The remaining terms of these leases vary in length and will be paid through 2014.

During 2006, the Company recorded a pre-tax restructuring
reversal of $2.7 million relating to the Q4 2002 Plan due to the completion in December 2006 of the sale of a building previously reserved for in the Q4 2002 Plan. The amount of the proceeds from this sale in excess of the current book value of the
property was recorded as a pre-tax restructuring reversal within the Life and Analytical Sciences segment.

Note 4:

Impairment of Assets

The Company recorded a charge of $3.2 million for the impairment of assets during 2006 within the Life and Analytical Sciences segment. This impairment
included a $2.8 million loss related to a manufacturing facility and a $0.4 million loss on impairment of a license agreement.

million—subject to expiration in years ranging from 2007 to 2026, and without expiration for certain foreign net operating loss carryforwards and certain state credit carryforwards. At



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

December 31, 2006, the Company also had a U.S. federal net operating loss carryforward of approximately $4.0 million as a result of an acquisition made
during 2006. The utilization of this loss is subject to an annual limitation based on Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. This loss will expire in 2026. Valuation allowances generally take into consideration
limitations imposed upon the use of the tax attributes and reduce the value of such items to the likely net realizable amount. Based on the judgment of the Company, and consistent with prior years, full valuation allowances have been established
against these tax attributes with the exception of the acquired federal net operating loss carryforward and certain foreign net operating loss carryforwards that have been determined to be more likely than not to be realized. The tax benefit of the
reversal of the valuation allowance associated with the Company’s research and experimental credits was reported as part of the gain on disposal of discontinued operations in 2005. Included in the foreign tax credit carryforwards and
corresponding valuation allowance of $17.8 million are $5.3 million of credits which, if utilized, will result in a credit to equity rather than a reduction of the income tax provision.

Current deferred tax assets of $32.1 million and $40.0 million were included in other current assets at December 31,
2006 and January 1, 2006, respectively. Long-term deferred tax assets of $3.0 million and $6.0 million were included in other assets at December 31, 2006 and January 1, 2006, respectively. Long-term deferred tax liabilities of $82.8
million and $109.1 million were included in other long-term liabilities at December 31, 2006 and January 1, 2006, respectively. Additionally, $13.4 million of net deferred tax liabilities are recorded through other comprehensive income,
primarily as a result of the adoption of FASB Statement No. 158 in 2006.

The Company generally considers all earnings generated outside of the United States to be permanently reinvested offshore. Pursuant to APB Opinion No. 23 and related interpretations with respect to corporate
earnings permanently reinvested offshore, the Company therefore does not accrue U.S. tax for the repatriation of its foreign earnings it considers to be permanently reinvested outside the United States. However, the Company regularly reviews its
global cash needs and may repatriate foreign earnings when necessary and when these earnings can be distributed in cash and in a tax efficient manner. As of December 31, 2006, the amount of foreign earnings for which no U.S. tax cost has been
provided was approximately $221 million. The U.S. tax cost has not been determined due to the fact that it is not practicable at this time.

During 2005, the Internal Revenue Service concluded its audit of federal income taxes for the years 1999 through 2002. The Company has agreed to the
conclusions of the Internal Revenue Service in all matters with the exception of one, and has filed a single issue protest with the Appeals Division of the Internal Revenue Service. The Company expects to resolve the matter in the first half of
2007. Regardless of the outcome of the protest, the Company does not expect the final resolution to significantly impact its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

The Company is under regular examination by tax authorities in the United States and other countries (such as Germany and
the United Kingdom) in which the Company has significant business operations. The tax years under examination vary by jurisdiction. The Company regularly reviews the likelihood of additional assessments in each of the taxing jurisdictions resulting
from these and subsequent years’ examinations. The Company has established income tax reserves which it believes to be adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments. Once established, reserves are adjusted as additional
information becomes available and when an event occurs requiring a change to the reserves. The resolution of tax matters is not expected to have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial condition.

In December 2006, the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 (the “Tax
Act”) was enacted. The Tax Act retroactively restored the expired research and experimental tax credit provisions of the law from January 1, 2006, and extended the credit through December 31, 2007. As a result of the Tax Act, the
Company recorded a



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

benefit in the fourth quarter of 2006 for the research and experimental tax credit for the full year 2006 in the amount of $1.6 million.

Note 7:

Discontinued Operations

As part of its continued efforts to focus on higher growth opportunities, the Company has discontinued certain businesses. The Company has accounted for
these businesses as discontinued operations in accordance with SFAS No. 144, “

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,

” and, accordingly, has presented the results of operations and related cash flows as
discontinued operations for all periods presented. The assets and liabilities of these businesses have been presented separately and are reflected within the assets and liabilities from discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets as of December 31, 2006 and January 1, 2006.

The Company recorded the following gains and losses, which have been reported as the gain (loss) on dispositions of discontinued operations during the three years ended:

In September 2005, the
Company’s Board of Directors approved a plan to divest its Fluid Sciences segment. The Fluid Sciences segment consisted of three businesses—Aerospace, Fluid Testing and Semiconductor. In November 2005, the Company sold the Fluid Testing
division for approximately $34.5 million, resulting in a net pre-tax gain of $30.3 million. In December 2005, the Company sold the Aerospace division for approximately $333.0 million, resulting in a net pre-tax gain of $250.6 million. These gains
were recognized during fiscal 2005 as gains on the dispositions of discontinued operations. The Company received total cash proceeds in these transactions of approximately $360.0 million. During 2006, the Company finalized the net working capital
adjustments associated with the sales of these businesses, settled a claim related to an employee benefit program, and ceased future benefit accruals to a postretirement medical plan. In 2006, these actions resulted in the recognition of a gain of
$0.5 million and a loss of $0.2 million relative to the Aerospace business and the Fluid Testing business, respectively. In February 2006, the Company sold substantially all of the assets of its Semiconductor business for approximately $26.5
million, subject to a net working capital adjustment, plus potential additional contingent consideration. A pre-tax gain of $3.8 million, exclusive of additional contingent consideration, was recognized in 2006.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In December 2005, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a plan to sell its Lithography
business. In June 2005, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a plan to shut down the Company’s Fiber Optics Test Equipment business. The results of these businesses were previously reported as part of the Optoelectronics segment.
During the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company substantially completed the remediation of an environmental matter within the Lithography business, resulting in recognition of a pre-tax loss of $1.7 million. The completion of the shut-down
of the Fiber Optics Test Equipment business resulted in a pre-tax loss of $5.2 million related to lease and severance costs and the reduction of fixed assets and inventory to net realizable value. The Company recognized the net loss during
fiscal 2005.

In September 2004, the Company’s Board of
Directors approved a plan to shut down its Computer-To-Plate business. In June 2004, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a plan to shut down the Company’s Electroformed Products business and sell the Company’s Ultraviolet
Lighting business. The results of these businesses were previously reported as part of the Optoelectronics reporting segment. The abandonment of the Computer-To-Plate business resulted in a $1.0 million write-down of certain fixed assets and
inventory for the year ended January 2, 2005. The net assets of the Electroformed Products business were written off resulting in a $1.6 million pre-tax loss in 2004. The fixed assets and inventory of the Ultraviolet Lighting business were sold
in July 2004 for their approximate book value.

During 2006,
2005 and 2004, the Company settled various claims under certain long-term contracts and transition services with our Technical Services business, which the Company sold in August 1999. The net settlement and the reversal of certain previously
established contingencies resulted in pre-tax gains of $1.2 million in 2006, $0.9 million in 2005 and $1.5 million in 2004.

Summary operating results of the discontinued operations for the periods prior to disposition were as follows:



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Note 8:

Earnings per Share

Basic earnings per share was computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period less restricted
unvested shares. Diluted earnings per share was computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding plus all potentially dilutive common stock equivalents, primarily shares issuable upon the exercise of stock
options using the treasury stock method. The following table reconciles the number of shares utilized in the earnings per share calculations:

Antidilutive
securities include outstanding stock options with exercise prices and average unrecognized compensation cost in excess of the average fair market value of common stock for the related period. Antidilutive options were excluded from the calculation
of diluted net income per share and could become dilutive in the future.

Note 9:

Accounts Receivable

Accounts receivable were net of reserves for doubtful accounts of $12.2 million and $11.7 million as of December 31, 2006 and January 1, 2006,
respectively.

During 2001, the Company established a wholly
owned consolidated subsidiary to maintain a receivables purchase agreement with a third party financial institution. Under this arrangement, the Company sold, on a revolving basis, certain of the Company’s accounts receivable balances to the
consolidated subsidiary which simultaneously sold an undivided percentage ownership interest in designated pools of receivables to a third party financial institution. As collections reduce the balance of sold accounts receivable, new receivables
are sold. The Company’s consolidated subsidiary retains the risk of credit loss on the receivables. Accordingly, the full amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts has been provided for on the Company’s balance sheet. The amount of
receivables sold and outstanding with the third party financial institution may not exceed $65.0 million. Under the terms of this arrangement, the Company retains collection and administrative responsibilities for the balances. The amount of
receivables sold to the consolidated subsidiary was $67.8 million as of December 31, 2006 and $91.0 million as of January 1, 2006. At each of December 31, 2006 and January 1, 2006, an undivided interest of $45.0 million in the
receivables had been sold to the third party financial institution under this arrangement. The remaining interest in receivables of $22.8 million and $46.0 million that were sold to and held by the consolidated subsidiary were included in accounts
receivable in the consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2006 and January 1, 2006, respectively.

The agreement requires the third party financial institution to be paid interest during the period from the date the receivable is sold to its maturity
date. At December 31, 2006, the effective interest rate was LIBOR plus approximately 50 basis points. The servicing fees received constitute adequate compensation for services performed. No servicing asset or liability is therefore recorded.
The agreement also includes conditions that require the Company to maintain a senior unsecured credit rating of BB or above, as defined by Standard & Poor’s Rating Services, and Ba2 or above, as defined by Moody’s Investors
Service. At December 31, 2006, the



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Company had a senior unsecured credit rating of BBB — with a stable outlook from Standard & Poor’s Rating Services, and of Baa3 with a
stable outlook from Moody’s Investors Service. In January 2007, the Company’s consolidated subsidiary entered into an agreement to extend the term of the accounts receivable securitization facility to January 25, 2008.

The net unrealized holding gain on marketable securities, net of deferred
income taxes, reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity, was a $0.1 million gain at December 31, 2006 and January 1, 2006. The proceeds from the sales of securities and the related gains
and losses are not material for any period presented.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

In accordance with SFAS No. 142, “

Goodwill and other Intangible Assets,”

the Company is required to test goodwill for impairment at
the reporting unit level upon initial adoption and at least annually on the later of January 1 or the first day of each fiscal year. As part of the Company’s ongoing compliance with SFAS No. 142, the Company, assisted by valuation
consultants, completed its annual assessment of goodwill and intangible assets for the year ending December 31, 2006. The results of this annual assessment resulted in no impairment of goodwill or intangible assets for fiscal 2006.

The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for fiscal 2006 and 2005
are as follows:

Senior Unsecured Credit Facility.

On October 31, 2005, the Company entered into a $350.0 million five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility. Letters of credit in the
aggregate amount of approximately $15.0 million, originally issued under our previous credit agreement, are treated as issued under this agreement. The Company uses the senior unsecured revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes which
may include



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

working capital, refinancing existing indebtedness, capital expenditures, share repurchases, acquisitions and strategic alliances. The interest rates under
the senior unsecured revolving credit facility are based on the Eurocurrency rate at the time of borrowing plus a margin or the base rate from time to time. The base rate is the higher of (1) the corporate base rate announced from time to time
by Bank of America, N.A. and (2) the Federal Funds rate plus 50 basis points. The Company may allocate all or a portion of our indebtedness under the senior unsecured revolving credit facility to interest based upon the Eurocurrency rate plus a
margin or the base rate. The Eurocurrency margin as of December 31, 2006 was 60 basis points; the weighted average Eurocurrency rate was 3.62%. There were approximately $151.5 million of borrowings under the facility as of December 31,
2006 with interest based on the above described Eurocurrency rate. At year end, the borrowings were undertaken by certain foreign subsidiaries of the Company’s and the funds were borrowed in the subsidiaries’ functional currencies of Euro
(EUR), Canadian Dollars

(CAD) and Japanese Yen (JPY). The
effective rates of the borrowings as of December 31, 2006 were as follows: EUR: 4.27%; CAD: 4.88% and JPY: 1.09%. The agreement contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants and events of default customary for financings of this type.
The financial covenants include interest coverage and debt-to-EBITDA ratios. At all times during 2006, the Company was in compliance with all applicable covenants.

Senior Subordinated
Notes.

In December 2002 the Company issued ten-year senior subordinated notes at a rate of 8


/


% with a face value of $300.0 million (the “Senior Subordinated Notes”). In the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company commenced and substantially completed a tender offer and consent solicitation for any and all of the Senior
Subordinated Notes. The Company repurchased all but $25 thousand of these notes as of November 23, 2005. In connection with the tender offer, the Company solicited consents to amend the indenture under which the Senior Subordinated Notes were
issued and removed most of the restrictive covenants from the indenture.

Note 16:

Employee Benefit Plans

The Company has adopted the balance sheet recognition requirements of SFAS No. 158 on December 31, 2006, which requires the Company to recognize
a net liability or asset and an offsetting adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income to report the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. The incremental effect of adopting SFAS No. 158 on
individual line items in the consolidated financial statements at December 31, 2006 is shown below:

Savings
Plan:

The Company has a savings plan for the benefit of qualified United States (U.S.) employees. Under this plan, for Life and Analytical Sciences and corporate employees, the Company contributes an amount equal to the
lesser of 100% of the employee’s voluntary contribution or 5.0% of the employee’s annual compensation up to applicable Internal Revenue Service limits. For Optoelectronics employees, the Company contributes an amount equal to the lesser of
55% of the amount of the employee’s voluntary contribution or 3.3% of the employee’s annual compensation up to applicable Internal Revenue Service limits. Savings plan expense was $7.6 million in 2006, $8.3 million in 2005 and $7.8 million
in 2004.

Pension Plans:

The
Company has defined benefit pension plans covering some U.S. employees and non-U.S. pension plans for some non-U.S. employees. The principal U.S. defined benefit pension plans were closed to new hires effective January 31, 2001, and benefits
for those employed by the Company’s former Life Sciences businesses within the Company’s Life and Analytical Sciences segment were frozen as of that date. Plan benefits were frozen as of March 2003 for those employed by the Company’s
former Analytical Instruments business within its Life and Analytical Sciences segment and corporate employees. The plans provide benefits that are based on an employee’s years of service and compensation near retirement.

Net periodic pension cost included the following components:

The following table sets forth the changes in the funded status of the principal U.S. pension plans

Not applicable due to change in accounting standard.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company also sponsors a supplemental executive retirement plan to provide senior management with
benefits in excess of normal pension benefits. Effective July 31, 2000, this plan was closed to new entrants. At December 31, 2006 and January 1, 2006, the projected benefit obligations were $19.7 million and $19.9 million,
respectively. Assets with a fair value of $0.7 million and $2.1 million, segregated in a trust (which is included in marketable securities and investments on the consolidated balance sheets), were available to meet this obligation as of
December 31, 2006 and January 1, 2006, respectively. Pension expense for this plan was approximately $2.0 million in 2006, $1.8 million in 2005 and $1.9 million in 2004.

An incremental additional minimum liability of $7.4 million, net of tax, was recorded to stockholder’s equity and
included in other comprehensive income during 2005 related to the Company’s non-U.S. pension plans in the United Kingdom and Germany. Unrecognized net losses are amortized over the remaining service period in accordance with accounting
regulations.

Assets of the defined benefit pension plans are
primarily equity and debt securities. Asset allocation at December 31, 2006 and January 1, 2006, and target asset allocations for fiscal 2007, are as follows:

The Company maintains
target allocation percentages among various asset classes based on investment policies established for the pension plans which are designed to maximize the total rate of return (income and appreciation) after inflation within the limits of prudent
risk taking, while providing for adequate near-term liquidity for benefit payments. The Company’s expected returns on assets assumptions are derived from studies conducted by actuaries and investment advisors. The studies include a review of
anticipated future long-term performance of individual asset classes and consideration of the appropriate asset allocation strategy given the anticipated requirements of the plans to determine the average rate of earnings expected on the funds
invested to provide for the pension plans benefits. While the study gives appropriate consideration to recent fund performance and historical returns, the assumption is primarily a long-term, prospective rate.

The Company does not expect to make any contributions to the U.S. pension
plan during fiscal 2007. With respect to non-U.S. plans, the Company expects to contribute approximately $11.1 million in 2007.

The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid as follows:



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The estimated amount that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income into net
periodic benefit cost in 2007 is as follows:

Postretirement
Medical Plans:

The Company provides health care benefits for eligible retired U.S. employees under a comprehensive major medical plan or under health maintenance organizations where available. The majority of the
Company’s U.S. employees become eligible for retiree health benefits if they retire directly from the Company and have at least ten years of service. Generally, the major medical plan pays stated percentages of covered expenses after a
deductible is met and takes into consideration payments by other group coverage and by Medicare. The plan requires retiree contributions under most circumstances and has provisions for cost-sharing charges. Effective January 1, 2000, this plan
was closed to new hires. For employees retiring after 1991, the Company has capped its medical premium contribution based on employees’ years of service. The Company funds the amount allowable under a 401(h) provision in the Company’s
defined benefit pension plan. Assets of the plan are primarily equity and debt securities.

Net periodic postretirement medical benefit cost (credit) included the following components:

*

The Company ceased future benefit accruals to its existing postretirement medical plan as part of the divesture of its Fluid Sciences segment, which was complete in February 2006.
In connection with this action, the Company recorded curtailment gains of approximately $1.8 million during fiscal year 2006 to discontinued operations.

The consolidated financial statements included $7.4 million of long-term assets and $1.6 million of
long-term liabilities as of December 31, 2006 and January 1, 2006, respectively.

The Company maintains a Master Trust for plan assets related to the U.S. defined benefit plans and the U.S. postretirement medical plan. Accordingly, investment policies, target asset allocations and actual asset
allocations are the same as those disclosed for the U.S. defined benefit plans.

The Company does not expect to make any contributions to the postretirement medical plan during 2007.

The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid as follows:

The estimated amount
that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic benefit cost in 2007 is as follows:

Deferred
Compensation Plans:

During 1998, the Company implemented a nonqualified deferred compensation plan that provides benefits payable to officers and certain key employees or their designated beneficiaries at specified future
dates, or upon retirement or death. Benefit payments under the plan are funded by a combination of contributions from participants and the Company. The obligations related to the deferred compensation plan totaled $5.4 million and $5.7 million at
December 31, 2006 and January 1, 2006, respectively.

Note 17:

Contingencies

The Company is conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at current and former Company locations and, along with other
companies, has been named a potentially responsible party (“PRP”) for certain waste disposal sites. The Company accrues for environmental issues in the accounting period that the Company’s responsibility is established and when the
cost can be reasonably estimated. The Company has accrued $3.5 million as of December 31, 2006, representing management’s estimate of the total cost of ultimate disposition of known environmental matters. Such amount is not discounted and
does not reflect the recovery of any amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements. These cost estimates are subject to a number of variables, including the stage of the environmental investigations, the magnitude of the possible
contamination, the nature of the potential remedies, possible joint and several liability, the time period over which remediation may occur and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations. For sites where the



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Company has been named a PRP, management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named
parties to contribute. The Company expects that the majority of such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to ten years. As assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site, these liabilities are reviewed and
adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available. There have been no environmental problems to date that have had or are expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or
cash flows. While it is possible that a loss exceeding the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may be incurred, the potential exposure is not expected to be materially different from those amounts recorded.

In papers dated October 23, 2002, Enzo Biochem, Inc. and Enzo Life
Sciences, Inc. (collectively, “Enzo”) filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Civil Action No. 02-8448, against Amersham plc, Amersham BioSciences, PerkinElmer, Inc., PerkinElmer
Life Sciences, Inc., Sigma-Aldrich Corporation, Sigma Chemical Company, Inc., Molecular Probes, Inc., and Orchid BioSciences, Inc. The complaint alleges that the Company has breached its distributorship and settlement agreements with Enzo, infringed
Enzo’s patents, engaged in unfair competition and fraud, and committed torts against Enzo by, among other things, engaging in commercial development and exploitation of Enzo’s patented products and technology, separately and together with
the other defendants. Enzo seeks injunctive and monetary relief. In 2003, the court severed the lawsuit and ordered Enzo to serve individual complaints against the five defendants. The Company subsequently filed an answer and a counterclaim alleging
that Enzo’s patents are invalid. In July 2006, the court issued a decision regarding the construction of the claims in Enzo’s patents that effectively limited the coverage of certain of those claims and, the Company believes, excludes
certain of the Company’s products from the coverage of Enzo’s patents. Discovery is ongoing. No trial date has been set, but summary judgment motions were filed by the defendants in January 2007.

On October 17,
2003, Amersham Biosciences Corp. filed a complaint, which was subsequently amended, in the United States District Court for New Jersey, Civil Action No. 03-4901, against a subsidiary of the Company, alleging that the Company’s
ViewLux

™

and certain of its Image FlashPlate

™

products infringe three of Amersham’s patents related to high-throughput screening (the “NJ case”). On August 18, 2004, Amersham plc
filed a complaint against two of the Company’s United Kingdom-based subsidiaries in the Patent Court of the English High Court of Justice, Case No. 04C02688, alleging that the Company’s same products infringe one corresponding
Amersham patent in the United Kingdom, which was granted in August 2004 (the “UK case”). Amersham seeks injunctive and monetary relief in both cases. The Company filed answers and counterclaims in both cases. On October 29, 2003, the
Company filed a complaint, which was subsequently amended, against Amersham in the United States District Court for Massachusetts, Civil Action No. 03-12098, alleging that Amersham’s IN Cell Analyzer, and LEADseeker

™

Multimodality Imaging system and certain Cyclic AMP and IP3 assays infringe two of the Company’s patents related to
high-throughput screening (the “MA case”). The Company seeks injunctive and monetary relief. Amersham subsequently filed an answer and counterclaims. After a trial in the UK case in December 2005, the court ruled in February 2006 that
Amersham’s patent in question was invalid in the United Kingdom and awarded costs to the Company. Amersham initiated an appeal of the ruling in the UK case but withdrew that appeal in January 2007. In May 2006, the court in the NJ case issued a
decision regarding the construction of the claims in Amersham’s patents that adopted many of Amersham’s claim construction positions. The Company’s motion asking the court to reconsider that decision was denied. Discovery has not yet
been completed in either the NJ or MA case, nor has a trial date been set in either case. A voluntary mediation occurred in September 2006, but did not result in a resolution of these matters. Fact discovery, which was stayed pending the mediation,
has now resumed. At the suggestion of the court in the NJ case, additional mediation is being scheduled.

The Company believes it has meritorious defenses to these lawsuits and other proceedings, and it is contesting the actions vigorously in all of the above
matters. The Company is currently unable, however, to



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

reasonably estimate the amount of loss, if any, that may result from the resolution of these matters or to determine whether resolution of any of these
matters will have a material adverse impact on its consolidated financial statements.

The Company is also subject to various other claims, legal proceedings and investigations covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of its business activities. Each of these matters is subject
to uncertainties, and it is possible that some of these matters may be resolved unfavorably to the Company. The Company has established accruals for potential losses that it believes are probable and reasonably estimable. In the opinion of the
Company’s management, based on its review of the information available at this time, the total cost of resolving these other contingencies at December 31, 2006, should not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated
financial statements.

Warranty Reserves

The Company provides warranty protection for certain products for periods ranging from one to three years beyond the date of sale. The majority of costs
associated with warranty obligations include the replacement of parts and the time of service personnel to respond to repair and replacement requests. A warranty reserve is recorded based upon historical results, supplemented by management’s
expectations of future costs. Warranty reserves are included in “Accrued expenses” on the consolidated balance sheets. A summary of warranty reserve activity for the years ended December 31, 2006, January 1, 2006 and
January 2, 2005 is as follows:

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R) which requires compensation costs related to stock-based transactions, including employee
stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on fair value. SFAS No. 123(R) revises SFAS No. 123, as amended, and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25.

Effective January 2, 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R) using the modified prospective
transition method. Accordingly, periods prior to adoption have not been restated and are not directly comparable to periods after adoption. Under the modified prospective method, compensation cost recognized in periods after adoption includes
(i) compensation cost for all stock-based payments granted prior to, but not yet



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

vested as of, January 2, 2006, based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS No. 123, less
estimated forfeitures, and (ii) compensation cost for all stock-based payments granted subsequent to January 1, 2006, based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), less estimated
forfeitures.

Prior to January 2, 2006, the Company
accounted for stock-based compensation plans in accordance with the provisions of APB Opinion No. 25, as permitted by SFAS No. 123. Under APB Opinion No. 25, the Company was generally not required to recognize compensation expense for
the cost of stock options, when such options had an exercise price equal to the market price at the date of grant, or shares issued under the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan. If the fair value based method as prescribed by SFAS
No. 123 had been applied by the Company, the effect on net income and earnings per share for 2005 and 2004 would have been as follows:

As of
December 31, 2006, the Company had three stock-based compensation plans. Under the 2005 Incentive Plan, 5.4 million shares of the Company’s common stock were made available for stock option grants, restricted stock awards and
performance units. Under the 2001 Incentive Plan, 8.8 million shares of the Company’s common stock were made available for stock option grants, restricted stock awards and performance units. Under the Life Sciences Plan, 2.3 million
shares of the Company’s common stock were made available for stock option grants.

For 2006, in accordance with the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), the Company recorded incremental pre-tax compensation related to the stock options of $9.2 million. The total pre-tax stock-based compensation expense
for the cost of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance units was $17.5 million for 2006. The total income tax benefit recognized in the consolidated statements of operations for stock-based compensation was $6.1
million in 2006. Stock-based compensation costs capitalized as part of inventory were approximately $0.2 million as of December 31, 2006.

Stock Options:

The Company has granted options to purchase common shares at prices equal to the market price of the common
shares on the date the option is granted. Conditions of vesting are determined at the time of grant. Options are generally exercisable in equal annual installments over a period of three years and will generally expire seven years after the date of
grant. Options assumed as part of business combination transactions retain all the rights, terms and conditions of the respective plans under which they were originally issued.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The fair value of each option grant is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The
fair value is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally the vesting period. Use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model
inputs. Expected volatility was calculated primarily based on the historical volatility of the Company’s stock. The average expected life was based on the contractual term of the option and historic exercise experience. The risk-free interest
rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life assumed at the date of grant. Forfeitures are estimated based on voluntary termination behavior, as well as an analysis of actual option forfeitures.
The Company’s weighted-average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model are as follows:

The following table
summarizes stock option activity for the three years ended December 31, 2006:

The weighted-average
grant-date fair values of options granted during 2006, 2005 and 2004 were $6.83, $8.36 and $8.26, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during 2006, 2005 and 2004 were $16.2 million, $13.7 million and $12.0 million,
respectively. Cash received from option exercises for 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $21.5 million, $19.4 million and $15.0 million, respectively. The related tax benefit classified as a financing cash inflow was $2.2 million for 2006. The related tax
benefit classified as an operating cash inflow was $5.3 million for 2005 and zero for 2004.

The total pre-tax compensation recognized related to the stock options, which is a function of current and prior year awards, is net of estimated forfeitures and was approximately $9.2 million in 2006. There was $10.6
million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock options granted as of December 31, 2006. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.6 fiscal years and will be adjusted for any future
changes in estimated forfeitures. The aggregate intrinsic value for stock options outstanding at December 31, 2006 was $26.9 million with a weighted-average remaining contractual term of 3.8 years. The aggregate intrinsic value for stock
options exercisable at December 31, 2006 was $25.4 million with a weighted-average remaining contractual term of 3.3 years. At December 31, 2006, there are 10.7 million stock options that are expected to vest, in the future, with an aggregate
intrinsic value of $22.9 million and a weighted-average remaining contractual term of 3.8 years.

Company’s consolidated statement of operations at December 31, 2006:

The following table
summarizes information about stock options outstanding at December 31, 2006:

Restricted Stock
Awards:

The Company has awarded restricted stock and restricted stock units that contain time-based vesting provisions and restricted stock that contains performance-based vesting provisions to certain employees at no cost
to them, which cannot be sold, assigned, transferred or pledged during the restriction period. These awards were granted under the Company’s 2005 Incentive Plan and 2001 Incentive Plan. All restrictions on the awards will lapse upon certain
situations including death or disability of the employee and a change in control of the Company. Recipients of the restricted stock have the right to vote such shares and receive dividends.

Restricted Stock Awards (Time-based Vesting)

—Grants of restricted
stock and restricted stock units that vest through the passage of time. The fair value of the award at the time of the grant is expensed on a straight line basis primarily in selling, general and administrative expenses over the vesting period,
which is generally three years.

Restricted Stock Awards
(Performance-based Vesting)

—Grants of restricted stock that vest based on certain specified performance criteria. The fair value of the shares is expensed over the period of performance primarily in selling, general and administrative
expenses, once achievement of criteria is deemed probable.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The following table summarizes the restricted stock activity for the three years ended
December 31, 2006:

The weighted-average
grant-date fair value of restricted stock awards granted was $22.32 per share in 2006, $20.76 per share in 2005 and $20.06 per share in 2004. The total compensation recognized related to the restricted stock awards, which is a function of current
and prior year awards, was approximately $4.4 million in 2006, $5.2 million in 2005 and $2.3 million in 2004. As of December 31, 2006, there were 416,803 shares of restricted stock awards outstanding subject to forfeiture.

As of December 31, 2006, there was $7.1 million of total unrecognized
compensation cost related to nonvested restricted stock awards. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.6 fiscal years. The fair value of restricted stock awards vested was $3.4 million in 2006, $8.3 million in
2005 and $3.0 million in 2004.

Unearned compensation was
recorded in a contra-equity account and established at the date restricted stock is granted representing the amount of unrecognized restricted stock expense that is reduced as expense is recognized. Under the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), the
recognition of unearned compensation at the date restricted stock is granted is no longer required. Therefore, in the first quarter of 2006, the $6.4 million of unrecognized restricted stock that had been in “Unearned compensation” in the
consolidated balance sheet as of January 1, 2006 was reclassified to “Capital in excess of par value.”

Performance Units:

The Company’s performance unit program provides a cash award based on the achievement of specific
performance criteria. A target number of units are granted at the beginning of a three-year performance period. The number of units earned at the end of the performance period is determined by multiplying the number of units granted by a performance
factor ranging from 0% to 200%. Awards are determined by multiplying the number of units earned by the stock price at the end of the performance period, and are paid in cash. The compensation expense associated with these units is recognized over
the period that the performance targets are expected to be achieved. The Company granted 208,328, 247,197 and 198,000 performance units during 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The weighted-average grant-date fair values of performance units
granted during 2006, 2005 and 2004 were $22.74, $21.02 and $20.06, respectively. The total compensation related to these performance units, which is a function of current and prior year awards, was approximately $4.0 million, $6.2 million and $1.4
million for 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. As of December 31, 2006, there were 473,995 performance units outstanding subject to forfeiture.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan:

In April 1999, the Company’s stockholders approved the 1998 Employee Stock Purchase Plan,
whereby participating employees had the right to purchase common stock at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the closing price on the first day or the last day of the six-month offering period. In April 2005, the Compensation and Benefits
Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors voted to amend the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, effective July 1, 2005, whereby participating employees have the right to



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

purchase common stock at a price equal to 95% of the closing price on the last day of each six-month offering period. The number of shares which an employee
may purchase, subject to certain aggregate limits, is determined by the employee’s voluntary contribution, which may not exceed 10% of the employee’s base compensation. During 2006, the Company issued 0.1 million shares under this
plan at a weighted-average price of $20.43 per share. During 2005, the Company issued 0.3 million shares under this plan at a weighted-average price of $17.52 per share. During 2004, the Company issued 0.4 million shares under this plan at
a weighted-average price of $15.66 per share. There remains available for sale to employees an aggregate of 1.7 million shares of the Company’s stock out of the 5.0 million shares authorized by shareholders.

Comprehensive Income:

The components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax
were as follows:

The tax effects on the
components of other comprehensive income (loss) are minimal due to the Company’s position under APB Opinion No. 23 and the valuation allowances on the minimum pension liability. The components of other comprehensive income (loss) were as
follows:



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Cost of Shares Held In Treasury:

Effective July 1, 2004, companies incorporated in Massachusetts became
subject to the Massachusetts Business Corporation Act (“the Act”), Chapter 156D. As a result, Chapter 156D eliminates the concept of “treasury shares” and provides that shares reacquired by a company become “authorized but
unissued” shares. Accordingly, as of the effective date of the Act, the Company has redesignated its existing treasury shares, at an aggregate cost of $168.8 million, as authorized but unissued and has allocated this amount to the common stock
par value and capital in excess of par value.

Stock
Repurchase Program:

During 2006, the Company
repurchased in the open market 8.9 million shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of $190.1 million, including commissions. These repurchases were made pursuant to a stock repurchase program announced in November 2005 (the
“Program”). The repurchased shares have been reflected as additional authorized but unissued shares, with the payments reflected in common stock and capital in excess of par value. On November 6, 2006, the Company announced that its
Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to 10.0 million additional shares of common stock under a new stock repurchase program (the “New Program”). The New Program will expire on October 25, 2010 unless this
authorization is terminated earlier by the Board. The New Program may also be suspended or discontinued at any time. From January 1, 2007 through February 23, 2007, the Company repurchased 2.4 million shares of its common stock in the
open market under the New Program at an aggregate cost of $57.0 million, including commissions.

Note 20:

Financial Instruments

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash investments, marketable
securities and accounts receivable. The Company believes it had no significant concentrations of credit risk as of December 31, 2006.

In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into foreign exchange contracts for periods consistent with its committed exposures to mitigate the
effect of foreign currency movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Transactions covered by hedge contracts include intercompany and third-party receivables and payables. The contracts are primarily in European and Asian
currencies, have maturities that do not exceed 12 months, have no cash requirements until maturity, and are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet. Credit risk and market risk are insignificant as the foreign exchange instruments
are contracted with major banking institutions. Unrealized gains and losses on the Company’s foreign currency contracts are recognized immediately in earnings for hedges designated as fair value and, for hedges designated as cash flow, the
related unrealized gains or losses are deferred as a component of other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. Deferred gains and losses are recognized in income in the period in which the underlying anticipated
transaction occurs and impacts earnings. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company did not engage in any designated cash flow hedges. Principal hedged currencies include the British Pound (GBP), Canadian Dollar (CAD), Euro (EUR),
Japanese Yen (JPY), and Singapore Dollar (SGD). The Company held forward foreign exchange contracts with U.S. equivalent notional amounts totaling $174.8 million at December 31, 2006 and $197.6 million as of January 1, 2006, and the
approximate fair value of these foreign currency derivative contracts was insignificant. The gains and losses realized on foreign currency derivative contracts are not material and the duration of these contracts was generally 30 days for 2006. The
Company does not enter into derivatives for trading or other speculative purposes, nor does the Company use leveraged financial instruments.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The Company estimates the fair value of financial instruments based on interest rates available to the Company and by
comparison to quoted market prices. The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value due to the short-term maturities of these assets and liabilities.

The fair values of marketable securities included in investments have been
determined using available quoted market prices for such securities. The fair value and carrying value of the Company’s investments are disclosed in Note 12 above.

The Company’s $350.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility had an outstanding balance as of
December 31, 2006 of $151.5 million. The interest rate on the Company’s senior unsecured revolving credit facility, and prior year senior secured credit facility, are reset monthly to correspond to variable rates that reflect
currently available terms and conditions for similar debt. Consequently, the carrying value of the current year and prior year credit facilities approximate fair value.

Note 21:

Leases

The Company leases certain property and equipment under operating leases. Rental expense charged to continuing operations for 2006, 2005 and 2004 amounted
to $37.7 million, $30.6 million and $34.6 million, respectively. Minimum rental commitments under noncancelable operating leases are as follows: $31.9 million in 2007, $23.2 million in 2008, $18.0 million in 2009, $14.0 million in 2010, $11.5
million in 2011 and $119.2 million in 2012 and thereafter.

Industry Segment and Geographic Area Information

The Company follows SFAS No. 131, “

Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information

.” SFAS No. 131
establishes standards for the way public business enterprises report information about operating segments in annual financial statements and in interim reports to shareholders. The method for determining what information to report is based on the
way that management organizes the segments within the Company for making operating decisions and assessing financial performance. The Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on sales and operating profit. Intersegment sales
and transfers are not significant. Based on the guidance in SFAS No. 131, the Company has two operating segments for financial reporting purposes. The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in Note 1. The
operating segments and their principal products and services are:

•

Life and Analytical Sciences.

The Company is a leading provider of drug discovery, genetic screening and environmental and chemical analysis tools,
including instruments, reagents, consumables, and services.

•

Optoelectronics.

The Company provides a broad range of digital imaging, sensor and specialty lighting components used in biomedical, consumer products
and other specialty end markets.

Controls and Procedures

Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2006. The term “disclosure controls and procedures” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
“Exchange Act”), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a
company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in
evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2006, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as
of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial
reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the company’s
board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles and includes those policies and procedures that:

•

Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;

•

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and

•

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006. In making this assessment, our
management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework.

Based on this assessment, our management believes that, as of December 31, 2006, our internal control over financial
reporting was effective based on those criteria.

Our
independent auditors have issued an audit report on our management’s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. This report appears below.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of PerkinElmer,
Inc.

Waltham, Massachusetts

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that
PerkinElmer, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material
respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such
other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive
and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation
of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and
(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial
reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness
of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that the Company
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial
statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year



ended December 31, 2006 of the Company, and our report dated March 1, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and
