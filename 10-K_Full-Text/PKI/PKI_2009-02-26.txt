Recent Developments

As part of our strategy to grow our core businesses, we have taken the following actions:

Strategic Business Re-Alignment:

In November 2008, we announced a new alignment of our businesses effective for fiscal year 2009 that will allow us to prioritize our capabilities on two
key strategic areas – Human Health and Environmental Health. Our new Human Health segment concentrates on developing diagnostics, tools and applications to detect disease earlier and more accurately and to accelerate the discovery and
development of critical new therapies. Our new Environmental Health segment provides technologies and applications to facilitate the creation of safer products, more secure surroundings and efficient energy resources. As part of this new alignment
we placed our Photonics and Photoflash businesses from our Optoelectronics segment under strategic review and created separate plans to divest these businesses.

We reported our financial results through fiscal year 2008 using the two reporting segments of Life and Analytical Sciences and Optoelectronics.
Beginning in fiscal year 2009, we will report our financial results under the Human Health and Environmental Health segments to reflect our new business alignment.

Acquisitions:

Acquisition of Opto Technology Inc.

In January 2009, we acquired Opto Technology Inc. (“Opto Technology”), a supplier of
light-emitting diode based lighting components and subsystems. We expect this acquisition to expand our portfolio of high brightness LED components by adding optical subsystems to provide energy efficient solid state lighting solutions to original
equipment manufacturers. We paid the shareholders of Opto Technology approximately $21.0 million in cash plus a potential of $8.0 million in additional contingent consideration.

Acquisition of Arnel, Inc.

In December 2008, we acquired Arnel, Inc. (“Arnel”), a provider of custom
engineered solutions for gas chromatography applications in the petrochemical, food and beverage, and industrial hygiene markets. We expect this acquisition to expand our chromatography portfolio and strengthen our application-focused products to
better serve the biofuels and hydrocarbon processing industries. We paid the shareholders of Arnel approximately $2.0 million in cash plus potential additional contingent consideration.

Acquisition of VaConics Lighting, Inc

. In May 2008, we acquired
VaConics Lighting, Inc. (“VaConics”), a leading provider of custom and standard ceramic Xenon arc lamps. We expect this acquisition to expand our Xenon lighting technology by increasing our offerings of lamp products that include medical
endoscopes, surgical headlamps, forensic analyses, video projectors, searchlights, and infrared lighting. We paid approximately $3.9 million in cash for VaConics’ assets.

Acquisition of LabMetrix Technologies S.A.

In March 2008,
we acquired LabMetrix Technologies S.A. (“LabMetrix”), LabMetrix Technologies Ltd. and LabMetrix Technologies, Inc., a provider of metrology-based multi-vendor analytical instrument qualification solutions. We expect this acquisition to
add technology, tools, processes and compliance expertise to our suite of OneSource

®

laboratory services by strengthening our support of customers in a wide range of industries including
the pharmaceutical, medical device, food, toy and other consumer goods industries. We paid the shareholders of LabMetrix approximately $4.3 million in cash plus potential additional contingent consideration.



Acquisition of Newborn Metabolic Screening Business from Pediatrix Medical Group, Inc.

In
February 2008, we acquired Pediatrix Screening, Inc., which constituted the newborn metabolic screening business of Pediatrix Medical Group, Inc., and is now known as PerkinElmer Genetics, Inc. (“PKI Genetics”). PKI Genetics provides
neonatal screening and consultative services to hospitals, medical groups and various states. We expect this acquisition to expand our capabilities to supply state laboratories and other agencies with comprehensive newborn screening solutions. We
initially paid Pediatrix Medical Group, Inc. approximately $66.3 million in cash. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2008, we received approximately $0.3 million, from Pediatrix Medical Group, Inc. for net working capital adjustments.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008, we paid approximately $2.3 million to Pediatrix Medical Group, Inc. as additional purchase price for the election to treat the acquisition as a deemed asset sale.

We took the following actions to further strengthen our core businesses:

Restructuring:

During fiscal year 2008, we incurred $6.6 million pre-tax restructuring
charge in the Life and Analytical Sciences segment related to a workforce reduction from reorganization activities and the closure of excess facilities. We also recognized a $0.4 million pre-tax restructuring reversal in the Optoelectronics segment
related to a workforce reduction from reorganization activities. Our management approved a plan to shift resources into product lines that are more consistent with our growth strategy. The pre-tax restructuring activity associated with these plans
has been reported as restructuring expenses as a component of operating expenses from continuing operations. We expect the impact of immediate and future cost savings from these restructuring activities on operating results and cash flows to be
negligible, as we have incurred and will incur offsetting costs.

Discontinued Operations:

Photonics
and Photoflash Businesses Divesture.

In December 2008, as part of our new strategic business alignment into the Human Health and Environmental Health segments and our continued efforts to focus on higher growth opportunities, our management
approved separate plans to sell our Photonics and Photoflash businesses within our Optoelectronics segment. Our Photonics and Photoflash products and technologies include xenon flashtubes and intense pulsed light. These products are used in a
variety of applications including mobile phones and laser machine tools. We have reflected these businesses as discontinued operations for all periods presented in this annual report on Form 10-K. We are actively marketing and are currently
committed to a plan to sell both of these businesses.

Certain Instrument Businesses Shut down.

In December 2008, as part of our continued efforts to focus on higher growth opportunities, our management approved the shut down of certain instrument businesses within our Life and
Analytical Sciences segment: Cellular Screening Fluorescence and Luminescence workstations Analytical Proteomics Instruments, and Proteomics and Genomics Instruments. We have reflected these businesses as discontinued operations for all periods
presented in this annual report on Form 10-K. The Cellular Fluorescence and Luminescence workstations business included products focused on cellular imaging for kinetic and glow luminescence assays. The Analytical Proteomics Instruments
business and the Proteomics and Genomics Instruments businesses included products for bioimaging, mass spectrometers for protein identification, high resolution multi-color fluorescence gel imagers, spot detection and spot excision instruments, as
well as laser scanners for slide based microarray image analysis. We continue to serve the Cellular Screening, Proteomics and Genomics consumable and reagents markets. The shut down of the Cellular Screening Fluorescence and Luminescence
workstations business, Analytical Proteomics Instruments business, and Proteomics and Genomics Instruments business in December 2008 resulted in a $4.8 million loss related to lease and severance costs and the reduction of fixed assets and inventory
to net realizable value.

ViaCyte

SM

and Cellular Therapy Technology Businesses Shut down.

Following the ViaCell acquisition, our Board of Directors (the “Board”) approved a plan to sell the ViaCyte

SM

and Cellular Therapy
Technology businesses that were acquired with our acquisition of ViaCell, Inc., in November 2007. The ViaCyte

SM

business focused on the development
of a proprietary media intended for the cryopreservation of human unfertilized



oocytes. The Cellular Therapy Technology business focused on the development and sale of unrestricted somatic stem cell products which are derived from
umbilical cord blood. We determined that both businesses do not strategically fit with the other products offered by our Life and Analytical Sciences segment. We also determined that without investing capital into the operations of both businesses,
we could not effectively compete with larger companies that focus on the market for such products. After careful consideration, we decided in the second quarter of fiscal year 2008 to shut down the ViaCyte

SM

and Cellular Therapy Technology businesses, recording a pre-tax loss of $8.0 million for severance and facility closure costs. We have classified the results and shut down of
the ViaCyte

SM

and Cellular Therapy Technology businesses as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements. See Note 7 to our
consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional details.

As part of our strategy, we also took the following actions:

Share Repurchase Program:

On November 6, 2006, we announced that our Board authorized us to repurchase up to 10.0 million shares of common stock under a stock repurchase
program (the “Repurchase Program”). During the third quarter of fiscal year 2008, we repurchased 1.9 million shares of common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of $56.6 million, including commissions, under the Repurchase
Program. These repurchases completed the repurchase of the 10.0 million shares in the aggregate authorized under the Repurchase Program. On October 23, 2008, we announced that our Board has authorized us to repurchase up to
10.0 million additional shares of common stock under a new stock repurchase program (the “New Repurchase Program”). The New Repurchase Program will expire on October 22, 2012 unless this authorization is terminated earlier by the
Board, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. During fiscal year 2008, we repurchased approximately 1.0 million shares of our common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of $18.0 million, including commissions, under the New
Repurchase Program. From December 29, 2008 through February 20, 2009, we repurchased approximately 1.0 million shares of our common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of $14.2 million, including commissions, under the New
Repurchase Program.

Marketing

All of our businesses market their products and services directly through
their own specialized sales forces. As of December 28, 2008, we employed approximately 2,600 sales and service representatives operating in approximately 35 countries, and marketing products and services in more than 150 countries. In
geographic regions where we do not have a sales and service presence, we utilize distributors to sell our products.

Raw Materials and Supplies

Each of our businesses uses a wide variety of raw materials and supplies that are generally available from alternate sources of supply and in adequate
quantities from domestic and foreign sources. We generally have multi-year contracts, with no minimum purchase requirements, with certain of our suppliers. For certain critical raw materials and supplies required for the production of some of our
principal products, we have qualified only a limited or a single source of supply. We periodically purchase quantities of some of these critical raw materials in excess of current requirements, in anticipation of future manufacturing needs. With
sufficient lead times, we believe we would be able to qualify alternative suppliers for each of these raw materials. See further description in the applicable risk factor under “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”

Intellectual Property

We own numerous United States and foreign patents and have patent applications pending in the United States and abroad. We
also license intellectual property rights to and from third parties, some of which bear royalties and are terminable in specified circumstances. In addition to our patent portfolio, we possess a wide array of unpatented proprietary technology and
know-how. We also own numerous United States and foreign trademarks and trade names for a variety of our product names, and have applications for the registration of trademarks and trade names pending in the United States and abroad. We believe that
patents and other proprietary rights are important to the development of both of our reporting segments, but we also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain the
competitive position of both of our reporting segments. We do not believe that the loss of any one patent or other proprietary right would have a material adverse effect on our overall business or on any of our reporting segments.

In some cases, we may participate in litigation or other proceedings to
defend against or assert claims of infringement, to enforce our patents or our licensors’ patents, to protect our trade secrets, know-how or other intellectual property rights, or to determine the scope and validity of our or third
parties’ intellectual property rights. Litigation of this type could result in substantial cost to us and diversion of our resources. An adverse outcome in any litigation or proceeding could subject us to significant liabilities or expenses,
require us to cease using disputed intellectual property or cease the sale of a product, or require us to license the disputed intellectual property from third parties. We are currently involved in several lawsuits involving claims of violation of
intellectual property rights. See “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” for a discussion of these matters.



Backlog

We believe that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects for either of our business segments due to the short lead time required
on a majority of our sales. Therefore, we believe that backlog information is not material to an understanding of our business.

Competition

Due to the wide range of our products and services, we face many different types of competition and competitors. This affects our ability to sell our
products and services and the prices at which these products and services are sold. Our competitors range from large foreign and domestic organizations, which produce a comprehensive array of goods and services and that may have greater financial
and other resources, to small firms producing a limited number of goods or services for specialized market segments.

In our Life and Analytical Sciences segment, we compete on the basis of service level, price, technological innovation, product differentiation, product
availability, quality and reliability. Competitors range from multinational organizations with a wide range of products to specialized firms that in some cases have well-established market niches. We expect the proportion of large competitors in
this reporting segment to increase through the continued consolidation of competitors.

We do not believe any single competitor competes directly with our Optoelectronics segment across its full product range. However, we do compete with specialized manufacturing companies in the manufacturing and sale
of specialty flashtubes for industrial applications and ultra specialty lighting sources, photo detectors and photodiodes, and switched power supplies. Competition is based on price, technological innovation, operational efficiency, and product
reliability and quality.

We believe we compete effectively in
each of the areas in which our businesses experience competition.

Research
and Development

Research and development expenditures
were approximately $108.1 million during fiscal year 2008, approximately $105.5 million during fiscal year 2007, and approximately $93.4 million during fiscal year 2006. The fiscal year 2007 amount included an in-process research and development
(“IPR&D”) charge of $1.5 million related to the acquisitions of Evotec Technologies GmbH and Euroscreen Products, S.A. in January 2007.

We directed our research and development efforts in fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006 primarily toward genetic screening, bio-discovery, and analytical
sciences markets within our Life and Analytical Sciences segment, and medical imaging and photonics markets within our Optoelectronics segment, in order to help accelerate our growth initiatives. We expect to continue our strong investments in
research and development to drive growth during fiscal year 2009, and to continue to emphasize the genetic screening, bio-discovery, and medical imaging markets within our Human Health segment, and the analytical sciences market within our
Environmental Health segment.

Environmental Matters

Our operations are subject to various foreign, federal, state and local
environmental and safety laws and regulations. These requirements include those governing emissions and discharges of hazardous substances, the remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater, the regulation of radioactive materials, and the health
and safety of our employees.

We may have liability under the
Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act and comparable state statutes that impose liability for investigation and remediation of contamination without regard to fault, in connection with materials that we or our former
businesses sent to various third-party sites. We have incurred, and expect to incur, costs pursuant to these statutes.



We are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at our current and former
locations and, along with other companies, have been named a potentially responsible party (“PRP”) for certain waste disposal sites. We accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period that our responsibility is established and
when the cost can be reasonably estimated. We have accrued $4.0 million as of December 28, 2008, which represents our management’s estimate of the total cost of ultimate disposition of known environmental matters. This amount is not
discounted and does not reflect the recovery of any amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements. These cost estimates are subject to a number of variables, including the stage of the environmental investigations, the magnitude of the
possible contamination, the nature of the potential remedies, possible joint and several liability, the time period over which remediation may occur, and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations. For sites where we have been named a
PRP, our management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute. We expect that the majority of such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to
ten years. As assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site, these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available. There have been no environmental problems to date that have
had or are expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. While it is possible that a loss exceeding the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may be incurred, the
potential exposure is not expected to be materially different from those amounts recorded.

In addition, we accrued $9.7 million during fiscal year 2007 for a fire that occurred within our Life and Analytical Sciences facility in Boston, Massachusetts in March 2005, representing our management’s
estimate of the total cost for decommissioning the building, including environmental matters. We paid $1.6 million during fiscal year 2008 and $3.9 million during fiscal year 2007 towards decommissioning the building. We anticipate that the
remaining payments of $4.2 million will be completed by the third quarter of fiscal year 2009.

We may become subject to new or unforeseen environmental costs or liabilities. Compliance with new or more stringent laws or regulations, stricter interpretations of existing laws, or the discovery of new
contamination could cause us to incur additional costs.

Employees

As of December 28, 2008, we employed approximately
7,900 employees in continuing operations. Several of our subsidiaries are parties to contracts with labor unions and workers’ councils. As of December 28, 2008, we employed an aggregate of approximately 1,000 union and workers’
council employees. We consider our relations with employees to be satisfactory.

Financial Information About Reporting Segments

The assets and expenses for our corporate headquarters, such as legal, tax, accounting and finance, human resources, property and insurance management, information technology, treasury and other management and compliance costs, have been
included as “Corporate” below. We have a process to allocate and recharge expenses to the reportable segments when such costs are administered or paid by the corporate headquarters based on the extent to which the segment benefited from
the expenses. These amounts have been calculated in a consistent manner and are included in our calculations of segment results to internally plan and assess the performance of each segment for all purposes, including determining the compensation of
the business leaders for each of our operating segments.



The table below sets forth sales and operating income (loss) by reporting segment for the 2008, 2007 and
2006 fiscal years:

Discontinued
operations have not been included in the preceding table.

Additional information relating to our reporting segments for the 2008, 2007 and 2006 fiscal years is as follows:

Financial Information About Geographic Areas

Both of our reporting segments conduct business in, and derive substantial revenue from, various countries outside the United States. During fiscal year
2008, we had $1,185.1 million in sales from our international operations, representing approximately 60% of our total sales. During fiscal year 2008, we derived



approximately 80% of our international sales from our Life and Analytical Sciences segment, and approximately 20% of our international sales from our
Optoelectronics segment. We anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total sales in the future.

We are exposed to the risks associated with international operations, including exchange rate fluctuations, regional and
country-specific political and economic conditions, foreign receivables collection concerns, trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements, tax risks, staffing and labor law concerns, intellectual property protection risks,
and differing regulatory requirements. Additional geographic information is discussed in Note 23 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors

The following important factors affect our business and operations generally
or affect multiple segments of our business and operations:

If the markets into which we sell our products decline, or do not grow as anticipated due to a decline in general economic conditions or uncertainties surrounding the approval of government or industrial funding proposals, we may see
an adverse effect on the results of our business operations.

Our customers include pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, laboratories, academic and research institutions, public health authorities, private healthcare organizations, doctors and government agencies. Our quarterly sales and
results of operations are highly dependent on the volume and timing of orders received during the quarter. In addition, our revenues and earnings forecasts for future quarters are often based on the expected trends in our markets. However, the
markets we serve do not always experience the trends that we may expect. Negative fluctuations in our customers’ markets, the inability of our customers to secure credit or funding, general economic conditions or cuts in government funding
would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and services. In addition, government funding is subject to economic conditions and the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable. Our revenues may be adversely
affected if our customers delay or reduce purchases as a result of uncertainties surrounding the approval of government or industrial funding proposals. Such declines could harm our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows
and trading price of our common stock, and could limit our ability to sustain profitability.

Our growth is subject to global economic, political and other risks.

We have operations in many parts of the world. The health of the global economy has a significant impact on our business. For example, the current
tightening of credit in the financial markets may make it more difficult for customers to obtain financing for their operations, resulting in a material decrease in the orders we receive. Our business is also affected by local economic environments,
including inflation, recession, financial liquidity and currency volatility or devaluation. Political changes, some of which may be disruptive, could interfere with our supply chain, our customers and all of our activities in a particular location.
In addition, our global manufacturing facilities face risks to their production capacity that may relate to natural disasters, labor relations or regulatory compliance. While some of these risks can be hedged using financial instruments and some are
insurable, such attempts to mitigate these risks are costly and not always successful. In addition, our ability to engage in such mitigation has decreased or become even more costly as a result of recent market developments.

If we do not introduce new products in a timely manner, we may lose
market share and be unable to achieve revenue growth targets.

We sell many of our products in industries characterized by rapid technological change, frequent new product and service introductions, and evolving customer needs and industry standards. Many of the businesses competing with us in these
industries have significant financial and other resources to invest in new technologies, substantial intellectual property portfolios, substantial experience in new product development, regulatory



expertise, manufacturing capabilities, and the distribution channels to deliver products to customers. Our products could become technologically obsolete
over time, or we may invest in technology that does not lead to revenue growth, or continue to sell products for which the demand from our customers is declining, in which case we may lose market share or not achieve our revenue growth targets. The
success of our new product offerings will depend upon several factors, including our ability to:

•

accurately anticipate customer needs,

•

innovate and develop new technologies and applications,

•

successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner,

•

price our products competitively, and manufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes and on time, and

•

differentiate our offerings from our competitors’ offerings.

Many of our products are used by our customers to develop, test and manufacture their products. We must anticipate industry trends and
consistently develop new products to meet our customers’ expectations. In developing new products, we may be required to make significant investments before we can determine the commercial viability of the new product. If we fail to accurately
foresee our customers’ needs and future activities, we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant sales. We may also suffer a loss in market share and potential sales revenue if we are unable to
commercialize our technology in a timely and efficient manner.

In addition, some of our licensed technology is subject to contractual restrictions, which may limit our ability to develop or commercialize products for some applications.

We may not be able to successfully execute acquisitions or license technologies, integrate acquired businesses or
licensed technologies into our existing businesses, or make acquired businesses or licensed technologies profitable.

We have in the past supplemented, and may in the future supplement, our internal growth by acquiring businesses and licensing technologies that complement
or augment our existing product lines, such as ViaCell, Inc., acquired in November 2007, the Newborn Metabolic Screening Business from Pediatrix Medical Group, Inc., acquired in February 2008, LabMetrix Technologies S.A., acquired in March 2008,
VaConics Lighting, Inc., acquired in May 2008, and Arnel, Inc., acquired in December 2008. However, we may be unable to identify or complete promising acquisitions or license transactions for many reasons, including:

•

competition among buyers and licensees,

•

the high valuations of businesses and technologies,

•

the need for regulatory and other approval, and

•

our inability to raise capital to fund these acquisitions.

Some of the businesses we may seek to acquire may be unprofitable or marginally profitable. Accordingly, the earnings or
losses of acquired businesses may dilute our earnings. For these acquired businesses to achieve acceptable levels of profitability, we would have to improve their management, operations, products and market penetration. We may not be successful in
this regard and may encounter other difficulties in integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations, such as incompatible management, information or other systems, cultural differences or difficulties in predicting financial results. As
a result, our financial results may differ from our forecasts or the expectations of the investment community in a given quarter or over the long term.

To finance our acquisitions, we may have to raise additional funds, either through public or private financings. We may be unable to obtain such funds or
may be able to do so only on terms unacceptable to us. We may also incur expenses in evaluating possible acquisitions that we ultimately do not acquire, which expenses then may adversely impact our profitability.



We may not be
successful in adequately protecting our intellectual property.

Patent and trade secret protection is important to us because developing new products, processes and technologies gives us a competitive advantage, although it is time-consuming and expensive. We own many United States and foreign patents
and intend to apply for additional patents. Patent applications we file, however, may not result in issued patents or, if they do, the claims allowed in the patents may be narrower than what is needed to protect fully our products, processes and
technologies. Similarly, applications to register our trademarks may not be granted in all countries in which they are filed. For our intellectual property that is protected by keeping it secret, such as trade secrets and know-how, we may not use
adequate measures to protect this intellectual property.

Third
parties may also challenge the validity of our issued patents, may circumvent or “design around” our patents and patent applications, or may claim that our products, processes or technologies infringe their patents. In addition, third
parties may assert that our product names infringe their trademarks. We may incur significant expense in legal proceedings to protect our intellectual property against infringement by third parties or to defend against claims of infringement by
third parties. Claims by third parties in pending or future lawsuits could result in awards of substantial damages against us or court orders that could effectively prevent us from manufacturing, using, importing or selling our products in the
United States or other countries.

If we are unable to
renew our licenses or otherwise lose our licensed rights, we may have to stop selling products or we may lose competitive advantage.

We may not be able to renew our existing licenses, or licenses we may obtain in the future, on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we lose the rights to
a patented or other proprietary technology, we may need to stop selling products incorporating that technology and possibly other products, redesign our products or lose a competitive advantage. Potential competitors could in-license technologies
that we fail to license and potentially erode our market share.

Our licenses typically subject us to various economic and commercialization obligations. If we fail to comply with these obligations, we could lose important rights under a license, such as the right to exclusivity in a market. In some
cases, we could lose all rights under the license. In addition, rights granted under the license could be lost for reasons out of our control. For example, the licensor could lose patent protection for a number of reasons, including invalidity of
the licensed patent, or a third-party could obtain a patent that curtails our freedom to operate under one or more licenses.

If we do not compete effectively, our business will be harmed.

We encounter aggressive competition from numerous competitors in many areas of our business. We may not be able to compete
effectively with all of these competitors. To remain competitive, we must develop new products and periodically enhance our existing products. We anticipate that we may also have to adjust the prices of many of our products to stay competitive. In
addition, new competitors, technologies or market trends may emerge to threaten or reduce the value of entire product lines.

Our quarterly operating results could be subject to significant fluctuation, and we may not be able to adjust our operations to effectively address
changes we do not anticipate, which could increase the volatility of our stock price and potentially cause losses to our shareholders.

Given the nature of the markets in which we participate, we cannot reliably predict future sales and profitability. Changes in competitive, market and
economic conditions may require us to adjust our operations, and we may not be able to make those adjustments or make them quickly enough to adapt to changing conditions. A high proportion of our costs are fixed, due in part to our research and
development and manufacturing costs. Thus, small declines in sales could disproportionately affect our operating results in a quarter. Factors that may affect our quarterly operating results include:

•

demand for and market acceptance of our products,



•

competitive pressures resulting in lower selling prices,

•

adverse changes in the level of economic activity in regions in which we do business,

•

decline in general economic conditions or government funding,

•

adverse income tax audit settlements,

•

differing tax laws and changes in those laws, or changes in the countries in which we are subject to tax,

•

adverse changes in industries, such as pharmaceutical and biomedical,

•

changes in the portions of our sales represented by our various products and customers,

•

delays or problems in the introduction of new products,

•

our competitors’ announcement or introduction of new products, services or technological innovations,

•

increased costs of raw materials, energy or supplies, and

•

changes in the volume or timing of product orders.

A significant disruption in third-party package delivery and import/export services, or significant increases in prices for those services, could
interfere with our ability to ship products, increase our costs and lower our profitability.

We ship a significant portion of our products to our customers through independent package delivery and import/export companies, including UPS and Federal
Express in the United States, TNT, UPS and DHL in Europe and UPS in Asia. We also ship our products through other carriers, including national trucking firms, overnight carrier services and the U.S. Postal Service. If one or more of the package
delivery or import/export providers experiences a significant disruption in services or institutes a significant price increase, the delivery of our products could be prevented or delayed. Such events could cause us to incur increased shipping costs
that could not be passed on to our customers, negatively impacting our profitability and our relationships with certain of our customers.

Disruptions in the supply of raw materials, certain key components, and supplies from our limited or single source suppliers could have an adverse
effect on the results of our business operations, and could damage our relationships with customers.

The production of our products requires a wide variety of raw materials, key components and supplies that are generally available from alternate sources
of supply. However, certain critical raw materials, key components and supplies required for the production of some of our principal products are available from limited or single sources of supply. We generally have multi-year contracts with no
minimum purchase requirements with these suppliers, but those contracts may not fully protect us from a failure by certain suppliers to supply critical materials or from the delays inherent in being required to change suppliers and, in some cases,
validate new raw materials. Such raw materials, key components and supplies could usually be obtained from alternative sources with the potential for an increase in price, decline in quality or delay in delivery. A prolonged inability to obtain
certain raw materials, key components or supplies is possible and could have an adverse effect on our business operations, and could damage our relationships with customers.

The manufacture and sale of products may expose us to product liability claims for which we could have substantial
liability.

We face an inherent business risk of
exposure to product liability claims if our products or product candidates are alleged or found to have caused injury, damage or loss. We may in the future be unable to obtain insurance with adequate levels of coverage for potential liability on
acceptable terms or claims of this nature may be excluded from coverage under the terms of any insurance policy that we can obtain. If we are unable to obtain such insurance or the amounts of any claims successfully brought against us substantially
exceed our coverage, then our business could be adversely impacted.



If we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with the regulations of the United States Food and
Drug Administration and other governmental agencies, we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution, and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties.

Some of the products produced by our Life and Analytical Sciences segment
are subject to regulation by the United States Food and Drug Administration and similar agencies internationally. These regulations govern a wide variety of product activities, from design and development to labeling, manufacturing, promotion,
sales, resales and distribution. If we fail to comply with those regulations or those of similar international agencies, we may have to recall products, cease their manufacture and distribution, and may be subject to fines or criminal prosecution.
Other aspects of our operations are subject to regulation by different government agencies in the United States and other countries. If we fail to comply with those regulations, we could be subject to fines, penalties, criminal prosecution or other
sanctions.

Changes in governmental regulations may
reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses.

We compete in markets in which we or our customers must comply with federal, state, local and foreign regulations, such as environmental, health and safety, and food and drug regulations. We develop, configure and market our products to
meet customer needs created by these regulations. Any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our costs of producing these products.

The healthcare industry is highly regulated and if we fail to comply with its extensive system of laws and
regulations, we could suffer fines and penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations which could have a significant adverse effect on the results of our business operations.

The healthcare industry, including the genetic screening market, is subject
to extensive and frequently changing international and United States federal, state and local laws and regulations. In addition, legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse, patient privacy violations and misconduct involving
government insurance programs provide federal enforcement personnel with substantial powers and remedies to pursue suspected violations. We believe that our business will continue to be subject to increasing regulation as the federal government
continues to strengthen its position on healthcare matters, the scope and effect of which we cannot predict. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could suffer civil and criminal damages, fines and penalties, exclusion from
participation in governmental healthcare programs, and the loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business, as well as incur liabilities from third-party claims, all of which could have a significant
adverse effect on our business.

Economic, political and
other risks associated with foreign operations could adversely affect our international sales and profitability.

Because we sell our products worldwide, our businesses are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. Our sales originating outside
the United States represented the majority of our total sales in the fiscal year ended December 28, 2008. We anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total sales. In addition,
many of our manufacturing facilities, employees and suppliers are located outside the United States. Accordingly, our future results of operations could be harmed by a variety of factors, including:

•

changes in foreign currency exchange rates,

•

changes in a country’s or region’s political or economic conditions, particularly in developing or emerging markets,

•

longer payment cycles of foreign customers and timing of collections in foreign jurisdictions,

•

trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements,

•

differing tax laws and changes in those laws, or changes in the countries in which we are subject to tax,

•

adverse income tax audit settlements or loss of previously negotiated tax incentives,



•

differing business practices associated with foreign operations,

•

difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations,

•

differing labor laws and changes in those laws,

•

differing protection of intellectual property and changes in that protection, and

•

differing regulatory requirements and changes in those requirements.

If we do not retain our key personnel, our ability to execute our business strategy will be limited.

Our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of
our executive officers and key management and technical personnel, particularly our experienced engineers, and on our ability to continue to attract, retain, and motivate qualified personnel. The competition for these employees is intense. The loss
of the services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. In addition, there could be a material adverse effect on us should the turnover rates for engineers and other key personnel increase
significantly or if we are unable to continue to attract qualified personnel. We do not maintain any key person life insurance policies on any of our officers or employees.

Our success also depends on our ability to execute leadership succession plans. The inability to successfully transition key
management roles could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.

If we experience a significant disruption in our information technology systems or if we fail to implement new systems and software successfully, our business could be adversely affected.

We rely on several centralized information systems throughout our company to
keep financial records, process orders, manage inventory, process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions. If we were to experience a prolonged system disruption in the information technology systems that involve our interactions
with customers and suppliers, it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs, which could adversely affect our business.

Restrictions in our credit facility and outstanding debt instruments may limit our activities.

Our amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility and our 6% senior
unsecured notes contain, and future debt instruments to which we may become subject may contain, restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit our company. These debt instruments include
restrictions on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to:

•

pay dividends on, redeem or repurchase our capital stock,

•

sell assets,

•

incur obligations that restrict their ability to make dividend or other payments to us,

•

guarantee or secure indebtedness,

•

enter into transactions with affiliates, and

•

consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.

We are also required to meet specified financial ratios under the terms of
our debt instruments. Our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance, which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors, including factors that are beyond our control
such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates, changes in technology and changes in the level of competition.



Our failure to comply with any of these restrictions in our amended senior unsecured revolving credit
facility and our 6% senior unsecured notes may result in an event of default under either or both of these debt instruments, which could permit acceleration of the debt under either or both debt instruments, and require us to prepay that debt before
its scheduled due date.

Our results of operations will
be adversely affected if we fail to realize the full value of our intangible assets.

As of December 28, 2008, our total assets included $1.8 billion of net intangible assets. Net intangible assets consist principally of goodwill associated with acquisitions and costs associated with securing
patent rights, trademark rights and technology licenses, net of accumulated amortization. We test certain of these items—specifically all of those that are considered “non-amortizing”—at least on an annual basis for potential
impairment by comparing the carrying value to the fair market value of the reporting unit to which they are assigned. All of our amortizing intangible assets are evaluated for impairment should discrete events occur that call into question the
recoverability of the intangible assets.

Adverse changes in
our business or the failure to grow our Life and Analytical Sciences segment may result in impairment of our intangible assets, which could adversely affect our results of operations.

Our share price will fluctuate.

Over the last several quarters, stock markets in general and our common stock in particular have experienced significant price and volume
volatility. Both the market price and the daily trading volume of our common stock may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations due not only to general stock market conditions but also to a change in sentiment in the market regarding our
operations and business prospects. In addition to the risk factors discussed above, the price and volume volatility of our common stock may be affected by:

•

Properties

As of December 28, 2008, our continuing
operations occupied approximately 2,643,000 square feet in over 110 locations. We own approximately 615,000 square feet of this space, and lease the balance. We conduct our operations in manufacturing and assembly plants, research laboratories,
administrative offices and other facilities located in 11 states and 34 foreign countries.



Facilities outside of the United States account for approximately 1,312,000 square feet of our owned and
leased property, or approximately 50% of our total occupied space.

Our real property leases are both short-term and long-term. We believe that our properties are well-maintained and are adequate for our present requirements.

The following table indicates, as of December 28, 2008, the approximate square footage of real property owned and
leased attributable to the continuing operations of both of our reporting segments:

Legal Proceedings

Enzo Biochem, Inc. and Enzo Life Sciences, Inc. (collectively, “Enzo”) filed a complaint dated October 23, 2002 in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York, Civil Action No. 02-8448, against Amersham plc, Amersham BioSciences, PerkinElmer, Inc., PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Inc., Sigma-Aldrich Corporation, Sigma Chemical Company, Inc., Molecular
Probes, Inc., and Orchid BioSciences, Inc. The complaint alleges that we have breached our distributorship and settlement agreements with Enzo, infringed Enzo’s patents, engaged in unfair competition and fraud, and committed torts against Enzo
by, among other things, engaging in commercial development and exploitation of Enzo’s patented products and technology, separately and together with the other defendants. Enzo seeks injunctive and monetary relief. In 2003, the court severed the
lawsuit and ordered Enzo to serve individual complaints against the five defendants. We subsequently filed an answer and a counterclaim alleging that Enzo’s patents are invalid. In July 2006, the court issued a decision regarding the
construction of the claims in Enzo’s patents that effectively limited the coverage of certain of those claims and, we believe, excludes certain of our products from the coverage of Enzo’s patents. Summary judgment motions were filed by the
defendants in January 2007, and a hearing with oral argument on those motions took place in July 2007, but a decision on those motions has not been rendered, and a trial date has not been set.

PharmaStem Therapeutics, Inc. (“PharmaStem”) filed a complaint
dated February 22, 2002 against ViaCell, Inc., which is now our wholly owned subsidiary, and several other defendants in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, alleging infringement of United States Patents
No. 5,004,681 and No. 5,192,553, relating to certain aspects of the collection, cryopreservation and storage of hematopoietic stem cells and progenitor cells from umbilical cord blood (“PharmaStem I”). After several years of
proceedings at the District Court level, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit issued a decision in July 2007 that ViaCell did not infringe these two patents and that the two patents are invalid. PharmaStem filed a certiorari
petition in January 2008 seeking to have the United States Supreme Court review the appellate court’s decision as to the invalidity of the patents, but did not seek any further review of the non-infringement decision. However, the United States
Supreme Court denied certiorari in March 2008, so the decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in favor of ViaCell is final and non-appealable. PharmaStem had also filed a second complaint against ViaCell and other
defendants in July 2004 in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, alleging infringement of United States Patents No. 6,461,645 and 6,569,427, which also relate to certain aspects of the collection, cryopreservation
and storage of hematopoietic stem cells and progenitor cells from umbilical cord blood (“PharmaStem II”). The Delaware court granted ViaCell’s motion in October 2005 to stay the proceedings in PharmaStem II pending the outcome of
PharmaStem I and a decision from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“U.S. PTO”) on certain patent re-examination issues. On September 2, 2008, the U.S. PTO issued a Re-examination Certificate cancelling all claims of
United States



Patent No. 6,461,645, and on September 16, 2008, the U.S. PTO issued a Re-examination Certificate cancelling all claims of United States Patent
No. 6,569,427. As a result of the cancellation of all patent claims involved in PharmaStem II by the U.S. PTO, we will seek a dismissal of all claims for relief set forth by PharmaStem in PharmaStem II.

We believe we have meritorious defenses to these lawsuits and other
proceedings, and we are contesting the actions vigorously in all of the above unresolved matters. While each these matters is subject to uncertainty, in the opinion of our management, based on its review of the information available at this time,
the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.

We are also subject to various other claims, legal proceedings and investigations covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of
our business activities. Although, we have established accruals for potential losses that we believe are probable and reasonably estimable, in the opinion of our management, based on its review of the information available at this time, the total
cost of resolving these other contingencies at December 28, 2008 should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K. Each of these matters is subject to uncertainties,
and it is possible that some of these matters may be resolved unfavorably to us.

Selected Financial Data

The following table sets forth selected historical
financial information as of and for each of the fiscal years in the five-year period ended December 28, 2008. We derived the selected historical financial information as of and for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended
December 28, 2008 from our audited consolidated financial statements which are included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. We derived the selected historical financial information as of and for the fiscal years ended January 1,
2006 and January 2, 2005 from our audited consolidated financial statements which are not included in this annual report on Form 10-K. As with our financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 30, 2007 and December 31,
2006, we adjusted the information in the financial statements for the fiscal years ended January 1, 2006 and January 2, 2005, where appropriate, to account for our discontinued operations.

Our historical financial information may not be indicative of our results of
operations or financial position in the future.

You should
read the following selected historical financial information together with our “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and our consolidated financial statements, including the related
notes, included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.



(1)

We adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 123(R),

“Share-Based Payment

” (“SFAS No. 123(R)”), on
January 2, 2006. The total incremental pre-tax compensation expense related to stock options was $10.4 million in fiscal year 2008 and $9.2 million in each of the fiscal years 2007 and 2006.

(2)

We incurred pre-tax restructuring and lease charges (reversals), net, of $6.2 million in fiscal year 2008, $12.2 million in fiscal year 2007, ($3.6) million in fiscal year 2006, and
$22.1 million in fiscal year 2005.

(3)

We settled an insurance claim resulting from a fire that occurred in one of our facilities in March 2005. As a result of that settlement, we recorded pre-tax gains of $15.3 million
in fiscal year 2007.

(4)

In fiscal year 2005, we incurred $54.9 million in fees associated with the extinguishment of our senior subordinated 8


/8% notes due 2013 offset by gains on the sales of investments of $5.8 million.

(5)

In fiscal year 2007, we entered into forward interest rate contracts with notional amounts totaling $300.0 million and a weighted average interest rate of 4.25%. These contracts
were intended to hedge movements in interest rates prior to our expected debt issuance. Before amortization expense, we had accumulated derivative losses in other comprehensive (loss) income of $8.4 million, net of taxes of $5.4 million, as of
December 28, 2008 and $5.3 million, net of taxes of $3.5 million, as of December 30, 2007, related to these cash flow hedges. During fiscal year 2008, we discontinued forward interest rate contracts with notional amounts totaling $150.0
million. The discontinued cash flow hedges were immediately settled with counterparties, and the $17.5 million of accumulated derivative losses were recognized as interest and other expense, net.

(6)

In fiscal year 2008, interest expense was $25.2 million due to higher outstanding debt balances with the issuance of our 6% senior unsecured notes that primarily related to the
purchase of ViaCell, which was partially offset by lower interest rates on our amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility.

(7)

The fiscal year 2008 effective tax rate on continuing operations of 14.4% was largely due to a $15.6 million benefit related to the settlement of various income tax audits.

(8)

The fiscal year 2007 effective tax rate on continuing operations of 11.1% was largely due to a $18.6 million benefit related to the settlement of an income tax audit.

(9)

The fiscal year 2005 effective tax rate on continuing operations of (4.3%) was largely due to a $27.5 million benefit related to the settlement of federal, state and foreign
income tax audits and an additional accrual of $15.5 million related to the homeland investment provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.

(10)

In fiscal year 2008, our Board approved separate plans to sell our Photonics and Photoflash businesses and shut down our ViaCyte and Cellular Therapy Technology businesses,
Cellular Screening Products, Proteomics and Genomics Instruments businesses. We recognized a pre-tax loss of $12.8 million related to lease and severance costs and the reduction of fixed assets and inventory to net realizable value.

(11)

In fiscal year 2006, we sold substantially all of the assets of the Semiconductor business of our Fluid Sciences segment for approximately $26.5 million, subject to a net working
capital adjustment, plus potential additional contingent consideration. We recognized a pre-tax gain of $3.8 million, exclusive of additional contingent consideration.

(12)

In fiscal year 2005, we sold the Aerospace and Fluid Testing businesses of our Fluid Sciences segment for a net pre-tax gain of $280.9 million. Net pre-tax losses of $8.5 million
related to the sale of the Lithography Business and Fiber Optic Test Equipment Business, both included in our Optoelectronics segment, were partially offset by other pre-tax gains of $1.4 million that related to multiple discontinued operations.



(13)

In fiscal year 2007, we completed the tender offer for all of the outstanding shares of common stock of ViaCell. Aggregate consideration for this transaction was approximately
$295.8 million in cash, which excludes $31.8 million in acquired cash. In connection with this acquisition, we entered into a $300.0 million unsecured interim credit facility to pay the purchase price and transactional expenses of this acquisition.
This unsecured interim credit facility matured on March 31, 2008, at which point we paid in full the outstanding balance on the unsecured interim credit facility. The source of funds for the repayment was comprised of our on-hand cash and cash
equivalents, and borrowings under our amended and restated senior unsecured revolving credit facility. We classified the $300.0 million of outstanding borrowings on the unsecured interim credit facility as long-term debt in fiscal year 2007.

(14)

In May 2008, we issued and sold seven-year senior notes at a rate of 6% with a face value of $150.0 million and received $150.0 million in gross proceeds from the
issuance. The debt, which matures in May 2015, is unsecured.

(15)

In fiscal year 2006, we adopted Statement of SFAS No. 158,

“Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB
Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)”

(“SFAS No. 158”). The impact of adopting SFAS No. 158 was a reduction to accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income of $32.7 million, a reduction to other assets of $26.6
million, an increase to current liabilities of $7.3 million, an increase to current assets of $0.7 million and a reduction to long-term liabilities of $0.4 million, with no impact to our consolidated statements of operations or consolidated
statements of cash flows.

(16)

In fiscal year 2007, we adopted FASB Interpretation (“FIN”) No. 48,

“Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes”

(“FIN No. 48”). The
impact of adopting FIN No. 48 was an increase to retained earnings of $3.6 million and a reduction to accrued liabilities of $3.6 million, with no impact to our consolidated statements of operations or statements of cash flows.

(17)

In fiscal year 2008, we repurchased in the open market approximately 3.0 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $75.5 million, including commissions. In
fiscal year 2007, we repurchased in the open market approximately 8.1 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $203.0 million, including commissions. In fiscal year 2006, we repurchased in the open market approximately
8.9 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $190.1 million, including commissions. The repurchased shares have been reflected as additional authorized but unissued shares, with the payments reflected in common stock and
capital in excess of par value. These repurchases were made pursuant to our stock repurchase programs announced in October 2008, November 2006 and November 2005.

Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations

This annual
report on Form 10-K, including the following management’s discussion and analysis, contains forward-looking information that you should read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial
statements that we have included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. For this purpose, any statements contained in this report that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. Words such as
“believes,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “expects,” “will” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from the plans, intentions
or expectations we disclose in the forward-looking statements we make. We have included important factors above under the heading “Risk Factors” in Item 1A above that we believe could cause actual results to differ materially from the
forward-looking statements we make. We are not obligated to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.



Overview

We are a leading provider of technology, services and solutions to the diagnostics, academic research, environmental monitoring and safety and security
markets. We design, manufacture, market and service components, systems and products in two reporting segments:

•

Life and Analytical Sciences.

We are a leading provider of analysis tools, including instruments, reagents, software, and consumables, to the analytical
sciences, genetic screening, bio-discovery and laboratory services markets.

•

Optoelectronics.

We provide a broad range of medical imaging, optical sensor and specialty lighting components used in medical, consumer products and other
specialty end markets.

We recently announced
a new alignment of our businesses effective for fiscal year 2009 that will allow us to prioritize our capabilities on two key strategic areas – Human Health and Environmental Health. Our new Human Health segment concentrates on developing
diagnostics, tools and applications to detect disease earlier and more accurately and to accelerate the discovery and development of critical new therapies. The Human Health segment includes our products and services that address the genetic
screening and bio-discovery markets, formerly in our Life and Analytical Sciences segment, and our technology serving the medical imaging market, formerly in our Optoelectronics segment. Our new Environmental Health segment provides technologies and
applications to facilitate the creation of safer products, more secure surroundings and efficient energy resources. The Environmental Health segment includes our products and services that address the analytical sciences and laboratory service and
support markets, formerly in our Life and Analytical Sciences segment, and our technology designed for the sensors and lighting markets, formerly in our Optoelectronics segment.

Accounting Period

Our fiscal year ends on the Sunday nearest December 31. We report fiscal years under a 52/53 week format. Under this method, certain years will
contain 53 weeks. The fiscal years ended December 28, 2008, December 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006 each included 52 weeks. The fiscal year ended January 3, 2010 will include 53 weeks.

Consolidated Results of Continuing Operations

Sales

2008 Compared to 2007.

Sales for fiscal year 2008 were $1,937.5
million, as compared to $1,702.4 million for fiscal year 2007, an increase of $235.1 million, or 14%, which includes an approximate 2% increase in sales attributable to favorable changes in foreign exchange rates and an approximate 4% increase from
acquisitions. The analysis in the remainder of this paragraph compares segment sales for fiscal year 2008 as compared to fiscal year 2007 and includes the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions. The total increase in sales
reflects a $197.0 million, or 15%, increase in our Life and Analytical Sciences segment sales, due to increases in sales to genetic screening customers of $91.0 million, sales to analytical sciences customers of $36.9 million, sales to laboratory
service customers of $36.8 million, and sales to bio-discovery customers of $32.5 million. Our Optoelectronics segment sales grew $38.1 million, or 10%, primarily due to increases in sales of our medical imaging products of $24.6 million, specialty
lighting products of $7.2 million, and optical sensors of $5.4 million.

2007 Compared to 2006.

Sales for fiscal year 2007 were $1,702.4 million, as compared to $1,477.7 million for fiscal year 2006, an increase of $224.7 million, or 15%. Changes in foreign exchange and acquisitions each contributed
approximately 4% to the increase in revenue for fiscal year 2007, as compared to fiscal year 2006. The analysis in the remainder of this paragraph compares segment sales for fiscal year 2007 as compared to fiscal year 2006 and includes the effect of
foreign exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions. The total increase in sales reflects a $186.4 million, or 17%, increase in our Life and Analytical Sciences segment sales, due to increases in



sales to laboratory service customers of $51.3 million, sales to analytical sciences customers of $51.2 million, sales to genetic screening customers of
$49.1 million, and sales to bio-discovery customers of $34.9 million. Our Optoelectronics segment sales grew $38.3 million, or 11%, primarily due to increases in sales of our medical imaging products of $29.3 million, specialty lighting products of
$4.1 million, and optical sensors of $4.8 million.

Cost
of Sales

2008 Compared to 2007.

Cost of sales for fiscal year 2008 was $1,107.4 million, as compared to $996.4 million for fiscal year 2007, an increase of approximately $111.0 million, or 11%. As a percentage of
sales, cost of sales decreased to 57.2% in fiscal year 2008 from 58.5% in fiscal year 2007, resulting in an increase in gross margin of 137 basis points to 42.8% in fiscal year 2008 from 41.5% in fiscal year 2007. Amortization of intangible assets
increased due to the acquisitions completed in fiscal years 2008 and 2007 and was $37.4 million for fiscal year 2008 as compared to $34.4 million for fiscal year 2007. The amortization of purchase accounting adjustments to record the inventory
from certain acquisitions completed in fiscal year 2007 was approximately $2.5 million for fiscal year 2007. Stock option expense was $1.7 million and $1.2 million for fiscal years 2008 and 2007, respectively. The combined favorable impact of
increased sales volume, productivity improvements, and growth in higher gross margin products such as ViaCord

®

increased gross margin; however, this increase was partially offset by
increased freight costs.

2007 Compared to
2006.

Cost of sales for fiscal year 2007 was $996.4 million, as compared to $868.9 million for fiscal year 2006, an increase of approximately $127.4 million, or 15%. As a percentage of sales, cost of sales decreased to 58.5% in fiscal year
2007 from 58.8% in fiscal year 2006, resulting in an increase in gross margin of 27 basis points to 41.5% in fiscal year 2007 from 41.2% in fiscal year 2006. Amortization of intangible assets increased due to the acquisitions completed in fiscal
years 2007 and 2006 and was $34.4 million for fiscal year 2007 as compared to $29.2 million for fiscal year 2006. The amortization of purchase accounting adjustments to record the inventory from certain acquisitions completed in fiscal year
2007 was approximately $2.5 million for fiscal year 2007. Stock option expense was $1.2 million and $1.3 million for fiscal years 2007 and 2006, respectively. The combined impact of net productivity and capacity improvements within both segments
increased gross margin, which was partially offset by pressures in our laboratory services business as a result of entering into several large new contracts requiring an increase in start-up investment in the first six months of fiscal year 2007.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

2008 Compared to 2007.

Selling, general and
administrative expenses for fiscal year 2008 were $522.9 million as compared to $439.8 million for fiscal year 2007, an increase of approximately $83.1 million, or 19%. As a percentage of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses were
27.0% in fiscal year 2008, compared to 25.8% in fiscal year 2007, an increase of 1.2%. Amortization of intangible assets was $16.1 million for fiscal year 2008 as compared to $7.9 million for fiscal year 2007. Stock option expense was $8.2 million
and $7.3 million for fiscal years 2008 and 2007, respectively. This increase was primarily the result of increased sales and marketing expenses to support recent acquisitions, particularly the acquisition of ViaCell, increased employee-related
expenses to support our sales initiatives, and foreign exchange.

2007 Compared to 2006.

Selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal year 2007 were $439.8 million as compared to $370.5 million for fiscal year 2006, an increase of approximately $69.3 million, or 19%. As a
percentage of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses were 25.8% in fiscal year 2007, compared to 25.1% in fiscal year 2006, an increase of 0.7%. Amortization of intangible assets was $7.9 million for fiscal year 2007 as compared to $3.0
million for fiscal year 2006. Stock option expense was $7.3 million and $7.2 million for fiscal years 2007 and 2006, respectively. This increase was primarily the result of increased headcount and employee-related expenses to support our sales
initiatives, increased sales and marketing expenses to support recent acquisitions, business development expenses, and foreign exchange.



Research and Development Expenses

2008 Compared to 2007.

Research and development expenses for
fiscal year 2008 were $108.1 million, as compared to $104.0 million for fiscal year 2007, an increase of $4.1 million, or 4%. As a percentage of sales, research and development expenses decreased to 5.6% in fiscal year 2008 from 6.1% in fiscal year
2007. Amortization of intangible assets was $2.1 million for fiscal year 2008 as compared to $1.7 million for fiscal year 2007. Research and development expenses also included stock option expense of $0.6 million each for fiscal years 2008 and 2007.
We directed research and development efforts similarly during fiscal years 2008 and 2007, primarily toward genetic screening, bio-discovery, and analytical sciences markets within our Life and Analytical Sciences segment, and medical imaging and
photonics markets within our Optoelectronics segment, in order to help accelerate our growth initiatives.

2007 Compared to 2006.

Research and development expenses for fiscal year 2007 were $104.0 million, as compared to $93.4 million for fiscal
year 2006, an increase of $10.5 million, or 11%. As a percentage of sales, research and development expenses decreased to 6.1% in fiscal year 2007 from 6.3% in fiscal year 2006. Amortization of intangible assets was $1.7 million for fiscal year 2007
as compared to $1.6 million for fiscal year 2006. Research and development expenses also included stock option expense of $0.6 million and $0.7 million for fiscal years 2007 and 2006, respectively. We directed our research and development efforts
similarly during fiscal years 2007 and 2006, primarily toward genetic screening, bio-discovery, and analytical sciences markets within our Life and Analytical Sciences segment, and medical imaging and photonics markets within our Optoelectronics
segment, in order to help accelerate our growth initiatives.

Restructuring and Lease Charges (Reversals), Net

We have undertaken a series of restructuring actions related to the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and the integration of our business units. Restructuring actions were recorded in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 146,

“Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities”

(“SFAS No. 146”). Restructuring and lease charges, net, for fiscal year 2008 were a
$6.2 million charge, as compared to a $12.2 million charge for fiscal year 2007.

The following table summarizes our restructuring accrual balances and related activity by restructuring plan during fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006:



The purpose of the restructuring plans approved in the third quarter of fiscal year 2008 and fourth
quarter of fiscal year 2007, detailed below, was principally to shift resources into geographic regions and product lines that are more consistent with our growth strategy. The pre-tax restructuring activities associated with these plans have been
reported as restructuring expenses as a component of operating expenses from continuing operations. We expect the impact of immediate and future cost savings from these restructuring activities on operating results and cash flows to be negligible,
as we have incurred and will incur offsetting costs.

Q3 2008 Plan

During the third quarter of
fiscal year 2008, our management approved a plan to shift resources into product lines that are more consistent with our growth strategy (the “Q3 2008 Plan”). As a result of the Q3 2008 Plan, we recognized a $7.5 million pre-tax
restructuring charge in our Life and Analytical Sciences segment related to a workforce reduction from reorganization activities and the closure of excess facilities. We also recognized a $0.3 million pre-tax restructuring charge in our
Optoelectronics segment related to a workforce reduction from reorganization activities.

As part of our Q3 2008 Plan, we reduced headcount by 107 employees. All actions related to the Q3 2008 Plan were completed by September 28, 2008. All employees have been severed and we anticipate that the
remaining payments of $2.7 million for workforce reductions will be completed by the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010. We also anticipate that the remaining payments of $1.2 million for the closure of the excess facilities will be paid
through fiscal year 2011, in accordance with the terms of the applicable leases.

The following table summarizes the components of the Q3 2008 Plan activity recognized by segment:

Q4
2007 Plan

During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007,
our management approved a plan to shift resources into geographic regions and product lines that are more consistent with our growth strategy (the “Q4 2007 Plan”). As a result of the Q4 2007 Plan, we recognized a $4.8 million pre-tax
restructuring charge in our Life and Analytical Sciences segment related to a workforce reduction from these reorganization activities. We also recognized a $0.5 million pre-tax restructuring charge in our Optoelectronics segment related to a
workforce reduction.

As part of our Q4 2007 Plan, we reduced
headcount by 90 employees. All actions related to the Q4 2007 Plan were completed by December 30, 2007. During fiscal year 2008, we recorded a reversal of $0.3 million primarily due to lower than expected employee separation costs associated
with our Life and Analytical Sciences segment. All employees have been severed and we anticipate that the remaining payments of $0.6 million for workforce reductions will be completed by the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009.

ViaCell Plan

Following the ViaCell acquisition, we committed to a preliminary plan of integration of certain ViaCell activities that
included workforce reductions and the partial closure of an excess facility (the “ViaCell Plan”). We finalized the integration plan and all actions related to this plan as of June 29, 2008, through which we recorded a $1.9 million
liability for severance and the partial closure of an excess facility with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) Issue No. 95-3,

“Recognition of Liabilities in Connection
with a Purchase Business Combination”

(“EITF 95-3”). As part of our ViaCell Plan, we reduced headcount by 11 employees. All employees have been severed and we anticipate that the remaining payments of approximately $0.2 million
for workforce reductions will be completed by the end of the second quarter of fiscal year 2009.

Previous Restructuring and Integration Plans

The principal actions of the restructuring and integration plans from the fiscal years 2001 through the first quarter of fiscal year 2007 were workforce reductions related to the integration of our Life Sciences and Analytical Instruments
businesses, which is now our Life and Analytical Sciences segment, in order to reduce costs and achieve operational efficiencies as well as workforce reductions in both our Life and Analytical Sciences and Optoelectronics segments by shifting
resources into geographic regions and product lines that are more consistent with our growth strategy. During fiscal year 2008, we paid $0.8 million related to these plans and recorded a reversal of $1.0 million related to lower than expected costs
associated with severance for several of these plans. As of December 28, 2008, we had approximately $1.3 million of remaining liabilities associated with restructuring and integration plans, primarily relating to remaining lease obligations
related to those closed facilities in our Life and Analytical Sciences segment. The remaining terms of these leases vary in length and will be paid through fiscal year 2011.

Lease Charges

To facilitate the sale of a business in fiscal year 2001, we were required to guarantee the obligations that the buyer of
the business assumed related to the lease for the building in which the business operates. The lease obligations continue through March 2011. While we assigned our interest in the lease to the buyer at the time of the sale of the business, in the
event the buyer defaults under the lease, we are responsible for all remaining lease payments and certain other building related expenses. As an additional measure to facilitate the sale of the business, we obtained a letter of credit as partial
security for a loan to the buyer, which could have been drawn upon by the buyer’s lender in the event the buyer was delinquent in repayment of the loan. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2007, the lessor of the building began the process
to evict the buyer as a result of unpaid lease payments and building expenses and sought reimbursement from us. As a result of this action, we recorded a charge of $4.5 million related to payments for this lease obligation and the potential drawdown
of the letter of credit. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2007, the buyer completed a recapitalization of the business with another lender. The proceeds of the recapitalization were used to pay off the remaining balance on the original
securitized loan, as well as to make certain payments to the landlord for back rent and other obligations arising under the lease. We were also released from our obligation under the letter of credit on the original securitized loan. As a result of
these actions, we recorded a reversal of $1.4 million related to payments for this lease obligation and the release of the letter of credit in the third quarter of fiscal year 2007. The buyer made its required payments for lease obligations and
building expenses through June 2008 and as a result, we recorded an additional reversal of $0.4 million.



The buyer filed for bankruptcy protection on October 27, 2008 and was delinquent in making both its
lease payments and payments for certain building expenses in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2008, requiring us to make payments of $0.4 million during fiscal year 2008 and $0.4 million to date in fiscal year 2009. As of
December 28, 2008, we are still responsible for the remaining accrual of $2.4 million, which relates to the remaining lease and building obligations through March 2011, reduced by estimated sublease rentals reasonably expected to be obtained
for the property.

Gains on Settlement of Insurance Claim

2008 Compared to 2007.

During the second
quarter of fiscal year 2007 we settled an insurance claim resulting from a fire that occurred within our Life and Analytical Sciences facility in Boston, Massachusetts in March 2005. As a result of that settlement, we recorded gains of $15.3 million
during the second quarter of fiscal year 2007. We received the final settlement payment of $21.5 million in June 2007, and had previously received during fiscal years 2005 and 2006 a total of $35.0 million in advance payments towards costs incurred,
and for building, inventory and equipment damages. Of the $56.5 million in total settlement proceeds received by us, $25.6 million related to reimbursement of costs incurred; $23.7 million related to damages to the building, inventory and equipment;
and $7.2 million related to business interruption costs which were recorded as reductions to cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses. We accrued $9.7 million representing our management’s estimate of the total cost for
decommissioning the building, including environmental matters. We paid $1.6 million during fiscal year 2008 and $3.9 million during fiscal year 2007 towards decommissioning the building. We anticipate that the remaining payments of $4.2 million will
be completed by the third quarter of fiscal year 2009.

Compared to 2006.

There were no gains on settlement of insurance claim in fiscal year 2006.

Impairment of Assets

2008 Compared to 2007.

Impairment of assets was zero in fiscal years 2008 and 2007.

2007 Compared to 2006.

Impairment of assets was zero in fiscal
year 2007 and $3.2 million in fiscal year 2006. The fiscal year 2006 impairment was recorded within the Life and Analytical Sciences segment, which included a $2.8 million loss related to a manufacturing facility and a $0.4 million loss on
impairment of a license agreement.

Gains on Dispositions

2008 Compared to 2007.

There were no
dispositions in fiscal years 2008 and 2007.

2007 Compared
to 2006.

There were no dispositions in fiscal year 2007 and dispositions resulted in a gain of $1.5 million in fiscal year 2006. Gains on dispositions in fiscal year 2006 included a $0.6 million gain from an insurance reimbursement due to
fire damage in a certain manufacturing facility and a $0.9 million gain on disposal of certain fixed assets.

In-process Research and Development Charge

2008 Compared to 2007.

We did not have an in-process research and development (“IPR&D”) charge in fiscal year 2008. The
IPR&D charge for fiscal year 2007 was $1.5 million, which related to the acquisitions of Evotec Technologies GmbH and Euroscreen Products S.A. in January 2007. In determining the value of the in-process projects, we considered, among other
factors, the in-process projects’ stage of completion, the complexity of the work completed as of the acquisition date, the costs already incurred, the projected costs to complete, the contribution of core technologies and other acquired
assets, the expected introduction date, and the estimated useful life of the technology. We utilized the discounted cash flow method to value the IPR&D, using a discount rate equivalent to the relative risk of the asset, including the
uncertainty of technological feasibility and successful launch. This approach determines fair value by estimating the after-tax cash flows attributable to an



in-process project over its useful life, and then discounting these after-tax cash flows back to a present value. We believe that the estimated purchased
research and development amounts so determined, represent the fair value of each project at the acquisition date, and the amount represents management’s best estimate of the amount a third party would pay for the projects.

2007 Compared to 2006

. We did not have an IPR&D charge in fiscal
year 2006.

Interest and Other Expense, Net

Interest and other expense, net consisted of the
following:

2008 Compared to
2007.

Interest and other expense, net for fiscal year 2008 was $45.6 million, as compared to $16.9 million for fiscal year 2007, an increase of $28.7 million. The increase in interest and other expense, net, in fiscal year 2008 as compared
to fiscal year 2007 was primarily due to the discontinuance and settlement of forward interest rate contracts with $17.5 million of accumulated derivative losses which were recognized into interest expense and higher outstanding debt balances,
primarily related to the purchase of ViaCell, which was partially offset by lower interest rates on those outstanding debt balances. Interest income decreased $0.7 million as a result of lower interest rates, which were partially offset by higher
cash balances. Other expenses for fiscal year 2008 as compared to fiscal year 2007 increased by $1.2 million, and consisted primarily of expenses related to foreign currency translation. A more complete discussion of our liquidity is set forth below
under the heading “Liquidity and Capital Resources.”

2007 Compared to 2006.

Interest and other expense, net for fiscal year 2007 was $16.9 million, as compared to $2.7 million for fiscal year 2006, an increase of $14.2 million. The increase in interest and other expense, net, in
fiscal year 2007 as compared to fiscal year 2006 was primarily due to the higher outstanding debt balances, as well as lower outstanding cash balances. Interest income decreased $4.7 million due to lower overall cash balances, and interest expense
increased $6.2 million due to higher outstanding debt balances. We also recognized a net gain on dispositions of investments of $0.7 million associated with the dissolution of certain investments. Other expenses for fiscal years 2007 and 2006
increased by $1.7 million, and consisted primarily of expenses related to foreign currency translation and business development related costs.

Provision for Income Taxes

2008 Compared to 2007.

The fiscal year 2008 provision for income taxes from continuing operations was $21.2 million, as compared to a
provision of $16.3 million for fiscal year 2007. The effective tax rate from continuing operations was 14.4% for fiscal year 2008 as compared to 11.1% for fiscal year 2007. The higher effective tax rate in fiscal year 2008 was primarily due to the
favorable settlement of an income tax audit in fiscal year 2007.

In October 2008, the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2008 (the “2008 Tax Act”) was enacted. The 2008 Tax Act retroactively restored the expired research and experimental tax credit provisions of the law from December 31,
2007, and extended the credit through December 31, 2009. As a result of the 2008 Tax Act, we recorded a benefit for the research and experimental tax credit in fiscal year 2008 in the amount of $0.8 million.



2007 Compared to 2006.

The fiscal year 2007 provision for income taxes from continuing
operations was $16.3 million, as compared to a provision of $30.2 million for fiscal year 2006. The effective tax rate from continuing operations was 11.1% for fiscal year 2007 as compared to 20.9% for fiscal year 2006. The lower effective tax rate
in fiscal year 2007 was primarily due to the favorable settlement of an income tax audit partially offset by (i) the non-deductible IPR&D charge of $1.5 million recorded in fiscal year 2007; (ii) the discrete accrual of interest
expense as a result of the adoption of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation (“FIN”) No. 48 in fiscal year 2007; (iii) the accrual of U.S. taxes on the $15.3 million gains on the settlement of
an insurance claim for fiscal year 2007; and (iv) changes in our forecasted geographic distribution of earnings.

In December 2006, the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 (the “2006 Tax Act”) was enacted. The 2006 Tax Act retroactively restored the
expired research and experimental tax credit provisions of the law from December 31, 2006, and extended the credit through December 31, 2007. As a result of the 2006 Tax Act, we recorded a benefit for the research and experimental tax
credit in fiscal year 2006 in the amount of $1.6 million.

Discontinued
Operations

As part of our continued efforts to focus on
higher growth opportunities, we have discontinued certain businesses. We have accounted for these businesses as discontinued operations in accordance with SFAS No. 144, “

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets,

” and, accordingly, have presented the results of operations and related cash flows as discontinued operations for all periods presented. The assets and liabilities of these businesses have been presented separately and are reflected
within the assets and liabilities from discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 28, 2008 and December 30, 2007.

We recorded the following gains and losses, which have been reported as the (loss) gain on disposition of discontinued operations during
the three years ended:

As part of the new
strategic business alignment into the Human Health and Environmental Health segments and our continued efforts to focus on higher growth opportunities, in December 2008 our management approved separate plans to divest our Photonics and Photoflash
businesses within our Optoelectronics segment. Our Photonics and Photoflash products and technologies include xenon flashtubes and intense pulsed light. These products are used in a variety of applications including mobile phones and laser machine
tools. We are actively marketing and are currently committed to a plan to sell both of these businesses.

In addition, during December 2008, our management approved the shut down of certain instrument businesses within our Life and Analytical Sciences segment:
Cellular Screening Fluorescence and Luminescence workstations, Analytical Proteomics Instruments, and Proteomics and Genomics Instruments. The Cellular Fluorescence and Luminescence workstations business included products focused on cellular imaging
for kinetic



and glow luminescence assays. The Analytical Proteomics Instruments business and the Proteomics and Genomics Instruments businesses included products for
bioimaging, mass spectrometers for protein identification, high resolution multi-color fluorescence gel imagers, spot detection and spot excision instruments, as well as laser scanners for slide based microarray image analysis. We continue to serve
the Cellular Screening, Proteomics and Genomics consumable and reagents markets. The shut down of the Cellular Screening Fluorescence and Luminescence workstations business, Analytical Proteomics Instruments business, and Proteomics and Genomics
Instruments business in December 2008 resulted in a $4.8 million loss related to lease and severance costs and the reduction of fixed assets and inventory to net realizable value.

Following the ViaCell acquisition, our Board approved a plan to sell
the ViaCyte

SM

and Cellular Therapy Technology businesses that were acquired with ViaCell. The ViaCyte

SM

business focused on the development of a proprietary media intended for the cryopreservation of human unfertilized oocytes. The Cellular Therapy Technology business focused on
the development and sale of unrestricted somatic stem cell products which are derived from umbilical cord blood. We determined that both businesses do not strategically fit with the other products offered by our Life and Analytical Sciences segment.
We also determined that without investing capital into the operations of both businesses, we could not effectively compete with larger companies that focus on the market for such products. After careful consideration, we decided in the second
quarter of fiscal year 2008 to shut down the ViaCyte

SM

and Cellular Therapy Technology businesses, recording a pre-tax loss of $8.0 million for
severance and facility closure costs.

During the third quarter
of fiscal year 2008, we settled various income tax audits worldwide for years ranging from 1998 through 2005 as discussed in Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K. The closing of these audits
resulted in the recognition of $8.5 million of income tax benefits in discontinued operations.

During fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006, we settled various commitments related to the divestiture of other discontinued operations and recognized a pre-tax loss of $0.4 million in fiscal year 2008, a pre-tax loss of
$1.0 million in fiscal year 2007 and a pre-tax gain of $3.3 million in fiscal year 2006. During fiscal years 2007 and 2006, we substantially completed the remediation of an environmental matter within the Lithography business, resulting in
recognition of pre-tax losses of $0.7 million in fiscal year 2007 and $1.7 million in fiscal year 2006. In February 2006, we sold substantially all of the assets of our Semiconductor business for approximately $26.5 million, subject to a net working
capital adjustment, plus potential additional contingent consideration. A pre-tax gain of $3.8 million, exclusive of additional contingent consideration, was recognized in fiscal year 2006.

Summary operating results of the discontinued operations for the periods
prior to disposition were as follows:



Acquisitions

Acquisition of Opto Technology Inc.

In January 2009, we acquired the outstanding stock of Opto Technology Inc. (“Opto Technology”).
Opto Technology is a supplier of light-emitting diode based lighting components and subsystems. We expect this acquisition to expand our portfolio of high brightness LED components by adding optical subsystems to provide energy efficient solid state
lighting solutions to original equipment manufacturers. We paid the shareholders of Opto Technology approximately $21.0 million in cash for this transaction plus a potential of $8.0 million in additional contingent consideration. The excess of
the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets will be allocated to goodwill, none of which will be tax deductible. We expect to report the operations for this acquisition within the results of our Environmental Health segment
from the acquisition date.

Acquisition of Arnel,
Inc.

In December 2008, we acquired the outstanding stock of Arnel, Inc. (“Arnel”). Arnel provides custom engineered solutions for gas chromatography applications in the petrochemical, food and beverage, and industrial hygiene
markets. We expect this acquisition to expand our chromatography portfolio and strengthen our application-focused products to better serve the biofuels and hydrocarbon processing industries. We paid the shareholders of Arnel approximately
$2.0 million in cash for this transaction plus potential additional contingent consideration, which we expect to be immaterial to us. We determined that $0.5 million of the contingent consideration was probable and recorded the accrual at the
date of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets has been allocated to goodwill, none of which is tax deductible. We report the operations for this acquisition within the results of our Life and
Analytical Sciences segment from the acquisition date.

Acquisition of VaConics Lighting, Inc

. In May 2008, we acquired specified assets and assumed specified liabilities of VaConics Lighting, Inc. (“VaConics”), a leading provider of custom and standard ceramic Xenon arc
lamps. We expect this acquisition to expand our Xenon lighting technology by increasing our offerings of lamp products that include medical endoscopes, surgical headlamps, forensic analyses, video projectors, searchlights, and infrared lighting. We
paid approximately $3.9 million in cash for this transaction. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2008, we paid VaConics approximately $0.1 million of additional consideration for net working capital adjustments. The excess of the purchase
price over the fair value of the acquired net assets has been allocated to goodwill, all of which is tax deductible. We report the operations for this acquisition within the results of our Optoelectronics segment from the acquisition date.

Acquisition of LabMetrix Technologies S.A.

In March 2008, we acquired all of the stock of LabMetrix Technologies S.A. (“LabMetrix”) and acquired specified assets and assumed specified liabilities of LabMetrix
Technologies Ltd. and LabMetrix Technologies, Inc., a provider of metrology-based multi-vendor analytical instrument qualification solutions. We expect this acquisition to add technology, tools, processes and compliance expertise to our suite of
OneSource

®

laboratory services by strengthening our support of customers in a wide range of industries including the pharmaceutical, medical device, food, toy and other consumer goods
industries. We paid the shareholders of LabMetrix approximately $4.3 million in cash for this transaction plus potential additional contingent consideration. We determined that $1.9 million of the contingent consideration was probable and recorded
the accrual at the date of acquisition. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2008, we received approximately $0.1 million from the former shareholders of LabMetrix for net working capital adjustments. The excess of the purchase price over the
fair value of the acquired net assets has been allocated to goodwill. None of the goodwill related to the LabMetrix acquisition is tax deductible and all of the goodwill related to the LabMetrix Technologies Ltd. and LabMetrix Technologies, Inc.
acquisitions is tax deductible. We report the operations for this acquisition within the results of our Life and Analytical Sciences segment from the acquisition date.

Acquisition of Newborn Metabolic Screening Business from Pediatrix Medical Group, Inc.

In February 2008, we acquired the
outstanding stock of Pediatrix Screening, Inc., which constituted the newborn metabolic screening business of Pediatrix Medical Group, Inc., and is now known as PerkinElmer Genetics, Inc. (“PKI Genetics”). PKI Genetics provides neonatal
screening and consultative services to hospitals, medical groups and



various states. We expect this acquisition to expand our capabilities to supply state laboratories and other agencies with comprehensive newborn screening
solutions. We initially paid Pediatrix Medical Group, Inc. approximately $66.3 million in cash for this transaction. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2008, we received approximately $0.3 million from Pediatrix Medical Group, Inc. for
net working capital adjustments. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008, we paid approximately $2.3 million to Pediatrix Medical Group, Inc. as additional purchase price for the election to treat the acquisition as a deemed asset sale. The
excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets has been allocated to goodwill, all of which is tax deductible. We report the operations for this acquisition within the results of our Life and Analytical Sciences segment
from the acquisition date.

Acquisition of ViaCell, Inc.

In November 2007, we completed a tender offer for all of the outstanding shares of common stock of ViaCell, Inc. (“ViaCell”), at a price of $7.25 per share. ViaCell
specializes in the collection, testing, processing and preservation of umbilical cord blood stem cells. The addition of ViaCell’s ViaCord

®

product offering for the preservation of
umbilical cord blood, and its sales and marketing organization, has facilitated the expansion of our neonatal and prenatal businesses. We paid approximately $295.8 million in cash in the aggregate for this transaction, which excludes $31.8 million
in acquired cash. In January 2009, we received approximately $1.8 million for the majority of the unclaimed shares of ViaCell. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets has been allocated to goodwill, none of
which is tax deductible. We report the operations for this acquisition within the results of our Life and Analytical Sciences segment from the acquisition date.

Following the ViaCell acquisition, we committed to a preliminary plan of integration of certain ViaCell activities that included workforce reductions
and the partial closure of an excess facility. We finalized the integration plan and all actions related to this plan as of June 29, 2008, through which we recorded a $1.9 million liability for severance and the partial closure of an excess
facility with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill in accordance with EITF No. 95-3.

Following the ViaCell acquisition, our Board approved a plan to sell the ViaCyte

SM

and Cellular Therapy Technology businesses that were acquired with ViaCell. The ViaCyte

SM

business focused on the development of a proprietary media intended for the cryopreservation of human unfertilized oocytes. The Cellular Therapy Technology business focused on
the development and sale of unrestricted somatic stem cell products which are derived from umbilical cord blood. We determined that both businesses did not strategically fit with the other products offered by our Life and Analytical Sciences
segment. We also determined that without investing capital into the operations of both businesses, we could not effectively compete with larger companies that focus on the market for such products. After careful consideration, we decided in the
second quarter of fiscal year 2008 to close the ViaCyte

SM

and Cellular Therapy Technology businesses, recording a pre-tax loss of $8.0 million
for severance and facility closure costs. We have classified the results and closure of the ViaCyte

SM

and Cellular Therapy Technology
businesses as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional details.

Various Intangible Assets and Investments.

In fiscal year 2007,
we acquired various licenses, other intangible assets and investments for aggregate consideration of approximately $8.8 million in cash. Included in this amount are a customer list for reagents for approximately $4.8 million and a call option for
approximately $1.2 million to purchase the assets and liabilities of a company, each purchased during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007. In addition, we entered into various long-term license agreements during fiscal year 2007 for approximately
$2.8 million. Purchased intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives based upon the economic value. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional details.

Remaining minority interest of PerkinElmer India Pvt.
Ltd.

In June 2007, we acquired the remaining minority interest in PerkinElmer India Pvt. Ltd. (“PKI India”), a direct sales, service and marketing operation targeting India’s life science and analytical instrumentation
markets, from Labindia Instruments Pvt. Ltd. The acquisition establishes PKI India as our wholly owned subsidiary. We paid approximately $1.3 million in cash



for this transaction plus potential additional consideration of approximately $0.7 million, of which we paid $0.2 million during the fiscal year 2007. We
paid the remaining $0.5 million during the first quarter of fiscal year 2008. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets has been allocated to goodwill, none of which is tax deductible. We report the operations
for this acquisition within the results of our Life and Analytical Sciences segment from the acquisition date.

Improvision Ltd.

In March 2007, we acquired the stock of Improvision Ltd. (“Improvision”), a leading provider of cellular imaging
software and integrated hardware solutions used in life sciences research. We expect that the addition of Improvision’s imaging and analysis software to our high content screening systems will provide customers with powerful imaging solutions
for analyzing cellular events, from real-time imaging of live cells to rapid high content screening of multiple samples. We paid approximately $23.6 million in cash for this transaction plus potential additional contingent consideration, which we
expect to be immaterial to us. During fiscal year 2007, we paid $0.6 million for net working capital adjustments. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets has been allocated to goodwill, none of which is tax
deductible. We report the operations for this acquisition within the results of our Life and Analytical Sciences segment from the acquisition date.

Euroscreen Products S.A.

In January 2007, we acquired the stock of Euroscreen Products S.A. (“Euroscreen”), a developer of the
AequoScreen™ cellular assay platform. The AequoScreen™ platform from Euroscreen is based on an innovative luminescence technology that generates higher quality data, while reducing the number of false positives in G protein-coupled
receptor (“GPCR”) screening applications. We paid approximately $18.1 million in cash for this transaction. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets has been allocated to goodwill, none of which is
tax deductible. We report the operations for this acquisition within the results of our Life and Analytical Sciences segment from the acquisition date.

Evotec Technologies GmbH

. In January 2007, we acquired the stock of Evotec Technologies GmbH (“Evotec”). The acquisition is intended
to allow us to provide our customers in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and academic arenas with Evotec’s high content screening instruments and software. These analysis tools determine the composition of cells and cell structure, a critical
step in moving potential drug targets quickly through the discovery process. We paid approximately $33.0 million in cash for this transaction, which was paid in fiscal year 2006. During fiscal year 2007, we received $1.2 million for net working
capital adjustments. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets has been allocated to goodwill, none of which is tax deductible. We report the operations for this acquisition within the results of our Life and
Analytical Sciences segment from the acquisition date.

The
acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. Allocation of the purchase price for the acquisitions was based on estimates of the fair value of the net assets acquired, and is subject to adjustment upon finalization of the
purchase price allocation. The fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on management’s estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including
valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. We record the excess purchase price over those assigned values as goodwill. In accordance with SFAS No. 142,

“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”

(“SFAS No. 142”), goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment. Purchased intangibles with finite lives will be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements
included in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional details.

IPR&D charges represent incomplete acquired research and development projects that have not reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future use as of the acquisition date. Technological feasibility is established when
an enterprise has completed all planning, designing, coding, and testing activities that are necessary to establish that a product can be produced to meet its design specifications including functions, features, and technical performance
requirements. On the date of the acquisitions of Evotec and Euroscreen, there were multiple IPR&D efforts underway at each company for certain current and future product lines. In



determining the value of in-process projects, we consider, among other factors, the in-process projects’ stage of completion, the complexity of the work
completed as of the acquisition date, the costs already incurred, the projected costs to complete, the contribution of core technologies and other acquired assets, the expected introduction date, and the estimated useful life of the technology. For
these acquisitions, we utilized the discounted cash flow method to value the IPR&D, using a discount rate equivalent to the relative risk of the asset, including the uncertainty of technological feasibility and successful launch. This approach
determines fair value by estimating the after-tax cash flows attributable to an in-process project over its useful life, and then discounting these after-tax cash flows back to a present value. For the acquisitions of Evotec and Euroscreen, we
estimated the value of the IPR&D to be $0.2 million and $1.3 million, respectively. We believe that the estimated purchased research and development amounts so determined, represent the fair value at the date of the acquisitions, and the amount
represents management’s best estimate of the amount a third party would pay in the aggregate for the projects. The fair value of acquired IPR&D costs was expensed as of the acquisition date as the projects underway at Evotec and Euroscreen
had not reached technological feasibility and were determined to have no alternative future use.

In connection with the purchase price and related allocations for acquisitions, we estimate the fair value of deferred revenue assumed with our
acquisitions. The estimated fair value of deferred revenue is determined by the legal performance obligation at the date of acquisition, and is generally based on the nature of the activities to be performed and the related costs to be incurred
after consummation. The fair value of an assumed liability related to deferred revenue is estimated based on the current market cost of fulfilling the obligation, plus a normal profit margin thereon. The estimated costs to fulfill the deferred
revenue are based on the historical direct costs related to providing the services. We do not include any costs associated with selling efforts, research and development, or the related fulfillment margins on these costs. In most acquisitions,
profit associated with selling effort is excluded because the acquired entities would have concluded the selling efforts on the support contracts prior to the acquisition date. The estimated research and development costs are not included in the
fair value determination, as these costs are not deemed to represent a legal obligation at the time of acquisition. The sum of the costs and operating income approximates, in theory, the amount that we would be required to pay a third-party to
assume the obligation. As a result of purchase accounting, we recognized the deferred revenue related to the ViaCell acquisition at fair value, and did not recognize $18.1 million of deferred revenue that would have been otherwise recognized in
future periods.

As of December 28, 2008, all purchase
price and related allocations are final with the exception of the Arnel acquisition which was preliminary as of December 28, 2008. The Arnel purchase price and related allocations may be revised as a result of adjustments made to the purchase
price, as well as additional information regarding assets and liabilities assumed, including contingent liabilities, deferred taxes, and revisions of preliminary estimates of fair values made at the date of purchase. We are not aware of any
information that indicates the final purchase price allocation will differ materially from the preliminary estimates, and we expect to complete any outstanding asset valuations no later than one year from the date of acquisition.

Contingencies, Including Tax Matters

We are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial
actions at our current and former locations and, along with other companies, have been named a potentially responsible party (“PRP”) for certain waste disposal sites. We accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period that our
responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated. We have accrued $4.0 million as of December 28, 2008, which represents our management’s estimate of the total cost of ultimate disposition of known environmental
matters. This amount is not discounted and does not reflect the recovery of any amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements. These cost estimates are subject to a number of variables, including the stage of the environmental
investigations, the magnitude of the possible contamination, the nature of the potential remedies, possible joint and several liability, the time period over which remediation may occur, and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations. For
sites where we have been named a PRP, our management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant



named parties to contribute. We expect that the majority of such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to ten years. As assessment and
remediation activities progress at each individual site, these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available. There have been no environmental problems to date that have had or are expected to have a
material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. While it is possible that a loss exceeding the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may be incurred, the potential exposure is not expected
to be materially different from those amounts recorded.

Enzo
Biochem, Inc. and Enzo Life Sciences, Inc. (collectively, “Enzo”) filed a complaint dated October 23, 2002 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Civil Action No. 02-8448, against Amersham plc,
Amersham BioSciences, PerkinElmer, Inc., PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Inc., Sigma-Aldrich Corporation, Sigma Chemical Company, Inc., Molecular Probes, Inc., and Orchid BioSciences, Inc. The complaint alleges that we have breached our distributorship
and settlement agreements with Enzo, infringed Enzo’s patents, engaged in unfair competition and fraud, and committed torts against Enzo by, among other things, engaging in commercial development and exploitation of Enzo’s patented
products and technology, separately and together with the other defendants. Enzo seeks injunctive and monetary relief. In 2003, the court severed the lawsuit and ordered Enzo to serve individual complaints against the five defendants. We
subsequently filed an answer and a counterclaim alleging that Enzo’s patents are invalid. In July 2006, the court issued a decision regarding the construction of the claims in Enzo’s patents that effectively limited the coverage of certain
of those claims and, we believe, excludes certain of our products from the coverage of Enzo’s patents. Summary judgment motions were filed by the defendants in January 2007, and a hearing with oral argument on those motions took place in July
2007, but a decision on those motions has not been rendered, and a trial date has not been set.

PharmaStem Therapeutics, Inc. (“PharmaStem”) filed a complaint dated February 22, 2002 against ViaCell, Inc., which is now our wholly owned
subsidiary, and several other defendants in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, alleging infringement of United States Patents No. 5,004,681 and No. 5,192,553, relating to certain aspects of the collection,
cryopreservation and storage of hematopoietic stem cells and progenitor cells from umbilical cord blood (“PharmaStem I”). After several years of proceedings at the District Court level, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit issued a decision in July 2007 that ViaCell did not infringe these two patents and that the two patents are invalid. PharmaStem filed a certiorari petition in January 2008 seeking to have the United States Supreme Court review the appellate
court’s decision as to the invalidity of the patents, but did not seek any further review of the non-infringement decision. However, the United States Supreme Court denied certiorari in March 2008, so the decision by the United States Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit in favor of ViaCell is final and non-appealable. PharmaStem had also filed a second complaint against ViaCell and other defendants in July 2004 in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts,
alleging infringement of United States Patents No. 6,461,645 and 6,569,427, which also relate to certain aspects of the collection, cryopreservation and storage of hematopoietic stem cells and progenitor cells from umbilical cord blood
(“PharmaStem II”). The Delaware court granted ViaCell’s motion in October 2005 to stay the proceedings in PharmaStem II pending the outcome of PharmaStem I and a decision from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“U.S.
PTO”) on certain patent re-examination issues. On September 2, 2008, the U.S. PTO issued a Re-examination Certificate cancelling all claims of United States Patent No. 6,461,645, and on September 16, 2008, the U.S. PTO issued a
Re-examination Certificate cancelling all claims of United States Patent No. 6,569,427. As a result of the cancellation of all patent claims involved in PharmaStem II by the U.S. PTO, we will seek a dismissal of all claims for relief set forth
by PharmaStem in PharmaStem II.

We believe we have meritorious
defenses to these lawsuits and other proceedings, and we are contesting the actions vigorously in all of the above unresolved matters. While each of these matters is subject to uncertainty, in the opinion of our management, based on its review of
the information available at this time, the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.



During fiscal year 2005, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service concluded its audit of our federal income
taxes for the years 1999 through 2002. There was a single open issue related to this audit which we favorably resolved during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007. In addition, tax years ranging from 1998 through 2008 remain open to examination by
various state and foreign tax jurisdictions (such as China, Indonesia, the Philippines and the United Kingdom) in which we have significant business operations. The tax years under examination vary by jurisdiction. During the third quarter of fiscal
year 2008, we effectively settled several income tax audits worldwide, including in Canada, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States covering various years ranging from 1998 through 2005. We regularly review our tax positions in
each significant taxing jurisdiction in the process of evaluating our unrecognized tax benefits as required by FASB Interpretation No. 48,

“Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes”

(“FIN No. 48”), which we
adopted as of January 1, 2007. Adjustments are made to our unrecognized tax benefits when: (i) facts and circumstances regarding a tax position change, causing a change in management’s judgment regarding that tax position; (ii) a
tax position is effectively settled with a tax authority; and/or (iii) the statute of limitations expires regarding a tax position.

We are also subject to various other claims, legal proceedings and investigations covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of
our business activities. Although we have established accruals for potential losses that we believe are probable and reasonably estimable, in the opinion of our management, based on its review of the information available at this time, the total
cost of resolving these other contingencies at December 28, 2008 should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K. Each of these matters is subject to uncertainties,
and it is possible that some of these matters may be resolved unfavorably to us.

Reporting Segment Results of Continuing Operations

Life
and Analytical Sciences

2008 Compared to
2007.

Sales for fiscal year 2008 were $1,512.6 million, as compared to $1,315.6 million for fiscal year 2007, an increase of $197.0 million, or 15%, which includes an approximate 6% increase from acquisitions and an approximate 2% increase
in sales attributable to favorable changes in foreign exchange rates. The following analysis in the remainder of this paragraph compares selected sales by market and product type for fiscal year 2008, as compared to fiscal year 2007, and includes
the effect of acquisitions and foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Sales to genetic screening customers increased by $91.0 million, sales to analytical sciences customers increased by $36.9 million, sales to laboratory service customers increased by
$36.8 million, and sales to bio-discovery customers increased by $32.5 million.

Operating income for fiscal year 2008 was $138.6 million, as compared to $129.6 million for fiscal year 2007, an increase of $9.1 million, or 7%. Amortization of intangible assets increased due to acquisitions
completed in fiscal years 2008 and 2007 and was $52.5 million for fiscal year 2008, as compared to $41.4 million for fiscal year 2007. The gains on the settlement of the insurance claim for the fire in our Boston, Massachusetts facility in March
2005 was $15.3 million for fiscal year 2007. Restructuring and lease charges were $6.6 million for fiscal year 2008 as a result of our Q3 2008 Plan, and restructuring and lease charges were $8.7 million for fiscal year 2007 as a result of our
restructuring plans. Amortization of purchase accounting adjustments to record inventory and the IPR&D charge from certain acquisitions completed in fiscal year 2007 was $2.5 million and $1.5 million, respectively. Stock option expense was $4.1
million and $3.4 million for fiscal years 2008 and 2007, respectively. The combined favorable impact of increased sales volume and productivity improvements increased operating income, which was partially offset by inflation, increased freight
costs, and increased sales and marketing expenses to support recent acquisitions, particularly the acquisition of ViaCell.

2007 Compared to 2006.

Sales for fiscal year 2007 were $1,315.6 million, as compared to $1,129.2 million for fiscal year 2006, an increase of
$186.4 million, or 17%, which includes an approximate 6% increase from acquisitions and an approximate 4% increase in sales attributable to favorable changes in foreign exchange rates.



The following analysis in the remainder of this paragraph compares selected sales by market and product type for fiscal year 2007, as compared to fiscal year
2006, and includes the effect of acquisitions and foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Sales to genetic screening customers increased by $49.1 million, sales to analytical sciences customers increased by $51.2 million, sales to laboratory service
customers increased by $51.3 million, and sales to bio-discovery customers increased by $34.9 million.

Operating income for fiscal year 2007 was $129.6 million, as compared to $112.7 million for fiscal year 2006, an increase of $16.9 million, or 15%.
Amortization of intangible assets increased due to acquisitions completed in fiscal years 2007 and 2006 and was $41.4 million for fiscal year 2007, as compared to $31.3 million for fiscal year 2006. Restructuring and lease charges were $8.7 million
for fiscal year 2007 as a result of our restructuring plans, as compared to reversals of $1.7 million in fiscal year 2006. Amortization of purchase accounting adjustments to record the inventory and IPR&D from certain acquisitions completed in
fiscal year 2007 were $2.5 million and $1.5 million, respectively. Stock option expense was $3.4 million and $3.2 million for fiscal years 2007 and 2006, respectively. Gains on the settlement of the insurance claim for the March 2005 fire in our
Boston, Massachusetts facility were $15.3 million for fiscal year 2007. Increased sales volume and higher net productivity increased operating income, partially offset by pressures in our laboratory services business as a result of entering into
several large new contracts requiring an increase in start-up investment in the first six months of fiscal year 2007.

Optoelectronics

2008 Compared to 2007.

Sales for fiscal year 2008 were $424.9 million, as compared to $386.8 million for fiscal year 2007, an increase of
$38.1 million, or 10%, which includes an approximate 1% increase from acquisitions and an approximate 2% increase in sales attributable to favorable changes in foreign exchange rates. The analysis in the remainder of this paragraph compares selected
sales by product type for fiscal year 2008, as compared to fiscal year 2007, and includes the effect of acquisitions and foreign exchange fluctuations. The increase in sales was primarily a result of an increase of $24.6 million in sales of our
medical imaging products due to the performance of our amorphous silicon business, an increase in sales of our specialty lighting products of $7.2 million, and an increase in sales of our optical sensors of $5.4 million.

Operating income for fiscal year 2008 was $91.2 million, as compared to $71.4
million for fiscal year 2007, an increase of $19.8 million, or 28%. Restructuring and lease reversals were $0.4 million for fiscal year 2008 as a result of changes in estimates for lease costs associated with the sale of a business from 2001 and
restructuring and lease charges were $3.6 million for fiscal year 2007 as a result of our Q4 2007 Plan and lease costs associated with the sale of a business from 2001. Amortization of intangible assets was $3.1 million and $2.7 million for fiscal
years 2008 and 2007, respectively. Stock option expense was $1.8 million and $1.3 million for fiscal years 2008 and 2007, respectively. Increased sales volume and capacity and productivity improvements made within our amorphous silicon business
increased operating income.

2007 Compared to
2006.

Sales for fiscal year 2007 were $386.8 million, as compared to $348.5 million for fiscal year 2006, an increase of $38.3 million, or 11%, which includes an approximate 3% increase in sales attributable to favorable changes in foreign
exchange rates. The analysis in the remainder of this paragraph compares selected sales by product type for fiscal year 2007, as compared to fiscal year 2006, and includes the effect of acquisitions and foreign exchange fluctuations. The increase in
sales was primarily a result of an increase of $29.3 million in sales of our medical imaging products due to the performance of our amorphous silicon business, an increase in sales of our specialty lighting products of $4.1 million, and an increase
in sales of our optical sensors of $4.8 million.

Operating
income for fiscal year 2007 was $71.4 million, as compared to $66.1 million for fiscal year 2006, an increase of $5.3 million, or 8%. Restructuring and lease charges, net of reversals, were $3.6 million for fiscal year 2007, as a result of our Q4
2007 Plan and lease costs associated with the sale of a business from 2001. Restructuring reversals were $1.9 million for fiscal year 2006. Amortization of intangible assets was $2.7 million



and $2.5 million for fiscal years 2007 and 2006, respectively. Stock option expense was $1.3 million and $1.6 million for fiscal years 2007 and 2006,
respectively. Increased sales volume and capacity and productivity improvements made within the amorphous silicon business also increased operating income.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

We require cash to pay our operating expenses, make capital expenditures, service our debt and other long-term liabilities, repurchase shares of our
common stock and pay dividends on our common stock. Our principal sources of funds are from our operations and the capital markets, particularly the debt markets. In the near term, we anticipate that our operations will generate sufficient cash to
fund our operating expenses, capital expenditures, interest payments on our debt and dividends on our common stock. In the long term, we expect to use internally generated funds and external sources to satisfy our debt and other long-term
liabilities.

Principal factors that could affect the
availability of our internally generated funds include:

•

deterioration of sales due to weakness in markets in which we sell our products and services, and

•

changes in our working capital requirements.

Principal factors that could affect our ability to obtain cash from external sources include:

•

financial covenants contained in the financial instruments controlling our borrowings that limit our total borrowing capacity,

•

increases in interest rates applicable to our outstanding variable rate debt,

•

a ratings downgrade that would limit our ability to borrow under our accounts receivable and amended and restated senior unsecured revolving credit facility and our
overall access to the corporate debt market,

•

increases in interest rates or credit spreads, as well as limitations on the availability of credit, that affect our ability to borrow under future potential
facilities on a secured or unsecured basis,

•

a decrease in the market price for our common stock, and

•

volatility in the public debt and equity markets.

Cash Flows

Fiscal Year 2008

Operating Activities.

Net cash provided by continuing operations was $212.7 million for fiscal year 2008, compared to net cash provided by
continuing operations of $188.9 million for fiscal year 2007, an increase of $23.8 million. The increase in cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2008 was driven by income from continuing operations of $126.1 million, depreciation
and amortization of $88.3 million and restructuring and lease charges of $6.2 million. These amounts were partially offset by a net increase in working capital of $17.0 million. Contributing to the net increase in working capital in fiscal year
2008, excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations, was an increase in accounts receivable of $12.2 million and an increase in inventory of $10.4 million, offset by an increase in accounts payable of $5.6 million. The increase in
inventory was primarily the result of expanding the amount of inventory held at sales locations within our Life and Analytical Sciences segment to improve timing of sales. In both the Life and Analytical Sciences and Optoelectronics segments the
timing of revenue during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008 increased the accounts receivable balance, which was offset by the timing of disbursements in accounts payable during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008. There was a decrease of
$5.0 million in our accounts receivable securitization facility during fiscal year 2008, which totaled $40.0 million and $45.0 million at December 28, 2008 and December 30, 2007, respectively. Changes in accrued expenses, other assets and
liabilities and other items, net, totaled $9.1 million in fiscal year 2008, and primarily related to tax audit settlements and the timing of payments for tax, restructuring, and salary and benefits.



Investing Activities.

Net cash used in continuing operations investing activities was $133.6
million for fiscal year 2008, compared to $347.7 million of cash used in continuing operations investing activities for fiscal year 2007. For fiscal year 2008, we used $76.7 million of net cash for acquisitions and used $14.9 million in related
transaction costs, earn-out payments, acquired licenses and other costs in connection with these and other transactions. Capital expenditures for fiscal year 2008 were $43.3 million, mainly in the areas of tooling and other capital equipment
purchases, in addition to improvements in our amorphous silicon facility within our Optoelectronics segment and payments of $0.2 million related to business development costs. These cash outflows were partially offset by $1.2 million from the sale
of investments and $0.4 million related to the release of restricted cash balances.

Financing Activities.

Net cash used in continuing operations financing activities was $101.1 million for fiscal year 2008, as compared to $148.9 million of cash provided by continuing operations financing
activities for fiscal year 2007. In fiscal year 2008, we repurchased approximately 3.0 million shares of our common stock, including 37,521 shares to satisfy minimum statutory tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of
restricted stock awards, for a total cost of $75.5 million. This compares to repurchases of approximately 8.1 million shares of our common stock in the open market for fiscal year 2007 for an aggregate of $203.0 million, including commissions.
This use of cash was offset by proceeds from common stock option exercises of $43.7 million and the related tax benefit of $0.3 million for fiscal year 2008. During fiscal year 2008, debt borrowings from our amended senior unsecured revolving credit
facility totaled $476.0 million, proceeds from the issuance of our seven-year senior unsecured notes at a rate of 6% totaled $150.0 million, which was offset by debt reductions to our credit facilities, with aggregate payments of $633.0
million. This compares to debt reductions in fiscal year 2007 of $212.4 million. In fiscal year 2008, we also paid $27.1 million to settle forward interest rate contracts with notional amounts totaling $300.0 million and a weighted average interest
rate of 4.25% and $2.0 million for debt issuance costs during fiscal year 2008. In addition, we paid $33.1 million in dividends for fiscal year 2008.

Fiscal Year 2007

Operating Activities.

Net cash provided by continuing operations was $188.9 million in fiscal year 2007, compared to net cash provided by
continuing operations of $124.7 million in fiscal year 2006, an increase of $64.2 million, driven primarily by the $1.3 million of divestiture tax refunds that occurred in fiscal year 2007 as compared to the $60.3 million of taxes paid on
divestitures in fiscal year 2006. The increase in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year 2007 was also driven by income from continuing operations of $130.7 million, depreciation and amortization of $76.5 million and restructuring and
lease charges of $12.2 million. These amounts were partially offset by $15.3 million from the settlement of an insurance claim and a net increase in working capital of $10.9 million. Contributing to the net increase in working capital in fiscal year
2007, excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations, was an increase in accounts receivable of $19.6 million and an increase in inventory of $2.4 million, offset by an increase in accounts payable of $11.1 million. In both the Life and
Analytical Sciences and Optoelectronics segments the timing of strong revenue performance in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007 increased the accounts receivable balance, which was offset by the timing of accounts payable disbursements in the
same quarter. There was no incremental use of our accounts receivable securitization facility in fiscal year 2007, which totaled $45.0 million at both December 30, 2007 and December 31, 2006. Changes in accrued expenses, other assets and
liabilities and other items, net, totaled $5.6 million in fiscal year 2007, and primarily related to timing of payments for tax, restructuring, and salary and benefits.

Investing Activities.

Net cash used in continuing operations investing activities was $347.7 million in fiscal year 2007, compared
to $139.1 million of cash used in continuing operations investing activities in fiscal year 2006. Included in fiscal year 2007 were payments of $1.0 million related to business development costs. In addition, we used $312.7 million of net cash for
acquisitions and used $3.2 million in related transaction costs, earn-out payments, acquired licenses and other costs in connection with these and other transactions. Capital expenditures in fiscal year 2007 were $44.5 million, mainly in the areas
of tooling and other capital equipment



purchases, in addition to the improvements in our amorphous silicon facility within our Optoelectronics segment. These cash outflows were partially offset by
$10.8 million received from the settlement of an insurance claim, $1.6 million from the surrender of life insurance policies, and $1.4 million from the sale of investments.

Financing Activities.

Net cash provided by continuing operations financing activities was $148.9 million in fiscal
year 2007, compared to $313.5 million of cash used in continuing operations financing activities in fiscal year 2006. In fiscal year 2007, we repurchased in the open market approximately 8.1 million shares of our common stock at a total cost of
$203.0 million, including commissions. This compares to repurchases in fiscal year 2006 of $190.1 million. We also paid $4.2 million to settle forward interest rate contracts with notional amounts totaling $300.0 million and a weighted average
interest rate of 4.25%, and $0.8 million for debt issuance costs. These uses of cash were offset in part by $32.8 million of proceeds from common stock option exercises and the related tax benefit. Debt borrowings from our amended senior unsecured
revolving credit facility and interim unsecured credit facility in fiscal year 2007 totaled $271.5 million and $300.0 million, respectively, offset by debt reductions to our amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility of $212.4 million and
other credit facilities of $1.3 million. This compares to debt reductions in fiscal year 2006 of $110.7 million. In addition, we paid $33.7 million in dividends in fiscal year 2007.

Current Borrowing Arrangements

Amended Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility.

On August 13, 2007, we entered into an amended and restated senior unsecured
revolving credit facility providing for a facility through August 13, 2012, which amended and restated in its entirety our previous senior revolving credit agreement dated as of October 31, 2005. During the first quarter of fiscal year
2008, we exercised our option to increase the amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility to $650.0 million from $500.0 million. Letters of credit in the aggregate amount of approximately $14.0 million were issued under the previous facility,
which are treated as issued under the amended facility. We use the amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes, which may include working capital, refinancing existing indebtedness, capital expenditures, share
repurchases, acquisitions and strategic alliances. The interest rates under the amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility are based on the Eurocurrency rate at the time of borrowing plus a margin or the base rate from time to time. The base
rate is the higher of (i) the corporate base rate announced from time to time by Bank of America, N.A. and (ii) the Federal Funds rate plus 50 basis points. We may allocate all or a portion of our indebtedness under the amended senior
unsecured revolving credit facility to interest based upon the Eurocurrency rate plus a margin or the base rate. The Eurocurrency margin as of December 28, 2008 was 40 basis points. The weighted average Eurocurrency interest rate as of
December 28, 2008 was 0.63%, resulting in a weighted average effective Eurocurrency rate, including the margin, of 1.03%. We had drawn down approximately $359.0 million of borrowings in U.S. Dollars under the facility as of December 28,
2008, with interest based on the above described Eurocurrency rate. The agreement for the facility contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants and events of default customary for financings of this type, and which are consistent with
those financial covenants contained in our previous senior revolving credit agreement. The financial covenants in our amended and restated senior unsecured revolving credit facility include debt-to-capital ratios and a contingent maximum total
leverage ratio, applicable if our credit rating is down-graded below investment grade. At all times during fiscal year 2008, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants, and anticipate being in compliance for the duration of the term of the
credit facility.

Unsecured Interim Credit
Facility.

On November 14, 2007, we entered into a $300.0 million unsecured interim credit facility. We entered into this unsecured interim credit facility in order to pay the purchase price and transactional expenses of the ViaCell
acquisition. This unsecured interim credit facility matured on March 31, 2008, at which point all amounts outstanding were due in full. On March 28, 2008, we paid in full the outstanding balance on the unsecured interim credit facility of
$300.0 million. The source of funds for the repayment was comprised of our cash and cash equivalents, and borrowings under our amended and restated senior unsecured revolving credit facility.



6% Senior Unsecured Notes.

On May 30, 2008, we issued and sold seven-year senior notes
at a rate of 6% with a face value of $150.0 million and received $150.0 million in gross proceeds from the issuance. The debt, which matures in May 2015, is unsecured. Interest on the 6% senior notes is payable semi-annually on
May 30th and November 30th. We may redeem some or all of our 6% senior notes at any time in an amount not less than 10% of the original aggregate principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, plus the applicable make-whole
amount. The financial covenants in our 6% senior notes include debt-to-capital ratios which, if our credit rating is down-graded below investment grade, would be replaced by a contingent maximum total leverage ratio. At all times during fiscal
year 2008, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants, and anticipate being in compliance for the duration of the term of the notes.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007, we entered into forward interest rate contracts with notional amounts totaling $300.0 million and a
weighted average interest rate of 4.25%. These contracts were intended to hedge movements in interest rates prior to our expected debt issuance. In May 2008, we settled forward interest rate contracts with notional amounts totaling $150.0 million,
upon the issuance of our 6% senior unsecured notes. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008, we concluded that the remaining portion of the expected debt issuance, with a notional amount totaling $150.0 million, was no longer probable. As a
result of the debt issuance no longer being probable, we discontinued and settled the forward interest rate contracts with notional amounts totaling $150.0 million and recognized derivative losses of $17.5 million, in interest and other expense.

Before amortization expense, we had accumulated derivative
losses of $8.4 million, net of taxes of $5.4 million, in other comprehensive (loss) income as of December 28, 2008 and $5.3 million, net of taxes of $3.5 million, as of December 30, 2007, related to these cash flow hedges. The
derivative losses are amortized into interest expense when the hedged exposure affects interest expense. During fiscal year 2008, $1.2 million of these derivative losses were amortized into interest expense.

Once established, cash flow hedges are generally recorded in other
comprehensive (loss) income until maturity unless an anticipated transaction is no longer likely to occur. Discontinued or dedesignated cash flow hedges are immediately settled with counterparties, and the related accumulated derivative gains or
losses are recognized into interest expense on the consolidated financial statements. We did not recognize any ineffectiveness during fiscal year 2008 or fiscal year 2007.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Receivables Securitization Facility.

During fiscal year 2001, we established a wholly owned consolidated subsidiary to maintain a receivables
purchase agreement with a third party financial institution. Under this arrangement, we sold, on a revolving basis, certain of our accounts receivable balances to the consolidated subsidiary which simultaneously sold an undivided percentage
ownership interest in designated pools of receivables to a third party financial institution. As collections reduce the balance of sold accounts receivable, new receivables are sold. Our consolidated subsidiary retains the risk of credit loss on the
receivables. Accordingly, the full amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts has been provided for on our balance sheets. The amount of receivables sold and outstanding with the third party financial institution may not exceed $65.0 million.
Under the terms of this arrangement, our consolidated subsidiary retains collection and administrative responsibilities for the balances. The aggregate amount of receivables sold to the consolidated subsidiary was $72.8 million as of
December 28, 2008 and $79.0 million as of December 30, 2007. At December 28, 2008 and December 30, 2007, an undivided interest of $40.0 million and $45.0 million, respectively, in the receivables had been sold to the third party
financial institution under this arrangement. The remaining interest in receivables of $32.8 million and $34.0 million that were sold to and held by the consolidated subsidiary were included in accounts receivable in the consolidated financial
statements at December 28, 2008 and December 30, 2007, respectively.

The agreement requires the third party financial institution to be paid interest during the period from the date the receivable is sold to its maturity date. At December 28, 2008, the effective interest rate was
LIBOR plus approximately 220 basis points. The servicing fees received constitute adequate compensation for services



performed. No servicing asset or liability is therefore recorded. The agreement also includes conditions that require us to maintain a senior unsecured
credit rating of BB or above, as defined by Standard & Poor’s Rating Services, and Ba2 or above, as defined by Moody’s Investors Service. At December 28, 2008, we had a senior unsecured credit rating of BBB, with a stable
outlook from Standard & Poor’s Rating Services, and of Baa3, with a stable outlook from Moody’s Investors Service. In January 2009, our consolidated subsidiary entered into an agreement to extend the term of the accounts
receivable securitization facility to February 27, 2009 in order to conclude the audit of the receivables purchase agreement. We anticipate an additional extension of the facility.

Dividends

Our Board declared regular quarterly cash dividends of seven cents per share in each quarter of fiscal years 2008 and 2007, resulting in an annual
dividend rate of 28 cents per share.

Contractual Obligations

The following table summarizes our contractual
obligations at December 28, 2008 for continuing and discontinuing operations:

(1)

The credit facility borrowings carry variable interest rates; the amounts included in this table do not contemplate interest obligations.

(2)

For the purposes of this table, the obligation has been calculated without interest obligations.

(3)

The FIN No. 48 amount includes accrued interest, net of tax benefits, and penalties. We have excluded $36.2 million, including accrued interest, net of tax benefits, and
penalties, from the amount related to our uncertain tax positions as we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of related future payments.

Capital Expenditures

During fiscal year 2009, we expect to invest an amount for capital expenditures similar to that in fiscal year 2008, primarily to introduce new products,
to improve our operating processes, to shift the production capacity to lower cost locations, and to develop information technology. We expect to use our available cash and internally generated funds to fund these expenditures.

Other Potential Liquidity Considerations

On November 6, 2006, we announced that our Board authorized us to
repurchase up to 10.0 million shares of our common stock under a stock repurchase program (the “Repurchase Program”). The Repurchase Program would expire on October 25, 2010 unless this authorization was terminated earlier by our
Board, and could be



suspended or discontinued at any time. During the first quarter of 2007, we repurchased in the open market 2,500,000 shares of our common stock at an
aggregate cost of $60.0 million, including commissions, under the Repurchase Program. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2007, we repurchased in the open market 3,468,300 shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $87.1 million,
including commissions, under the Repurchase Program. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2007, we repurchased in the open market 1,082,492 shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $28.9 million, including commissions, under the
Repurchase Program. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007, we repurchased in the open market 1,000,000 shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $26.9 million, including commissions, under the Repurchase Program. During the third
quarter of fiscal year 2008, we repurchased 1,949,208 shares of our common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of $56.6 million, including commissions, under the Repurchase Program. These repurchases completed our repurchase of the
10.0 million shares in the aggregate authorized under the Repurchase Program. The repurchased shares have been reflected as additional authorized but unissued shares, with the payments reflected in common stock and capital in excess of par
value.

On October 23, 2008, we announced that our Board
has authorized us to repurchase up to 10.0 million additional shares of our common stock under a new stock repurchase program (the “New Repurchase Program”). The New Repurchase Program will expire on October 22, 2012 unless this
authorization is terminated earlier by our Board, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008, we repurchased 1,000,000 shares of our common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of $18.0
million, including commissions, under the New Repurchase Program. From December 29, 2008 through February 20, 2009, we repurchased approximately 1,000,000 shares of our common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of $14.2 million,
including commissions, under the New Repurchase Program.

Our
Board has authorized us to repurchase shares of our common stock in the aggregate to satisfy minimum statutory tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit awards granted pursuant to
our equity incentive plans. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2008, we repurchased 17,549 shares of our common stock. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2008, we repurchased 3,354 shares of our common stock. During the fourth quarter of
fiscal year 2008, we repurchased 16,618 shares of our common stock. The repurchased shares have been reflected as additional authorized but unissued shares, with the payments reflected in common stock and capital in excess of par value.

At December 28, 2008, we had cash and cash equivalents of
approximately $179.1 million and an amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility with $277.0 million available for additional borrowing. In May 2008, we finalized an issuance of 6% seven-year senior unsecured notes with proceeds of
approximately $150.0 million. The proceeds from this debt issuance were used to repay existing borrowings under our amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility.

In connection with the settlement of an insurance claim resulting from a fire that occurred within our Life and Analytical Sciences
facility in Boston, Massachusetts in March 2005, we accrued $9.7 million during the second quarter of fiscal year 2007, representing our management’s estimate of the total cost for decommissioning the building, including environmental matters,
that was damaged in the fire. We paid $1.6 million during fiscal year 2008 and $3.9 million during fiscal year 2007 towards decommissioning the building, and we anticipate that the remaining payments of $4.2 million will be completed by the third
quarter of fiscal year 2009.

Our businesses have not been
materially affected by conditions in the global financial markets and the economy in general. However, recent distress in these markets has adversely impacted a number of financial conditions by severely diminishing liquidity and credit
availability, creating extreme volatility in security prices, increasing interest rates and/or widening credit spreads, and decreasing valuations of certain investments. The increasing or high interest rates and/or widening credit spreads may create
a less favorable environment for certain of our businesses and may affect the fair value of financial instruments that we issue or hold. Increases in interest rates or credit spreads, as well as limitations on the availability of credit, could
affect our ability to borrow under future potential facilities on a secured or unsecured basis, which may adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations.



Our pension plans have not experienced any material impact on liquidity or counterparty exposure due to
the volatility in the credit markets; however, as a result of losses experienced in global equity markets, our pension funds had a negative return for fiscal year 2008, which in turn created increased pension costs in fiscal year 2009 and
potentially in additional future periods. In addition, we may be required to fund our pension plans for approximately $18.0 million by fiscal year 2010, and we could potentially have to make additional funding payments in future periods. We cannot
predict how long these conditions will exist or how our businesses may be affected. In difficult global financial markets, we may be forced to fund our operations at a higher cost, or we may be unable to raise as much funding as we need to support
our business activities.

Effects of Recently Adopted Accounting
Pronouncement

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS
No. 157,

“Fair Value Measurements”

(“SFAS No. 157”), which clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability, establishes
a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions, and expands the related disclosure requirements. Under the standard, fair value measurements are to be separately disclosed by level within the fair value
hierarchy. SFAS No. 157 applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value based upon an exit price model. The FASB also issued FASB Staff Position
(“FSP”) No. 157-2 in February 2008 (“FSP No. 157-2”). FSP No. 157-2 delays the effective date of the application of SFAS No. 157 to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008 for all nonfinancial
assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis. We adopted SFAS No. 157 as of December 31, 2007, with the exception of the application of the statement to
non-recurring nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities. See Note 21 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional details.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,

“The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
Liabilities”

(“SFAS No. 159”). SFAS No. 159 provides entities with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value, with the objective to reduce both the complexity in accounting for financial
instruments, and the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related financial assets and liabilities differently. Unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option is elected would be reported in earnings. We adopted SFAS
No. 159 as of December 31, 2007, and to date have not elected to measure any additional financial instruments and other items at fair value. Therefore, material financial assets and liabilities not carried at fair value, such as our
short-term and long-term debt obligations and trade accounts receivable and accounts payable, are still reported at their carrying values. Any future transacted financial asset or liability will be evaluated for the fair value election as prescribed
by SFAS No. 159.

In March 2007, the FASB ratified EITF
Issue No. 06-10,

“Accounting for Collateral Assignment Split-Dollar Life Insurance Arrangements”

(“EITF No. 06-10”). EITF No. 06-10 provides guidance for determining a liability for the post-retirement
benefit obligation as well as recognition and measurement of the associated asset on the basis of the terms of the collateral assignment agreement. We adopted EITF No. 06-10 as of December 31, 2007 and the adoption did not have an impact
on our consolidated financial statements.

In June 2007, the
FASB ratified EITF Issue No. 07-3,

“Accounting for Nonrefundable Advance Payments for Goods or Services Received for Use in Future Research and Development Activities”

(“EITF No. 07-3”). EITF No. 07-3
requires that nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities be deferred, capitalized and recognized as an expense as the goods are delivered or the related services
are performed. We adopted EITF No. 07-3, on a prospective basis, as of December 31, 2007 and the adoption did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In May 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 162,

“The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles”

(“SFAS No. 162”). SFAS No. 162 identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles used in the preparation of financial statements of nongovernmental entities that are



presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”). With the issuance of this statement, the FASB concluded that the
U.S. GAAP hierarchy should be directed toward the entity and not its auditor, and reside in the accounting literature established by the FASB as opposed to the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“AICPA”) Statement on
Auditing Standards No. 69,

“The Meaning of Present Fairly in Conformity With Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.”

SFAS No. 162 is effective 60 days following the Securities and Exchange Commission’s
(“SEC”) approval of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board amendments to AU Section 411,

“The Meaning of Present Fairly in Conformity With Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.”

We have evaluated the
requirements of SFAS No. 162 and have determined that it will not have a significant impact on our determination or reporting of financial results.

Effects of Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007),

“Business Combinations”

(“SFAS No. 141(R)”). SFAS
No. 141(R) establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements significant aspects of a business combination. Under SFAS No. 141(R), acquisition costs will generally be expensed
as incurred; noncontrolling interests will be valued at fair value at the acquisition date; IPR&D will be recorded at fair value as an indefinite-lived intangible asset at the acquisition date; restructuring costs associated with a business
combination will generally be expensed subsequent to the acquisition date; and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally will affect income tax expense. SFAS No. 141(R)
amends SFAS No. 109,

“Accounting for Income Taxes”

(“SFAS No. 109”), such that adjustments made to valuation allowances on deferred taxes and acquired tax contingencies associated with acquisitions that closed
prior to the effective date of SFAS No. 141(R) would also apply the provisions of SFAS No. 141(R). SFAS No. 141(R) also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business
combination. Early adoption is not permitted. SFAS No. 141(R) is effective on a prospective basis for all business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual period subsequent to
December 15, 2008, with the exception of the accounting for valuation allowances on deferred taxes and acquired tax contingencies. We will be required to adopt SFAS No. 141(R) in the first quarter of fiscal year 2009. We are currently
evaluating the requirements of SFAS No. 141(R) and have not yet determined the impact of its adoption on our consolidated financial statements.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, “

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements—an amendment of
Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51”

(“SFAS No. 160”). SFAS No. 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent, the amount of
consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest, changes in a parent’s ownership interest, and the valuation of retained noncontrolling equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. SFAS
No. 160 also establishes disclosure requirements that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners. We will be required to adopt SFAS No. 160 in the first quarter of
fiscal year 2009. We are currently evaluating the requirements of SFAS No. 160 and have not yet determined the impact, if any, of its adoption on our consolidated financial statements.

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, “

Disclosures about
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities—an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133”

(“SFAS No. 161”). SFAS No. 161 is intended to improve transparency in financial reporting by requiring enhanced disclosures
of an entity’s derivative instruments and hedging activities and their effects on the entity’s financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. SFAS No. 161 applies to all derivative instruments within the scope of SFAS
No. 133,

“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,”

as well as related hedged items, bifurcated derivatives, and nonderivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments. SFAS
No. 161 establishes principles and requirements for how an entity identifies derivative instruments and related hedged items that affect its financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. SFAS No. 161 also establishes
disclosure requirements that the fair values of derivative instruments and their gains and losses are disclosed in a tabular



format, that derivative features which are credit-risk related be disclosed to provide clarification to an entity’s liquidity and cross-referencing
within footnotes. We will be required to adopt SFAS No. 161 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2009. SFAS No. 161 provides only disclosure requirements; the adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated
financial statements.

In April 2008, the FASB issued FSP
No. 142-3,

“Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets”

(“FSP No. 142-3”). FSP No. 142-3 amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to
determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS No. 142. The objective of FSP No. 142-3 is to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS No. 142 and the period of
expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under SFAS No. 141(R) and other accounting principles. FSP No. 142-3 applies to all intangible assets, whether acquired in a business combination or otherwise, and early
adoption is prohibited. We will be required to adopt FSP No. 142-3 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2009. We are currently evaluating the requirements of FSP No. 142-3 and have not yet determined the impact of its adoption on our
consolidated financial statements.

In December 2008, the FASB
issued FSP No. 132(R)-1,

“Employers’ Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets”

(“FSP No. 132(R)-1”), which requires additional disclosures for employers’ pension and other postretirement
benefit plan assets. Pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets were not included within the scope of SFAS No. 157. FSP No. 132(R)-1 requires employers to disclose information about fair value measurements of plan assets similar
to the disclosures required under SFAS No. 157, including the investment policies and strategies for the major categories of plan assets, and significant concentrations of risk within plan assets. We will be required to adopt FSP
No. 132(R)-1 as of December 31, 2009. FSP No. 132(R)-1 provides only disclosure requirements; the adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make
estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to bad debts,
inventories, intangible assets, income taxes, restructuring, pensions and other postretirement benefits, contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable
under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different
assumptions or conditions.

We believe the following critical
accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements.

Revenue recognition.

We record product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price to the buyer
is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. For products that include installation, if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element, we recognize product revenue upon delivery, and we delay
recognition of installation revenue until the installation is complete. For sales that include customer-specified acceptance criteria, we recognize revenue only after the acceptance criteria have been met. We defer revenue from services and
recognize it over the contractual period, or as we render services and the customer accepts them. When arrangements include multiple elements, we use objective evidence of fair value to allocate revenue to the elements and recognize revenue when the
criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element, all in accordance with EITF Issue No. 00-21, “

Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables.”

Because the majority of our sales relate to specific manufactured
products or units rather than long-term customized projects, we generally do not experience significant changes in original estimates. Further, we have not experienced any significant refunds or promotional allowances that require significant
estimation.



Warranty Costs

. We provide for estimated warranty costs for products at the time of their
sale. Warranty liabilities are based on estimated future repair costs using historical labor and material incurred in the warranty period.

Allowances for doubtful accounts.

We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our
customers to make required payments. We generally compute our allowance for doubtful accounts by (i) applying specific percentage reserves on accounts that are past due and deemed uncollectible; and (ii) specifically reserving for
customers known to be in financial difficulty. Therefore, if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate beyond our estimates, we may have to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts. This would reduce our earnings.

Inventory valuation.

We initially value inventory at actual
cost to purchase and/or manufacture. We periodically review these values to ascertain that market value of the inventory continues to exceed its recorded cost. Generally, reductions in value of inventory below cost are caused by our maintenance of
stocks of products in excess of demand, or technological obsolescence of the inventory. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand and, when necessary, record provisions for excess and obsolete inventory based on either our estimated forecast
of product demand and production requirements, or historical trailing usage of the product. If our sales do not materialize as planned or at historic levels, we may have to increase our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory. This would reduce
our earnings. If actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated, inventory previously written down may be sold, resulting in lower costs of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period.

Business Combinations.

The allocation of purchase price for
business combinations requires estimates and judgment as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business, and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets, in determining the estimated fair value for purchase
price allocation purposes. The fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on management’s estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including
valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. If the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these estimates, the amounts recorded in the financial statements could result in a possible impairment of
the intangible assets and goodwill, or require acceleration of the amortization expense of finite-lived intangible assets.

Value of long-lived assets, including intangibles.

We carry a variety of long-lived assets on our balance sheet including property and
equipment, investments, identifiable intangible assets, and goodwill. We periodically review the carrying value of all of these assets based, in part, upon current estimated market values and our projections of anticipated future cash flows. We
undertake this review (i) on an annual basis for assets such as goodwill and non-amortizing intangible assets and (ii) on a periodic basis for other long-lived assets when facts and circumstances suggest that cash flows emanating from
those assets may be diminished. Any impairment charge that we record reduces our earnings. The impairment test consists of a two-step process. The first step is the comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit to
determine if the carrying value exceeds the fair value. The second step measures the amount of an impairment loss, and is only performed if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit. We perform the annual impairment assessment
on the later of January 1 or the first day of each fiscal year. This same impairment test will be performed at other times during the course of the year should an event occur which suggests that the recoverability of goodwill should be
reconsidered. Non-amortizing intangibles are also subject to an annual impairment test. The impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of an intangible asset
exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess is recognized

.

In addition, we currently evaluate the remaining useful life of our non-amortizing intangible assets at least annually to determine whether events or
circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life. If events or circumstances indicate that the useful lives of non-amortizing intangible assets are no longer indefinite, the assets will be tested for impairment in accordance with SFAS
No. 142. These intangible assets will then be amortized prospectively over their estimated remaining useful life and accounted for in the



same manner as other intangible assets that are subject to amortization. Through fiscal year 2008, we assessed the annual impairment testing using the Life
and Analytical Sciences and Optoelectronics reporting units. We completed the annual impairment test using a measurement date of December 28, 2008 and January 1, 2008, and concluded based on the first step of the process that there was no
goodwill impairment. While we believe that our estimates of current value are reasonable, different assumptions regarding items such as future cash flows and the volatility inherent in markets which we serve could affect our evaluations and result
in impairment charges against the carrying value of those assets.

Employee compensation and benefits.

Retirement and postretirement benefit plans are a significant cost of doing business, and represent obligations that will be ultimately settled far in the future, and therefore are subject to
estimation. Retirement and postretirement benefit plan expenses are allocated to cost of sales, research and development, and selling, general and administrative expenses, in our consolidated statements of operations. We incurred expenses of $8.3
million in fiscal year 2008, $12.5 million in fiscal year 2007, and $10.2 million in fiscal year 2006 for our retirement and postretirement plans. We expect expenses of approximately $13.2 million in fiscal year 2009 for our retirement and
postretirement plans. Pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employee’s approximate service period based on the terms of the plans and the investment and funding decisions made. We are
required to make assumptions regarding such variables as the expected long-term rate of return on assets and the discount rate applied, to determine service cost and interest cost, in order to arrive at pension income or expense for the year. As of
December 28, 2008, we estimated the expected long-term rate of return of assets in our pension portfolios in the United States was 8.5% and was 6.5% for all plans outside the United States. We have analyzed the rates of return on assets used
and determined that these rates are reasonable based on the plans’ historical performance relative to the overall markets in the countries where we invest the assets, as well as our current expectations for long-term rates of returns for our
pension assets. Our management will continue to assess the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumptions for each plan based on relevant market conditions, and will make adjustments to the assumptions as appropriate. Discount rate
assumptions have been, and continue to be, based on the prevailing market long-term interest rates at the measurement date. If any of our assumptions were to change, our pension plan expenses would also change. A one-quarter percent increase in the
discount rate would decrease our net periodic benefit cost by $0.5 million for fiscal year 2009 in the United States and by $0.4 million for fiscal year 2009 for all plans outside the United States. A one percent decrease in the estimated return on
plan assets would increase our pre-tax pension expense by $2.2 million for fiscal year 2009 in the United States and by $0.7 million for fiscal year 2009 for all plans outside the United States. We have reduced the volatility in our healthcare
costs provided to our retirees by adopting a defined dollar plan feature in fiscal year 2001. Under the defined dollar plan feature, our total annual liability for healthcare costs to any one retiree is limited to a fixed dollar amount, regardless
of the nature or cost of the healthcare needs of that retiree. Our maximum future liability, therefore, cannot be increased by future changes in the cost of healthcare.

Restructuring activities.

Our consolidated financial statements detail specific charges relating to restructuring activities as
well as the actual spending that has occurred against the resulting accruals in accordance with SFAS No. 146,

“Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.”

Our pre-tax restructuring charges are estimates
based on our preliminary assessments of (i) severance benefits to be granted to employees, based on known benefit formulas and identified job grades, (ii) costs to abandon certain facilities based on known lease costs of sub-rental income
and (iii) asset impairments as discussed above under “Value of long-lived assets, including intangibles.” Because these accruals are estimates, they are subject to change as a result of deviations from initial restructuring plans or
subsequent information that may come to our attention. For example, actual severance costs may be less than anticipated if employees voluntarily leave prior to the time at which they would be entitled to severance, or if anticipated legal hurdles in
foreign jurisdictions prove to be less onerous than expected. In addition, unanticipated successes or difficulties in terminating leases and other contractual obligations may lead to changes in estimates. When such changes in estimates occur, they
are reflected in our consolidated financial statements on our consolidated statement of operations line entitled “restructuring and lease charges (reversals), net.”

Gains or losses on dispositions.

When we record the disposition of an asset or discontinuance of an operation,
we make an estimate relative to the amount we expect to realize on the sale or disposition. This



estimate is based on a variety of factors, including current interest in the market, alternative markets for the assets, and other relevant factors. If
anticipated proceeds are less than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation, we record a loss. If anticipated proceeds are greater than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation, we recognize a gain net of expected
contingencies when the transaction has been consummated. Accordingly, we may realize amounts different than were first estimated. During the fiscal year ended December 28, 2008, we did not recognize any gains or losses from disposition of fixed
assets. We recorded $2.0 million in losses from the disposition of discontinued operations. Any such changes decrease or increase current earnings, and are recorded either against the “gains on disposition” or “discontinued
operations” line items appearing in our consolidated statement of operations.

Income taxes.

Our business operations are global in nature, and we are subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Tax laws and tax rates vary substantially in these jurisdictions, and are subject to
change given the political and economic climate in those countries. We report and pay income tax based on operational results and applicable law. Our tax provision contemplates tax rates currently in effect to determine both our current and deferred
tax provisions. Any significant fluctuation in rates or changes in tax laws could cause our estimates of taxes we anticipate either paying or recovering in the future to change. Such changes could lead to either increases or decreases in our
effective tax rate.

Significant judgment is required in
determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related tax assets and liabilities. In the ordinary course of our business, there are operational decisions, transactions, facts and circumstances, and calculations for which the
ultimate tax determination is not certain. Furthermore, our tax positions are periodically subject to challenge by taxing authorities throughout the world. Every quarter we review our tax positions in each significant taxing jurisdiction in the
process of evaluating our unrecognized tax benefits as required by FIN No. 48. Adjustments are made to our unrecognized tax benefits when: (i) facts and circumstances regarding a tax position change, causing a change in our judgment
regarding that tax position; (ii) a tax position is ultimately settled with a tax authority; and/or (iii) the statute of limitations expires regarding a tax position. Any significant impact as a result of changes in underlying facts, law,
tax rates, tax audit, or review could lead to adjustments to our income tax expense, our effective tax rate, or our cash flow.

Additionally, in accordance with SFAS No. 109, we have established valuation allowances against a variety of deferred tax assets, including net
operating loss carryforwards, foreign tax credits, other income tax credits and certain pension accruals. Valuation allowances take into consideration our ability to use these deferred tax assets and reduce the value of such items to the amount that
is deemed more likely than not to be recoverable. Improvements or other changes in our operations, domestically and internationally, could increase our ability to utilize these tax attributes in the future. The release of valuation allowances in
periods when these tax attributes become realizable would reduce our effective tax rate.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Financial Instruments

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash
investments, marketable securities and accounts receivable. We believe we had no significant concentrations of credit risk as of December 28, 2008.

In the ordinary course of business, we enter into foreign exchange contracts for periods consistent with our committed exposures to mitigate the effect of
foreign currency movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Transactions covered by hedge contracts include intercompany and third-party receivables and payables. The contracts are primarily in European and Asian currencies, have
maturities that do not exceed 12 months, have no cash requirements until maturity, and are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet. Credit risk and market risk are insignificant as the foreign exchange instruments are contracted
with major



banking institutions. Unrealized gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts are recognized immediately in earnings for hedges designated as fair
value and, for hedges designated as cash flow, the related unrealized gains or losses are deferred as a component of other comprehensive (loss) income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Deferred gains and losses are recognized in
income in the period in which the underlying anticipated transaction occurs and impacts earnings. Principal hedged currencies include the British Pound (GBP), Canadian Dollar (CAD), Euro (EUR), Japanese Yen (JPY), and Singapore Dollar (SGD). We held
forward foreign exchange contracts with U.S. equivalent notional amounts totaling $160.8 million at December 28, 2008 and $105.2 million as of December 30, 2007, and the approximate fair value of these foreign currency derivative contracts
was insignificant. The gains and losses realized on foreign currency derivative contracts are not material. The duration of these contracts entered into in fiscal year 2008 was generally 30 days.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007, we entered into forward
interest rate contracts with notional amounts totaling $300.0 million and a weighted average interest rate of 4.25%. These contracts were intended to hedge movements in interest rates prior to our expected debt issuance. In May 2008, we settled
forward interest rate contracts with notional amounts totaling $150.0 million, upon the issuance of our 6% senior unsecured notes. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008, we concluded that the remaining portion of the expected debt issuance,
with a notional amount totaling $150.0 million, was no longer probable. As a result of the debt issuance no longer being probable, we discontinued and settled the forward interest rate contracts with notional amounts totaling $150.0 million and
recognized derivative losses of $17.5 million, in interest and other expense.

Before amortization expense, we had accumulated derivative losses of $8.4 million, net of taxes of $5.4 million, in other comprehensive (loss) income as of December 28, 2008 and $5.3 million, net of taxes of
$3.5 million, as of December 30, 2007, related to these cash flow hedges. The derivative losses are amortized into interest expense when the hedged exposure affects interest expense. During fiscal year 2008, $1.2 million of these derivative
losses were amortized into interest expense.

Once established,
cash flow hedges are generally recorded in other comprehensive (loss) income until maturity unless an anticipated transaction is no longer likely to occur. Discontinued or dedesignated cash flow hedges are immediately settled with counterparties,
and the related accumulated derivative gains or losses are recognized into interest expense on the consolidated financial statements. We did not recognize any ineffectiveness during fiscal year 2008 or fiscal year 2007.

We do not enter into derivatives for trading or other speculative purposes,
nor do we use leveraged financial instruments.

Market
Risk

Market Risk.

We are exposed to
market risk, including changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates. To manage the volatility relating to these exposures, we enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted market
exposures.

Foreign Exchange Risk.

The potential
change in foreign currency exchange rates offers a substantial risk to us, as approximately 60% of our business is conducted outside of the United States, generally in foreign currencies. Our risk management strategy currently uses forward contracts
to mitigate certain balance sheet foreign currency transaction exposures. The intent is to offset gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures, with gains and losses resulting from the forward contracts that hedge these exposures.
Moreover, we are able to partially mitigate the impact that fluctuations in currencies have on our net income as a result of our manufacturing facilities located in countries outside the United States, material sourcing and other spending which
occur in countries outside the United States, resulting in a natural hedge.

Although we attempt to manage our foreign currency exchange risk through the above activities, when the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies in which we transact business, generally sales and net income will
be positively but not proportionately impacted.



Foreign Currency Risk—Value-at-Risk Disclosure

. We utilize a Value-at-Risk model to
determine the potential earning/fair value exposures presented by our foreign currency related financial instruments. As discussed above, we seek to minimize this exposure through our hedging program. Our Value-at-Risk computation is based on the
Monte Carlo simulation, utilizing a 95% confidence interval and a holding period of 30 days. As of December 28, 2008, this computation estimated that there is a 5% chance that the market value of the underlying exposures and the corresponding
derivative instruments either increase or decrease due to foreign currency fluctuations by more than $0.1 million. This Value-At-Risk measure is consistent with our financial statement disclosures relative to our foreign currency hedging program.
Specifically, during each of the four quarters ended in fiscal year 2008, the Value-At-Risk ranged between $0.3 million and $0.8 million, with an average of approximately $0.5 million.

Interest Rate Risk.

As described above, our debt portfolio includes variable rate instruments. Fluctuations in
interest rates can therefore have a direct impact on both our short-term cash flows, as they relate to interest, and our earnings. To manage the volatility relating to these exposures, we enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our
policies to hedge against known or forecasted interest rate exposures.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007, we entered into forward interest rate contracts with notional amounts totaling $300.0 million and a weighted average interest rate of 4.25%. These contracts were intended to hedge movements in
interest rates prior to our expected debt issuance. In May 2008, we settled forward interest rate contracts with notional amounts totaling $150.0 million, upon the issuance of our 6% senior unsecured notes. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year
2008, we concluded that the remaining portion of the expected debt issuance, with a notional amount totaling $150.0 million, was no longer probable. As a result of the debt issuance no longer being probable, we discontinued and settled the forward
interest rate contracts with notional amounts totaling $150.0 million and recognized derivative losses of $17.5 million, in interest and other expense.

Before amortization expense, we had accumulated derivative losses of $8.4 million, net of taxes of $5.4 million, in other comprehensive (loss) income
as of December 28, 2008 and $5.3 million, net of taxes of $3.5 million, as of December 30, 2007, related to these cash flow hedges. The derivative losses are amortized into interest expense when the hedged exposure affects interest
expense. During fiscal year 2008, $1.2 million of these derivative losses were amortized into interest expense.

Once established, cash flow hedges are generally recorded in other comprehensive (loss) income until maturity unless an anticipated transaction is no
longer likely to occur. Discontinued or dedesignated cash flow hedges are immediately settled with counterparties, and the related accumulated derivative gains or losses are recognized into interest expense on the consolidated financial statements.
We did not recognize any ineffectiveness during fiscal year 2008 or fiscal year 2007.

Interest Rate Risk—Sensitivity

. As of December 28, 2008, our debt portfolio consisted of $359.0 million of variable rate debt. In addition, our cash and cash equivalents, for which we receive
interest at variable rates, were $179.1 million at December 28, 2008. Our current earnings exposure for changes in interest rates can be summarized as follows:

(i) Changes in interest rates can cause interest charges on our variable rate debt, consisting of $359.0
million of revolving and interim debt facilities, to fluctuate. An increase of 10%, or approximately 10 basis points, in current interest rates would cause an additional pre-tax charge to our earnings of $0.4 million for fiscal year 2009.

(ii) Changes in interest rates can cause our
cash flows relative to interest payments on variable rate debt to fluctuate. As described above, an increase of 10%, or approximately 10 basis points, in current interest rates would cause our cash outflows to increase by $0.4 million for fiscal
year 2009.

(iii) Changes in interest rates
can cause our interest income and cash flows to fluctuate.

Financial Statements and Supplemental Data




REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of PerkinElmer,
Inc.

Waltham, Massachusetts

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of PerkinElmer, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 28, 2008
and December 30, 2007, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 28, 2008. Our audits also included
the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15. These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of PerkinElmer,
Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 28, 2008 and December 30, 2007, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 28, 2008, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the
information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 1 to the
consolidated financial statements, on January 1, 2007 the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation (“FIN”) No. 48,

“Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes”

(“FIN No. 48”).

We have also audited, in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2008, based on the criteria established in

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1:

Nature of Operations and Accounting Policies

Nature of Operations:

PerkinElmer, Inc. is a global high technology company which designs, manufactures, markets and
services components, systems and products within two reporting segments: Life and Analytical Sciences and Optoelectronics.

The Company recently announced a new alignment of its businesses effective for fiscal year 2009 that will allow the Company to prioritize its capabilities
on two key strategic areas – Human Health and Environmental Health. The Company’s new Human Health segment concentrates on developing diagnostics, tools and applications to detect disease earlier and more accurately and to accelerate the
discovery and development of critical new therapies. The Human Health segment includes the Company’s products and services that address the genetic screening and bio-discovery markets, formerly in the Life and Analytical Sciences segment, and
the Company’s technology serving the medical imaging market, formerly in the Optoelectronics segment. The Company’s new Environmental Health segment provides technologies and applications to facilitate the creation of safer products, more
secure surroundings and efficient energy resources. The Environmental Health segment includes the Company’s products and services that address the analytical sciences and laboratory service and support markets, formerly in the Life and
Analytical Sciences segment, and the Company’s technology designed for the sensors and lighting markets, formerly in the Optoelectronics segment.

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of PerkinElmer, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”). All intercompany balances
and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Investments in business entities in which the Company does not have control, but has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies, are accounted for by
the equity method.

The Company’s fiscal year ends on the
Sunday nearest December 31. The Company reports fiscal years under a 52/53 week format. Under this method, certain years will contain 53 weeks. The fiscal years ended December 28, 2008, December 30, 2007 and December 31,
2006 included 52 weeks.

Accounting Policies and
Estimates:

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with United States (“U.S.”) Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) requires the Company to make estimates and
judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates. The Company bases its estimates on
historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily
apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

Revenue Recognition:

The Company’s product sales are recorded when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price to the buyer is fixed or
determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. For products that include installation, and if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element, product revenue is recognized upon delivery, and installation revenue is
recognized when the installation is complete. For sales that include customer-specified acceptance criteria, revenue is recognized after the acceptance criteria have been met. Certain of the Company’s products require specialized installation.
Revenue for these products is deferred until installation is completed. Revenue from services is deferred and recognized over the contractual period, or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer. When arrangements include multiple
elements, the Company uses objective evidence of fair value to allocate revenue to the elements, and recognizes revenue when the criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element, in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force
(“EITF”) Issue No. 00-21, “

Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables.”

Warranty Costs

:    The Company provides for estimated warranty costs for products at the time of their sale. Warranty
liabilities are based on estimated future repair costs using historical labor and material costs incurred in the warranty period.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Shipping and Handling Costs:

The Company reports shipping and handling
costs in both sales and the related costs as cost of goods sold to the extent they are billed to customers. In all other instances, they are reflected as a component of cost of goods sold.

Inventories

:    Inventories, which include
material, labor and manufacturing overhead, are valued at the lower of cost or market. Substantially all inventories are accounted for using the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method of determining inventory costs. Inventory quantities
on-hand are regularly reviewed, and where necessary, provisions for excess and obsolete inventory are recorded based primarily on the Company’s estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements.

Income Taxes:

The Company uses the asset and
liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. This method also requires the recognition of future tax benefits such as net operating loss carryforwards, to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. A valuation allowance is established for any
deferred tax asset for which realization is not more likely than not. With respect to corporate earnings permanently reinvested offshore, the Company does not accrue tax for the repatriation of such foreign earnings.

The Company provides reserves for potential payments of tax to various tax
authorities related to uncertain tax positions and other issues. Prior to January 1, 2007, these reserves were recorded when management determined that it was probable that a loss would be incurred related to these matters and the amount of
such loss was reasonably determinable. As of January 1, 2007 the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation (“FIN”) No. 48,

“Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes”

(“FIN No. 48”). As a result, reserves are subsequently based on a determination of whether and how much of a tax benefit taken by the Company in its tax filings or positions is more likely than not to be realized following resolution
of any potential contingencies present related to the tax benefit. Potential interest and penalties associated with such uncertain tax positions is recorded as a component of income tax expense. See Note 6, below, for additional details.

Property, Plant and Equipment:

The Company
depreciates plant and equipment using the straight-line method over its estimated useful lives, which generally fall within the following ranges: buildings—10 to 40 years; leasehold improvements—estimated useful life or remaining term of
lease, whichever is shorter; machinery and equipment—3 to 7 years. Certain tooling costs are capitalized and amortized over a 3-year life, while repairs and maintenance costs are expensed.

Asset Retirement Obligations

:    The Company
records obligations associated with its lease obligations, the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset-retirement costs in accordance with SFAS No. 143, “

Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations,”

and FIN No. 47, “

Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations

,

an interpretation of SFAS No. 143”

. The Company reviews legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived
assets that result from contractual obligations or the acquisition, construction, development and/or normal use of the assets. If it is determined that a legal obligation exists, regardless of whether the obligation is conditional on a future event,
the fair value of the liability for an asset retirement obligation is recognized in the period in which it is incurred, if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the
associated asset, and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset. The difference between the gross expected future cash flow and its present value is accreted over the life of the related lease as an operating expense.

Pension Plans:

The
Company’s funding policy provides that payments to the U.S. pension trusts shall at least be equal to the minimum funding requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Non-U.S. plans are accrued for, but generally not fully funded, and benefits are paid from operating funds. The difference between actual amounts and
estimates based on actuarial assumptions will be recognized in other comprehensive (loss) income in the period in which they occur. In accordance with SFAS No. 158,

“Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other
Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)”

(“SFAS No. 158”) the Company recognizes a net liability or asset and an offsetting adjustment, net of taxes, to accumulated other
comprehensive (loss) income to report the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans, and measures plan assets and obligations at their year-end balance sheet date.

Translation of Foreign Currencies:

For foreign
operations, asset and liability accounts are translated at current exchange rates; income and expenses are translated using weighted average exchange rates for the reporting period. Resulting translation adjustments, as well as translation gains and
losses from certain intercompany transactions, are reported in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income, a separate component of stockholders’ equity.

Intangible Assets:

The Company’s intangible assets consist of (i) goodwill, which is not being amortized;
(ii) indefinite lived intangibles, which consist of certain trademarks and trade names that are not subject to amortization; and (iii) amortizing intangibles, which consist of patents and purchased technologies, which are being amortized
over their useful lives. All intangible assets are subject to impairment tests on an annual or periodic basis.

Goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing using the guidance and criteria described in SFAS No. 142,

“Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets”

(“SFAS No. 142”). The impairment test consists of a two-step process. The first step is the comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if the carrying value exceeds the fair
value. The second step measures the amount of an impairment loss, and is only performed if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit. This annual impairment assessment is performed by the Company on the later of January 1
or the first day of each fiscal year. This same impairment test will be performed at other times during the course of the year, should an event occur which suggests that the recoverability of goodwill should be reconsidered. Non-amortizing
intangibles are also subject to an annual impairment test. The impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an
impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess is recognized

.

Amortizing intangibles are evaluated for impairment using the methodology set forth in SFAS No. 144, “

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets”

(“SFAS No. 144”). Recoverability of these assets is assessed only when events have occurred that may give rise to an impairment. When a potential impairment has been identified, forecasted undiscounted net cash flows
of the operations to which the asset relates are compared to the current carrying value of the long-lived assets present in that operation. If such cash flows are less than such carrying amounts, long-lived assets, including such intangibles, are
written down to their respective fair values. See Note 13, below, for additional details.

Stock-Based Compensation:

The Company has three stock-based compensation plans from which it makes grants, which are described more fully in Note 20. Effective January 2, 2006, the
Company adopted SFAS No. 123(R),

“Share-Based Payment

” (“SFAS No. 123(R)”), which requires compensation costs related to stock-based transactions, including employee stock options, to be recognized in the
consolidated financial statements based on fair value. Compensation cost recognized in periods after adoption includes (i) compensation cost for all stock-based payments granted prior to, but not yet vested as of January 2, 2006, based on
the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS No. 123, as amended,

“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation”

(“SFAS No. 123”), less estimated forfeitures, and
(ii) compensation cost for all stock-based payments granted subsequent to December 31, 2006, based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), less estimated forfeitures.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The FASB Staff Position (“FSP”) No. 123R-3,

“Transition Election Related to
Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment Awards”

(“FSP No. 123R-3”) required an entity to follow either the transition guidance for the additional-paid-in-capital pool as prescribed in SFAS No. 123(R) or the
alternative transition method described in FSP No. 123R-3. The Company adopted the alternative transition method provided in the FSP No. 123R-3 for calculating the tax effects of stock-based compensation under SFAS No. 123(R).

Marketable Securities and
Investments:

Marketable securities and investments, whether debt or equity, are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 115, “

Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities.”

The
cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. If securities are classified as available for sale, the Company records these investments at their fair values with unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other
comprehensive (loss) income. Under the cost method of accounting, equity investments in private companies are carried at cost and are adjusted for other-than-temporary declines in fair value, additional investments or distributions.

Cash Flows:

For purposes of the Consolidated
Statements of Cash Flows, the Company considers all highly liquid unrestricted instruments with a purchased maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value due to the
short maturities of these instruments.

Environmental
Matters:

The Company accrues for costs associated with the remediation of environmental pollution when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the Company’s proportionate share of the amount can be
reasonably estimated. The recorded liabilities have not been discounted.

Research and Development:

Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. The fair value of acquired in-process research and development costs is expensed as of the acquisition
date if the related projects have not reached technological feasibility and were determined to have no alternative future use.

Restructuring Charges:

Restructuring actions are recorded in accordance with SFAS No. 146, “

Accounting for
Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities

” (“SFAS No. 146”). In recent fiscal years, the Company has undertaken a series of restructuring actions related to the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and the integration
of its business units. In connection with these initiatives, the Company has recorded restructuring charges, as more fully described in Note 3. Generally, costs associated with an exit or disposal activity are recognized when the liability is
incurred. Costs related to employee separation arrangements requiring future service beyond a specified minimum retention period are recognized over the service period.

Comprehensive (Loss) Income:

Comprehensive (loss) income is defined as net income or loss and other changes
in stockholders’ equity from transactions and other events from sources other than stockholders. Comprehensive (loss) income is reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity and Comprehensive Income.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging:

The Company
follows SFAS No. 133, “

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities”

(“SFAS No. 133”), as amended and interpreted, which requires that all derivatives be recorded on the balance sheet at fair
value. Gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives would be accounted for depending on the use of the derivative instrument and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting.

For a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the derivative’s gain or
loss is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive (loss) income and subsequently amortized into net earnings when the hedged exposure affects net earnings. Cash flow hedges related to anticipated transactions are designated and
documented at the inception of each hedge by matching the terms of the contract to the underlying transaction.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company classifies the cash flows from hedging transactions in the same categories as the cash flows from the respective hedged items. Once established,
cash flow hedges are generally recorded in other comprehensive (loss) income until maturity, unless an anticipated transaction is no longer likely to occur, and subsequently amortized into net earnings when the hedged exposure affects net earnings.
Discontinued or dedesignated cash flow hedges are immediately settled with counterparties, and the related accumulated derivative gains or losses are recognized into net earnings on the consolidated financial statements. Forward contract
effectiveness for cash flow hedges is calculated by comparing the fair value of the contract to the change in value of the anticipated transaction using forward rates on a monthly basis. The Company also has entered into foreign currency forward
contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes. These contracts are recorded at fair value, with the changes in fair value recognized into net earnings on the consolidated financial statements.

Recent Issued Accounting Pronouncements:

In
December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007),

“Business Combinations”

(“SFAS No. 141(R)”). SFAS No. 141(R) establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in
its financial statements significant aspects of a business combination. Under SFAS No. 141(R), acquisition costs will generally be expensed as incurred; noncontrolling interests will be valued at fair value at the acquisition date; in-process
research and development will be recorded at fair value as an indefinite-lived intangible asset at the acquisition date; restructuring costs associated with a business combination will generally be expensed subsequent to the acquisition date; and
changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally will affect income tax expense. SFAS No. 141(R) amends SFAS No. 109,

“Accounting for Income Taxes,”

such
that adjustments made to valuation allowances on deferred taxes and acquired tax contingencies associated with acquisitions that closed prior to the effective date of SFAS No. 141(R) would also apply the provisions of SFAS No. 141(R). SFAS
No. 141(R) also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination. Early adoption is not permitted. SFAS No. 141(R) is effective on a prospective basis for all
business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual period subsequent to December 15, 2008, with the exception of the accounting for valuation allowances on deferred taxes and acquired tax
contingencies. The Company will be required to adopt SFAS No. 141(R) in the first quarter of fiscal year 2009. The Company is currently evaluating the requirements of SFAS No. 141(R) and has not yet determined the impact of its adoption on
its consolidated financial statements.

In December 2007, the
FASB issued SFAS No.    160,

“Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements—an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51”

(“SFAS No. 160”). SFAS No. 160
establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent, the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest, changes in a
parent’s ownership interest, and the valuation of retained noncontrolling equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. SFAS No. 160 also establishes disclosure requirements that clearly identify and distinguish between the
interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners. The Company will be required to adopt SFAS No. 160 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2009. The Company is currently evaluating the requirements of SFAS No. 160 and
has not yet determined the impact, if any, of its adoption on its consolidated financial statements.

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161,

“Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities—an amendment of FASB
Statement No. 133”

(“SFAS No. 161”). SFAS No. 161 is intended to improve transparency in financial reporting by requiring enhanced disclosures of an entity’s derivative instruments and hedging activities and
their effects on the entity’s financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. SFAS No. 161 applies to all derivative instruments within the scope of SFAS No. 133, as well as related hedged items, bifurcated derivatives, and
nonderivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments. SFAS No. 161 establishes principles and requirements for how an entity identifies derivative instruments and related hedged items that affect its financial
position, financial performance, and cash flows.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

SFAS No. 161 also establishes disclosure requirements that the fair values of derivative instruments and their gains and losses are disclosed in a
tabular format, that derivative features which are credit-risk related be disclosed to provide clarification to an entity’s liquidity and cross-referencing within footnotes. The Company will be required to adopt SFAS No. 161 in the first
quarter of fiscal year 2009. SFAS No. 161 provides only disclosure requirements; the adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

In April 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. 142-3,

“Determination of
the Useful Life of Intangible Assets”

(“FSP No. 142-3”). FSP No. 142-3 amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized
intangible asset under SFAS No. 142. The objective of FSP No. 142-3 is to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS No. 142 and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the
fair value of the asset under SFAS No. 141(R) and other accounting principles. FSP No. 142-3 applies to all intangible assets, whether acquired in a business combination or otherwise, and early adoption is prohibited. The Company will be
required to adopt FSP No. 142-3 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2009. The Company is currently evaluating the requirements of FSP No. 142-3 and has not yet determined the impact of its adoption on its consolidated financial statements.

In December 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. 132(R)-1,

“Employers’ Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets”

(“FSP No. 132(R)-1”), which requires additional disclosures for employers’ pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets. Pension and
other postretirement benefit plan assets were not included within the scope of SFAS No. 157,

“Fair Value Measurements”

(“SFAS No. 157”). FSP No. 132(R)-1 requires employers to disclose information about fair
value measurements of plan assets similar to the disclosures required under SFAS No. 157, including the investment policies and strategies for the major categories of plan assets, and significant concentrations of risk within plan assets. The
Company will be required to adopt FSP No. 132(R)-1 as of December 31, 2009. FSP No. 132(R)-1 provides only disclosure requirements; the adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial
statements.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

acquired cash. In January 2009, the Company received approximately $1.8 million for the majority of the unclaimed shares of ViaCell. The excess of the
purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets has been allocated to goodwill, none of which is tax deductible. The Company reports the operations for this acquisition within the results of the Company’s Life and Analytical
Sciences segment from the acquisition date.

Following the
ViaCell acquisition, the Company committed to a preliminary plan of integration of certain ViaCell activities that included workforce reductions and the partial closure of an excess facility. Through the second quarter of fiscal year 2008, the
Company recorded a $1.9 million liability for severance and the partial closure of an excess facility with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill in accordance with EITF Issue No. 95-3,

“Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a
Purchase Business Combination”

(“EITF No. 95-3”). The Company finalized the integration plan and all actions related to this plan as of June 29, 2008.

Following the ViaCell acquisition, the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) approved a plan to sell the ViaCyte

SM

and Cellular Therapy Technology businesses that were acquired with ViaCell. The ViaCyte

SM

business focused on the
development of a proprietary media intended for the cryopreservation of human unfertilized oocytes. The Cellular Therapy Technology business focused on the development and sale of unrestricted somatic stem cell products which are derived from
umbilical cord blood. The Company determined that both businesses did not strategically fit with the other products offered by the Life and Analytical Sciences segment. The Company also determined that without investing capital into the operations
of both businesses, the Company could not effectively compete with larger companies that focus on the market for such products. After careful consideration, the Company decided in the second quarter of fiscal year 2008 to close the
ViaCyte

SM

and Cellular Therapy Technology businesses, recording a pre-tax loss of $8.0 million for severance and facility closure costs. The Company
has classified the results and closure of the ViaCyte

SM

and Cellular Therapy Technology businesses as discontinued operations in the accompanying
financial statements. See Note 7, below, for additional details.

approximately $2.8 million. The operations for these acquired intangible assets and investments are reported within the results of the Company’s Life and Analytical Sciences segment from the acquisition date. Purchased intangible assets are
amortized over their estimated useful lives based upon the economic value. See Note 13, below, for additional details.

Acquisition of remaining minority interest of PerkinElmer India Pvt. Ltd.

In June 2007, the Company acquired the remaining
minority interest in PerkinElmer India Pvt. Ltd. (“PKI India”), a direct sales, service and marketing operation targeting India’s life science and analytical instrumentation markets, from Labindia Instruments Pvt. Ltd. The acquisition
establishes PKI India as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The Company paid approximately $1.3 million in cash for this transaction plus potential additional consideration of approximately $0.7 million, of which the Company paid $0.2 million
during the fiscal year 2007. The Company paid the remaining $0.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets has been allocated to goodwill, none of which is tax
deductible. The Company reports the operations for this acquisition within the results of the Company’s Life and Analytical Sciences segment from the acquisition date.

Acquisition of Improvision Ltd.

In March 2007, the Company acquired the stock of Improvision
Ltd. (“Improvision”), a leading provider of cellular imaging software and integrated hardware solutions used in life sciences research. The Company expects that the addition of Improvision’s imaging and analysis software to the
Company’s high content screening systems will provide customers with powerful imaging solutions for analyzing cellular events, from real-time imaging of live cells to rapid high content screening of multiple samples. The Company paid
approximately $23.6 million in cash for this transaction plus potential additional contingent consideration, which management expects to be immaterial to the Company. During fiscal year 2007, the Company paid $0.6 million for net working capital
adjustments. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets has been allocated to goodwill, none of which is tax deductible. The Company reports the operations for this acquisition within the results of the
Company’s Life and Analytical Sciences segment from the acquisition date.

Acquisition of Euroscreen Products S.A.

In January 2007, the Company
acquired the stock of Euroscreen Products S.A. (“Euroscreen”), a developer of the AequoScreen

™

cellular assay platform. The AequoScreen

™

platform from Euroscreen is based on an innovative luminescence technology that generates higher quality data, while reducing the number of false positives in G protein-coupled receptor (“GPCR”) screening
applications. The Company paid approximately $18.1 million in cash for this transaction. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets has been allocated to goodwill, none of which is tax deductible. The Company
reports the operations for this acquisition within the results of the Company’s Life and Analytical Sciences segment from the acquisition date.

Acquisition of Evotec Technologies GmbH.

In January 2007, the Company acquired the stock of Evotec Technologies GmbH
(“Evotec”). The acquisition is intended to allow the Company to provide its customers in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and academic arenas with Evotec’s high content screening instruments and software. These analysis tools
determine the composition of cells and cell structure, a critical step in moving potential drug targets quickly through the discovery process. The Company paid approximately $33.0 million in cash for this transaction, which was paid in fiscal year
2006. During fiscal year 2007, the Company received $1.2 million for net working capital adjustments. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets has been allocated to goodwill, none of which is tax
deductible. The Company reports the operations for this acquisition within the results of the Company’s Life and Analytical Sciences segment from the acquisition date.

The acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. Allocation of the purchase price for the
acquisitions was based on estimates of the fair value of the net assets acquired, and is subject to adjustment



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

upon finalization of the purchase price allocation. The fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on
management’s estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. The Company records the excess purchase price over those assigned
values as goodwill. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment. Purchased intangibles with finite lives will be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives. See Note 13, below, for
additional details.

In-process research and development
(“IPR&D”) charges represent incomplete acquired research and development projects that have not reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future use as of the acquisition date. Technological feasibility is established
when an enterprise has completed all planning, designing, coding, and testing activities that are necessary to establish that a product can be produced to meet its design specifications including functions, features, and technical performance
requirements. On the date of the acquisitions of Evotec and Euroscreen there were multiple IPR&D efforts underway at each company for certain current and future product lines. In determining the value of in-process projects, the Company
considers, among other factors, the in-process projects’ stage of completion, the complexity of the work completed as of the acquisition date, the costs already incurred, the projected costs to complete, the contribution of core technologies
and other acquired assets, the expected introduction date, and the estimated useful life of the technology. For these acquisitions, the Company utilized the discounted cash flow method to value the IPR&D, using a discount rate equivalent to the
relative risk of the asset, including the uncertainty of technological feasibility and successful launch. This approach determines fair value by estimating the after-tax cash flows attributable to an in-process project over its useful life, and then
discounting these after-tax cash flows back to a present value. For the acquisitions of Evotec and Euroscreen, the Company estimated the value of the IPR&D to be $0.2 million and $1.3 million, respectively. The Company believes that the
estimated purchased research and development amounts so determined, represent the fair value at the date of the acquisitions, and the amount represents management’s best estimate of the amount a third party would pay in the aggregate for the
projects. The fair value of acquired in-process research and development costs was expensed as of the acquisition date as the projects underway at Evotec and Euroscreen had not reached technological feasibility and were determined to have no
alternative future use.

In connection with the purchase price
and related allocations for acquisitions, the Company estimates the fair value of deferred revenue assumed with its acquisitions. The estimated fair value of deferred revenue is determined by the legal performance obligation at the date of
acquisition, and is generally based on the nature of the activities to be performed and the related costs to be incurred after consummation. The fair value of an assumed liability related to deferred revenue is estimated based on the current market
cost of fulfilling the obligation, plus a normal profit margin thereon. The estimated costs to fulfill the deferred revenue are based on the historical direct costs related to providing the services. The Company does not include any costs associated
with selling effort, research and development, or the related fulfillment margins on these costs. In most acquisitions, profit associated with selling effort is excluded because the acquired entities would have concluded the selling effort on the
support contracts prior to the acquisition date. The estimated research and development costs are not included in the fair value determination, as these costs are not deemed to represent a legal obligation at the time of acquisition. The sum of the
costs and operating income approximates, in theory, the amount that the Company would be required to pay a third-party to assume the obligation.

As of December 28, 2008, all purchase price and related allocations are final with the exception of the Arnel acquisition which was preliminary as of
December 28, 2008. The Arnel purchase price and related allocations may be revised as a result of adjustments made to the purchase price, as well as additional information regarding assets and liabilities assumed, including contingent
liabilities, deferred taxes, and revisions of preliminary estimates of fair values made at the date of purchase. The Company is not aware of any information that indicates the final purchase price allocation will differ materially from the
preliminary estimates, and the Company expects to complete any outstanding asset valuations no later than one year from the date of acquisition.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The components of the purchase prices and allocations for the acquisitions completed in fiscal year
2008 are as follows:

The components of the
purchase prices and allocations for the acquisitions completed in fiscal year 2007 are as follows:

Current assets include $0.7 million, $0.9 million and $0.2 million of purchase price accounting basis adjustments to inventory, net, to reflect the fair value-based valuation from
the Evotec, Euroscreen and Improvision acquisitions, respectively.

Restructuring and Lease Charges (Reversals), net

The Company has undertaken a series of restructuring actions related to the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and the integration of its business
units. Restructuring actions were recorded in accordance with SFAS No. 146.

A description of the restructuring plans and the activity recorded are as follows:

The purpose of the restructuring plans approved in the third quarter of fiscal year 2008 and fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007, detailed below, was
principally to shift resources into geographic regions and product lines that are more consistent with the Company’s growth strategy. The pre-tax restructuring activities associated with these plans have been reported as restructuring expenses
as a component of operating expenses from continuing operations. The Company expects the impact of immediate and future cost savings from these restructuring activities on operating results and cash flows to be negligible, as the Company has
incurred and will incur offsetting costs.

Q3 2008 Plan

During the third quarter of fiscal year 2008, the
Company’s management approved a plan to shift resources into product lines that are more consistent with the Company’s growth strategy (the “Q3 2008 Plan”). As a result of the Q3 2008 Plan, the Company recognized a $7.5 million
pre-tax restructuring charge in the Life and Analytical Sciences segment related to a workforce reduction from reorganization activities and the closure of excess facilities. The Company also recognized a $0.3 million pre-tax restructuring charge in
the Optoelectronics segment related to a workforce reduction from reorganization activities. All actions related to the Q3 2008 Plan were completed by September 28, 2008.

The following table summarizes the Q3 2008 Plan activity:

All employees have
been severed and the Company anticipates that the remaining payments of $2.7 million for workforce reductions will be completed by the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010. The Company also anticipates that the remaining payments of $1.2
million for the closure of the excess facilities will be paid through fiscal year 2011, in accordance with the terms of the applicable leases.

Q4 2007 Plan

During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007, the Company’s management approved a plan to shift resources into geographic regions and product lines
that are more consistent with the Company’s growth strategy (the “Q4 2007 Plan”). As a result of the Q4 2007 Plan, the Company recognized a $4.8 million pre-tax restructuring charge in the Life and Analytical Sciences segment related
to a workforce reduction from reorganization activities. The Company also recognized a $0.5 million pre-tax restructuring charge in the Optoelectronics segment related to a workforce reduction. All actions related to the Q4 2007 Plan were completed
by December 30, 2007.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The following table summarizes the Q4 2007 Plan activity:

During fiscal year
2008, the Company recorded a reversal of $0.3 million primarily due to lower than expected employee separation costs associated with the Company’s Life and Analytical Sciences segment. All employees have been severed and the Company anticipates
that the remaining payments of $0.6 million for workforce reductions will be completed by the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2009.

ViaCell Plan

Following the ViaCell acquisition, the Company committed to a preliminary plan of integration of certain ViaCell activities that included workforce
reductions and the partial closure of an excess facility (the “ViaCell Plan”). The Company finalized the integration plan and all actions related to this plan as of June 29, 2008, through which the Company recorded a $1.9 million
liability for severance and the partial closure of an excess facility with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill in accordance with EITF No. 95-3.

The following table summarizes the ViaCell Plan activity:

All employees have
been severed and the Company anticipates that the remaining payments of approximately $0.2 million for workforce reductions will be completed by the end of the second quarter of fiscal year 2009.

Previous Restructuring and Integration Plans

The principal actions of the restructuring and integration plans from the
fiscal years 2001 through the first quarter of fiscal year 2007 were workforce reductions related to the integration of the Company’s Life Sciences and Analytical Instruments businesses, which is now the Company’s Life and Analytical
Sciences segment, in order to reduce costs and achieve operational efficiencies as well as workforce reductions in both the Life and Analytical Sciences and Optoelectronics segments by shifting resources into geographic regions and product

lines that are more consistent with the Company’s growth strategy. During fiscal year 2008, the Company paid $0.8 million related to these plans and
recorded a reversal of $1.0 million related to lower than expected costs associated with severance for several of these plans. As of December 28, 2008, the Company had approximately $1.3 million of remaining liabilities associated with
restructuring and integration plans, primarily relating to remaining lease obligations related to those closed facilities in the Life and Analytical Sciences segment. The remaining terms of these leases vary in length and will be paid through fiscal
year 2011.

Lease Charges

To facilitate the sale of a business in fiscal year 2001, the Company was
required to guarantee the obligations that the buyer of the business assumed related to the lease for the building in which the business operates. The lease obligations continue through March 2011. While the Company assigned its interest in the
lease to the buyer at the time of the sale of the business, in the event the buyer defaults under the lease, the Company is responsible for all remaining lease payments and certain other building related expenses. As an additional measure to
facilitate the sale of the business, the Company obtained a letter of credit as partial security for a loan to the buyer, which could have been drawn upon by the buyer’s lender in the event the buyer was delinquent in repayment of the loan.
During the second quarter of fiscal year 2007, the lessor of the building began the process to evict the buyer as a result of unpaid lease payments and building expenses and sought reimbursement from the Company. As a result of this action, the
Company recorded a charge of $4.5 million related to payments for this lease obligation and the potential drawdown of the letter of credit. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2007, the buyer completed a recapitalization of the business with
another lender. The proceeds of the recapitalization were used to pay off the remaining balance on the original securitized loan, as well as to make certain payments to the landlord for back rent and other obligations arising under the lease. The
Company was also released from its obligation under the letter of credit on the original securitized loan. As a result of these actions, the Company recorded a reversal of $1.4 million related to payments for this lease obligation and the release of
the letter of credit in the third quarter of fiscal year 2007. The buyer made its required payments for lease obligations and building expenses through June 2008 and as a result, the Company recorded an additional reversal of $0.4 million.

The buyer filed for bankruptcy protection on October 27,
2008 and was delinquent in making both its lease payments and payments for certain building expenses in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2008, requiring the Company to make payments of $0.4 million during fiscal year 2008 and $0.4
million to date in fiscal year 2009. As of December 28, 2008, the Company is still responsible for the remaining accrual of $2.4 million, which relates to the remaining lease and building obligations through March 2011, reduced by estimated
sublease rentals reasonably expected to be obtained for the property.

Note 4:

Impairment of Assets

The Company recorded a charge of $3.2 million for the impairment of assets during fiscal year 2006 within the Life and Analytical Sciences segment. This
impairment included a $2.8 million loss related to a manufacturing facility, and a $0.4 million loss on impairment of a license agreement.

Income Taxes

The Company adopted FIN No. 48 effective January 1, 2007. As a result of the adoption of FIN No. 48, the Company adjusted the carrying
value of its uncertain tax positions and reduced its accrued liabilities by $3.6 million, which was accounted for as an increase to retained earnings as of January 1, 2007. As of the adoption date, the Company had gross tax effected
unrecognized tax benefits of $48.5 million, of which $36.0 million, if recognized, would affect the continuing operations effective tax rate. The remaining amount, if recognized, would affect goodwill and discontinued operations. However, upon the
adoption of SFAS No. 141(R), changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally will affect income tax expense, including those associated with acquisitions that closed prior to
the effective date of SFAS No. 141(R). The Company had accrued interest, net of tax benefits, and penalties related to the unrecognized tax benefits of $7.3 million, which is not included in the unrecognized tax benefits of $48.5 million.

The Company regularly reviews its tax positions in each
significant taxing jurisdiction in the process of evaluating its unrecognized tax benefits as required by FIN No. 48. Adjustments are made to the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits when: (i) facts and circumstances regarding a tax
position change, causing a change in management’s judgment regarding that tax position; (ii) a tax position is effectively settled with a tax authority; and/or (iii) the statute of limitations expires regarding a tax position.

The tabular reconciliation of the total amounts of
unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

In accordance with FIN
No. 48, the Company will continue to classify interest and penalties as a component of income tax expense. At December 28, 2008, the Company had accrued approximately $4.5 million and



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

$6.4 million in interest and penalties, respectively. During fiscal year 2008, the Company recognized approximately $0.1 million in interest and a
reversal of $0.5 million in penalties in its total tax provision. During fiscal year 2007, the Company recognized approximately $2.1 million and $3.4 million in interest and penalties, respectively, in its total tax provision. At December 28,
2008, the Company had gross tax effected unrecognized tax benefits of $41.0 million, of which $33.8 million, if recognized, would affect the continuing operations effective tax rate. Of the remaining amount, if recognized, $1.9 million would affect
discontinued operations and $5.3 million would relate to acquisitions. However, upon the Company’s adoption of SFAS No. 141(R) in the first quarter of fiscal year 2009, changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax
uncertainties after the acquisition date generally will affect income tax expense, including those associated with acquisitions that closed prior to the effective date of SFAS No. 141(R).

At December 28, 2008, the Company had $10.4 million of FIN No. 48
accrued tax liabilities, including accrued interest, net of tax benefits, and penalties, which should be resolved within the next year as a result of the completion of various audits. A portion of the FIN No. 48 accrued tax liabilities could
affect the continuing operations effective tax rate depending on the ultimate resolution; however, the Company cannot quantify an estimated range at this time. The Company is subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as to income tax of
numerous state and foreign jurisdictions.

During fiscal year
2005, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service concluded its audit of the Company’s federal income taxes for the years 1999 through 2002. There was a single open issue related to this audit which the Company favorably resolved during the fourth
quarter of fiscal year 2007. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2008, the Company effectively settled several income tax audits worldwide, including in Canada, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States covering various years
ranging from 1998 through 2005. The closing of these audits resulted in the recognition of $15.6 million of income tax benefits in continuing operations and $8.5 million of income tax benefits in discontinued operations. In addition, tax years
ranging from 1998 through 2008 remain open to examination by various state and foreign tax jurisdictions (such as China, Indonesia, the Philippines and the United Kingdom) in which the Company has significant business operations. The tax years under
examination vary by jurisdiction.

The components of income

The tax effects of temporary differences and attributes that gave rise to deferred income tax assets
and liabilities as of December 28, 2008 and December 30, 2007 were as follows:

At December 28,
2008, the Company had state net operating loss carryforwards of $279.3 million, foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $152.2 million, state tax credit carryforwards of $3.8 million general business tax credit carryforwards of $1.9 million, and
foreign tax credit carryforwards of $21.9 million—subject to expiration in years ranging from 2009 to 2028, and without expiration for certain foreign net operating loss carryforwards and certain state credit carryforwards. At December 28,
2008, the Company also had U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $88.9 million and federal credit carryforwards of approximately $3.4 million as a result of acquisitions made during fiscal years 2007 and 2008. The
utilization of these losses and credits is subject to annual limitations based on Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. These losses and credits will expire in fiscal years 2009 through 2026. Valuation allowances
generally take into consideration limitations imposed upon the use of the tax attributes and reduce the value of such items to the likely net realizable amount. Based on the judgment of the Company, and consistent with prior years, full valuation
allowances have been established against these tax attributes with the exception of the acquired federal net operating loss carryforwards, certain foreign net operating loss carryforwards and the federal research and experimental tax credit
carryforwards that have been determined to be more likely than not to be realized. The tax benefit of the reversal of the valuation allowance associated with the Company’s research and experimental credits was reported as part of the gain on
disposal of discontinued operations in fiscal year 2005. Included in the foreign tax credit carryforwards and corresponding valuation allowance are $15.2 million of credits which, if utilized, will result in a credit to equity and discontinued
operations rather than a reduction of the income tax provision.

Current deferred tax assets of $44.7 million and $45.9 million were included in other current assets at December 28, 2008 and December 30, 2007, respectively. Long-term deferred tax assets of $6.0 million and $7.2 million
were included in other assets at December 28, 2008 and December 30, 2007, respectively. Long-term deferred tax liabilities of $17.7 million and $67.6 million were included in other long-term liabilities at December 28, 2008 and
December 30, 2007, respectively. Additionally, $10.2 million and $10.8 million of net deferred tax liabilities were recorded through other comprehensive (loss) income as of December 28, 2008 and December 30, 2007, respectively, primarily as a
result of the adoption of SFAS No. 158 in fiscal year 2006.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company generally considers all earnings generated outside of the United States to be permanently
reinvested offshore. Pursuant to APB Opinion No. 23 and related interpretations with respect to corporate earnings permanently reinvested offshore, the Company therefore does not accrue U.S. tax for the repatriation of its foreign earnings it
considers to be permanently reinvested outside the United States. However, the Company regularly reviews its global cash needs and may repatriate foreign earnings when necessary, and when these earnings can be distributed in cash and in a tax
efficient manner. As of December 28, 2008, the amount of foreign earnings for which no U.S. tax cost has been provided was approximately $493.0 million. The U.S. tax cost has not been determined due to the fact that it is not practicable to do
so at this time.

Note 7:

Discontinued Operations

As part of its continuing efforts to focus on higher growth opportunities, the Company has discontinued certain businesses. The Company has accounted for
these businesses as discontinued operations in accordance with SFAS No. 144 and, accordingly, has presented the results of operations and related cash flows as discontinued operations for all periods presented. The assets and liabilities of
these businesses have been presented separately, and are reflected within the assets and liabilities from discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 28, 2008 and December 30, 2007.

The Company recorded the following gains and losses, which have been reported
as the (loss) gain on disposition of discontinued operations during the three years ended:

As part of the new
strategic business alignment into the Human Health and Environmental Health segments and the Company’s continued efforts to focus on higher growth opportunities, in December 2008 the Company’s management approved separate plans to divest
its Photonics and Photoflash businesses within the Optoelectronics segment. The Company’s Photonics and Photoflash products and technologies include xenon flashtubes and intense pulsed light. These products are used in a variety of applications
including mobile phones and laser machine tools. The Company is actively marketing and is currently committed to a plan to sell both of these businesses.

In addition, during December 2008, the Company’s management approved the shut down of certain instrument businesses within the Life and Analytical
Sciences segment: Cellular Screening Fluorescence and Luminescence workstations, Analytical Proteomics Instruments and Proteomics and Genomics Instruments. The Cellular Fluorescence and Luminescence workstations business included products focused on
cellular imaging for kinetic and glow luminescence assays. The Analytical Proteomics Instruments business and the Proteomics and Genomics Instruments businesses included products for bioimaging, mass spectrometers for protein



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

identification, high resolution multi-color fluorescence gel imagers, spot detection and spot excision instruments, as well as laser scanners for slide based
microarray image analysis. The Company continues to serve the Cellular Screening, Proteomics and Genomics consumable and reagents markets. The shut down of the Cellular Screening Fluorescence and Luminescence workstations business, Analytical
Proteomics Instruments business, and Proteomics and Genomics Instruments business in December 2008 resulted in a $4.8 million loss related to lease and severance costs and the reduction of fixed assets and inventory to net realizable value.

Following the ViaCell acquisition, the Board approved a plan to sell the ViaCyte

SM

and Cellular Therapy Technology businesses that
were acquired with ViaCell. The ViaCyte

SM

business focused on the development of a proprietary media intended for the cryopreservation of human
unfertilized oocytes. The Cellular Therapy Technology business focused on the development and sale of unrestricted somatic stem cell products which are derived from umbilical cord blood. The Company determined that both businesses do not
strategically fit with the other products offered by the Life and Analytical Sciences segment. The Company also determined that without investing capital into the operations of both businesses, the Company could not effectively compete with larger
companies that focus on the market for such products. After careful consideration, the Company decided in the second quarter of fiscal year 2008 to shut down the ViaCyte

SM

and Cellular Therapy Technology businesses, recording a pre-tax loss of $8.0 million for severance and facility closure costs.

During the third quarter of fiscal year 2008, the Company settled various income tax audits worldwide for years ranging from
1998 through 2005 as discussed in Note 6. The closing of these audits resulted in the recognition of $8.5 million of income tax benefits in discontinued operations.

During fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company settled various commitments related to the divestiture of other
discontinued operations and recognized a pre-tax loss of $0.4 million in fiscal year 2008, a pre-tax loss of $1.0 million in fiscal year 2007 and a pre-tax gain of $3.3 million in fiscal year 2006. During fiscal years 2007 and 2006, the Company
substantially completed the remediation of an environmental matter within the Lithography business, resulting in recognition of pre-tax losses of $0.7 million in fiscal year 2007 and $1.7 million in fiscal year 2006. In February 2006, the Company
sold substantially all of the assets of its Semiconductor business for approximately $26.5 million, subject to a net working capital adjustment, plus potential additional contingent consideration. A pre-tax gain of $3.8 million, exclusive of
additional contingent consideration, was recognized in fiscal year 2006.

Summary operating results of the discontinued operations for the periods prior to disposition were as follows:

Earnings per Share

Basic earnings per share was computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period less restricted
unvested shares. Diluted earnings per share was computed by



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding plus all potentially dilutive common stock equivalents, primarily shares
issuable upon the exercise of stock options using the treasury stock method. The following table reconciles the number of shares utilized in the earnings per share calculations:

Antidilutive
securities include outstanding stock options with exercise prices and average unrecognized compensation cost in excess of the average fair market value of common stock for the related period. Antidilutive options were excluded from the calculation
of diluted net income per share and could become dilutive in the future.

Note 9:

Accounts Receivable, net

Accounts receivable were net of reserves for doubtful accounts of $23.5 million and $16.2 million as of December 28, 2008 and December 30, 2007,
respectively.

During fiscal year 2001, the Company established
a wholly owned consolidated subsidiary to maintain a receivables purchase agreement with a third party financial institution. Under this arrangement, the Company sold, on a revolving basis, certain of the Company’s accounts receivable balances
to the consolidated subsidiary which simultaneously sold an undivided percentage ownership interest in designated pools of receivables to a third party financial institution. As collections reduce the balance of sold accounts receivable, new
receivables are sold. The Company’s consolidated subsidiary retains the risk of credit loss on the receivables. Accordingly, the full amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts has been provided for on the Company’s balance sheets. The
aggregate amount of receivables sold and outstanding with the third party financial institution may not exceed $65.0 million. Under the terms of this arrangement, the Company’s consolidated subsidiary retains collection and administrative
responsibilities for the balances. The amount of receivables sold to the consolidated subsidiary was $72.8 million as of December 28, 2008 and $79.0 million as of December 30, 2007. At December 28, 2008 and December 30, 2007, an
undivided interest of $40.0 million and $45.0 million, respectively, in the receivables had been sold to the third party financial institution under this arrangement. The remaining interest in receivables of $32.8 million and $34.0 million that were
sold to and held by the consolidated subsidiary were included in accounts receivable in the consolidated financial statements at December 28, 2008 and December 30, 2007, respectively.

The agreement requires the third party financial institution to be paid
interest during the period from the date the receivable is sold to its maturity date. At December 28, 2008, the effective interest rate was LIBOR plus approximately 220 basis points. The servicing fees received constitute adequate compensation
for services performed. No servicing asset or liability is therefore recorded. The agreement also includes conditions that require the Company to maintain a senior unsecured credit rating of BB or above, as defined by Standard & Poor’s
Rating Services, and Ba2 or above, as defined by Moody’s Investors Service. At December 28, 2008, the Company had a senior unsecured credit rating of BBB, with a stable outlook from Standard & Poor’s Rating Services, and of
Baa3, with a stable outlook from Moody’s Investors Service. In January 2009, the Company’s consolidated subsidiary entered into an agreement to extend the term of the accounts receivable securitization

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

Goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing using the guidance and criteria described in SFAS No. 142

.

The impairment test consists of a
two-step process. The first step is the comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if the carrying value exceeds the fair value. The second step measures the amount of an impairment loss, and is only
performed if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit. The annual impairment assessment is performed by the Company on the later of January 1 or the first day of each fiscal year. This same impairment test is performed at
other times during the course of the year should an event occur which suggests that the recoverability of goodwill should be reconsidered. Through fiscal year 2008, the Company assessed the annual impairment testing using the Life and Analytical
Sciences and Optoelectronics reporting units. The Company completed the annual impairment test for these reporting units using a measurement date of December 28, 2008 and January 1, 2008, and concluded based on the first step of the
process that there was no goodwill impairment.

The changes in
the carrying amount of goodwill for fiscal years 2008 and 2007 are as follows:

Debt

Amended Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility.

On August 13, 2007, the Company entered into an amended and restated senior unsecured revolving credit facility providing for a facility through
August 13, 2012, which amended and restated in its entirety the Company’s previous senior revolving credit agreement dated as of October 31, 2005. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2008, the Company exercised its option to
increase the amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility to $650.0 million from $500.0 million. Letters of credit in the aggregate amount of approximately $14.0 million were issued under the previous facility, which are treated as issued
under the amended facility. The Company uses the amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes, which may include working capital, refinancing existing indebtedness, capital expenditures, share repurchases,
acquisitions and strategic alliances. The interest rates under the amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility are based on the Eurocurrency rate at the time of borrowing plus a margin or the base rate from time to time. The base rate is the
higher of (i) the corporate base rate announced from time to time by Bank of America, N.A. and (ii) the Federal Funds rate plus 50 basis points. The Company may allocate all or a portion of its indebtedness under the amended senior
unsecured revolving credit facility to interest based upon the Eurocurrency rate plus a margin or the base rate. The Eurocurrency margin as of December 28, 2008 was 40 basis points. The weighted average Eurocurrency interest rate as of
December 28, 2008 was 0.63%, resulting in a weighted average effective Eurocurrency rate, including the margin, of 1.03%. The Company had drawn down approximately $359.0 million of borrowings in U.S. Dollars under the facility as of
December 28, 2008, with interest based on the above described Eurocurrency rate. The agreement for the facility contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants and events of default customary for financings of this type, and which are
consistent with those financial covenants contained in the Company’s previous senior revolving credit agreement. The financial covenants in the Company’s amended and restated senior unsecured revolving credit facility include
debt-to-capital ratios and a contingent maximum total leverage ratio, applicable if the Company’s credit rating is down-graded below investment grade. At all times during fiscal year 2008, the Company was in compliance with all applicable
covenants, and anticipate being in compliance for the duration of the term of the credit facility.

Unsecured Interim Credit Facility.

On November 14, 2007, the Company entered into a $300.0 million unsecured interim credit facility. The
Company entered into this unsecured interim credit facility in order to pay the purchase price and transactional expenses of the ViaCell acquisition. This unsecured interim credit facility matured on March 31, 2008, at which point all amounts
outstanding were due in full. On March 28, 2008, the Company paid in full the outstanding balance on the unsecured interim credit facility of $300.0 million. The source of funds for the repayment was comprised of cash and cash equivalents held
by the Company, and borrowings under the Company’s amended and restated senior unsecured revolving credit facility.

6% Senior Unsecured Notes.

On May 30, 2008, the Company issued and sold seven-year senior notes at a rate of 6% with a face value of
$150.0 million and received $150.0 million in gross proceeds from the issuance. The debt, which matures in May 2015, is unsecured. Interest on the 6% senior notes is payable semi-annually on May 30th and November 30th. The
Company may redeem some or all of its 6% senior notes at any time in an amount not less than 10% of the original aggregate principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, plus the applicable make-whole amount. The financial covenants in the
Company’s 6% senior notes include debt-to-capital ratios which, if the Company’s credit rating is down-graded below investment grade, would be replaced by a contingent maximum total leverage ratio. At all times during fiscal year
2008, the Company was in compliance with all applicable covenants, and anticipate being in compliance for the duration of the term of the notes.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007, the Company entered into forward interest rate contracts with notional amounts totaling $300.0 million and
a weighted average interest rate of 4.25%. These contracts were intended to hedge movements in interest rates prior to the Company’s expected debt issuance. In May 2008, the



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Company settled forward interest rate contracts with notional amounts totaling $150.0 million, upon the issuance of the Company’s 6% senior unsecured
notes. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008, the Company concluded that the remaining portion of the expected debt issuance, with a notional amount totaling $150.0 million, was no longer probable. As a result of the debt issuance no longer
being probable, the Company discontinued and settled the forward interest rate contracts with notional amounts totaling $150.0 million and recognized derivative losses of $17.5 million, in interest and other expense.

Before amortization expense, the Company had accumulated derivative losses of
$8.4 million, net of taxes of $5.4 million, in other comprehensive (loss) income as of December 28, 2008 and $5.3 million, net of taxes of $3.5 million, as of December 30, 2007, related to these cash flow hedges. The derivative losses
are amortized into interest expense when the hedged exposure affects interest expense. During fiscal year 2008, $1.2 million of these derivative losses were amortized into interest expense.

Once established, cash flow hedges are generally recorded in other
comprehensive (loss) income until maturity unless an anticipated transaction is no longer likely to occur. Discontinued or dedesignated cash flow hedges are immediately settled with counterparties, and the related accumulated derivative gains or
losses are recognized into interest expense on the consolidated financial statements. The Company did not recognize any ineffectiveness during fiscal year 2008 or fiscal year 2007.

The following table summarizes the maturities of the Company’s indebtedness at December 28, 2008:

Employee Benefit Plans

The Company adopted the balance sheet recognition requirements of SFAS No. 158 on December 31, 2006, which required the Company to recognize a
net liability or asset and an offsetting adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income to report the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans.

Savings Plan:

The Company has a 401k Savings
Plan for the benefit of all qualified U.S. employees. Under this plan, the Company’s Life and Analytical Sciences and Corporate Headquarters employees receive matching contributions in the amount equal to 100% of the first 5% of compensation up
to applicable Internal Revenue Service limits. For Optoelectronics employees, matching contributions are made in the amount equal to 55% of the first 6% of compensation up to applicable Internal Revenue Service limits. The 401k Savings Plan was
amended as of January 1, 2009 so that Optoelectronics employees, other than those eligible for the defined benefit plan, will receive matching contributions of 100% of the first 5% of compensation up to applicable Internal Revenue Service
limits. Optoelectronics employees eligible for the defined benefit plan will continue to receive matching contributions of 55% of the first 6% of compensation. Savings plan expense was $9.7 million in fiscal year 2008, $7.8 million in fiscal year
2007 and $7.6 million in fiscal year 2006.

Pension
Plans:

The Company has a defined benefit pension plan covering some U.S. employees and non-U.S. pension plans for some non-U.S. employees. The principal U.S. defined benefit pension plan was closed to new hires effective
January 31, 2001, and benefits for those employed by the Company’s former Life Sciences businesses within the Company’s Life and Analytical Sciences segment were frozen as of that date. Plan benefits were frozen as of March 2003 for
those employed by the Company’s former Analytical Instruments business within its Life and Analytical Sciences segment and corporate employees. The plans provide benefits that are based on an employee’s years of service and compensation
near retirement.

allocation at December 28, 2008 and December 30, 2007, and target asset allocations for fiscal year 2009, are as follows:

The Company maintains
target allocation percentages among various asset classes based on investment policies established for the pension plans which are designed to maximize the total rate of return (income and appreciation) after inflation within the limits of prudent
risk taking, while providing for adequate near-term liquidity for benefit payments. The Company’s expected returns on assets assumptions are derived from management’s estimates, as well as other information compiled by management,
including studies that utilize customary procedures and techniques. The studies include a review of anticipated future long-term performance of individual asset classes and consideration of the appropriate asset allocation strategy given the
anticipated requirements of the plans to determine the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested to provide for the pension plans benefits. While the study gives appropriate consideration to recent fund performance and historical
returns, the assumption is primarily a long-term, prospective rate.

The Company does not expect to make any contributions to the U.S. pension plan during fiscal year 2009. With respect to non-U.S. plans, the Company expects to contribute approximately $11.4 million in fiscal year 2009.

The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as
appropriate, are expected to be paid as follows:

The estimated amount
that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income into net periodic benefit cost in fiscal year 2009 is as follows:

The Company also
sponsors a supplemental executive retirement plan to provide senior management with benefits in excess of normal pension benefits. Effective July 31, 2000, this plan was closed to new entrants. At

December 28, 2008 and December 30, 2007, the projected benefit obligations were $16.6 million and $19.2 million, respectively. Assets with a fair
value of $0.2 million, segregated in a trust (which is included in marketable securities and investments on the consolidated balance sheets), were available to meet this obligation as of both December 28, 2008 and December 30, 2007.
Pension expense for this plan was approximately $1.3 million in fiscal year 2008, $1.9 million in fiscal year 2007 and $2.0 million in fiscal year 2006.

Postretirement Medical Plans:

The Company provides healthcare benefits for eligible retired U.S. employees under a
comprehensive major medical plan or under health maintenance organizations where available. The majority of the Company’s U.S. employees become eligible for retiree health benefits if they retire directly from the Company and have at least ten
years of service. Generally, the major medical plan pays stated percentages of covered expenses after a deductible is met and takes into consideration payments by other group coverage and by Medicare. The plan requires retiree contributions under
most circumstances and has provisions for cost-sharing charges. Effective January 1, 2000, this plan was closed to new hires. For employees retiring after 1991, the Company has capped its medical premium contribution based on employees’
years of service. The Company funds the amount allowable under a 401(h) provision in the Company’s defined benefit pension plan. Assets of the plan are primarily equity and debt securities.

Net periodic postretirement medical benefit credit included the following
components:

The Company ceased future benefit accruals to its existing postretirement medical plan as part of the divesture of its Fluid Sciences segment, which was completed in February 2006.
In connection with this action, the Company recorded curtailment gains of approximately $1.8 million during fiscal year 2006 to discontinued operations.

The estimated amount
that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income into net periodic benefit cost in fiscal year 2009 is as follows:

Deferred
Compensation Plans:

During fiscal year 1998, the Company implemented a nonqualified deferred compensation plan that provides benefits payable to officers and certain key employees or their designated beneficiaries at specified future dates,
or upon retirement or death. Benefit payments under the plan are funded by contributions from participants, and for certain participants, contributions are funded by the Company. The obligations related to the deferred compensation plan totaled $1.3
million and $3.1 million at December 28, 2008 and December 30, 2007, respectively.

Note 17:

Settlement of Insurance Claim

During the second quarter of fiscal year 2007, the Company settled an insurance claim resulting from a fire that occurred within its Life and Analytical
Sciences facility in Boston, Massachusetts in March 2005. As a result of that settlement, the Company recorded gains of $15.3 million during the second quarter of fiscal year 2007. The Company received the final settlement payment of $21.5 million
in June 2007, and had previously received during fiscal years 2005 and 2006 a total of $35.0 million in advance payments towards costs incurred and for building, inventory and equipment damages. Of the $56.5 million in total settlement proceeds
received by the Company, $25.6 million related to reimbursement of costs incurred; $23.7 million related to damages to the building, inventory and equipment; and $7.2 million related to business interruption costs which were recorded as reductions
to cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses.

The Company accrued $9.7 million representing its management’s estimate of the total cost for decommissioning the building, including environmental matters, that was damaged in the fire. The Company paid $1.6 million during fiscal year
2008 and $3.9 million during fiscal year 2007 towards decommissioning the building, and anticipates that the remaining payments of $4.2 million will be completed by the third quarter of fiscal year 2009.

Note 18:

Contingencies

The Company is conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at current and former locations of the Company and, along with
other companies, has been named a potentially responsible party (“PRP”) for certain waste disposal sites. The Company accrues for environmental issues in the accounting period that the Company’s responsibility is established and when
the cost can be reasonably estimated. The Company has accrued $4.0 million as of December 28, 2008, which represents management’s estimate of the total cost of ultimate disposition of known environmental matters. This amount is not
discounted and does not reflect the recovery of any amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements. These cost estimates are subject to a number of variables, including the stage of the environmental investigations, the magnitude of the
possible contamination, the nature of the potential remedies, possible joint and several liability, the time period over which remediation may occur, and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations. For sites where the Company has been
named a PRP, management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute. The Company expects that the majority of such accrued amounts could be paid out over a
period of up to ten years. As assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site, these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available. There have been no environmental problems to
date that have had or are expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. While it is possible that a loss exceeding the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial
statements may be incurred, the potential exposure is not expected to be materially different from those amounts recorded.

Enzo Biochem, Inc. and Enzo Life Sciences, Inc. (collectively, “Enzo”) filed a complaint dated October 23, 2002 in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York, Civil Action No. 02-8448, against Amersham plc, Amersham BioSciences, PerkinElmer, Inc., PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Inc., Sigma-Aldrich Corporation, Sigma Chemical Company, Inc., Molecular
Probes, Inc., and Orchid BioSciences, Inc. The complaint alleges that the Company has breached its distributorship and settlement agreements with Enzo, infringed Enzo’s patents, engaged in unfair competition and fraud, and committed torts
against Enzo by, among other things, engaging in commercial development and exploitation of Enzo’s patented products and technology, separately and together with the other defendants. Enzo seeks injunctive and monetary relief. In 2003, the
court severed the lawsuit and ordered Enzo to serve individual complaints against the five defendants. The Company subsequently filed an answer and a counterclaim alleging that Enzo’s patents are invalid. In July 2006, the court issued a
decision regarding the construction of the claims in Enzo’s patents that effectively limited the coverage of certain of those claims and, the Company believes, excludes certain of the Company’s products from the coverage of Enzo’s
patents. Summary judgment motions were filed by the defendants in January 2007, and a hearing with oral argument on those motions took place in July 2007, but a decision on those motions has not been rendered, and a trial date has not been set.

PharmaStem Therapeutics, Inc. (“PharmaStem”) filed a
complaint dated February 22, 2002 against ViaCell, Inc., which is now a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and several other defendants in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, alleging infringement of United
States Patents No. 5,004,681 and No. 5,192,553, relating to certain aspects of the collection, cryopreservation and storage of hematopoietic stem cells and progenitor cells from umbilical cord blood (“PharmaStem I”). After
several years of proceedings at the District Court level, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit issued a decision in July 2007 that ViaCell did not infringe these two patents and that the two patents are invalid. PharmaStem
filed a certiorari petition in January 2008 seeking to have the United States Supreme Court review the appellate court’s decision as to the invalidity of the patents, but did not seek any further review of the non-infringement decision.
However, the United States Supreme Court denied certiorari in March 2008, so the decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in favor of ViaCell is final and non-appealable. PharmaStem had also filed a second complaint
against ViaCell and other defendants in July 2004 in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, alleging infringement of United States Patents No. 6,461,645 and 6,569,427, which



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

also relate to certain aspects of the collection, cryopreservation and storage of hematopoietic stem cells and progenitor cells from umbilical cord blood
(“PharmaStem II”). The Delaware court granted ViaCell’s motion in October 2005 to stay the proceedings in PharmaStem II pending the outcome of PharmaStem I and a decision from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“U.S.
PTO”) on certain patent re-examination issues. On September 2, 2008, the U.S. PTO issued a Re-examination Certificate cancelling all claims of United States Patent No. 6,461,645, and on September 16, 2008, the U.S. PTO issued a
Re-examination Certificate cancelling all claims of United States Patent No. 6,569,427. As a result of the cancellation of all patent claims involved in PharmaStem II by the U.S. PTO, the Company will seek a dismissal of all claims for relief
set forth by PharmaStem in PharmaStem II.

The Company believes
it has meritorious defenses to these lawsuits and other proceedings, and it is contesting the actions vigorously in all of the above unresolved matters. While each of these matters is subject to uncertainty, in the opinion of the Company’s
management, based on its review of the information available at this time, the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

The Company is also subject to various other claims, legal proceedings and
investigations covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of its business activities. Although the Company has established accruals for potential losses that it believes are probable and reasonably estimable, in the opinion
of the Company’s management, based on its review of the information available at this time, the total cost of resolving these other contingencies at December 28, 2008 should not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
consolidated financial statements. Each of these matters is subject to uncertainties, and it is possible that some of these matters may be resolved unfavorably to the Company.

Warranty Reserves

The Company provides warranty protection for certain products for periods usually ranging from one to three years beyond the date of sale. The majority of
costs associated with warranty obligations include the replacement of parts and the time of service personnel to respond to repair and replacement requests. A warranty reserve is recorded based upon historical results, supplemented by
management’s expectations of future costs. Warranty reserves are included in “Accrued expenses” on the consolidated balance sheets. A summary of warranty reserve activity for the years ended December 28, 2008, December 30,
2007 and December 31, 2006 is as follows:

Note 20: Stockholders’ Equity

Stock-Based Compensation:

As of December 28, 2008, the Company had three stock-based compensation plans. Under the 2005 Incentive Plan,
5.4 million shares of the Company’s common stock were made available for stock option grants, restricted stock awards and performance units. Under the 2001 Incentive Plan, 8.8 million shares of the Company’s common stock were
made available for stock option grants, restricted stock awards and performance units. Under the Life Sciences Plan, 2.3 million shares of the Company’s common stock were made available for stock option grants.

For fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company recorded incremental
pre-tax compensation expense related to the stock options of $10.4 million, $9.2 million, and $9.2 million, respectively. The total pre-tax stock-based compensation expense for the cost of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units,
performance units and stock grants was $17.8 million in fiscal year 2008, $22.2 million in fiscal year 2007 and $18.0 million in fiscal year 2006. The total income tax benefit recognized in the consolidated statements of operations for stock-based
compensation was $5.1 million in fiscal year 2008, $8.0 million in fiscal year 2007 and $6.3 million in fiscal year 2006. Stock-based compensation costs capitalized as part of inventory were approximately $0.3 million as of both December 28,
2008 and December 30, 2007.

Stock
Options:

The Company has granted options to purchase common shares at prices equal to the market price of the common shares on the date the option is granted. Conditions of vesting are determined at the time of grant.
Options are generally exercisable in equal annual installments over a period of three years, and will generally expire seven years after the date of grant. Options assumed as part of business combination transactions retain all the rights, terms and
conditions of the respective plans under which they were originally issued.

The fair value of each option grant is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is
generally the vesting period. Use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. Expected volatility was calculated primarily based on the historical volatility of the Company’s
stock. The average expected life was based on the contractual term of the option and historic exercise experience. The risk-free interest rate is based on United States Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life
assumed at the date of grant. Forfeitures are estimated based on voluntary termination behavior, as well as an analysis of actual option forfeitures. The Company’s weighted-average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model are
as follows:



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The following table summarizes stock option activity for the three years ended December 28,
2008:

The weighted-average
grant-date fair values of options granted during fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $5.85, $7.45, and $6.83, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $19.4 million, $25.3 million,
and $16.2 million, respectively. Cash received from option exercises for fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006 was $43.7 million, $32.4 million, and $21.5 million, respectively. The related tax benefit classified as a financing cash inflow was $0.3
million for fiscal year 2008, $0.4 million for fiscal year 2007, and $2.2 million for fiscal year 2006.

The aggregate intrinsic value for stock options outstanding at December 28, 2008 was $3.8 million with a weighted-average remaining contractual term
of 3.5 years. The aggregate intrinsic value for stock options exercisable at December 28, 2008 was $3.8 million with a weighted-average remaining contractual term of 2.6 years. At December 28, 2008, there are 8.0 million stock options
that are vested and expected to vest, in the future, with an aggregate intrinsic value of $3.2 million and a weighted-average remaining contractual term of 3.5 years.

There was $8.8 million of total unrecognized compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, related to nonvested stock
options granted as of December 28, 2008. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.7 years, and will be adjusted for any future changes in estimated forfeitures.

The following table summarizes total compensation expense recognized related
to the stock options, which is a function of current and prior year awards and net of estimated forfeitures, included in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations during the years ended:



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The following table summarizes information about outstanding stock options at December 28, 2008:

Restricted Stock
Awards:

The Company has awarded shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units that contain time-based vesting provisions and shares of restricted stock that contain performance-based vesting provisions to certain
employees at no cost to them, which cannot be sold, assigned, transferred or pledged during the restriction period. These awards were granted under the Company’s 2005 Incentive Plan and 2001 Incentive Plan. All restrictions on the awards will
lapse upon certain situations including death or disability of the employee and a change in control of the Company. Recipients of the restricted stock have the right to vote such shares and receive dividends.

Restricted Stock Awards (Time-based Vesting)

—Grants of restricted
stock and restricted stock units that vest through the passage of time, assuming continued employment. The fair value of the award at the time of the grant is expensed on a straight line basis primarily in selling, general and administrative
expenses over the vesting period, which is generally three years.

Restricted Stock Awards (Performance-based Vesting)

—Grants of restricted stock that vest based on certain specified performance criteria, assuming employment at the time the performance criteria are met. The fair value of the
shares is expensed over the period of performance primarily in selling, general and administrative expenses, once achievement of criteria is deemed probable.

The following table summarizes the restricted stock activity for the three years ended December 28, 2008:

The weighted-average
grant-date fair value of restricted stock awards granted was $25.38 per share in fiscal year 2008, $23.90 per share in fiscal year 2007, and $22.32 per share in fiscal year 2006. The fair value of restricted stock awards vested was $4.7 million in
fiscal year 2008, $5.0 million in fiscal year 2007, and $3.4 million in fiscal year 2006. The total compensation expense recognized related to the restricted stock



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

awards, which is a function of current and prior year awards, was approximately $6.0 million in fiscal year 2008, $4.9 million in fiscal year 2007, and $4.4
million in fiscal year 2006.

As of December 28, 2008,
there was $4.0 million of total unrecognized compensation cost, net of forfeitures, related to nonvested restricted stock awards. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.6 fiscal years.

Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), unearned compensation was
recorded in a contra-equity account and established at the date restricted stock was granted, representing the amount of unrecognized restricted stock expense that is reduced as expense is recognized. Under the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R),
the recognition of unearned compensation at the date restricted stock is granted is no longer required. Therefore, in the first quarter of fiscal year 2006, the $6.4 million of unrecognized restricted stock that had been in “Unearned
compensation” in the consolidated balance sheet as of January 1, 2006 was reclassified to “Capital in excess of par value.”

Performance Units:

The Company’s performance unit program provides a cash award based on the achievement of specific
performance criteria. A target number of units are granted at the beginning of a three year performance period. The number of units earned at the end of the performance period is determined by multiplying the number of units granted by a performance
factor ranging from 0% to 200%. Awards are determined by multiplying the number of units earned by the stock price at the end of the performance period, and are paid in cash and accounted for as a liability based award. The compensation expense
associated with these units is recognized over the period that the performance targets are expected to be achieved. The Company granted 131,151 performance units, 209,326 performance units, and 208,328 performance units during fiscal years 2008,
2007, and 2006, respectively. The weighted-average grant-date fair values of performance units granted during fiscal years 2008, 2007, and 2006 were $24.95, $23.48, and $22.74, respectively. The total compensation expense related to these
performance units, which is a function of current and prior year awards, was approximately $0.6 million, $7.4 million, and $4.0 million for fiscal years 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. As of December 28, 2008, there were 353,884 performance
units outstanding subject to forfeiture.

Stock
Awards:

The Company’s stock award program provides non-employee Directors an annual equity award. For fiscal years 2008 and 2007, the award equaled the number of shares of the Company’s common stock which has an
aggregate fair market value of $100,000 on the date of the award. Annual awards granted in fiscal year 2006 were equal to an aggregate fair market value of $60,000. The stock award is prorated for non-employee directors who serve for only a portion
of the year. The shares are granted in April following the annual meeting of shareholders, on the third business day after the Company’s first quarter earnings release. Directors may defer the receipt of shares into the Company’s deferred
compensation plan. The compensation expense associated with these stock awards is recognized when the stock award is granted. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2008, a new non-employee Director was awarded 667 shares as a prorated award for
serving a portion of the fiscal year 2007. During fiscal years 2008, 2007, and 2006, each non-employee Director was awarded 3,740 shares, 4,114 shares, and 2,770 shares, respectively. The weighted-average grant-date fair value of stock awards
granted during fiscal years 2008, 2007, and 2006 was $26.70, $24.31, and $21.67, respectively. The total compensation expense recognized related to these stock awards was approximately $0.8 million, $0.7 million, and $0.5 million for fiscal years
2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively.

Employee Stock Purchase
Plan:

In April 1999, the Company’s stockholders approved the 1998 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, whereby participating employees had the right to purchase common stock at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the
closing price on the first day or the last day of the six-month offering period. In April 2005, the Compensation and Benefits Committee of the Board voted to amend the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, effective July 1, 2005, whereby participating
employees have the right to purchase common stock at a price equal to 95% of the closing price on the last day of each six-month offering period. The number of shares which an employee may purchase, subject to certain aggregate limits, is determined
by the employee’s voluntary contribution, which may not exceed 10% of the employee’s base compensation. During fiscal year 2008, the



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Company issued 0.1 million shares of common stock under the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan at a weighted-average price of $25.56 per share.
During fiscal year 2007, the Company issued 0.04 million shares under this plan at a weighted-average price of $24.73 per share. During fiscal year 2006, the Company issued 0.1 million shares under this plan at a weighted-average price of
$20.43 per share. At December 28, 2008 there remains available for sale to employees an aggregate of 1.6 million shares of the Company’s common stock out of the 5.0 million shares authorized by shareholders for issuance under
this plan.

Comprehensive (Loss) Income:

The components of accumulated other comprehensive
(loss) income, net of income taxes, consist of the following:

The tax effects on the
components of other comprehensive (loss) income are minimal due to the Company’s position under APB Opinion No. 23. The components of other comprehensive (loss) income were as follows:

Stock Repurchase Program:

On November 6, 2006, the Company announced that the Board authorized
the Company to repurchase up to 10.0 million shares of common stock under a stock repurchase program (the “Repurchase Program”). The Repurchase Program would expire on October 25, 2010 unless this authorization was terminated
earlier by the Board, and could be suspended or discontinued at any time. During fiscal year 2007, the Company repurchased in the open market approximately 8.1 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $203.0 million, including
commissions, under the Repurchase Program. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2008, the Company repurchased 1.9 million shares of common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of $56.6 million, including commissions, under the
Repurchase Program. These repurchases completed the Company’s repurchase of the 10.0 million shares in the aggregate authorized under the Repurchase Program. The repurchased shares have been reflected as additional authorized but unissued
shares, with the payments reflected in common stock and capital in excess of par value.

On October 23, 2008, the Company announced that the Board has authorized the Company to repurchase up to 10.0 million additional shares of common stock under a new stock repurchase program (the “New
Repurchase Program”). The New Repurchase Program will expire on October 22, 2012 unless this authorization is terminated earlier by the Board, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. During fiscal year 2008, the Company
repurchased 1.0 million shares of common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of $18.0 million, including commissions, under the New Repurchase Program. The repurchased shares have been reflected as additional authorized but unissued
shares, with the payments reflected in common stock and capital in excess of par value. From December 29, 2008 through February 20, 2009, the Company repurchased approximately 1.0 million shares of common stock in the open market at
an aggregate cost of $14.2 million, including commissions, under the New Repurchase Program.

The Board has authorized the Company to repurchase shares of the Company’s common stock in the aggregate to satisfy minimum statutory tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock
awards and restricted stock unit awards granted pursuant to the Company’s equity incentive plans. During fiscal year 2008, the Company repurchased 37,521 shares of common stock. The repurchased shares have been reflected as additional
authorized but unissued shares, with the payments reflected in common stock and capital in excess of par value.

During fiscal year 2006, the Company repurchased in the open market 8.9 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $190.1 million,
including commissions. These repurchases were made pursuant to the stock repurchase program announced in November 2005. The repurchased shares have been reflected as additional authorized but unissued shares, with the payments reflected in common
stock and capital in excess of par value.

Note 21:

Financial Instruments

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash investments, marketable
securities and accounts receivable. The Company believes it had no significant concentrations of credit risk as of December 28, 2008.

In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into foreign exchange contracts for periods consistent with its committed exposures to mitigate the
effect of foreign currency movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Transactions covered by hedge contracts include intercompany and third-party receivables and payables. The contracts are primarily in European and Asian
currencies, have maturities that do not exceed 12 months, have no cash requirements until maturity, and are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets. Credit risk and market risk are insignificant as the foreign exchange instruments
are



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

contracted with major banking institutions. Unrealized gains and losses on the Company’s foreign currency contracts are recognized immediately in
earnings for hedges designated as fair value and, for hedges designated as cash flow, the related unrealized gains or losses are deferred as a component of other comprehensive (loss) income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Deferred
gains and losses are recognized in income in the period in which the underlying anticipated transaction occurs and impacts earnings. Principal hedged currencies include the British Pound (GBP), Canadian Dollar (CAD), Euro (EUR), Japanese Yen (JPY),
and Singapore Dollar (SGD). The Company held forward foreign exchange contracts with U.S. equivalent notional amounts totaling $160.8 million at December 28, 2008 and $105.2 million as of December 30, 2007, and the approximate fair value
of these foreign currency derivative contracts was insignificant. The gains and losses realized on foreign currency derivative contracts are not material. The duration of these contracts entered into during fiscal year 2008 was generally 30 days.

In addition, during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007,
the Company entered into forward interest rate contracts with notional amounts totaling $300.0 million and a weighted average interest rate of 4.25%. These contracts were intended to hedge movements in interest rates prior to the Company’s
expected debt issuance. In May 2008, the Company settled forward interest rate contracts with notional amounts totaling $150.0 million, upon the issuance of the Company’s 6% senior unsecured notes. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008,
the Company concluded that the remaining portion of the expected debt issuance, with a notional amount totaling $150.0 million, was no longer probable. As a result of the debt issuance no longer being probable, the Company discontinued and settled
the forward interest rate contracts with notional amounts totaling $150.0 million and recognized derivative losses of $17.5 million, in interest and other expense.

Before amortization expense, the Company had accumulated derivative losses of $8.4 million, net of taxes of
$5.4 million, in other comprehensive (loss) income as of December 28, 2008 and $5.3 million, net of taxes of $3.5 million, as of December 30, 2007, related to these cash flow hedges. The derivative losses are amortized into interest
expense when the hedged exposure affects interest expense. During fiscal year 2008, $1.2 million of these derivative losses were amortized into interest expense.

Once established, cash flow hedges are generally recorded in other comprehensive (loss) income until maturity unless an
anticipated transaction is no longer likely to occur. Discontinued or dedesignated cash flow hedges are immediately settled with counterparties, and the related accumulated derivative gains or losses are recognized into interest expense on the
consolidated financial statements. The Company did not recognize any ineffectiveness during fiscal year 2008 or fiscal year 2007.

The Company does not enter into derivatives for trading or other speculative purposes, nor does the Company use leveraged financial instruments.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The Company adopted SFAS No. 157 as of December 31, 2007, with the
exception of the application of the statement to non-recurring nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that was delayed by FSP No. 157-2. Non-recurring nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities for which the Company has not
applied the provisions of SFAS No. 157 include those measured at fair value in goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment testing, those initially measured at fair value in a business combination, and asset retirement
obligations initially measured at fair value.

Valuation
Hierarchy:

SFAS No. 157 establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs, where available. The following summarizes the three levels of inputs required by the standard to measure fair
value: Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2 inputs are observable prices that are based on inputs not quoted on active markets, but



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

corroborated by market data; and Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the
fair value of the assets or liabilities based on the Company’s assumptions. A financial asset’s or liability’s classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value
measurement. In determining fair value, the Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible.

The following table shows the assets and liabilities carried at fair value
measured on a recurring basis at December 28, 2008 classified in one of the three classifications described above:

Valuation
Techniques:

The Company’s Level 1 and Level 2 assets and liabilities are comprised of investments in equity and fixed-income securities as well as derivative contracts. For financial assets and liabilities that utilize Level 1 and Level
2 inputs, the Company utilizes both direct and indirect observable price quotes, including common stock price quotes, foreign exchange forward prices, and bank price quotes. Below is a summary of valuation techniques for Level 1 and Level 2
financial assets and liabilities.

The carrying amounts
of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value due to the short-term maturities of these assets and liabilities.

The Company’s amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility, with a maximum of $650.0 million available limit, and
6% senior unsecured notes, with a face value of $150.0 million, had outstanding balances as of December 28, 2008 of $359.0 million and $150.0 million, respectively. The Company’s amended senior unsecured revolving credit
facility, with a maximum of $500.0 million available limit, and a $300.0 million unsecured interim credit facility, had outstanding balances as of December 30, 2007 of $216.0 million and $300.0 million, respectively. The interest rate on
the Company’s amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility is reset at least monthly to correspond to variable rates that reflect currently available terms and conditions for similar debt. The Company had no change in credit standing
during fiscal year 2008. Consequently, the carrying value of the current year and prior year credit facilities approximate fair value.

Note 22:

Leases

The Company leases certain property and equipment under operating leases. Rental expense charged to continuing operations for fiscal years 2008, 2007, and
2006 amounted to $40.4 million, $35.2 million, and $36.8 million, respectively. Minimum rental commitments under noncancelable operating leases are as follows: $42.0 million in fiscal year 2009, $36.7 million in fiscal year 2010, $28.3 million in
fiscal year 2011, $20.5 million in fiscal year 2012, $19.2 million in fiscal year 2013 and $99.5 million in fiscal year 2014 and thereafter.

Note 23:

Industry Segment and Geographic Area Information

The Company follows SFAS No. 131, “

Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information”

(“SFAS
No. 131”). SFAS No. 131 establishes standards for the way public business enterprises report information about operating segments in annual financial statements and in interim reports to shareholders. The method for determining what
information to report is based on the way that management organizes the segments within the Company for making operating decisions and assessing financial performance. The Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on sales
and operating income. Intersegment sales and transfers are not significant. Based on the guidance in SFAS No. 131, the Company has two operating segments for financial reporting purposes. The accounting policies of the operating segments are
the same as those described in Note 1. The operating segments and their principal products and services are:

•

Life and Analytical Sciences.

The Company is a leading provider of analysis tools, including instruments, reagents, software, and
consumables, to the analytical sciences, genetic screening, bio-discovery and laboratory services markets.

•

Optoelectronics.

The Company provides a broad range of medical imaging, optical sensor and specialty lighting components used in
medical, consumer products and other specialty end markets.

The assets and expenses for the Company’s corporate headquarters, such as legal, tax, accounting and finance, human resources, property and insurance management, information technology, treasury and other
management and compliance costs, have been included as “Corporate” below. The Company has a process to allocate and recharge expenses to the reportable segments when such costs are administered or paid by the corporate headquarters based
on the extent to which the segment benefited from the expenses. These amounts have been calculated in a consistent manner and are included in the Company’s calculations of segment results to internally plan and assess the performance of each
segment for all purposes, including determining the compensation of the business leaders for each of the Company’s operating segments.

Sales and operating income (loss) by segment for the three years ended December 28, 2008, excluding discontinued operations, are shown in the table

Controls and Procedures

Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 28, 2008. The term “disclosure controls and procedures” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange



Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by the company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and
forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated
and communicated to the company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no
matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the
evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 28, 2008, our Chief Executive Officer and Acting Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the
reasonable assurance level.

Management’s Report on Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible
for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the
supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the company’s board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and includes those policies and procedures that:

•

Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;

•

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and

•

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2008. In making this assessment, our
management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework.

Based on this assessment, our management believes that, as of December 28, 2008, our internal control over financial reporting was
effective based on those criteria.

Our registered public
accounting firm has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting. This report appears below.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of PerkinElmer,
Inc.

Waltham, Massachusetts

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of PerkinElmer, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 28,
2008, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar
functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override
of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to
the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 28, 2008, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended December 28, 2008 of the Company and our report dated February 26, 2009 expressed an
unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedule.
