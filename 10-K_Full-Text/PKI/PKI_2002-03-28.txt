PART I

ITEM
1.

BUSINESS

PerkinElmer, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as
“PerkinElmer”, the “Company”, or the
“Registrant”, which terms include the Company’s
subsidiaries) is a global high technology company, providing
products and systems to the life sciences, pharmaceutical,
medical, chemical, semiconductor, aerospace, telecom and
photographic markets. The Company has operations in over 125
countries, and is a component of the S&P 500 Index. The
Company’s continuing operations are classified into three
operating segments: Life Sciences, Optoelectronics, and
Analytical Instruments. In 2001, the Company had sales of
$1.3 billion from continuing operations. The Company was
incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts
in 1947.

Recent Developments

On November 13, 2001, the Company completed
the acquisition of Packard BioScience Company
(“Packard”), a global developer, manufacturer and
marketer of instruments, software and related consumables and
services for use in drug discovery and other life sciences
research. Packard generated sales of approximately
$165 million during 2000. Details of the transaction and
pro forma financial information were reported on a Current
Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company with the Securities
and Exchange Commission on November 13, 2001.

Also in 2001, the Company approved separate plans
to dispose of its Security and Detection Systems business and
its Fluid Sciences business. These businesses have been
reflected as discontinued operations in accordance with
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30,

Reporting
the Results of Operations — Reporting the Effects of
Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual
and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions

(“APB No. 30”). Additionally, the Company
completed the sale of its Instruments for Research and Applied
Science business and its Voltarc Technologies business during
the fourth quarter of 2001.

Life Sciences

The Life Sciences business unit helps solve

Discontinued Operations

In October 2001, the Company announced its plan
to sell its Fluid Sciences business unit. The financial results
for this unit are classified as discontinued operations. Fluid
Sciences is a leading provider of mission-critical fluid control
and containment solutions for highly demanding environments.
This business unit provides precision valves, seals, bellows,
pneumatic joints, coatings and subassemblies to the aerospace,
semiconductor equipment, power generation, maintenance, repair
and overhaul, and fluid testing markets.

During July 2001, the Company announced its
intention to sell its Security and Detection Systems business
and consequently moved that business to discontinued operations.
On January 3, 2002, PerkinElmer announced an agreement to
sell this business to L-3 Communications for approximately $100
million. The proposed sale is currently being reviewed by the US
Department of Justice and is expected to be finalized during the
first half of 2002. Security and Detection Systems is a leading
supplier of X-ray inspection equipment that screens airline
baggage and cargo.

On August 20, 1999, the Company sold the
assets of its Technical Services business, including the
outstanding capital stock of EG&G Defense Material, Inc., a
subsidiary of the Company, to EG&G Technical Services, Inc.,
an affiliate of The Carlyle Group LP, for approximately
$250 million in cash and the assumption by the buyer of
certain liabilities of the Technical Services segment. Results
of this unit have been classified as discontinued operations.
Through its Technical Services segment, the Company provided
engineering, scientific, management and technical support
services to a broad range of governmental and industrial
customers.

Sales from the discontinued operations of the
Technical Services, Fluid Sciences and Security and Detection
Systems businesses were $271.7 million, $359.7 million
and $615.1 million during 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

Marketing

All three of the Company’s business units,
Life Sciences, Optoelectronics and Analytical Instruments,
market their products and services through their own specialized
sales forces as well as independent foreign and domestic
manufacturer’s representatives and distributors. In certain
foreign countries, these operating segments have entered into
joint venture and license agreements with local firms to
manufacture and market their products.

Raw Materials and Supplies

Raw materials and supplies used by each of the
Company’s business units are generally readily available in
adequate quantities from domestic and foreign sources.

Patents and Trademarks

While the Company’s patents, trademarks and
licenses in the aggregate are important to its business, the
Company does not believe that the loss of any one patent,
trademark or license or group of related patents, trademarks or
licenses would have a materially adverse effect on the overall
business of the Company or on any of its operating segments. The
Company has both trademarks and registered trademarks for a
variety of its product names.

Backlog

The Company believes that backlog is not a
meaningful indicator of future business prospects for any of its
strategic business units due to the short-lead time required on
a majority of the Company’s sales. Therefore, we believe
that backlog information is not material to an understanding of
our business.

Competition

Because of the wide range of its products and
services, the Company faces many different types of competition
and competitors. This affects its ability to sell its products
and services and the prices at which



such products and services are sold. Competitors
range from large foreign and domestic organizations that produce
a comprehensive array of goods and services, and which may have
greater financial and other resources than the Company, to small
concerns producing a small number of goods or services for
specialized market segments.

In the Life Sciences segment, competition is on
the basis of product availability and reliability, and service
level. Competitors range from multinational organizations with a
wide range of products to specialized firms that in some cases
have well established market niches. The Company competes in
these markets on the basis of innovative technologies, product
differentiation and quality. The proportion of large competitors
in this segment is expected to increase through the continued
consolidation of competitors.

In the Optoelectronics segment, no single
competitor competes directly with this business unit across its
full product range. However, the Company does compete with
specialized manufacturing companies in the manufacture and sale
of specialty flashtubes and ultraspecialty lighting sources,
certain photodetectors and photodiodes, switched power supplies
and telecommunications products. Competition is based on price,
technological innovation, operational efficiency, and product
reliability and quality.

In the Analytical Instruments segment, no single
competitor competes directly with this business unit as a whole.
The Company competes with instrument companies that serve
particular segments of markets in industrial instrumentation and
imagining detection systems. The Company competes in this
segment primarily on the basis of product performance, product
reliability, service and price.

Research and Development

During 2001, 2000 and 1999, Company-sponsored
research and development expenditures were approximately
$81 million, $77 million and $67 million,
respectively.

Environmental Compliance

The Company is conducting a number of
environmental investigations and remedial actions at current and
former Company locations and, along with other companies, has
been named a potentially responsible party (a “PRP”)
for certain waste disposal sites. The Company accrues for
environmental issues in the accounting period in which the
Company’s responsibility is established and when the cost
can be reasonably estimated. The Company has accrued
$6.9 million as of December 30, 2001, representing
management’s estimate of the total cost of ultimate
disposition of known environmental matters. This amount is not
discounted and does not reflect any recovery of any amounts
through insurance or indemnification arrangements. These cost
estimates are subject to a number of variables, including the
stage of the environmental investigations, the magnitude of the
possible contamination, the nature of the potential remedies,
possible joint and several liability, the timeframe over which
remediation may occur and the possible effects of changing laws
and regulations. For sites where the Company has been named a
PRP, management does not currently anticipate any additional
liability to result from the inability of other significant
named parties to contribute. The Company expects that such
accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to five
years. As assessments and remediation activities progress at
each individual site, these liabilities are reviewed and
adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes
available. There have been no environmental problems to date
that have had or are expected to have a material effect on the
Company’s financial position or results of operations.
While it is reasonably possible that a material loss exceeding
the amounts recorded may have been incurred, the preliminary
stages of the investigations make it impossible for the Company
to reasonably estimate the range of potential exposure.

Employees

As of March 1, 2002, the Company employed
roughly 10,800 employees of which approximately 9,300 were
employed within its continuing operations. Certain of the
Company’s subsidiaries are parties to contracts with labor
unions. The Company considers its relations with employees to be
satisfactory.

physical location:

ITEM 2.

PROPERTIES

As of January 30, 2002 the Company’s
continuing operations occupied approximately 3,227,000 square
feet of building area, of which approximately 1,075,000 square
feet is owned by the Company. The balance is



leased. The Company’s headquarters occupies
53,400 square feet of leased space in Wellesley, Massachusetts.
The Company’s other operations are conducted in
manufacturing and assembly plants, research laboratories,
administrative offices and other facilities located in nine
states and 39 foreign countries.

Non-U.S. facilities account for approximately
1,600,000 square feet of owned and leased property, or
approximately 50% of the Company’s total occupied space.

The Company’s real property leases are both
short-term and long-term. In management’s opinion, the
Company’s properties are well-maintained and are adequate
for its present requirements.

The following table indicates the approximate
square footage of real property owned and leased attributable to
each of the Company’s operating segments for continuing
operations:

ITEM 3.

LEGAL
PROCEEDINGS

The Company is subject to various claims, legal
proceedings and investigations covering a wide range of matters
that arise in the ordinary course of its business activities.
Each of these matters is subject to various uncertainties, and
it is possible that some of these matters may be resolved
unfavorably to the Company. The Company has established accruals
for matters that are probable and reasonably estimable.
Management believes that any liability that may ultimately
result from the resolution of these matters in excess of amounts
provided will not have a material adverse effect on the
financial position or results of operations of the Company.

In September 2001 the Company announced that it
had resolved its US Tax Court case with the Internal Revenue
Service (IRS). The case, which was brought by the IRS in 1995,
primarily involved accounting for gains and intercompany pricing
during the years 1985 through 1994. The IRS had proposed
additional tax of $74 million plus interest. The settlement,
however, awarded a small refund to the Company and eliminated
all outstanding disputes with the IRS.

The Company and its subsidiary, EG&G Idaho,
Inc., were named in 1998 as defendants in a lawsuit pending in
the United States District Court for the District of Idaho.
Filed by two former employees of EG&G Idaho under the Civil
False Claims Act, the suit names as defendants six entities
which were formerly, or currently are, prime contractors or
subcontractors to the United States Department of Energy at the
Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory.
Plaintiffs allege that the defendants submitted false claims to
the government for reimbursement of environmental activities
which they knew or should have known had either not been
performed or were performed improperly. The District Court
recently granted the Company’s Motion for Summary Judgment,
and dismissed most, but not all, of the allegations involving
the Company. The plaintiffs may appeal that ruling. The
plaintiffs have yet to quantify the damages they are seeking.

The Company’s subsidiary, EG&G Rocky
Flats, Inc., and two other companies were also named as
defendants in January 2000 in a civil false claim action pending
in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado
involving security issues at the United States Department of
Energy’s Rocky Flats Plant. In response to a motion filed
by the United States Department of Justice, the District Court
dismissed the case. The plaintiffs have appealed the dismissal.

The Company intends to defend itself vigorously
in these matters and believes that their ultimate disposition
will not have a material impact on the Company’s financial
position or results of operations.

Consolidated Results of Operations for the periods presented are
on a continuing operations basis.

Portfolio changes

2001 represented the fourth year in the
Company’s transformation into a global, high technology
leader. During 2001, the Company continued its focus on shifting
its portfolio of businesses to higher growth markets and
applications. Significant changes to the Company’s
portfolio during the three years ended December 30, 2001
are highlighted below:



•

Acquisition of NEN Life Sciences, Inc.
	(“NEN”)

•

Disposal of the Berthold business

•

Disposal of micromachined sensors business


•

Acquisition of the Analytical Instruments
	business from PE Corp. (“AI”)

•

Disposal of the Technical Services business

Other
accomplishments

Other significant accomplishments during 2001
included:



•

Consolidation within Analytical Instruments
	segment including starting the consolidation of European
	administrative functions to a central location in Monza, Italy,
	move to new world headquarters and manufacturing facility in
	Shelton, CT and moves of certain manufacturing functions from
	Europe to lower cost geographies within Asia

As a result of the significant amount of changes,
the results period over period are frequently not comparable. In
order to improve the comparability of financial results, the
Company has highlighted nonrecurring items in all periods and
presented a discussion of the results excluding these items.
Nonrecurring items represent income and expenses associated with
an acquisition, restructuring, divestiture or other unusual
event that are not expected to have an impact on ongoing
operations.

2001 Acquisitions and Divestitures

On November 13, 2001, the Company completed
the acquisition of Packard BioScience Company
(“Packard”) for consideration of approximately
$762 million in the form of approximately 22 million
common shares and the assumption of $118 million in debt.
The acquisition extends the Company’s capabilities in
automated liquid handling and sample preparation and strengthens
the Company’s position as a global provider of
comprehensive drug discovery solutions. Packard, a global
developer, manufacturer and marketer of instruments, software
and related consumables and services for use in drug discovery
and other life sciences research, generated sales of
approximately $165 million for its year ended
December 31, 2000.

Packard’s operations, assumed as of the date
of acquisition, are reported within the results from operations
of the Life Sciences segment. The acquisition was accounted for
as a purchase in accordance with the recently issued Financial
Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 141, Business
Combinations, (“SFAS No. 141”), and the Company
has accordingly allocated the purchase price of Packard based
upon the fair values of the net assets acquired and liabilities
assumed. The allocation of the purchase price has not yet been
finalized; however, the Company does not expect material
changes. Portions of the net assets acquired and liabilities
assumed were valued by independent appraisers utilizing
customary valuation procedures and techniques. These intangible
assets included $69.0 million in acquired in-process
research and development for projects that had not yet reached
technological feasibility as of the acquisition date and for
which no future alternative use existed. These costs were
expensed during the fourth quarter of 2001. Other acquired
intangible assets valued at $237.3 million included the
fair value of trade names, trademarks, patents and developed
technology. Of this amount, $76.5 million has been ascribed to
trade names and trademarks for which an indefinite life has been
assigned. The Packard acquisition also resulted in goodwill of
$438.6 million, which is not being amortized in accordance
with SFAS No. 141, effective for all business combinations
completed subsequent to July 1, 2001.

During the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company
sold its Instruments for Research and Applied Science business
(“IRAS”) and its Voltarc Technologies
(“Voltarc”) business. These sales resulted in a gain
of $32.3 million and a loss of $6.3 million,
respectively. Additionally, the Company has deferred gains of
approximately $3.0 million in connection with certain
contingencies related to the IRAS sale. The combined net income
of these businesses was $1.4 million in 2001 through date
of disposal and $5.4 million in 2000.

The Packard acquisition and 2001 dispositions are
expected to result in a higher concentration of revenue in the
Life Sciences segment in future periods.

Discussion of Consolidated Results of
Operations — 2001 Compared to 2000

Sales

2001 Compared to

Sales for 2001 were $1,330.1 million versus
$1,335.5 million during 2000, representing a decrease of
$5.4 million or less than 1%. Incremental revenue of
approximately $102 million from the acquisitions of Packard
and NEN mostly offset lower revenue of $74 million
associated with divested businesses, the negative impact of
foreign exchange of $26 million and organic revenue decline
of $8 million. Organic revenue, which the Company defines
as growth in historical businesses plus growth in acquired
businesses assuming they were owned in prior periods, adjusted
for the effects of exited businesses and foreign exchange, was
strong in the Life Sciences segment as a result of market
expansion and new product introductions, but was offset by
declines in electronic-based end-markets.

2000 Compared to

Sales for 2000 were $1,335.5 million versus
$1,050.8 million in 1999, representing an increase of
$284.7 million or 27%. Incremental revenue from the
acquisition of NEN and AI, organic growth in the Life Sciences
and Optoelectronics segments as well as new product
introductions within the Life Sciences segment contributed to
the increase.

Cost of Sales

2001 Compared to

Reported cost of sales of $721.7 million for
2001 versus $756.9 million during 2000 represented a
decrease of $35.2 million or 5%. On a percentage-of-sales
basis, cost of sales decreased to 54% in 2001 from 57% during
2000. The decrease is reflective of the Company’s continued
productivity and cost containment gains in the form of headcount
and facility rationalization and further expansion and
relocation into lower cost manufacturing geographies as well as
strategic moves into higher margin businesses.

Adjusted cost of sales, which excludes the impact
of nonrecurring items, was $706.3 million for 2001 versus
$753.3 million for 2000, representing a $47.0 million
or 6% decrease. Nonrecurring items for 2001 of
$15.4 million related principally to an inventory write-off
related to unexpected declines in the telecom component
business, the amortization of the write-up of Packard inventory
included as part of purchase accounting, the cost of movements
of manufacturing facilities and charges associated with moves to
lower cost geographies. The results from 2000 included
$3.6 million in nonrecurring charges as discussed below.

2000 Compared to

Reported cost of sales of $756.9 million for
2000 versus $624.7 million for 1999 represented an increase
of $132.2 million or 21%. On a percentage-of-revenue basis,
cost of sales decreased to 57% in 2000 from 59% in 1999. The
decrease reflected productivity initiatives and the benefits of
restructuring initiatives aimed at headcount reduction and
facility rationalization.

Adjusted cost of sales, which excludes the impact
of nonrecurring items, was $753.3 million for 2000 versus
$614.5 million in 1999. Nonrecurring items for 2000
included $3.6 million in charges associated with
reorganization-related activities and the write-up of inventory
acquired as part of the NEN acquisition. The results for 1999
included $10.2 million in nonrecurring charges, principally
comprised of the write-up of inventory acquired as part of the
AI acquisition.

Research and Development and
In-Process Research and Development Charges

2001 Compared to

Reported research and development expenses
including in-process research and development charges increased
to $150.4 million in 2001 from $101.2 million in 2000,
an increase of $49.2 million or 49%, as a result of higher
in-process research and development charges in 2001. Research
and development efforts during 2001 were mainly directed in the
end markets of drug discovery tools, pharmaceutical and
biomedical within the Life Sciences business.



Adjusted research and development costs, which
exclude the impact of nonrecurring items, were
$81.3 million in 2001 versus $76.9 million in 2000, an
increase of $4.4 million or 6%. As a percentage of sales,
research and development costs on an adjusted basis represented
6% of sales for both 2001 and 2000, a trend reflective of the
Company’s continued commitment to new product development.
Nonrecurring items in 2001 were $69.0 million associated with
the write-off of in-process technology acquired as part of the
Company’s acquisition of Packard. The results from 2000
included a similar charge of $24.3 million related to the
Company’s acquisition of NEN.

Compared to 1999

Reported research and development costs including
in-process research and development charges of
$101.2 million for 2000 versus $89.9 million for 1999
represented an increase of $11.3 million or 13%. The
increase reflects research and development efforts as a result
of the Company’s continued commitment to new product
development, particularly in the Life Sciences businesses.

Adjusted research and development costs for 2000
were $76.9 million, versus $66.9 million for 1999. On
a percentage of sales basis, adjusted research and development
costs were 6% for both 2000 and 1999. Nonrecurring charges for
2000 were $24.3 million, which represented a write-off of
in-process research and development charges associated with the
NEN acquisition. Nonrecurring charges for 1999 were
$23.0 million, which represented a similar write-off
related to the AI acquisition.

Selling, General and
Administrative Expenses

2001 Compared to

Reported SG&A expenses for 2001 were
$411.1 million versus $375.9 million for 2000,
representing an increase of $35.2 million or 9%. The
increase primarily reflects the inclusion of expenses associated
with Packard’s operations of $9 million assumed during the
fourth quarter of 2001, increased amortization expenses
associated with the NEN and Packard acquisitions of
$11.3 million as well as the restructuring and
reorganization related charges noted below.

Adjusted SG&A expenses, which exclude
goodwill and intangibles amortization and the impact of
nonrecurring items, were $350.7 million for 2001 versus
$340.0 million for 2000, representing an increase of
$10.7 million or 3% principally as a result of the
acquisition of Packard. As a percentage of sales, adjusted
SG&A expenses were 26% in 2001 versus 25% in 2000. Goodwill
and intangibles amortization increased to $42.3 million in
2001 from $30.9 million in 2000 as a result of the NEN
acquisition completed in 2000 and the Packard acquisition
completed during the fourth quarter of 2001. Nonrecurring
charges of $18.1 million in 2001 included: incentive payments
associated with portfolio changes, charges associated with the
integration of general and administrative functions for the Life
Sciences and Analytical Instruments business units, as well as
moves of certain manufacturing operations to lower cost
geographies and acquisition-related charges borne by the
Company. Nonrecurring charges during 2000 were $5.0 million
as discussed below.

2000 Compared to

Reported SG&A expenses of $375.9 million
for 2000 versus $290.8 million for 1999 represented an
increase of $85.1 million or 29%. The increase is primarily
attributable to the increased amortization expense associated
with the AI and NEN acquisitions.

Adjusted SG&A expenses, which excludes
goodwill and intangible amortization and the impact of
nonrecurring items, were $340.0 million in 2000 versus
$271.3 million in 1999. As a percentage of sales, adjusted
SG&A expenses were 25% in 2000 versus 26% in 1999. Goodwill
and intangible amortization increased to $30.9 million in
2000 from $22.9 million in 1999. Net nonrecurring charges
of $5.0 million in 2000 represented an increase over the
$3.4 million net gains from 1999. Nonrecurring charges for
2000 included integration-related charges associated with the
Packard acquisition. Nonrecurring charges for 1999 included
smaller items of a similar nature in connection with the AI
acquisition.



Restructuring and Asset
Impairment Charges

2001 Compared to

Net restructuring charges were $9.5 million
for 2001 versus $3.9 million in 2000. Charges for the
2001 year represented a restructuring charge associated
with the Packard acquisition of $3.9 million as well as
additional funding for amendments to existing plans for
integration activities previously identified. Resultant charges
for both years are considered nonrecurring in the Company’s
presentation of Adjusted Net Income.

2000 Compared to

Net restructuring charges were $3.9 million
in 2000 versus $14.7 million in 1999. Net charges for 2000
were comprised of a $15.1 million plan announced during the
fourth quarter of 2000, offset by $11.2 million in
reversals associated with plans announced during prior years.
The charges during 2000 related to restructuring activities
within the Life Sciences and Optoelectronics businesses. Net
charges for 1999 were comprised of an $18.0 million charge
for the 1999 plan, offset by $3.3 million reversed from the
1998 plan. Results from 1999 also included $18.0 million in
asset impairment charges associated with impairments recognized
on long-lived assets within the Analytical Instruments and
Optoelectronics segments. These charges are considered
nonrecurring in the Company’s presentation of Adjusted Net
Income.

Gains on
Dispositions

2001 Compared to

Dispositions resulted in a net gain of
$26.6 million for 2001 versus a net gain of
$35.1 million in 2000. The gain in 2001 resulted
principally from the $32.3 million gain on the sale of the
Instruments for Research and Applied Sciences business,
previously part of the Analytical Instruments business, and
approximately $0.6 million in net gains resulting from
dispositions in the Optoelectronics and Analytical Instruments
businesses, offset in part by the $6.3 million loss
resulting from the sale of the Voltarc Technologies business,
previously part of the Optoelectronics segment. The gain in 2000
included a gain of approximately $16.7 million on the sale
of a building, a $10.0 million gain on the disposition of
the Company’s Berthold business, $6.7 million in gains
from other dispositions within the Optoelectronic business
segment and $1.6 million in gains previously deferred from
prior dispositions. The resulting impact for both years is
considered nonrecurring in the Company’s presentation of
Adjusted Net Income.

2000 Compared to

Dispositions resulted in gains of
$35.1 million in 2000 versus $13.8 million in 1999.
The gain in 2000 included amounts related to the sale of a
building and dispositions of certain businesses, as previously
discussed. The 1999 gain principally related to previously
deferred sales proceeds recognized as a result of the favorable
resolution of certain events and contingencies. The resulting
impact for both years is considered nonrecurring in the
Company’s presentation of Adjusted Net Income.

Other Expense,
net

2001 Compared to

Other expense, net for 2001 was
$29.8 million versus $33.7 million in 2000,
representing a decrease of $3.9 million or 12%. Other
expense, net consisted principally of interest from debt
associated with prior acquisitions. The decrease is caused
primarily by the impact of nonrecurring gains, which consisted
of gains realized on the sale of investments of
$4.3 million and $0.9 million in 2001 and 2000,
respectively.

Other expense, net excluding nonrecurring items
was $34.1 million versus $34.6 million. Decreased
interest rates offset the impact of higher average debt levels
resulting from the acquisition of NEN in 2000.

2000 Compared to

Other Expense, net for 2000 was
$33.7 million versus $15.0 million in 1999, an
increase of $18.7 million. The increase is primarily the
result of increased debt levels as a result of acquisitions, as
well as the impact of foreign exchange losses. As discussed, the
2000 expense includes a $0.9 million nonrecurring gain
associated with the sale of an investment. The 1999 results did
not include any nonrecurring amounts.



Provision for Income
Taxes

2001 Compared to

Provision for income taxes was $34.8 million
for 2001 versus $39.7 million in 2000. The 2001 tax rate
was primarily impacted by the tax treatment of in-process
research and development charges associated with the Packard
acquisition, with a minor benefit resulting from a refund on a
case previously brought by the Internal Revenue Service. The
2000 rate was impacted to a lesser extent by similar in-process
research and development charges, as discussed below.

Provision for income taxes on Adjusted Net Income
was $40.9 million in 2001 and $36.4 million in 2000.
The effective rate on an adjusted basis was 26% for 2001 versus
28% for 2000. The decrease in effective rate was primarily the
result of the Company’s continued expansion of
manufacturing operations to lower tax jurisdictions.

2000 Compared to

Provision for income taxes was $39.7 million
in 2000 versus $4.6 million in 1999. The effective rate for
both years was 40% on a reported basis and reflected the tax
impact of in-process research and development charges for the
NEN acquisition during 2000 and the AI acquisition during 1999.

Provision for income taxes on Adjusted net income
was $36.4 million in 2000 versus $24.7 million in
1999. The effective rate was 28% for both periods on an adjusted
basis.

Segment Results of Operations

The Company’s continuing operations are
reported as three segments, reflecting the Company’s
management methodology and structure. The Company’s
Technical Services segment, Security and Detection Systems
business, previously reported as part of the Company’s
Instruments segment, and Fluid Sciences business have been
classified as discontinued operations in accordance with
Accounting Principles Board (“APB”) Opinion
No. 30, Reporting the Results of Operations -Reporting the
Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and
Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and
Transactions (“APB No. 30”). The accounting
policies of the segments are the same as those described in the
footnotes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
The Company evaluates performance based on operating profit of
the respective segments. The discussion that follows is a
summary analysis of the primary changes in operating results by
segment for 2001 versus 2000 and 2000 versus 1999.

Life Sciences

2001 Compared to

Sales for 2001 were $346.1 million versus
$221.4 million in 2000, representing a $124.7 million
or 56% increase. This increase reflects approximately
$102 million from the combined impact of the inclusion of
the results of operations of NEN for a full year and two months
of results associated with Packard. The increase was also driven
by strong growth in the drug discovery and genetic screening
businesses and growth in related consumables resulting from new
product introductions and geographic expansions leading to
organic growth in excess of 12%.

The reported operating loss for 2001 was
$46.0 million versus a loss of $3.6 million in 2000
due to the inclusion of purchase accounting and restructuring
charges associated with the acquisition of Packard during 2001,
partially offset by similar charges during 2000 from the NEN
acquisition as discussed below.

Adjusted operating profit excluding goodwill and
intangibles amortization and nonrecurring items was
$63.9 million for 2001, which represented a $24.7 million
or 63% increase over that of 2000. As a percentage of sales,
adjusted operating profit rose to 18.5% from 17.7% as a result
of sales of higher margin products and the impact of
productivity and cost containment associated with the
consolidation of manufacturing and administrative sites.
Goodwill and intangibles amortization was $23.7 million for
2001 versus $9.3 million for 2000 as a result of the
acquisitions discussed above. Nonrecurring charges during 2001
totaled $86.2 million, consisting of a $69.0 million
charge associated with acquired in-process research and
development, a $1.5 million charge for the revaluation of
acquired inventory, $3.4 million of net restructuring
charges, a $3.3 million integration incentive associated
with the Packard acquisition, $6.0 million in
integration-related



charges outside the scope of purchase accounting
and a net $2.8 million in other charges which include the
settlement of certain preacquisition contingencies from a prior
acquisition. The 2000 reported operating profit included
$33.5 million in nonrecurring charges as discussed below.

2000 Compared to

Sales of $221.4 million for 2000 increased
$63.4 million, or 40%, versus 1999. Organic revenue growth
for 2000 was 18%. Higher volumes from high throughput screening
and drug discovery applications, revenues from new product
introductions in the areas of genetic screening and drug
discovery tools, and the inclusion of revenues from NEN Life
Sciences acquired in August 2000, were the primary drivers of
the increase in 2000 versus 1999.

Reported operating loss for 2000 was
$3.6 million versus reported operating income of
$15.8 million in 1999. The decline is attributed
principally to the impact of purchase accounting and
restructuring charges associated with the acquisition of NEN.

Adjusted operating profit before goodwill and
intangibles amortization and nonrecurring items for 2000 was
$39.2 million, representing an increase of
$15.2 million, or 63%, versus 1999. Higher revenues
discussed above, particularly sales of higher-margin new
products, and revenues from the NEN acquisition contributed to
the increase in operating profit before goodwill and intangibles
amortization and nonrecurring items in 2000 versus 1999. The
2000 reported operating loss included goodwill and intangibles
amortization of $9.3 million and nonrecurring charges of
$33.5 million: a $24.3 million charge for acquired
in-process R&D, a $1.8 million charge for the
revaluation of acquired inventory, $3.9 million of net
restructuring charges and $3.5 million of
integration-related charges associated with the NEN acquisition
borne by the Company. The 1999 reported operating profit
included goodwill and intangibles amortization of
$2.4 million and net restructuring charges of
$5.8 million.

Optoelectronics

2001 Compared to

Sales for 2001 were $415.7 million, down
$81.2 million or 16% from he $496.9 million in sales
for 2000. The lower revenue was a result of an organic revenue
decline of 10% as well as the impact of divested businesses and
product lines. This decline in organic revenue reflects
continued weakness in the photography, semiconductor and telecom
component markets which more than offset strong growth in the
digital imaging, sensors and biomedical markets.

Reported operating profit for 2001 was
$45.8 million, down $51.1 million or 53% from the
$96.9 million recognized during 2000. The decline was
driven principally by the decreases in revenue discussed above,
and the costs associated with moving to lower cost production
locations and streamlining operations.

Adjusted operating profit for 2001 was
$68.6 million, representing a $15.0 million or 18% decrease
from $83.6 million for 2000. As a percentage of sales,
adjusted operating profit was 16.5% for 2001 versus 16.8% for
2000, with the impact of the reduction in sales offset to some
degree by cost savings and productivity enhancements associated
with reduced headcount and facility costs as well as moves to
lower cost geographies. The 2001 reported operating profit
included goodwill and intangibles amortization of
$8.1 million as well as nonrecurring items of
$14.7 million. Nonrecurring items were primarily comprised
of a $4.0 million inventory write-off related to unexpected
declines in end-user demand in the telecom component business, a
$5.5 million net loss realized on the disposal of certain
businesses, a $1.8 million retention incentive,
reorganization-related charges of $6.0 million associated
with the Company’s further expansion and relocation into
lower cost manufacturing locations, restructuring and other
charges of $1.0 million as well as a $3.6 million
nonrecurring credit related to accruals no longer deemed
necessary. The 2000 reported operating profit included goodwill
and intangibles amortization of $8.1 million and net
nonrecurring gains of $21.4 million, as discussed below.

2000 Compared to

Sales for 2000 were $496.9 million versus
$447.7 million in 1999, representing an increase of
$49.2 million, or 11%. Organic revenue growth for 2000 was
22%. Strong revenue growth across all businesses contributed to
this increase in 2000 versus 1999.



Reported operating profit increased
$56.6 million in 2000 to $96.9 million versus
$40.3 million in 1999, representing a 140% increase. The
increase in 2000 was due primarily to higher revenues discussed
above, the sale of higher margin new specialty lighting products
and the continued benefits of Six Sigma and other manufacturing
initiatives and the nonrecurring credits discussed below.

Adjusted operating profit before goodwill and
intangibles amortization and nonrecurring items for 2000 was
$83.6 million, increasing $25.3 million, or 43%,
versus 1999. The 2000 reported operating profit included
goodwill and intangibles amortization of $8.1 million and
net nonrecurring gains of $21.4 million. Nonrecurring items
included: gains on dispositions of $23.4 million,
restructuring credits of $9.9 million, restructuring
charges of $10 million and restructuring-related charges of
$1.9 million related to the shift by the Company to
lower-cost manufacturing geographies. The 1999 reported
operating profit included goodwill and intangibles amortization
of $9.5 million and nonrecurring items including
restructuring charges of $5.5 million and an asset
impairment charge of $3 million.

Analytical
Instruments

2001 Compared to

Sales for 2001 were $568.2 million, a
decrease of $49.1 million or 8% versus the
$617.3 million recognized during 2000. The decline in
revenue was driven principally by the disposition of the
Berthold business in late 2000, which had revenue of
$30 million in the year 2000, as well as the impact of
unfavorable foreign exchange of $14 million in 2001.
Organically, the business contracted less than 1%.

Reported operating profit for 2001 was
$78.4 million versus $56.9 million in 2000, an
increase of $21.5 million or 38%. The increase during 2001
reflects the impact of nonrecurring gains associated with the
sale of the Company’s IRAS business, net of nonrecurring
charges and the benefits of productivity and cost containment
actions. Results from 2000 included a net nonrecurring gain of
approximately $10.0 million resulting from the Berthold
sale.

Adjusted operating profit before goodwill and
intangibles amortization and nonrecurring items was
$72.8 million for 2001 versus $61.7 million for 2000,
representing an $11.1 million or 18% increase. As a
percentage of sales, adjusted operating profit rose from 10.0%
to 12.8% driven principally by reductions in headcount of over
350 people as a result of transitioning European
manufacturing to lower cost Asian facilities as well as
consolidating European sales and back office operations.
Adjusted operating profit for 2001 excludes goodwill and
intangibles amortization of $10.5 million and net
nonrecurring gains of $16.1 million. Nonrecurring items
included: $32.1 million in gains realized on the disposal
of businesses, a restructuring charge of $5.3 million, a
$2.3 million incentive payment associated with the
successful completion of the divestitures and $8.4 million
in reorganization-related charges associated with the
business’ move to lower cost geographies, consolidation of
European finance functions and the move to a new US
headquarters. Reported operating profit for 2000 included
goodwill and intangibles amortization of $13.5 million and
nonrecurring gains of $8.7 million, as discussed below.

2000 Compared to

Sales for 2000 were $617.3 million,
increasing $172.2 million, or 39%, versus 1999. Organic
revenue growth in 2000 was basically flat. The increase in
reported 2000 revenues versus 1999 was due primarily to the
inclusion of the AI business for a full year, partially offset
by the Company’s sale of its Berthold business in the
fourth quarter and the effects of a stronger dollar in 2000.

Reported operating profit for 2000 was
$56.9 million versus an operating loss in 1999 of
$21.4 million. The increase is due primarily to the
inclusion of the AI acquisition for a full year in 2000,
improvements in manufacturing cost structure and benefits from
restructuring actions.

For 2000, adjusted operating profit before
goodwill and intangibles amortization and nonrecurring items was
$61.7 million versus $40.2 million in 1999,
representing an increase of $21.5 million, or 53%. The 2000
reported operating profit included goodwill and intangibles
amortization of $13.5 million and net nonrecurring gains of
$8.7 million. The net nonrecurring items included: a
$10.0 million gain on disposition of the Berthold business,
a $0.9 million gain on the sale of a building and
$2.2 million of reorganization-related charges associated
with the integration of the AI acquisition. The 1999 reported
operating profit included goodwill and



intangibles amortization of $11 million, certain
acquisition-related charges and other nonrecurring items:
$23 million charge for acquired in-process research and
development, $15 million asset impairment charge,
$9.8 million charge for the revaluation of acquired
inventory and restructuring-related and other charges of
$2.8 million.

Restructuring and Asset Impairment
Charges

During the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company
recorded $33.0 million as part of a purchase accounting
adjustment associated with the Packard acquisition (“the
Packard Plan”) in accordance with Emerging Issues Task
Force Issue No. 95-3, Recognition of Liabilities in
Connection with a Purchase Business Combination (“EITF
95-3”). The principal elements of this plan involve
approximately $20.0 million in employee separation
expenses, $3.0 million in expenses associated with the
disposal of certain product lines and assets and
$10.0 million in lease and contract termination costs and
other expenses. During 2001, the Company announced restructuring
charges totaling $9.2 million associated with continued
integration activities (“the 2001 plan”). The
principal elements of this plan included $7.0 million in
employee separation expenses, $2.1 million in lease and
contract termination costs and other expenses and
$0.1 million in expenses associated with the disposal of
certain product lines and assets.

Amounts accrued for under remaining plans include
actions announced during the fourth quarter of 2000 associated
with employee separation costs and asset disposal costs
resulting from the rationalization of certain facilities and the
disposal of underutilized assets. These actions occurred in the
Life Sciences and Optoelectronics businesses. Additionally, the
remaining accrual for existing plans includes amounts accrued
for in connection with the AI and NEN acquisitions that occurred
during 1999 and 2000, respectively.

Cash outlays during 2001 were approximately
$36.3 million for the above discussed plans. The Company
expects to incur approximately $40-50 million of cash
outlays in connection with these plans during 2002.

Discontinued Operations

In October 2001, the Company announced its plan
to sell its Fluid Sciences business. The Company has accounted
for the business as a discontinued operation in accordance with
APB No. 30 and, accordingly, the results of operations have
been segregated from continuing operations and reported as a
separate line item on the Company’s accompanying
consolidated income statements.

During July 2001, the Company announced its
intention to sell its Security and Detection Systems business.
During January 2002, the Company announced the sale of this
business for consideration of approximately $100 million.
The proposed sale is currently being reviewed by the US
Department of Justice and is expected to be finalized during the
first half of 2002. The Company has accounted for the business
as a discontinued operation in accordance with APB No. 30
and, accordingly, the results of operations have been segregated
from continuing operations and reported as a separate line item
on the Company’s accompanying consolidated income
statements. The Company does not expect to incur a loss on the
sale of either the Fluid Sciences or Security and Detection
Systems businesses.

On August 20, 1999, the Company sold the
assets of its Technical Services business, including the
outstanding capital stock of EG&G Defense Materials, Inc., a
subsidiary of the Company, to EG&G Technical Services, Inc.,
an affiliate of The Carlyle Group LP (the
“Buyer”), for approximately $250 million in cash
and the assumption by the Buyer of certain liabilities of the
Technical Services business. The Company accounted for the sale
of its Technical Services business as a discontinued operation
in accordance



with APB No. 30. Accordingly, the results of
operations have been segregated from continuing operations and
reported as a separate line item on the Company’s
accompanying consolidated income statements.

Sales from the discontinued operations of the
Technical Services, Fluid Sciences and Security and Detection
Systems businesses were $271.7 million, $359.7 million
and $615.1 million during 2001, 2000 and 1999,
respectively. The summary operating results of the discontinued
operations are outlined in Note 7 to the financial
statements.

Dividends

During 2001, the Company’s Board of
Directors declared four regular quarterly cash dividends of
7 cents per share each, resulting in an annual rate of
28 cents per share.

Stock Split

At the Company’s 2001 Annual Meeting of
Stockholders, an increase in the number of authorized shares of
common stock from 100,000,000 shares to 300,000,000 shares was
approved. At the April 24, 2001 Board of Directors Meeting
a two-for-one stock split was approved. The stock split has been
retroactively reflected in this report.

Environmental

The Company is conducting a number of
environmental investigations and remedial actions at current and
former Company locations and, along with other companies, has
been named a potentially responsible party (PRP) for
certain waste disposal sites. The Company accrues for
environmental issues in the accounting period that the
Company’s responsibility is established and when the cost
can be reasonably estimated. The Company has accrued
$6.9 million as of December 30, 2001, representing
management’s estimate of the total cost of ultimate
disposition of known environmental matters. Such amount is not
discounted and does not reflect any recovery of any amounts
through insurance or indemnification arrangements. These cost
estimates are subject to a number of variables, including the
stage of the environmental investigations, the magnitude of the
possible contamination, the nature of the potential remedies,
possible joint and several liability, the timeframe over which
remediation may occur and the possible effects of changing laws
and regulations. For sites where the Company has been named a
PRP, management does not currently anticipate any additional
liability to result from the inability of other significant
named parties to contribute. The Company expects that such
accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to five
years. As assessments and remediation activities progress at
each individual site, these liabilities are reviewed and
adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes
available. There have been no environmental problems to date
that have had or are expected to have a material effect on the
Company’s financial position or results of operations.
While it is reasonably possible that a material loss exceeding
the amounts recorded may have been incurred, the preliminary
stages of the investigations make it impossible for the Company
to reasonably estimate the range of potential exposure.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash Flows

Net cash provided by operating activities was
$111.0 million in 2001 compared to $98.2 million in
2000. For 2001, this was comprised of net income before
depreciation, amortization and other non-cash items of
$176.8 million partially offset by gains on disposition of
assets, net of $30.9 million and $34.9 million net change
in certain assets and liabilities and other items during 2001.
The 2000 operating cash flow was comprised of net income before
depreciation, amortization and other non-cash items of
$162.6 million partially offset by gains on dispositions of
assets, net of $37.2 million and $27.2 million of net
change in certain assets, liabilities and other items during the
period.

Included in the change in assets and liabilities
for 2001 was a $39.5 million increase in inventory due to
lower than planned sales in a number of the businesses,
primarily in the Optoelectronics segment and inventory safety
stock for production moves, $31.5 million in restructuring
payments, partially offset by a $14.0 million reduction in
accounts receivable which is net of $37.0 million from a
receivable securitization program that is discussed below.



Capital expenditures were $88.7 million in
2001 versus $55.3 million in 2000. This increase was due to
a $30 million leasehold improvement at a new worldwide
headquarters facility for the Analytical Instruments business
and a $20 million expansion of the Company’s telecom
manufacturing capability. The Company estimates capital
expenditures for 2002 of approximately $60 million,
principally for equipment, process improvement and maintenance
associated with increasing productivity and capacity within the
businesses of drug discovery tools and other biomedical
applications.

Cash flow from the sale of businesses, primarily
IRAS and Voltarc, was $57.5 million and from the
monetization of assets was $56.3 million for 2001.
Monetization of assets consisted of the sale of non-strategic
assets and the sale-leaseback of facilities and equipment. Costs
of acquisitions, net of cash acquired, generated
$45.5 million of cash in 2001, principally from the Packard
acquisition, versus a usage of $431.5 million in 2000.
During 2000, cash flow from the sale of businesses was
$49.2 million and from the monetization of assets was
$33.9 million. Monetization of assets during 2000 included
the sale of assets, nonstrategic investments and the
sale-leaseback of facilities.

Cash flows generated through operating and
investing activities, along with proceeds of $39.4 million
from the exercise of stock options, were used in part to reduce
short-term commercial paper borrowings by $177.0 million
during 2001. In 2000, the Company issued convertible debt with
net proceeds totaling $448 million. These proceeds along
with net borrowings under commercial paper of approximately
$37.0 million and proceeds from the exercise of stock
options of $46.9 million were used in part to reduce other
debt balances by approximately $234.0 million. Cash
utilized in the payment of dividends to common stockholders
totaled $28.3 million during 2001.

Borrowing
Arrangements

The Company maintains two unsecured lines of
credit totaling $370 million. In March 2002, the
Company’s revolving credit facility was refinanced in the
amount of $270 million and will expire in March 2003. In
March 2001, the Company’s $100 million revolving
credit facility was refinanced and will expire in March 2006.
These agreements, which serve as backup facilities for the
commercial paper borrowings, have no significant commitment
fees. The credit lines, if drawn, bear interest at LIBOR plus 60
basis points. Under the terms of the credit agreement, the
Company is required to maintain certain minimum Debt to Total
Capital and Interest Coverage ratios. There were no amounts
outstanding under these lines at December 31, 2000 or
December 30, 2001 nor during any time period in these two
years and the Company was in compliance with all applicable
covenants.

At December 30, 2001 and December 31,
2000, long-term debt was $598.1 million and
$583.3 million, respectively. Included in these amounts are
$115 million of unsecured ten-year notes issued in October
1995, which carry an interest rate of 6.8% and mature in 2005.
During the fourth quarter of 2001, this fixed rate was swapped
to a floating rate, resulting in an all-in-cost of funds of
4.46% during 2001, a reduction of 2.34% from the fixed rate.
This interest rate swap instrument resets semi-annually in
arrears based upon six month USD LIBOR. The fair value of this
instrument as of December 30, 2001 was $(2.3) million
which is offset by a corresponding gain on the underlying bond.
Other long-term debt includes zero coupon senior convertible
debentures described below which had a $483 million
accreted value at 2001 and a $468 million accreted value at
2000. The carrying amount of the unsecured ten-year notes and
senior subordinated ten-year notes approximated the estimated
fair value at December 30, 2001, based on a quoted market
price. The estimated fair value of the convertible debentures
approximated $512 million at December 30, 2001, also
based on a quoted market price.

As discussed above, in 2001 the Company relocated
its Analytical Instruments headquarters to a new leased facility
and pre-funded $30 million of leasehold improvements.
Originally, these improvements were to be included in the
operating lease of the facility. However, the Company determined
it was more economical to purchase the leasehold improvements
and fund them through asset securitization. Consequently, the
Company established a wholly owned consolidated subsidiary to
purchase, on a revolving basis, certain of the Company’s
accounts receivable balances and simultaneously sell an
undivided interest in this pool of receivables to a financial
institution. As collections reduce the accounts receivable
balances, new receivables are sold. The Company’s
consolidated subsidiary retains the risk of credit loss on the
receivables and



accordingly, the full amount of the allowance for
doubtful accounts has been provided for on the Company’s
balance sheet. Under the terms of this arrangement, the Company
retains collection and administrative responsibilities for the
balances. The facility is renewable on an annual basis and has
an effective interest rate of approximately LIBOR plus 30 basis
points. Amounts sold under this facility during 2001
approximated $37 million. This amount has reduced the
outstanding receivables balance.

In August 2000, the Company sold zero coupon
senior convertible debentures with an aggregate purchase price
of $460 million. The Company used the offering’s net
proceeds of approximately $448 million to repay a portion
of its commercial paper borrowings, which had been increased
temporarily to finance the NEN acquisition. Deferred issuance
costs of $12 million were recorded as a non-current asset
and are being amortized over three years. The debentures are due
August 2020, and were priced with a yield to maturity of 3.5%.
At maturity, the Company would be required to repay
$921 million, comprised of $460 million of original
purchase price plus accrued original issue discount. The Company
may redeem some or all of the debentures at any time on or after
August 7, 2003 at a redemption price equal to the issue
price plus the accrued original issue discount through the
redemption date. Holders of the debentures may require the
Company to repurchase some or all of the debentures in August
2003 and August 2010, or at any time upon certain changes of
control in the Company, at a repurchase price equal to the
initial price to the public plus the accrued original issue
discount through the date of the repurchase. The Company has the
right to repay some or all of the debentures with common stock
based on the then current market price, subject to satisfying
conditions within the trust indenture, particularly the
Company’s ability to register the necessary common shares
under applicable securities laws. The Company may only exercise
this right in connection with a repurchase at the option of the
holders or a repurchase in connection with certain changes in
control. The debentures are currently convertible into
10.8 million shares of the Company’s common stock at
approximately $44 per share.

In November 2001, the Company completed its
acquisition of Packard BioScience Company and assumed
$118 million of senior subordinated ten-year notes issued
in March 1997. The Company redeemed the notes on March 1,
2002 at a rate of 104.688% in accordance with the indenture
dated as of March 4, 1997. As such, this amount has been
reclassified to short-term for presentation purposes.

As of December 30, 2001, the Company was in
compliance with all covenants and other requirements set forth
in its credit agreements and indentures. Although a downgrade in
the Company’s credit rating could affect the pricing of
short-term liquidity sources such as commercial paper, the only
credit agreement or indenture the Company maintains with ratings
downgrades that would accelerate the maturity dates of debt is
the receivables securitization program discussed above. The
Company and its subsidiaries are parties to various other
financing and leasing arrangements which do not contain any
ratings triggers.

Contractual
Obligations

The following table summarizes the Company’s
contractual obligations at December 30, 2001, and the
effect such obligations are expected to have on its liquidity
and cash flow in future periods:


The interest on the Unsecured Notes maturing in
	2005, originally fixed at 6.8%, has been swapped to a variable
	rate based upon the 6 month LIBOR. For the purposes of this
	table, the obligation has been calculated using the fixed 6.8%
	rate due to the variability in the actual rate.




As discussed above, the 9.375% Sr. Subordinated
	Notes due 2005 have been redeemed by the Company as of
	March 1, 2002.


The 2003 obligation on the Zero Coupon
	Convertible Debentures reflects the right of the holders to
	require the Company to repurchase some or all of the notes in
	August 2003, as discussed above. The Company has the option
	to repay some or all of the debentures with common stock, as
	discussed above.

Included in the lease commitments disclosed in
the preceding table is a six-year operating lease agreement
signed in 2000 for a facility in the Optoelectronics segment. At
the end of the lease term, the Company, at its option, may:
(i) renew the lease; (ii) purchase the property at a
price equal to the lessor’s original cost (approximately
$30 million); or (iii) allow the lease to expire and
cause the property to be sold. The Company’s ability to
cause the property to be sold depends upon its compliance with
certain terms of the lease. Under certain conditions, the
Company would receive any excess of the net sales proceeds over
the property’s original cost. In the event that the net
sales proceeds are less than the original cost, the Company
would be required to make certain contingent rental payments to
the lessor equal to that difference, subject to a maximum amount.

The Company requires cash to pay its operating
expenses, make capital expenditures and acquisitions and pay
debt service, including principal and interest. The
Company’s principal sources of funds are from its
operations and the capital markets, particularly the debt
markets. The Company also anticipates receiving significant cash
in the near term from the projected dispositions of its
discontinued operations.

In the near term, the Company anticipates that
its operations will generate sufficient cash to fund its
operating expenses, capital expenditures and interest payments
on its debt. Depending on the size of the transaction, the
Company may require funds from external sources for acquisitions
that it effects for cash. The Company may also require funds
from external sources to refinance the principal of its debt as
it matures, particularly the $510 million of zero coupon
convertible debentures that holders will have the option to put
in 2003 and the $123 million of principal that becomes due
on its 6.8% unsecured notes in 2005.

Principal factors that could affect the
Company’s internally generated funds include:

•

Increased working capital requirements.

•

Deterioration of sales due to continued weakness
	in certain end-markets into which the Company sells.

Principal factors that could affect the
Company’s ability to obtain cash from external sources
include:

Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial
statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments
that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, the Company
evaluates its estimates, including those related to bad debts,
inventories, investments, intangible assets, income taxes,
restructuring, pensions and other post-retirement benefits, and
contingencies and litigation. The Company bases its estimates on
historical experience and on various other assumptions that are
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results
of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying
values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
from other sources. Actual results may differ from these
estimates under different assumptions or conditions.



The Company believes the following critical
accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and
estimates used in preparation of its consolidated financial
statements.

The Company’s product sales are recorded at
the time when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,
delivery has occurred, the price to the buyer is fixed or
determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. A
provision is made at the time the related revenue is recognized
for the cost of any installation obligations and the estimated
cost of product warranties. When other significant obligations
remain after products are delivered, including certain customer
acceptance provisions, revenue is recognized only after such
obligations are fulfilled. If a loss is anticipated on any
contract, a provision for the entire loss is made immediately.
Revenue related to the sale of maintenance contracts is deferred
and amortized on a straight-line basis over the service period.
For equipment leased to a customer under a sales-type lease,
revenue recognition generally commences when the equipment has
been shipped, installed and is ready for use.

The Company values inventory at the lower of the
actual cost to purchase and/or manufacture the inventory or the
current estimated market value of the inventory. Inventory
quantities on hand are regularly reviewed, and where necessary,
provisions for excess and obsolete inventory are recorded based
primarily on either our estimated forecast of product demand and
production requirements for the next twelve months or historical
trailing twelve month usage. A significant increase in the
demand for our products could result in a short-term increase in
the cost of inventory purchases while a significant decrease in
demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess
inventory quantities on hand requiring additional inventory
write-downs.

The Company maintains allowances for doubtful
accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of
its customers to make required payments. If the financial
condition of the Company’s customers were to deteriorate,
resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments,
additional allowances may be required.

The Company periodically reviews the carrying
value of its long-lived assets and investments for continued
appropriateness. This review is based upon its projections of
anticipated future cash flows, market conditions, legal factors
and operational performance. While it believes that its future
estimates are reasonable, different assumptions regarding items
such as future cash flows and the volatility inherent in markets
which we serve could materially affect our evaluations and
result in impairment charges against the carrying value of those
assets.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About
Market Risk

Financial
Instruments

Financial instruments that potentially subject
the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally
of temporary cash investments and accounts receivable. The
Company believes it had no significant concentrations of credit
risk as of December 30, 2001.

In the ordinary course of business, the Company
enters into foreign exchange contracts for periods consistent
with its committed exposures to mitigate the effect of foreign
currency movements on transactions denominated in foreign
currencies. Transactions covered by hedge contracts include
inter-company and third-party receivables and payables. The
contracts are primarily in European and Asian currencies, have
maturities that do not exceed 12 months, have no cash
requirements until maturity and are recorded at fair value on
the consolidated balance sheet. Credit risk and market risk are
minimal as the foreign exchange instruments are contracted with
major banking institutions. Unrealized gains and losses on the
Company’s foreign currency contracts are recognized
immediately in earnings for hedges designated as fair value and,
for hedges designated as cash flow, the related unrealized gains
or losses are deferred as a component of other comprehensive
income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. These
deferred gains and losses are recognized in income in the period
in which the underlying anticipated transaction occurs.
Effectiveness of these cash flow hedges is measured utilizing
the cumulative dollar offset method and is reviewed quarterly.
For the year ended December 30, 2001, net losses from
hedges reclassified from other comprehensive income to revenue
and expense totaled $36,000. The notional amount of the
outstanding foreign currency contracts was approximately
$280 million as of December 30, 2001 and
$190 million at December 31, 2000. At
December 30, 2001, the approximate fair value for foreign
currency derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges
was $560,000 and at December 31, 2000 was not significant.
The approximate fair value for



foreign currency derivative instruments
designated as cash flow hedges was $380,000 and is recorded in
other current assets with the offset to other comprehensive
income. This gain will be recognized in earnings over the next
12 months.

Market Risk

Market Risk:

The
Company is exposed to market risk, including changes in interest
rates and currency exchange rates. To manage the volatility
relating to these exposures, the Company enters into various
derivative transactions pursuant to the Company’s policies
to hedge against known or forecasted market exposures.

Foreign Exchange Risk:

As a multinational corporation, the
Company is exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. As the
Company’s international sales grow, exposure to volatility
in exchange rates could have a materially adverse impact on the
Company’s financial results. The Company’s risk from
exchange rates is primarily related to non-dollar denominated
sales in Europe and Asia. The Company uses foreign currency
forward and option contracts to manage the risk of exchange rate
fluctuations. The derivative instruments held by the Company are
not leveraged and are not held for trading purposes. The Company
uses forward contracts to hedge its net asset position and uses
a combination of forward and option contracts to hedge
anticipated cash flows. The Company’s hedging activity is
intended to offset the impact of currency fluctuations on
assets, liabilities and cash flows denominated in foreign
currencies. The success of the hedging program depends on
forecasts of transaction activity in various currencies. To the
extent that these forecasts are overstated or understated during
periods of currency volatility, the Company could experience
unanticipated currency gains or losses. The principal currencies
hedged are the British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Euro, Japanese
Yen, and Singapore Dollar. In those currencies where there is a
liquid, cost-effective forward market, the Company maintains
hedge coverage between minimum and maximum percentages of its
anticipated transaction exposure for periods not to exceed one
year. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in
the value of the related exposure.

Interest Rate Risk:

The Company maintains an investment
portfolio consisting of securities of various issuers, types and
maturities. The investments are classified as available for
sale. These securities are recorded on the balance sheet at
market value, with any unrealized gain or loss recorded in
comprehensive income. These instruments are not leveraged, and
are not held for trading purposes.

Value-at-Risk:

The
Company utilizes a Value-at-Risk (“VaR”) model to
determine the potential loss in fair value of its interest rate
and foreign exchange sensitive derivative financial instruments
within a 95% confidence interval. The Company’s computation
was based on the interrelationships between movements in
interest rates and foreign currencies. These interrelationships
were determined by observing historical interest rate and
foreign currency market changes over corresponding periods. The
assets, liabilities, firm commitments and anticipated
transactions, which are hedged by derivative financial
instruments, were excluded from the model. The Company’s
computations are based on the Monte Carlo simulation, utilizing
a 95% confidence interval and a holding period of 30 days.
The VaR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to
represent actual gains or losses in fair value that will be
incurred by the Company. The VaR model estimated that there is a
5% chance that the market value of the derivative instruments
held as of December 30, 2001 will deteriorate due to
foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations by more than
$1.8 million. During the four quarters ended
December 30, 2001, the VaR ranged between
$0.25 million and $1.8 million, and averaged
approximately $0.8 million.

Management periodically reviews its interest rate
and foreign currency exposures and evaluates strategies to
manage such exposures in the near future. The Company implements
changes, when deemed necessary, in the management of hedging
instruments which mitigate its exposure.

Since the Company utilizes interest rate and
foreign currency sensitive derivative instruments for hedging, a
loss in fair value for those instruments is generally offset by
increases in the value of the underlying transaction.

It is the Company’s policy to enter into
foreign currency and interest rate transactions only to the
extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated
above. The Company does not enter into foreign currency or
interest rate transactions for speculative purposes.



Forward-Looking Information and Factors
Affecting Future Performance

This report contains “forward-looking
statements” as defined in Section 21E of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. For this purpose, any statements contained
in this report that are not statements of historical fact may be
deemed to be forward-looking statements. Words such as
“believes,” “anticipates,”
“plans,” “expects,” “will” and
similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking
statements. There are a number of important factors that could
cause our results to differ materially from those indicated by
these forward-looking statements including, among others, the
factors set forth below.

The following important factors affect our
business and operations generally or affect multiple segments of
our business and operations:

Our operating results could be harmed if
	the industries into which we sell our products are in downward
	cycles.

Some of the industries and markets into which we
sell our products are cyclical. Industry downturns often are
characterized by reduced product demand, excess manufacturing
capacity and erosion of average selling prices. Any significant
downturn in our customers’ markets or in general economic
conditions would likely result in a reduction in demand for our
products and could harm our business. For example, in 2001, and
with respect to Optoelectronics, the first quarter of 2002, the
operating results of our Optoelectronics and Fluid Sciences
segments were adversely affected by the downturn in the telecom,
photography and semiconductor markets. Current economic
conditions have caused a decrease in capital spending by many of
our customers, which in turn has adversely affected our revenues
and business.

If we do not introduce new products in a
	timely manner, our products could become obsolete, and our
	operating results would suffer.

We sell many of our products in industries
characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new
product and service introductions and evolving industry
standards. Without the timely introduction of new products and
enhancements, our products could become technologically obsolete
over time, in which case our revenue and operating results would
suffer. The success of our new product offerings will depend
upon several factors, including our ability to:

Many of our products are used by our customers to
develop, test and manufacture their products. Therefore, we must
anticipate industry trends and develop products in advance of
the commercialization of our customers’ products. In
developing any new product, we may be required to make a
substantial investment before we can determine the commercial
viability of the new product. If we fail to accurately foresee
our customers’ needs and future activities, we may invest
heavily in research and development of products that do not lead
to significant revenue.

In addition, some of our Life Sciences
segment’s licensed technology is subject to contractual
restrictions, which may limit our ability to develop or
commercialize products for some applications. For example, some
of our Life Sciences segment’s license agreements are
limited to the field of life sciences research and exclude
clinical diagnostics applications.

Economic, political and other risks
	associated with international sales and operations could
	adversely affect our sales.

Since we sell our products worldwide, our
businesses are subject to risks associated with doing business
internationally. Our revenue originating outside the United
States represented 56% of our total sales from continuing
operations in the fiscal year ended December 30, 2001. We
anticipate that sales from international



operations will continue to represent a
substantial portion of our total revenue. In addition, many of
our manufacturing facilities, employees and suppliers are
located outside the United States. Accordingly, our future
results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including:

Fluctuations in our quarterly operating
	results may cause our stock price to decline.

Given the nature of the markets in which we
participate, we cannot reliably predict future revenue and
profitability. Changes in competitive, market and economic
conditions may cause us to adjust our operations. A high
proportion of our costs are fixed, due in part to our
significant sales, research and development and manufacturing
costs. Thus, small declines in revenue could disproportionately
affect our operating results in a quarter. Factors that may
affect our quarterly operating results and the market price of
our common stock include:

In addition, the stock market has experienced
extreme price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has
significantly affected the market prices of securities for
reasons frequently unrelated to or disproportionate to the
operating performance of specific companies. These broad market
fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common
stock.

We may not be able to successfully execute
	our acquisition strategy, integrate acquired businesses into our
	existing business, or make acquired businesses
	profitable.

One of our strategies is to supplement our
internal growth by acquiring businesses and technologies that
complement or augment our existing product lines. We may be
unable to identify or complete promising acquisitions for many
reasons, including:

•

competition among buyers;

•

the need for regulatory and other approvals; and

•

the high valuations of businesses.



Some of the businesses we may seek to acquire may
be marginally profitable or unprofitable. Accordingly, the
earnings or losses of acquired businesses may dilute our
earnings. For these acquired businesses to achieve acceptable
levels of profitability, we must improve their management,
operations, products and market penetration. We may not be
successful in this regard and may encounter other difficulties
in integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations.

To finance our acquisitions, we may have to raise
additional funds, either through public or private financings.
We may be unable to obtain such funds or may be able to do so
only on unfavorable terms.

We face aggressive competition in many
	areas of our business; if we do not compete effectively, our
	business will be harmed.

We encounter aggressive competition from numerous
competitors in many areas of our business. We may not be able to
compete effectively with all of these competitors. To remain
competitive, we must develop new products and periodically
enhance our existing products in a timely manner. We anticipate
that we may have to adjust prices of many of our products to
stay competitive. In addition, new competitors may emerge, and
entire product lines may be threatened by new technologies or
market trends that reduce the value of these product lines.

If we fail to maintain satisfactory
	compliance with the regulations of the Food and Drug
	Administration and other governmental agencies, we may be forced
	to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution,
	and we could be subject to civil or criminal
	penalties.

Some of the products produced by our Life
Sciences segment are subject to regulation by the United States
Food and Drug Administration and similar international agencies.
These regulations govern a wide variety of product activities,
from design and development to labeling, manufacturing,
promotion, sales and distribution. If we fail to comply with the
FDA’s regulations or those of similar international
agencies, we may have to recall products and cease their
manufacture and distribution. In addition, we could be subject
to fines or criminal prosecution.

Changes in governmental regulations may
	reduce demand for our products or increase our
	expenses.

We compete in markets in which we or our
customers must comply with federal, state, local and foreign
regulations, such as environmental, health and safety and food
and drug regulations. We develop, configure and market our
products to meet customer needs created by these regulations.
Any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand
for our products or the cost of producing these products.

Obtaining and enforcing patent protection
	for our proprietary products, processes and technologies may be
	difficult and expensive; we may infringe intellectual property
	rights of third parties.

Patent and trade secret protection is important
to us because developing and marketing new technologies and
products is time-consuming and expensive. We own many U.S. and
foreign patents and intend to apply for additional patents to
cover our products. We may not obtain issued patents from any
pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to
us. The claims allowed under any issued patents may not be broad
enough to protect our technology.

Third parties may seek to challenge, invalidate
or circumvent issued patents owned by or licensed to us or claim
that our products and operations infringe their patent or other
intellectual property rights.

In addition to our patents, we possess an array
of unpatented proprietary technology and know-how and we license
intellectual property rights to and from third parties. The
measures employed to protect this technology and these rights
may not be adequate. Moreover, some licenses can be terminated
or converted to non-exclusive arrangements by the licensor if we
fail to meet specified performance targets.

We may incur significant expense in any legal
proceedings to protect our proprietary rights or to defend
infringement claims by third parties. In addition, claims of
third parties against us could result in awards of substantial
damages or court orders that could effectively prevent us from
making, using or selling our products in the U.S. or abroad.



We have substantial existing debt and may
	incur additional debt in the future.

As of December 30, 2001, we had $598 million
in outstanding long-term indebtedness. Our substantial level of
indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to
generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of,
interest on and other amounts due in respect of our
indebtedness. We may also obtain additional long-term debt and
working capital lines of credit and issue additional commercial
paper to meet future financing needs, which would have the
effect of increasing our total leverage.

Our substantial leverage could have significant
negative consequences, including:

A significant portion of our outstanding
indebtedness bears interest at floating rates. As a result, our
interest payment obligations on such indebtedness will increase
if interest rates increase.

Because a substantial portion of our assets
	is represented by intangibles, such as goodwill associated with
	acquisitions and costs associated with securing patent rights
	and technology licenses, the failure to realize the full value
	of those assets could adversely affect our results of
	operations.

As of December 30, 2001, our total assets
included $1.5 billion of net intangible assets. Net intangible
assets consist of goodwill associated with acquisitions and
costs associated with securing patent rights and technology
licenses, net of accumulated amortization. These assets have
historically been amortized on a straight-line basis over their
estimated useful lives. In connection our adoption of SFAS
No. 142, we will discontinue the amortization of goodwill
and indefinite lived intangible assets from December 31,
2001. Instead, these items will be tested on an annual basis for
potential impairment by comparing the carrying value to the fair
market value of the reporting unit to which they are assigned.
There can be no assurance that we will ultimately be able to
realize the full value assigned to those assets. Any realization
assessment that results in the write-off of a significant
portion of our net intangible assets could adversely affect our
results of operations.

We may not be able to successfully dispose
	of our Fluid Sciences business.

In October 2001, we approved a plan to sell
our Fluid Sciences business. Our ability to successfully dispose
of our Fluid Sciences business and the price we receive upon any
such disposition will be affected by, among other things, the
performance of the Fluid Sciences business and the ability of
prospective buyers to obtain adequate financing. The ability of
prospective buyers to obtain financing will depend on, among
other things, the state of the capital markets. We cannot
predict whether we will be able to successfully dispose of our
Fluid Sciences business.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS

Note 1:

Nature of Operations and Critical Accounting
	Policies

Nature of Operations:

PerkinElmer, Inc. is a global high
technology company which designs, manufactures, markets and
supports products, systems and service offerings within three
major business segments: Life Sciences, Optoelectronics and
Analytical Instruments. In August 1999, the Company divested its
Technical Services segment, which is presented as discontinued
operations in accordance with Accounting Principles Board (APB)
Opinion No. 30,

Reporting the Results of
Operations — Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a
Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and
Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions

(“APB
No. 30”) (see Note 7). In July 2001, PerkinElmer,
Inc. approved a plan to sell its Security and Detection Systems
business, which is presented as discontinued operations in
accordance with APB No. 30 (see Note 7). In October
2001, PerkinElmer, Inc. approved a plan to sell its Fluid
Sciences business which is presented as part of discontinued
operations in accordance with APB No. 30 (see Note 7).
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
PerkinElmer, Inc. (formerly EG&G, Inc.) and its subsidiaries
(the Company). All material intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates:

The preparation of consolidated
financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and
judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, the
Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to bad
debts, inventories, investments, intangible assets, income
taxes, restructuring, pensions and other post-retirement
benefits, and contingencies and litigation. The Company bases
its estimates on historical experience and on various other
assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making
judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities
that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results
may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or
conditions.

Sales:

The majority
of the Company’s product sales are recorded at the time of
shipment and when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,
the seller’s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable
and collectibility is reasonably assured. A provision is made at
the time the related revenue is recognized for the cost of any
installation obligations and the estimated cost of product
warranties. When other significant obligations remain after
products are delivered, including certain customer acceptance
provisions, revenue is recognized only after such obligations
are fulfilled. If a loss is anticipated on any contract, a
provision for the entire loss is made immediately. Revenue
related to the sale of maintenance contracts is deferred and
amortized on a straight-line basis over the service period. For
equipment leased to a customer under a sales-type lease, revenue
recognition generally commences when the equipment has been
shipped and installed. Shipping and handling costs are reflected
in both revenue and cost of goods sold to the extent they are
billed to customers. In all other instances they are reflected
as a component of cost of goods sold.

Inventories:

Inventories, which include material,
labor and manufacturing overhead, are valued at the lower of
cost or market. The majority of inventories is accounted for
using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method of determining
inventory costs; remaining inventories are accounted for using
the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. Inventory quantities
on-hand are regularly reviewed, and where necessary, provisions
for excess and obsolete inventory are recorded based primarily
on either the Company’s estimated forecast of product
demand and production requirements for the next twelve months or
historical trailing twelve month usage. A significant increase
in the demand for the Company’s products could result in a
short-term increase in the cost of inventory purchases while a
significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in
the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand requiring
additional inventory write-downs.

Allowance for Bad Debts:

The Company maintains allowances for
doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the
inability of its customers to make required payments. If the
financial condition of the Company’s customers were to
deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make
payments, additional allowance may be required.

Property, Plant and Equipment:

For financial statement purposes, the
Company depreciates plant and equipment using the straight-line
method over their estimated useful lives, which generally fall
within the



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

following ranges: buildings — 10 to
25 years; leasehold improvements — estimated
useful life or remaining term of lease, whichever is shorter;
machinery and equipment — 3 to 7 years. Certain
tooling costs are capitalized and amortized over a 3 year
life, while diminimus costs are expensed. For income tax
purposes, the Company depreciates plant and equipment over their
estimated useful lives using accelerated methods.

Pension Plans:

The
Company’s funding policy provides that payments to the U.S.
pension trusts shall at least be equal to the minimum funding
requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974. Non-U.S. plans are accrued for, but generally not fully
funded, and benefits are paid from operating funds.

Translation of Foreign Currencies:

The balance sheet accounts of non-U.S.
operations, exclusive of stockholders’ equity, are
translated at year-end exchange rates, and income statement
accounts are translated at weighted-average rates in effect
during the year; any translation adjustments are made directly
to a component of stockholders’ equity.

Intangible Assets:

In accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 121,

Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for
Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of

, and APB Opinion
No. 17,

Intangible Assets

, the Company reviews
long-lived assets and all intangible assets (including goodwill)
for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be
recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is determined by
comparing the forecasted undiscounted net cash flows of the
operation to which the assets relate, to the carrying amount
including associated intangible assets of such operation. If the
operation is determined to be unable to recover the carrying
amount of its assets, then intangible assets are written down
first, followed by the other long-lived assets of the operation,
to fair value. Fair value is determined based on discounted cash
flows or appraised values, depending upon the nature of the
assets. (See Note 4 for further discussion of asset
impairment charges.)

Stock-Based Compensation:

In accordance with SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

, the Company
accounts for stock-based compensation at intrinsic value with
disclosure of the effects of fair value accounting on net income
and earnings per share on a pro forma basis.

Cash Flows:

For
purposes of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, the
Company considers all highly liquid instruments with a purchased
maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The
carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair
value due to the short maturities.

Environmental Matters:

The Company accrues for costs
associated with the remediation of environmental pollution when
it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the
Company’s proportionate share of the amount can be
reasonably estimated. Any recorded liabilities have not been
discounted.

Comprehensive Income:

The Company has adopted the provisions
of SFAS No. 130,

Reporting Comprehensive Income

,
which established standards for reporting and display of
comprehensive income and its components. Comprehensive income is
the total of net income and all other nonowner changes in
stockholders’ equity.

Segments and Related Information:

The Company has adopted the provisions
of SFAS No. 131,

Disclosures about Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information

. The statement
established standards for the way that public business
enterprises report information and operating segments in annual
financial statements and requires reporting of selected
information in interim financial reports.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging:

The Financial Accounting Standards
Board (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 137,

Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities —
Deferral of the Effective Date of SFAS No. 133

, in June
1999. SFAS No. 133 was effective for all fiscal quarters of
all fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000. The
statement requires companies to record derivatives on the
balance sheet as assets or liabilities, measured at fair value.
Gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those
derivatives would be accounted for depending on the use of the
derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting. The
effect of the adoption of SFAS No. 133 as of January 1,
2001 was not material.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Stock Splits:

Per
share amounts and share data have been retroactively restated to
give effect to the two-for-one stock split on June 1, 2001,
effected in the form of a 100% stock dividend for holders of
record as of May 15, 2001.

Reclassifications:

Certain amounts from prior years have
been reclassified to conform to the 2001 financial statement
presentation.

Recently Issued Accounting
	Pronouncements

In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141,

Business Combinations

, and SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets

. SFAS No. 141 requires all
business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 to be
accounted for using the purchase method. Under SFAS
No. 142, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite
lives are no longer amortized but are reviewed annually at a
minimum for potential impairment by comparing the carrying value
to the fair value of the reporting unit to which they are
assigned. The provisions of SFAS No. 142 apply to goodwill
and intangible assets arising for acquisitions completed
subsequent to June 30, 2001. SFAS No. 142 is required
to be adopted for goodwill and intangible assets arising from
acquisitions prior to June 30, 2001 as of December 31,
2001. The Company is currently determining the impact of
adopting this standard under the transition provisions of SFAS
No. 142. Goodwill amortization expense for 2001 was
$26.2 million.

In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143,

Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations

. SFAS
No. 143 addresses accounting and reporting for obligations
associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and
the associated asset retirement costs. This statement is
effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002.
The Company is currently assessing the impact of this new
standard.

In July 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets

, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2001. The provisions of this statement provide
a single accounting model for determining impairment of
long-lived assets. The Company is currently assessing the impact
of this new standard.

Note 2:

Acquisitions and Divestitures

On November 13, 2001, the Company completed
the acquisition of Packard BioScience Company (Packard) for
consideration of approximately $762 million in the form of
approximately 22 million of the Company’s common
shares and the assumption of $118 million in debt which was
subsequently redeemed in March 2002 (see Note 14). Packard
is a global developer, manufacturer and marketer of instruments
and related consumables and services for use in drug discovery
and other life sciences research and generated sales of
approximately $165 million for its fiscal year ended
December 31, 2000.

Packard’s operations, assumed as of the date
of acquisition, are reported within the results from operations
of the Life Sciences segment. The acquisition was accounted for
as a purchase in accordance with the recently issued SFAS
No. 141, and the Company has accordingly allocated the
purchase price of Packard based upon the fair values of the net
assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The allocation of the
purchase price has not yet been finalized, however, the Company
does not expect material changes. Portions of the net assets
acquired and liabilities assumed were valued by independent
appraisers utilizing customary valuation procedures and
techniques. These intangible assets included $69.0 million
in acquired in-process research and development for projects
that had not yet reached technological feasibility as of the
acquisition date and for which no future alternative use
existed. These costs were expensed during the fourth quarter of
2001. Other acquired intangible assets valued at
$237.3 million included the fair value of trade names,
trademarks, patents and developed technology. Of this amount,
$76.5 million has been ascribed to trade names and trademarks
for which an indefinite life has been assigned. The Packard
acquisition also resulted in goodwill of $438.6 million.
Indefinite lived intangibles and goodwill are not being
amortized in accordance with SFAS No. 141, effective for
all business combinations completed subsequent to July 1,
2001.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In connection with this acquisition, the Company
agreed to issue 0.311 shares of PerkinElmer common stock for
each outstanding share of Packard common stock. The Company also
agreed to assume all outstanding options to purchase Packard
common stock, which became exercisable for shares of PerkinElmer
common stock following the merger after giving effect to the
same exchange ratio provided for in the merger agreement to the
Packard common shareholders. The purchase price for Packard has
been allocated to the estimated fair value of assets acquired
and liabilities assumed. The preliminary purchase price
allocation is based upon the Company’s current estimates of
respective fair values. Some allocations are based on studies
and independent valuations, as discussed above.

The components of the estimated purchase price
and preliminary allocation are as follows (in thousands):

On July 31, 2000, the Company completed its
acquisition of NEN Life Sciences, Inc. (NEN), a provider of
state-of-the-art drug discovery products, services, reagents and
technologies to the life sciences industry for an aggregate
purchase price of approximately $400 million. In connection
with the acquisition, the Company paid approximately
$350 million in cash and issued warrants to purchase
approximately 600,000 shares of the Company’s common stock
in exchange for all of the outstanding shares, options and
warrants of NEN. In addition, the Company repaid approximately
$50 million of outstanding indebtedness of NEN. The Company
financed the acquisition and repayment of the outstanding
indebtedness with $410 million of commercial paper
borrowings with a weighted-average interest rate of 7%. These
short-term borrowings were repaid in early August with proceeds
from the issuance of long-term convertible debentures (see Note
14). NEN’s operations, included in the consolidated results
of the Company from the date of acquisition, are reported in the
Life Sciences segment. The acquisition was accounted for as a
purchase under APB Opinion No. 16,

Business
Combinations

(“APB No. 16”).

On May 28, 1999, the Company completed its
acquisition of the Analytical Instruments Division (AI) of
PE Corp. for an aggregate purchase price of approximately
$425 million, plus acquisition costs. The acquisition was
accounted for as a purchase under APB No. 16.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Unaudited pro forma operating results for the
Company, assuming the acquisition of AI occurred on
December 29, 1997, NEN occurred on January 3, 1999,
and Packard occurred on January 3, 2000 are as follows:

The pro forma amounts in the previous table
exclude the in-process R&D charges of $69.0 million,
$24.3 million and $23 million for the Packard, NEN and
AI acquisitions, respectively. The unaudited pro forma financial
information is provided for informational purposes only and is
not necessarily indicative of the Company’s operating
results that would have occurred had the acquisitions been
consummated on the dates for which the consummation of the
acquisitions are being given effect, nor is it necessarily
indicative of the Company’s future operating results. The
pro forma amounts do not reflect any operating efficiencies and
cost savings that the Company believes are achievable.

During the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company
sold its IRAS business for cash of $55.5 million, resulting
in a pretax gain of approximately $32.3 million.
Additionally, the Company has deferred a gain of approximately
$3 million in connection with certain contingencies related
to the sale. Also during the fourth quarter, the Company sold
its Voltarc business for cash of $9.5 million and a note
for approximately $8.0 million, resulting in a pretax loss
of approximately $6.3 million. The combined net income of
the disposed businesses were $5.4 million in 2000 and
$1.4 million in 2001 through the date of disposal.

During 2001, 2000 and 1999, in connection with
the 1998 dispositions of the Company’s Rotron and Sealol
Industrial Seals divisions, the Company recognized approximately
$1.0 million, $3.7 million and $13.2 million,
respectively, of pre-tax gains from the previously deferred
sales proceeds as a result of the favorable resolution of
certain events and contingencies. As of December 30, 2001,
$2.7 million in gains related to the Rotron sale remain
deferred pending the resolution of certain matters.

During the fourth quarter of 2000, the Company
sold its Berthold business at a net pre-tax gain of
$10 million. The Company deferred gain recognition of
approximately $11.9 million of sales proceeds from this
divestiture in connection with certain contingencies related to
the sale, $2.0 million of which was recognized during 2001.
Revenues for 2000 and 1999 for the divested business were
$30 million and $38 million, respectively. Also during
the fourth quarter of 2000, the Company recorded a pre-tax gain
of $16.7 million from the sale of a building. Additionally
during 2001, the Company recognized $2.4 million in net
losses related to certain other dispositions.

During the first quarter of 2000, the Company
sold its micromachined sensors and specialty semiconductor
businesses for cash of $24.3 million, resulting in a
pre-tax gain of $6.7 million. Combined financial results of
the divested businesses for 2000 and 1999 were not material to
the consolidated results of the Company.

All of the gains described above are reported on
the “Gains on Dispositions, net” line in the
consolidated income statements.

Note 3:

Restructuring and Integration
	Charges

During the fourth quarter of 2001, the Company
expanded its continuing effort to restructure certain businesses
to further improve performance. The plan resulted in additional
pre-tax restructuring charges of



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

$9.2 million. The principal actions in these
restructuring plans primarily relate to employee separation
costs associated with the consolidation of certain European
general and managerial functions within both the Life Sciences
and Analytical Instruments segments, as well as costs associated
with the closure of certain facilities and disposal of related
assets.

During the fourth quarter of 2000, the Company
recorded of a pre-tax restructuring charge of $15.1 million
for actions to be completed in 2001 (the “2000 plan”).
These charges related to the Company’s Life Sciences and
Optoelectronics segments. The principal actions in the
restructuring plans included close-down or consolidation of a
number of offices and facilities, the closure of certain
manufacturing facilities, and the disposal of underutilized
assets. The restructuring charges were broken down as follows by
operating segment: The Life Sciences’ actions were
associated with rationalization of its distribution network and
overall facility consolidation. The Optoelectronics’
actions were associated with its Lighting and Imaging businesses
and relate to employee separation costs and the closures of
certain manufacturing facilities. During 2001, the Company
provided for an additional $0.8 million under the 2000 plan
as a result of additional needs related to lease terminations.
Also during 2001, due to the substantial completion of the
actions of the 2000 plan, the Company reevaluated its 2000
restructuring plans. As a result of this review, costs
associated with the previous Life Sciences plan related to the
rationalization of its network and facility consolidation were
no longer required. As a result, the Company recognized a
restructuring credit of $0.5 million during 2001.

The following table summarizes activity related
to the 2000 plan:

Also during 2000, as a result of the substantial
completion of previously announced restructuring plans, the
Company recognized restructuring credits of $11.2 million
relating to 1999 and prier restructurings.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

As part of the Packard acquisition, the Company
recorded approximately $33.0 million in integration
charges. The integration plans include initiatives to integrate
the operations of Packard and the Company and are principally
comprised of amounts related to employee separation costs and
the termination of leases and other contractual obligations.

During the second quarter of 2000, the Company
finalized its restructuring plan for AI. Based on continued
aggressive actions by the Company to improve the cost structure
of the acquired business, and increased costs related primarily
to employment integration, the Company increased its original
estimate of restructuring costs recorded at the acquisition date
by $24.0 million in connection with purchase accounting.
All restructuring actions will have been completed by the first
quarter of 2002.

As part of the July 2000 acquisition of NEN, the
Company recorded a $4.0 million restructuring charge for
actions targeted at reduced employment costs, consolidation of
certain facilities and the termination of certain leases and
other contractual obligations.

The following table summarizes reserve activity
during fiscal 2001 related to the AI and NEN acquisitions as
discussed above:

Cash outlays during 2001 were approximately
$36.3 million for the above discussed plans. The Company
expects to incur approximately $40– $50 million of
cash outlays in connection with these plans during 2002.

Note 4:

Asset Impairment Charges

During the third quarter of 1999, in connection
with its ongoing review of its portfolio of businesses, the
Company conducted a strategic review of certain units within its
business segments. The strategic review triggered an impairment
review of long-lived assets of certain business units that were
expected to be disposed. The Company calculated the present
value of expected cash flows of certain business units to
determine the fair value of those assets. Accordingly, in the
third quarter of 1999, the Company recorded non-cash impairment
charges and wrote down goodwill by $15 million in the
Instruments segment and $3 million in the Optoelectronics
segment. Sales and operating profit for the businesses under
strategic review were approximately $54 million and
$2 million, respectively, in 1999.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Note 5:

Other Expense

Other expense, net consisted of the following:

The increase in interest expense in 2001 was due
to the impact of higher debt levels resulting from acquisitions.
The increase in gains on sales of investments, net was due to
the disposal of two non-strategic investments during 2001 for
gains of approximately $3.4 million and $0.9 million,
respectively.

Note 6:

Income Taxes

The components of income from continuing
operations before income taxes for financial reporting purposes
were as follows:

The components of the provision for income taxes
for continuing operations were as follows:



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The total provision for income taxes included in
the consolidated financial statements was as follows:

The major differences between the Company’s
effective tax rate for continuing operations and the federal
statutory rate were as follows:

The 2001 tax provision and effective tax rate for
continuing operations was impacted by the inclusion of
in-process research and development charges associated with the
Packard acquisition and the disposals of the Voltarc and the
IRAS businesses.

The 2000 tax provision and effective rate for
continuing operations includes tax for nonrecurring items such
as the disposals of the Berthold, micromachined sensors and
specialty semiconductor businesses. The 1999 tax provision and
effective rate for continuing operations was impacted by a
non-deductible goodwill write-down.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The tax effects of temporary differences and
carryovers that gave rise to deferred income tax assets and
liabilities as of December 30, 2001 and December 31,
2000 were as follows:

At December 30, 2001, the Company had
non-U.S. (primarily from Germany) net operating loss carryovers
of $13.4 million, substantially all of which carry forward
indefinitely. The valuation allowance results primarily from
these carryovers, as the Company expects that they will not be
realized.

Current deferred tax assets of $78 million
and $53 million were included in other current assets at
December 30, 2001 and December 31, 2000, respectively.
Long-term deferred tax liabilities of $101 million and
$8 million were included in long-term liabilities at
December 30, 2001 and December 31, 2000, respectively.

In general, it is the practice and intention of
the Company to reinvest the earnings of its non-U.S.
subsidiaries in those operations. Repatriation of retained
earnings is done only when it is advantageous. Applicable
federal taxes are provided only on amounts planned to be
remitted.

During 2001 the Company received notice from the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that a previously brought US Tax
Court case had been settled in the Company’s favor,
resulting in a minor refund. The total additional tax proposed
by the IRS previously amounted to approximately $74 million
plus interest.

Note 7:

Discontinued Operations

In July 2001, the Company approved a plan to sell
its Security and Detection Systems business. The results of
operations of the Security and Detection Systems business were
previously reported as part of the Analytical Instruments
business. In October 2001, the Company approved a plan to sell
its Fluid Sciences business. The Company has accounted for the
plan to sell both businesses as discontinued operations in
accordance with APB No. 30, and accordingly, the results of
operations of the Security and Detection Systems business and
the Fluid Sciences business have been segregated from continuing
operations and reported as a



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

separate line on the Company’s Consolidated
Income Statements. The Company does not expect to incur a loss
on the sale of either business.

On August 20, 1999, the Company sold the
assets of its Technical Services business, including the
outstanding capital stock of EG&G Defense Materials, Inc., a
subsidiary of the Company, to EG&G Technical Services, Inc.
The results of operations of the Technical Services business
were previously reported as one of five business segments of the
Company. The Company accounted for the sale of its Technical
Services business as a discontinued operation in accordance with
APB No. 30 and, accordingly, the results of operations of
the Technical Services business have been segregated from
continuing operations and reported as a separate line item on
the Company’s Consolidated Income Statements during 1999.
The Company recorded a pre-tax gain on disposition of
discontinued operations of $181 million, net of transaction
and related costs, during 1999. The $110 million after-tax
gain was reported separately from the results of the
Company’s continuing operations.

Summary operating results of the discontinued
operations of the Technical Services, Fluid Sciences and
Security and Detection Systems businesses (through
December 30, 2001) were as follows:

Note 8:

Earnings per Share

Basic earnings per share was computed by dividing
net income by the weighted-average number of common shares
outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share was
computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number
of common shares outstanding plus all potentially dilutive
common shares outstanding, primarily shares issuable upon the
exercise of stock options using the treasury stock method. The
following table reconciles the number of shares utilized in the
earnings per share calculations:

Potential common shares of 3,570,000 were not
included in the computation of weighted-average diluted shares
outstanding for 2001 because their inclusion would be
anti-dilutive.

Options to purchase 8,044,000 and 54,400 shares
of common stock were not included in the computation of diluted
earnings per share for 2001 and 2000, respectively, because the
options’ exercise prices were greater than the average
market price of the common shares and thus their effect would
have been antidilutive. Additionally, the Company’s zero
coupon senior convertible debentures (see Note 14) are
currently convertible into 10.8 million shares of the
Company’s common stock at approximately $44.00 per share.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Conversion of the debentures was not assumed in
the computation of diluted earnings per share because the effect
of assumed conversion would have been antidilutive.

Note 9:

Accounts Receivable

Accounts receivable were net of reserves for
doubtful accounts of $13.1 million and $13.3 million
as of December 30, 2001 and December 31, 2000
respectively.

During 2001, the Company established a wholly
owned consolidated subsidiary to purchase, on a revolving basis,
certain of the Company’s accounts receivable balances and
simultaneously sell an undivided interest in this pool of
receivables to a financial institution. As collections reduce
the accounts receivable balances, new receivables are sold. The
Company’s consolidated subsidiary retains the risk of
credit loss on the receivables and accordingly, the full amount
of the allowance for doubtful accounts has been provided for on
the Company’s balance sheet. Under the terms of this
arrangement, the Company retains collection and administrative
responsibilities for the balances. The facility is renewable on
an annual basis and has an effective interest rate of
approximately LIBOR plus 30 basis points. Amounts sold under
this facility during 2001 approximated $37 million. This
amount has reduced the outstanding receivable balance.

Note 10:

Inventories

Inventories as of December 30, 2001 and
December 31, 2000 consisted of the following:

The increase in inventory is primarily
attributable to the Packard acquisition which occurred during
the fourth quarter of 2001.

Note 11:

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment, at cost, as of
December 30, 2001 and December 31, 2000 consisted of
the following:

Increases in property, plant and equipment are
primarily due to the acquisition of Packard and capital
expenditures related to the Analytical Instruments facility in
Shelton, CT during 2001, offset to some extent by the
sale-leaseback of certain facilities and equipment, as
previously discussed.

Note 12:

Investments

Investments as of December 30, 2001 and
December 31, 2000 consisted of the following:

The decrease in marketable investments from 2000
to 2001 resulted mainly from the sale of approximately 70% of
the Company’s investment in Genomic Solutions, Inc.
Marketable investments consist of trust assets which are carried
at market value and primarily reflect equity and fixed-income
securities held to meet obligations associated with the
supplemental executive retirement plan. As of December 30,
2001, the fixed-income securities held within marketable
investments had, on average, maturities of between 3 and
30 years.

The change in the joint venture and other
investments balance from 2000 to 2001 is reflective of the
Company’s sale of its interest in a joint venture with
Seiko in connection with the sale of the IRAS business, offset
by an additional $3.1 million investment in Bragg
Photonics. This additional investment brings the Company’s
total investment in Bragg Photonics to 31%. The Company
recognized a $1.9 million loss in 2001 as a result of
equity accounting for this investment. Joint venture investments
reflect holdings the Company maintains which are accounted for
under the equity method of accounting.

The net unrealized holding gain (loss) on
marketable investments, net of deferred income taxes, reported
as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss) in stockholders’ equity, was a
$1.4 million loss and a $0.9 million gain at
December 30, 2001 and December 31, 2000, respectively.

Marketable investments classified as available
for sale as of December 30, 2001 and December 31, 2000
consisted of the following:

Note 13:

Intangible Assets

Intangible assets consist mainly of goodwill from
acquisitions accounted for using the purchase method of
accounting, representing the excess of cost over the fair market
value of the net assets of the acquired businesses. Goodwill,
net of accumulated amortization, was $1,034 million and
$631 million at December 30, 2001 and
December 31, 2000, respectively. Other identifiable
intangible assets from acquisitions include patents, trademarks,
trade names and developed technology and are being amortized
over periods of 10–40 years. Other identifiable
intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, were
$497 million and



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

$256 million at December 30, 2001 and
December 31, 2000, respectively. Intangible assets as of
December 30, 2001 and December 31, 2000 consisted of
the following:

As previously discussed, the issuance of SFAS
No. 142 will result in the discontinuance of goodwill and
indefinite lived intangible amortization from December 31,
2001 forward. Instead, these items will be tested on an annual
basis for potential impairment by comparing the carrying value
to the fair value of the reporting unit to which they are
assigned.

The increase in intangible assets resulted
primarily from the acquisition of Packard in 2001, as previously
discussed.

Note 14:

Debt

Short-term debt at December 30, 2001 was
$125.7 million with no commercial paper outstanding.
Short-term debt at December 31, 2000 was
$183.1 million and was comprised primarily of commercial
paper borrowings. The weighted average interest rate on the
commercial paper borrowings was 4.4% and 6.7%, during 2001 and
2000, respectively. Weighted average maturities were
20 days or less during 2001 and 60 days or less during
2000.

In March 2002, the Company’s revolving
credit facility was refinanced in the amount of
$270 million and will expire in March 2003. The Company
refinanced a $100 million revolving credit facility, which
expires in March 2006. These agreements, which serve as backup
facilities for the commercial paper borrowings, have no
significant commitment fees. Under the terms of the credit
agreement, the Company is required to maintain certain minimum
Debt to Total Capital and Interest Coverage ratios, with which
the Company was in compliance during all of 2000 and 2001. There
were no amounts outstanding under these lines at
December 30, 2001 or December 31, 2000 nor at any time
during these two years.

At December 30, 2001 and December 31,
2000, long-term debt was $598.1 million and
$583.3 million, respectively. Included in these amounts are
$115 million of unsecured ten-year notes issued in October
1995, which carry an interest rate of 6.8% and mature in 2005.
During the fourth quarter of 2001, this fixed rate was swapped
to a floating rate, resulting in an all-in cost of funds of
4.46% during 2001, an annualized reduction of 2.34% from the
fixed rate. This interest rate swap instrument resets
semi-annually in arrears based upon six month USD LIBOR. The
fair value of this instrument as of December 30, 2001 was
$(2.3) million, which is offset by a corresponding gain on
the underlying bond. Other long term debt includes zero coupon
senior convertible debentures described below which had a
$483 million accreted value at 2001 and a $468 million
accreted value at 2000. The carrying amount of the unsecured
ten-year notes and senior subordinated ten-year notes
approximated the estimated fair value at December 30, 2001,
based on a quoted market price. The estimated fair value of the
convertible debentures approximated $512 million at
December 30, 2001, also based on a quoted market price.

In August 2000, the Company sold zero coupon
senior convertible debentures with an aggregate purchase price
of $460 million. The Company used the offering’s net
proceeds of approximately $448 million to repay a portion
of its commercial paper borrowings, which had been increased
temporarily to finance the NEN acquisition. Deferred issuance
costs of $12 million were recorded as a noncurrent asset
and are being amortized over three years. The debentures, which
were offered by a prospectus supplement pursuant to the
Company’s effective shelf registration statement, are due
August 2020, and were priced with a yield to maturity of 3.5%.
At maturity, the Company is required to repay $921 million,
comprised of $460 million of



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

original purchase price plus accrued original
issue discount. The Company may redeem some or all of the
debentures at any time on or after August 7, 2003 at a
redemption price equal to the issue price plus the accrued
original issue discount through the redemption date. Holders of
the debentures may require the Company to repurchase some or all
of the debentures in August 2003 and August 2010, or at any time
when there is a change in control of the Company, as is
customary and ordinary for debentures of this nature, at a
repurchase price equal to the initial price to the public plus
the accrued original issue discount through the date of the
repurchase. The debentures are currently convertible into
10.8 million shares of the Company’s common stock at
approximately $44.00 per share.

In November 2001, the Company completed its
acquisition of Packard BioScience Company and assumed
$118 million of senior subordinated ten-year notes issued
in March 1997 at an interest rate of 9.375%. The Company has
elected to redeem the notes on March 1, 2002 at a rate of
104.688% in accordance with the indenture dated as of
March 4, 1997. As such, this amount has been reclassified
to short-term debt for presentation purposes.

Note 15:

Accrued Expenses

Accrued expenses as of December 30, 2001 and
December 31, 2000 consisted of the following:

The increase in accrued expenses is due primarily
to accrued expenses assumed as part of the Packard acquisition.

Note 16:

Employee Benefit Plans

Except where noted otherwise, the following
employee benefit plan disclosures include amounts and
information, on a combined basis, for both the continuing and
discontinued operations of the Company.

Savings Plan:

The
Company has a savings plan for the benefit of qualified U.S.
employees. Under this plan, for all business units except those
within Life Sciences, the Company contributes an amount equal to
the lesser of 55% of the amount of the employee’s voluntary
contribution or 3.3% of the employee’s annual compensation.
For Life Sciences, the Company contributes an amount equal to
the lesser of 100% of the employee’s voluntary contribution
or 5.0% of the employee’s annual compensation. Savings plan
expense charged to continuing operations was $5.8 million
in 2001, $4.2 million in 2000, and $2.8 million in
1999.

Pension Plans:

The
Company has defined benefit pension plans covering substantially
all U.S. employees except those employed by Life Sciences and
non-U.S. pension plans for non-U.S. employees. The U.S. defined
benefit pension plans were closed to new hires effective
January 31, 2001. The plans provide benefits that are based
on an employee’s years of service and compensation near
retirement. Assets of the U.S. plan are comprised primarily of
equity and debt securities.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Net periodic pension cost included the following
components:

STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The following table sets forth the changes in the
funded status of the principal U.S. pension plan and the
principal non-U.S. pension plans and the amounts recognized in
the Company’s consolidated balance sheets as of
December 30, 2001 and December 31, 2000.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Non-U.S. accrued pension liabilities classified
as long-term liabilities totaled $80 million and
$86 million as of December 30, 2001 and
December 31, 2000, respectively. The U.S. pension asset was
classified as other noncurrent assets.

The Company also sponsors a supplemental
executive retirement plan to provide senior management with
benefits in excess of normal pension benefits. Effective
July 31, 2000, this plan was closed to new entrants. At
December 30, 2001 and December 31, 2000, the projected
benefit obligations were $16.5 million and
$16.4 million, respectively. Assets with a fair value of
$8.0 million and $9.2 million segregated in a trust,
were available to meet this obligation as of December 30,
2001 and December 31, 2000, respectively. Pension expense
for this plan was approximately $1.1 million in 2001,
$2.0 million in 2000 and $1.8 million in 1999.

Postretirement Medical Plans:

The Company provides health care
benefits for eligible retired U.S. employees under a
comprehensive major medical plan or under health maintenance
organizations where available. The majority of the
Company’s U.S. employees become eligible for retiree health
benefits if they retire directly from the Company and have at
least ten years of service. Generally, the major medical plan
pays stated percentages of covered expenses after a deductible
is met and takes into consideration payments by other group
coverages and by Medicare. The plan requires retiree
contributions under most circumstances and has provisions for
cost-sharing charges. Effective January 1, 2000, this plan
was closed to new hires. For employees retiring after 1991, the
Company has capped its medical premium contribution based on
employees’ years of service. The Company funds the amount
allowable under a 401(h) provision in the Company’s defined
benefit pension plan. Assets of the plan are comprised primarily
of equity and debt securities.

Net periodic post-retirement medical benefit cost
(credit) included the following components:.



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The following table sets forth the changes in the
postretirement medical plan’s funded status and the amounts
recognized in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets at
December 30, 2001 and December 31, 2000.

The accrued postretirement medical liability
included $4.5 million and $4.7 million classified as
long-term liabilities as of December 30, 2001 and
December 31, 2000, respectively.

Deferred Compensation Plans:

During 1998, the Company implemented
certain nonqualified deferred compensation programs that provide
benefits payable to officers and certain key employees or their
designated beneficiaries at specified future dates, upon
retirement or death. Benefit payments under these plans are



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

funded by a combination of contributions from
participants and the Company. In 2000, this plan was extended to
cover members of the Board of Directors.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan:

The Company has an Employee Stock
Purchase Plan, whereby participating employees have the right to
purchase common stock at a price equal to 85% of the lower of
the closing price on the first day or the last day of the
six-month offering period. The number of shares which an
employee may purchase, subject to certain aggregate limits, is
determined by the employee’s voluntary contribution which
may not exceed 10% of base compensation.

Other:

The Company
has granted restricted stock awards to certain executive
employees and directors which contain vesting provisions tied to
certain Company performance metrics. The shares available under
these awards are a component of the Company’s 1999
Incentive Plan.

Note 17:

Commitments and Contingencies

The Company is subject to various claims, legal
proceedings and investigations covering a wide range of matters
that arise in the ordinary course of its business activities.
Each of these matters is subject to various uncertainties, and
it is possible that some of these matters may be resolved
unfavorably to the Company. The Company has established accruals
for matters that are probable and reasonably estimable.
Management believes that any liability that may ultimately
result from the resolution of these matters in excess of amounts
provided will not have a material adverse effect on the
financial position or results of operations of the Company.

In addition, the Company is conducting a number
of environmental investigations and remedial actions at current
and former Company locations and, along with other companies,
has been named a potentially responsible party (PRP) for
certain waste disposal sites. The Company accrues for
environmental issues in the accounting period that the
Company’s responsibility is established and when the cost
can be reasonably estimated. The Company has accrued
$6.9 million as of December 30, 2001, representing
management’s estimate of the total cost of ultimate
disposition of known environmental matters. Such amount is not
discounted and does not reflect the recovery of any amounts
through insurance or indemnification arrangements. These cost
estimates are subject to a number of variables, including the
stage of the environmental investigations, the magnitude of the
possible contamination, the nature of the potential remedies,
possible joint and several liability, the timeframe over which
remediation may occur and the possible effects of changing laws
and regulations. For sites where the Company has been named a
PRP, management does not currently anticipate any additional
liability to result from the inability of other significant
named parties to contribute. The Company expects that such
accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to five
years. As assessments and remediation activities progress at
each individual site, these liabilities are reviewed and
adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes
available. There have been no environmental problems to date
that have had or are expected to have a material effect on the
Company’s financial position or results of operations.
While it is reasonably possible that a material loss exceeding
the amounts recorded may have been incurred, the preliminary
stages of the investigations make it impossible for the Company
to reasonably estimate the range of potential exposure.

Included in the lease commitments discussed in
Note 21 to the Financial Statements is a six-year operating
lease agreement signed in 2000 for a facility in the
Optoelectronics segment. At the end of the lease term, the
Company, at its option, may: (i) renew the lease;
(ii) purchase the property at a price equal to the
lessor’s original cost (approximately $30 million); or
(iii) allow the lease to expire and cause the property to
be sold. The Company’s ability to cause the property to be
sold depends upon its compliance with certain terms of the
lease. Under certain conditions, the Company would receive any
excess of the net sales proceeds over the property’s
original cost. In the event that the net sales proceeds are less
than the original cost, the Company would make certain
contingent rental payments to the lessor equal to that
difference, subject to a maximum amount.

Risks and Uncertainties

For information concerning various
investigations, claims, legal proceedings, environmental
investigations and remedial actions, see Note 17. For
information concerning factors affecting future performance, see
Management’s Discussion and Analysis.

Costs incurred under cost-reimbursable government
contracts, primarily in the former Technical Services segment,
which is presented as discontinued operations, are subject to
audit by the government. The results of prior audits, completed
through 1997, have not had a material effect on the Company.

The Company’s management and operations
contracts with the DOE are presented as discontinued operations.
The Company’s last DOE management and operations contract
expired on September 30, 1997. The Company is in the
process of negotiating contract closeouts and does not
anticipate incurring any material loss in excess of previously
established reserves.

Note 19:

Stockholders’ Equity

Stock-Based Compensation:

Under the 2001 Incentive Plan,
8.8 million additional shares of the Company’s common
stock were made available for option grants, restricted stock
awards, performance units and other stock-based awards. Under
the 1999 Incentive Plan, 7.0 million additional shares of
the Company’s common stock were made available for similar
stock-based awards. At December 30, 2001, 3.6 million
shares of the Company’s common stock were reserved for
employee benefit plans.

The Company has nonqualified and incentive stock
option plans for officers and key employees. Under these plans,
options may be granted at prices not less than 100% of the fair
market value on the date of grant. Options expire 7-10 years
from the date of grant, and options granted become exercisable,
in ratable installments, over periods of 3-5 years from the
date of grant. The Compensation Committee of the Board of
Directors, at its sole discretion, may also include stock
appreciation rights in any option granted. There are no stock
appreciation rights outstanding under these plans.

The following table summarizes stock option
activity for the three years ended December 30, 2001:



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The following table summarizes information about
stock options outstanding at December 30, 2001:

During 2001, approximately 6,071,000 and
1,190,000 options were granted pursuant to the 2001 Incentive
Plan and the 1999 Incentive Plan, respectively, at exercise
prices ranging from $23.84 per share to $50.28 per share. The
remaining options granted during 2001 were done so principally
under plans associated with Packard. At December 30, 2001,
there were 3,491,000 common shares available for grant under
active equity plans.

The weighted-average fair values of options
granted during 2001, 2000 and 1999 were $14.40, $9.91 and $4.57,
respectively. The values were estimated on the date of grant
using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The following
weighted-average assumptions were used in the model:

As previously discussed, in April 1999, the
Company’s stockholders approved the 1998 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan, whereby participating employees currently have
the right to purchase common stock at a price equal to 85% of
the lower of the closing price on the first day or the last day
of the six-month offering period. The number of shares which an
employee may purchase, subject to certain aggregate limits, is
determined by the employee’s voluntary contribution, which
may not exceed 10% of base compensation. During 2001, the
Company issued 242,120 shares under this plan at a
weighted-average price of $23.40 per share. During 2000, the
Company issued 420,288 shares under this plan at a
weighted-average price of $21.84 per share. During 1999, the
Company issued 716,000 shares under this plan at a
weighted-average price of $11.07 per share. There remains
available for sale to employees an aggregate of 3.6 million
shares of the Company’s stock out of 5 million shares
authorized by the stockholders.

As permitted by SFAS No. 123,

Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation

, the Company continues to apply
APB Opinion No. 25 in accounting for its stock option and
stock purchase plans. As required, the



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

following table discloses pro forma net income
and diluted earnings per share had compensation cost for the
Company’s stock-based compensation plans been determined
based on the fair value approach:

Pro forma compensation cost may not be
representative of that to be expected in future years since the
estimated fair value of stock options is amortized to expense
over the vesting period, and additional options may be granted
in future years.

Shareholder Rights Plan:

Under a Shareholder Rights Plan,
preferred stock purchase rights were distributed on
February 8, 1995 as a dividend at the rate of one right for
each share of common stock outstanding. Each right, when
exercisable, entitles a stockholder to purchase one
one-thousandth of a share of a new series of junior
participating preferred stock at a price of $30. The rights
become exercisable only if a person or group acquires 20% or
more or announces a tender or exchange offer for 30% or more of
the Company’s common stock. This preferred stock is
nonredeemable and will have 1,000 votes per share. The rights
are nonvoting, expire in 2005 and may be redeemed prior to
becoming exercisable. The Company has reserved 70,000 shares of
preferred stock, designated as Series C Junior Participating
Preferred Stock, for issuance upon exercise of such rights. If a
person (an Acquiring Person) acquires or obtains the right to
acquire 20% or more of the Company’s outstanding common
stock (other than pursuant to certain approved offers), each
right (other than rights held by the Acquiring Person) will
entitle the holder to purchase shares of common stock of the
Company at one-half of the current market price at the date of
occurrence of the event. In addition, in the event that the
Company is involved in a merger or other business combination in
which it is not the surviving corporation or in connection with
which the Company’s common stock is changed or converted,
or it sells or transfers 50% or more of its assets or earning
power to another person, each right that has not previously been
exercised will entitle its holder to purchase shares of common
stock of such other person at one-half of the current market
price of such common stock at the date of the occurrence of the
event.

Comprehensive Income:

The components of accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) were as follows:

Note 20:

Financial Instruments

Financial instruments that potentially subject
the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally
of temporary cash investments and accounts receivable. The
Company believes it had no significant concentrations of credit
risk as of December 30, 2001.

In the ordinary course of business, the Company
enters into foreign exchange contracts for periods consistent
with its committed exposures to mitigate the effect of foreign
currency movements on transactions denominated in foreign
currencies. Transactions covered by hedge contracts include
intercompany and third-party receivables and payables. The
contracts are primarily in European and Asian currencies,
generally have maturities that do not exceed 12 months,
have no cash requirements until maturity and are recorded at
fair value on the consolidated balance sheet. Credit risk and
market risk are minimal as the foreign exchange instruments are
contracted with major banking institutions. Gains and losses on
the Company’s foreign currency contracts are recognized
immediately in earnings for hedges designated as fair value and,
for hedges designated as cash flow, the related unrealized gains
or losses are deferred as a component of other comprehensive
income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. These
deferred gains and losses are recognized in income in the period
in which the underlying anticipated transaction occurs.
Effectiveness of these cash flow hedges is measured utilizing
the cumulative dollar offset method and is reviewed quarterly.
For



NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the year ended December 30, 2001, net losses
from hedges reclassified from other comprehensive income to
revenue and expense totaled $36,000. The notional amount of the
outstanding foreign currency contracts was approximately
$280 million as of December 30, 2001 and
$190 million at December 31, 2000. At
December 30, 2001, the approximate fair value for foreign
currency derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges
was $560,000 and at December 31, 2000 was not significant.
The approximate fair value for foreign currency derivative
instruments designated as cash flow hedges was $380,000 and is
recorded in other current assets with the offset to other
comprehensive income. This gain will be recognized in earnings
over the next 12 months.

Note 21:

Leases

The Company leases certain property and equipment
under operating leases. Rental expense charged to continuing
operations for 2001, 2000 and 1999 amounted to
$19.6 million, $17.2 million and $18.1 million,
respectively. Minimum rental commitments under noncancelable
operating leases are as follows: $20.0 million in 2002,
$17.4 million in 2003, $15.4 million in 2004,
$12.1 million in 2005, $12.8 million in 2006 and
$115.0 million after 2006.

Rental expenses charged to discontinued
operations for 2001, 2000 and 1999 amounted to
$3.4 million, $1.8 million and $1.1 million,
respectively. Minimum rental commitments under noncancelable
operating leases are as follows: $4.8 million in 2002,
$4.1 million in 2003, $3.6 million in 2004,
$3.5 million in 2005, $2.4 million in 2006 and
$22.3 million after 2006.

Note 22:

Industry Segment and Geographic Area
	Information

In 1998, the Company adopted SFAS No. 131,

Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related
Information

, which changed the way the Company reports
information about its operating segments. The Company’s
businesses are reported as three reportable segments which
reflect the Company’s management and structure under three
strategic business units (“SBUs”). The accounting
policies of the reportable segments are the same as those
described in Note 1. The Company evaluates the performance
of its operating segments based on operating profit.
Intersegment sales and transfers are not significant.

The operating segments and their principal
products and services are:

Life Sciences:

Sample handling and measuring
	instruments, computer software and chemical reagents for use in
	bio-screening and population screening laboratories.
	Bio-screening activities include academic research applications
	and drug discovery applications in high throughput screening
	laboratories of major pharmaceutical companies. Population
	screening activities include inherited and infectious disease
	screening, as well as routine clinical diagnostics.

Optoelectronics:

A
	broad spectrum of optoelectronic products, including large area
	amorphous silicon detectors, high volume and high-performance
	specialty lighting sources, detectors, imaging devices, as well

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC
ACCOUNTANTS

To the Stockholders of PerkinElmer, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of PerkinElmer, Inc. (a Massachusetts
corporation) and subsidiaries as of December 30, 2001 and
December 31, 2000 and the related consolidated statements
of income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for the
years ended December 30, 2001, December 31, 2000 and
January 2, 2000. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of PerkinElmer, Inc. and
subsidiaries as of December 30, 2001 and December 31,
2000, and the results of their operations and their cash flows
for the years ended December 30, 2001, December 31,
2000 and January 2, 2000 in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States.
